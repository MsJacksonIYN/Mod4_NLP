       "  'review': 'EVERYBODY was having lobster. Before placing an order, Chinatown veterans look around the dining room to see what others are eating. At the Royal Seafood Restaurant on Mott Street one recent night, the vote was unanimous. Grandmothers were having lobster and small girls in crisp dresses were having lobster and eight police officers in stiff blue uniforms were having lobster. Nearly all the enormous round tables draped with carnation-pink cloths were occupied, and sitting on the center of each was a platter of red shells split open to expose the shiny white meat inside. Lobster wasn’t anywhere on the menu, but my table followed suit and asked for one anyway. It was hacked into sections and wok-fried with a sticky, time-honored Cantonese sauce of scallions and slivers of ginger. With chopsticks and fingertips, we dug the slippery flesh out of the legs, the tail and the claws, asking ourselves how lobster could be this soft and generously sweet. We had followed the wisdom of the crowd and won. James Surowiecki would have been proud. So would the budget hawks back at the office, because the whole lobster cost $15. This was a week after the hurricane and a few days after the lights had come back on in downtown Manhattan. Chinatown was on my mind. I worried about the mournful fish in their dark tanks, but I also worried about the money the restaurants had lost and might keep losing if tourists stayed away. Chinatown has lived through so much that it can seem indestructible, but restaurants are fragile. We eat in Chinatown restaurants because no part of Manhattan so readily offers better food for less money; because the portions are truly meant for sharing; because even those places that don’t change their fluorescent bulbs as often as they might still buy fresh snow pea shoots each day. Royal Seafood has glinting chandeliers, not fluorescent bulbs, but it suits all the other criteria beautifully. It has the added benefit of serving food that is often very close to Cantonese cuisine, the original flavor of Chinatown, with enough modern Hong Kong flourishes to let you know that it’s 2012. The kitchen is under the command of Kendy Cheng, who arrived in New York from Hong Kong several years ago and founded Royal Seafood as the chef and a co-owner. His crispy fried chicken is old-school, and one night gave me almost everything you could ask from that dish, with deeply flavorful meat pressed flat beneath a crackling sheet of skin. The bird’s head stared up from the platter. I don’t know why some of the chicken’s original savor was missing on another night. But I know I am glad I overruled the person at my table who tried to vote down the Peking-style pork chops. He got jumpy when the server called the sauce “sweet and sour.” Of course, it was the furthest thing imaginable from the phosphorescent orange jelly of dubious takeout counters. It had the color of dark rum, the resonant tang of aged vinegar and the bittersweetness of burned sugar. The sauce brought a tingle of energy to the pork’s crunchy fried coating. Smoking-hot oil is often the elixir of happiness at Royal Seafood. It cooks a whole flounder impeccably and makes the fins, tails and bones brittle and hard to resist. It turns salt-and-pepper seafood into fritters with a slightly sweet, saffron-colored batter that reminded me, pleasantly, of the Coney Island Boardwalk. The same batter makes a nifty little snack of cubed pork ribs; you chew and suck them before spitting out the bony bits. And the deep fryer’s transformation of tofu into an object of desire is so impressive I might almost have considered it fraud, if I hadn’t been busy helping myself to more. Fried crispy bean curd was lovely; even more appealing were cubes of tofu dressed with a rich minced-pork sauce, and olives that were vaguely sweet and more fruity than briny. There were unengaging exceptions to the rule of deep-fried excellence, like the T-bone steak and the “house walnut shrimp.” If fried shrimp and melon cubes glazed with warm mayonnaise sounds appealing to you, though, by all means take mine. Just leave me the candied walnuts. Royal Seafood, rarely empty, draws rush-hour crowds for its dim sum. A manager stands in the front, looking around for empty chairs beneath one of the room’s four golden dragons with colored light bulbs for eyes. The moment somebody gets up to leave, the manager barks a number into a cordless microphone hooked up to a loudspeaker, and new customers rush across the room to claim their seats. It’s like a high-speed game show in which the prizes are dumplings. The best strategy: sit on an aisle unless you speak some Cantonese. Tables are jammed together, and sitting too far from the trolleys puts you at risk of missing a favorite dumpling. I wouldn’t have wanted to skip the shumai, filled with rosy pink chopped pork or with shrimp and chives. And it would have been a shame not to try the hollow, pistachio-green spheres of sticky rice filled with salty peanuts and sweet black sesame paste. If I had sat in a back row, the chewy, lightly spicy cubes of starchy turnip cake tossed with dried shrimp, Chinese sausage and scallions may have passed me by. Few of the dim sum items were exceptional, but all were good enough and all were priced to move, and move the meal does. You can order from the menu all day, but the best time to explore it is by night, when the dining room and presumably the kitchen are less frantic. Dinner brings the opportunity to share a soul-warming casserole of curried oxtail or a platter of irregular, springy e-fu noodles with fat mushrooms. And it’s the right moment to try the house special baby lamb chops in a black-pepper sauce that has a caramel bitterness and an unexpected depth, an umami undercurrent that must come from leaves of seaweed that are frilly and green like an iguana’s beard. In the evening, with enough people around the table, you can start the meal with a hot and deeply restorative soup. Maybe the bean curd with bits of chopped shrimp, or the West Lake beef soup with bright green cilantro leaves. A server will rush the steaming white tureen to the table, his arms straining at the weight. He will ladle it out. There will be just enough to fill every bowl. You will wish all your dinners began this well. It’s Chinatown. Don’t forget it, Jake.',\n",

       "  'review': 'FOODS that give us a deep feeling of indulgence aren’t always the ones you’d expect. There are spoonfuls of caviar that taste of little more than salt, and slices of wagyu so meek that their return on investment is roughly in the territory of a savings bond. Meanwhile, at a quiet Indian restaurant in the East 60s called Moti Mahal Delux, a bowl of lentils can make you go wobbly with happiness. The dish is called dal makhani, and it is an inky stew of spiced black lentils that have been coaxed into absorbing what feels like twice their own weight in salted butter imported from India. They are deeply, truly luxurious, a word I’m rarely tempted to use in the context of lentils. It had been a while since I had considered just how indulgent vast quantities of butter can make a humble plate of lentils, but the great practitioners of North India’s Mughlai cuisine never forgot. Mughlai food can be seductively rich and, with its wealth of spices and fresh ginger, spellbindingly aromatic. Heavily influenced by the Persian cuisine that was brought to the subcontinent by the Mogul emperors, the cooking of North India still has an imperial lavishness when cooked with care and consideration for ingredients, as it is at Moti Mahal Delux. The restaurant, which opened in July, is itself an outpost of an empire, a chain centered in New Delhi that has built a formidable reputation among Indians for its tandoori chicken, butter chicken and that black-lentil dal. In fact, there seem to be two competing companies, each claiming a lineage with the original Moti Mahal founded in 1947 and each vying for rights to the name in New York City. Lawyers may have to sort it out. Meanwhile, the rest of us can get down to the more serious business of rooting around the lengthy menu, paying particular attention to anything that passes through the tandoor oven. Its dry heat roasts papadum to a greaseless crisp and chases excess water from mushroom caps stuffed with herbs and cheese, leaving them tender and meaty. The tandoor also imparts a winning smokiness to an unpromising-sounding snack of grilled pineapple, sweet potato, apple and bell pepper in a sweet-tart malt vinegar marinade that has a slowly mounting black-pepper buzz. Skewers of lamb called burrah kebab emerge from the tandoor coated with a thick and tangy marinade of yogurt, sour cream and lemon juice spiced with garam masala. These chops make you want to gnaw at the bone once the meat is gone. The most eye-opening item to come out of the oven is tandoori chicken, a preparation said to have been introduced to restaurant dining by the original Moti Mahal. Justifiably, the dish and the restaurant became famous. Juicy despite its black streaks of char, the tandoori chicken at Moti Mahal Delux has a subtle heat and spice but does not have the quarter-inch of candy-red flesh that indicates the presence of food coloring. After tasting it, I thought of the restaurants where I had been served poor facsimiles of the dish and wanted to demand refunds from all of them. “My whole point of taking this franchise was to get the recipe for their tandoori chicken,” said Gaurav Anand, the executive chef and an owner of Moti Mahal Delux, in a phone interview. “Because as a chef I’ve been thinking for so long: How do they make it? It’s unbelievable.” Mr. Anand, who was raised in New Delhi, obtained the recipe he coveted from the mother ship, along with several others on the menu that are denoted as Moti Mahal Delux signatures. They are all worth having, from the golden pakora fritters spiked with ground Kashmiri chiles to the fearsomely rich butter chicken to the crab masala in a dry and complex sauce made of tomatoes, onions and a garam masala blend supplied by the restaurant’s New Delhi overlords. (A similar masala dish is made with goat brains.) These dishes set high expectations that are not met by every item on the menu, which mixes Moti Mahal classics and Mr. Anand’s own contributions. I was a bit mystified by the golgappa shots, four fried poori cups perched on different kinds of broth in shot glasses. You are meant to pour the broths into the poori, but they dribble out the bottom and don’t add much in any case. Roomali khasta was another shot-glass appetizer, fried pastry cigars stuffed with mushrooms and standing in a sun-dried tomato dip that didn’t leave much impression. And apart from the rice pudding, I was immune to the charms of the desserts. Next time I’ll have sweets elsewhere and concentrate on the things Moti Mahal Delux does best, starting with the vegetarian dishes. The kitchen brings out okra’s most appealing qualities by slicing the pods lengthwise and dredging them in roasted cumin seeds and other spices before giving them a fast blast in very hot oil. The okra hangs on to its crunchy texture even after it’s been tossed in its gravy of tomatoes and onions. Less aggressive treatment is in store for tiny eggplants with their stems still on and for broccoli, which is steamed and then simmered in a quiet saffron sauce. Mr. Anand, who also owns Bhatti Indian Grill on the south end of Lexington Avenue, said that he had discovered many of these dishes in India as a young cook. “If somebody made good kebabs, I’d get their recipe,” he said. The main dining room of Moti Mahal Delux, most recently a different Indian restaurant, has been done over in clean, modern style, with chocolate-leather chairs and straight-backed red banquettes along a blond wood wall. The room looks so fresh and new that you wish the designers had kept going a few yards more, into the corridor leading to the restrooms and the glassed-in terrace that wraps around the corner of First Avenue and 63rd Street. For a new restaurant, it has a few spots too many that could use a fresh coat of paint. For now, the restaurant has no liquor license, which keeps the check from climbing very high. A weekday lunch special with two appetizers, three entrees, a biryani, naan and dessert comes to less than $12. These are Curry Hill prices on the Upper East Side, and a bargain in any neighborhood for food that provides a surprising flavor of luxury.',\n",

       "  'review': 'DID you hear the one about the rutabaga? No, probably not. Vegetables don’t tend to inspire great jokes. On the contrary, they conjure their very own brand of humorlessness, the tight-lipped officiousness of grim nutritionists that is captured in the phrase “Eat your vegetables.” Since opening Dirt Candy in the East Village almost four years ago, the chef Amanda Cohen has been waging war on the “eat your vegetables” mind-set, using humor as one of her weapons. Here she is on her restaurant’s Web site on the subject of cabbage: “It’s the wino of the vegetable world: smelly, unloved and looking at it makes you feel sad. A cabbage salad sounds even worse. Cabbage that’s ... raw? It sounds like a plated suicide note.” Humor is so integral to Ms. Cohen’s work that she may be the only chef in America who could publish her first cookbook in comic-book form and make the decision seem not just sensible but inevitable. Drawn by Ryan Dunlavey with facial expressions that range from mild exasperation to howling rage, Ms. Cohen’s cartoon character delivers bitingly funny monologues about appearing on “Iron Chef” and rolling out pasta dough. Along the way, she and her staff beat the daylights out of a wizard and a fairy who are idiotic enough to suggest that pickles are made by magic. But Ms. Cohen’s chief weapon in the battle against vegetable scolds is the food she serves at Dirt Candy, a vegetarian restaurant that is thrillingly free of high-minded ideals. Ms. Cohen isn’t necessarily out to save a small planet or prevent heart disease. Her goals are possibly more subversive, and she achieves them with vegetable cookery that is original, clever, visually arresting and, above all, a lot of fun to eat. Take the dish called Cauliflower! The punctuation is the restaurant’s, but I’ll go along with the emotion. Ms. Cohen gives cauliflower florets a long bath in maple smoke, dips them in cornflakes, fries them to a golden crisp and serves them on waffles. She’s making a visual pun on the chicken-leg shape of the florets and stems. But these smoky and crunchy nuggets also invite you to see vegetables as an indulgence, a pleasure that is not quite guilty but not entirely innocent, either. Eating at Dirt Candy can be like going to a child’s birthday party in a country where all the children love vegetables. Eggplant tiramisù, with layers of rosemary lady fingers sandwiching a sweet mascarpone whipped with grilled eggplant, sounds like a dare: daring you to try it, daring you to like it. While you consider your options, a server brings the final element of the dish, a white frizz of cotton candy with a startlingly pure and piney taste of rosemary. It lifts up the eggplant, the dessert and the party. One way of cooking vegetables is to go deep, to concentrate flavors until you have the world’s most carroty carrot, and leave it at that. Ms. Cohen builds layers of flavor from the outside in. During the fall, she constructs a savory tart using tomatoes in every way imaginable, to intensify the effect. There are dried tomatoes in a pink, biscuit-like crust; there are peeled and marinated cherry tomatoes on top of that crust, with a creamy layer of smoked feta; there is a ribbon of sweet and chewy tomato leather around the tart; finally, off to the side, there is a salad of fresh and dehydrated cherry tomatoes. The whole was more than the sum of its parts, but all the parts were good to begin with. The same isn’t true yet of a new dish (Onions!) built around small Chinese-derived cakes of smoked scallions and chives. One night they were overwhelmingly smoky; on another night the smoke was more reticent but the cakes themselves tasted flat. Both nights, a salad of grilled scallions, red onions and herbs could have used a livelier, more decisive dressing. But it’s very difficult to criticize a dish that includes the world’s tiniest onion rings, each just big enough to fit on the tip of a chopstick. These elaborate plates, each of which holds about a half-dozen components and can be made in vegan form upon request, emerge from a visibly cramped kitchen. This may seem like a marvel, but it pales next to the logistical feat Ms. Cohen and her staff pulled off early this month. Like hundreds of restaurants downtown, Dirt Candy lost power for four days after Hurricane Sandy. Every perishable, including stocks, jams and pickles, had to be tossed onto the sidewalk in trash bags. Almost all of it was replenished in just two days, which meant scheduling times and temperatures for the single oven down to the minute. It must have been like re-enacting the invasion of Normandy in a kiddie pool. It also involved the same kind of spatial planning that allows Dirt Candy to fit 18 seats into a spare, modernist dining room where even one more might be too much. Wineglasses are stored on a sea-green glass ledge above the tables, and customers waiting for a table are stored outside on Ninth Street. Vegetarian cooks in the United States have not always found much nourishment in American cuisine. Some looked to health food and ideology, while others have looked abroad. Ms. Cohen dabbles in overseas influences. Cabbage!, a lonesome hobo no more, is reimagined as the star of a marvelous Asian noodle salad, with kohlrabi threads standing in for noodles, fried walnuts carrying a spicy blast of Sichuan peppercorn, and purple fried won tons getting their color and flavor from juiced cabbage. A new item on the menu, Beans!, surrounds haricots verts and crisp tofu with a deeply intriguing sauce in which saffron, ginger, cilantro, coriander seed, cumin and Urfa biber pepper offer echoes of Morocco. But there is no mistaking a Dirt Candy dish for one that you would find in another country. Ms. Cohen is not adapting the vegetarian cuisine of some other culture. She is inventing her own.',\n",

       "  'review': 'WHEN M. Wells, a tin-can diner on a windswept corner of Long Island City, Queens, closed in the summer of 2011, its operators blamed its demise on a rent increase. I never believed it. The more likely explanation, it seemed to me, is that the restaurant had to die so New York could live. As a light beginning to your meal, you could start with a half-dozen fat snails stuffed into the melting marrow of a long shaft of shinbone. After that delicate snack, you could get a little more serious by ordering an entire meatloaf with stroganoff gravy, spaetzle and foie gras. This tower of meat was meant to be shared by four people, but you could round out the meal with slices of buttered brioche weighted down with even more foie gras. That was a side dish. M. Wells posed a danger to more than the heart and arteries, though. Its chef, Hugue Dufour, advocated an approach to dining that was a threat to the work ethic that has made the city prosperous since it was called New Amsterdam. The gleefully unrestrained portions and liberal doses of fat and meat were an invitation to eat too much at lunch, get drunk in the afternoon, sleep it off for a while, resume consciousness again at dinner and call in sick the next day. If enough people had fallen into the M. Wells lifestyle, the city would have ground to a halt and our economy would look like Greece’s. But New York must have an immune system that keeps it safe from destabilizing outside influences, because M. Wells lasted just more than a year before the steak knives and the foie gras vanished from the scene. Two months ago, Mr. Dufour and his wife and business partner, Sarah Obraitis, returned to haunt our 60-hour workweeks and our plans to live to retirement age with M. Wells Dinette, a new cafeteria inside MoMA PS1 in Long Island City. In homage to the building’s past as a red brick schoolhouse, the dining area is set up like a classroom. There are long shared desks with composition notebooks tucked beneath the surface and even a few of those chairs with a built-in writing surface; others have a cage for books under the seat. More forgiving than the restaurant it attempts to reprise, M. Wells Dinette is closed for dinner and seems to have scaled back its portions ever so slightly for daytime eating. But Mr. Dufour did not return to the kitchen to make cucumber sandwiches. One weekend, a goat had been drawn on the menu chalkboard, its heart and other organs instructively labeled. (Another blackboard lists the wines, many of them French and all of them very helpful in putting away Mr. Dufour’s cuisine.) The kitchen had bought a goat, butchered it, and was selling off the pieces. By the time I got to the dinette on Sunday morning, just one leg and the liver were left. I chose the liver. With a rustic French sauce of vermouth and lardons, a mess of caramelized onions and a cushion of mashed potatoes holding everything in place, it was staggeringly hearty, the kind of thing you’d want to eat before setting off on a three-day bowhunting trip in Alaska. If my hemoglobin count had still been low after that liver, and I was still hungry, I might have followed it with the blood pudding. This big slab, the color of a just-dug beet, was crunchy on the outside, with an iron-rich tang that was softened and sweetened by a buttery apple mustard. The menus, which change daily, can be read as methodical studies in the uses of animal fat. Cured pork belly binds an expertly made terrine of rabbit shot through with pink ovals of foie gras. The rich oils of smoked herring bring depth to a surprisingly light Caesar salad with broccoli. One of my companions described the thin slices of fried bread served with a classic brandade as “crisp butter.” There is also smooth, spreadable butter, on an open-face sandwich of bottarga served with a shot glass of the anise-flavored spirit arak, and flaky layered butter in the crust on a slice of Mr. Dufour’s justifiably renowned Québécois meat pie, which overflows with the flesh of four or five species of animal. A native of Quebec, Mr. Dufour learned his blithe disregard for moderation while cooking at Au Pied de Cochon in Montreal, where he was also the pastry chef and an owner. Most of the time, his celebration of the unbridled joy of eating like a lumberjack is so convincing that I’d be prepared to split cordwood all day just to earn the right to pull up a chair. I may have to do that, in fact, if I keep going back to M. Wells for the charlotte that appears in various guises. One day the pastry chef, Bethany Costello, had filled it with pears, mascarpone and a lake of salted caramel; another time she made it impersonate a black forest cake, with chocolate mousse below brandied cherries and a dark chocolate shell. In any incarnation, it is said to serve two. It could easily make six people happy, or four people ecstatic. But at M. Wells Dinette, as at its forerunner, there are times when excess does not lead to success. There was nothing appealing about a veal cheek stroganoff — not the crunchy, underdone mushrooms, not the dense and pasty torpedoes of spaetzle, not the largely flavorless meat and especially not the pools of grease that lay on top of the sauce. Grease was also a major and unwelcome player in a bowl of onion soup topped with bland melted cheese. Get a dish like this, and you can start to wish that the kitchen put as much care into the fine details as it does into the broad strokes. Then again, you might just accept the occasional greasy sauce as the price you pay for all the food at M. Wells Dinette that you’ll never find anywhere else, least of all in a museum cafe. PS1 should be congratulated for landing a restaurant that suits the neighborhood, the museum’s audience and, trickiest of all, the questing spirit of the work in its galleries. It’s easy enough to imagine a contemporary artist butchering and roasting a goat as a performance piece. It’s less easy to imagine the resulting feast tasting as good as it did at M. Wells Dinette.',\n",

       "  'review': 'GUY FIERI, have you eaten at your new restaurant in Times Square? Have you pulled up one of the 500 seats at Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar and ordered a meal? Did you eat the food? Did it live up to your expectations? Did panic grip your soul as you stared into the whirling hypno wheel of the menu, where adjectives and nouns spin in a crazy vortex? When you saw the burger described as “Guy’s Pat LaFrieda custom blend, all-natural Creekstone Farm Black Angus beef patty, LTOP (lettuce, tomato, onion + pickle), SMC (super-melty-cheese) and a slathering of Donkey Sauce on garlic-buttered brioche,” did your mind touch the void for a minute? Did you notice that the menu was an unreliable predictor of what actually came to the table? Were the “bourbon butter crunch chips” missing from your Almond Joy cocktail, too? Was your deep-fried “boulder” of ice cream the size of a standard scoop? What exactly about a small salad with four or five miniature croutons makes Guy’s Famous Big Bite Caesar (a) big (b) famous or (c) Guy’s, in any meaningful sense? Were you struck by how very far from awesome the Awesome Pretzel Chicken Tenders are? If you hadn’t come up with the recipe yourself, would you ever guess that the shiny tissue of breading that exudes grease onto the plate contains either pretzels or smoked almonds? Did you discern any buttermilk or brine in the white meat, or did you think it tasted like chewy air? Why is one of the few things on your menu that can be eaten without fear or regret — a lunch-only sandwich of chopped soy-glazed pork with coleslaw and cucumbers — called a Roasted Pork Bahn Mi, when it resembles that item about as much as you resemble Emily Dickinson? When you have a second, Mr. Fieri, would you see what happened to the black bean and roasted squash soup we ordered? Hey, did you try that blue drink, the one that glows like nuclear waste? The watermelon margarita? Any idea why it tastes like some combination of radiator fluid and formaldehyde? At your five Johnny Garlic’s restaurants in California, if servers arrive with main courses and find that the appetizers haven’t been cleared yet, do they try to find space for the new plates next to the dirty ones? Or does that just happen in Times Square, where people are used to crowding? If a customer shows up with a reservation at one of your two Tex Wasabi’s outlets, and the rest of the party has already been seated, does the host say, “Why don’t you have a look around and see if you can find them?” and point in the general direction of about 200 seats? What is going on at this new restaurant of yours, really? Has anyone ever told you that your high-wattage passion for no-collar American food makes you television’s answer to Calvin Trillin, if Mr. Trillin bleached his hair, drove a Camaro and drank Boozy Creamsicles? When you cruise around the country for your show “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,” rasping out slangy odes to the unfancy places where Americans like to get down and greasy, do you really mean it? Or is it all an act? Is that why the kind of cooking you celebrate on television is treated with so little respect at Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar? How, for example, did Rhode Island’s supremely unhealthy and awesomely good fried calamari — dressed with garlic butter and pickled hot peppers — end up in your restaurant as a plate of pale, unsalted squid rings next to a dish of sweet mayonnaise with a distant rumor of spice? How did Louisiana’s blackened, Cajun-spiced treatment turn into the ghostly nubs of unblackened, unspiced white meat in your Cajun Chicken Alfredo? How did nachos, one of the hardest dishes in the American canon to mess up, turn out so deeply unlovable? Why augment tortilla chips with fried lasagna noodles that taste like nothing except oil? Why not bury those chips under a properly hot and filling layer of melted cheese and jalapeños instead of dribbling them with thin needles of pepperoni and cold gray clots of ground turkey? By the way, would you let our server know that when we asked for chai, he brought us a cup of hot water? When you hung that sign by the entrance that says, WELCOME TO FLAVOR TOWN!, were you just messing with our heads? Does this make it sound as if everything at Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar is inedible? I didn’t say that, did I? Tell me, though, why does your kitchen sabotage even its more appealing main courses with ruinous sides and sauces? Why stifle a pretty good bison meatloaf in a sugary brown glaze with no undertow of acid or spice? Why send a serviceable herb-stuffed rotisserie chicken to the table in the company of your insipid Rice-a-Roni variant? Why undermine a big fist of slow-roasted pork shank, which might fly in many downtown restaurants if the General Tso’s-style sauce were a notch less sweet, with randomly shaped scraps of carrot that combine a tough, nearly raw crunch with the deadened, overcooked taste of school cafeteria vegetables? Is this how you roll in Flavor Town? Somewhere within the yawning, three-level interior of Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar, is there a long refrigerated tunnel that servers have to pass through to make sure that the French fries, already limp and oil-sogged, are also served cold? What accounts for the vast difference between the Donkey Sauce recipe you’ve published and the Donkey Sauce in your restaurant? Why has the hearty, rustic appeal of roasted-garlic mayonnaise been replaced by something that tastes like Miracle Whip with minced raw garlic? And when we hear the words Donkey Sauce, which part of the donkey are we supposed to think about? Is the entire restaurant a very expensive piece of conceptual art? Is the shapeless, structureless baked alaska that droops and slumps and collapses while you eat it, or don’t eat it, supposed to be a representation in sugar and eggs of the experience of going insane? Why did the toasted marshmallow taste like fish? Did you finish that blue drink? Oh, and we never got our Vegas fries; would you mind telling the kitchen that we don’t need them? Thanks.',\n",
