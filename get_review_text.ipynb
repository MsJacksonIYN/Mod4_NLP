       "  'review': 'READERS who look forward to the dark thrill of a public execution on days when there are no stars attached to this column should turn elsewhere to satisfy their blood lust. This is going to be a kind of love letter to a restaurant where the food is largely forgettable and the prices are almost always unwarranted. Years had gone by since I had last sat beneath the toy trucks and boxing gloves, the model airplanes and beer steins in the barroom at “21.” Too many years, I realized in March, when another reformed speakeasy in Midtown, Bill’s Gay Nineties, went out of business. I stopped by on its last night, annoyed with myself for how long it had been since my last drink there. Then, like a man who has just returned from a funeral, I checked in on some old acquaintances. The “21” Club is in no apparent danger, although its status as a corporate trophy is nervous-making. (Last week a luxury hotel group based in India made a takeover bid for its owner, a luxury hotel group based in London.) All the same, I put on a blazer, left the jeans and sneakers at home so I wouldn’t be turned away at the door, and went for dinner. Sadly, the future of “21” might be grim if it had to survive as a restaurant alone. To get the violence over quickly: a game platter, with venison, a boar chop, house-made bacon and rabbit sausage, was as cold as if it had been carried all the way from the hunting lodge. Caesar salad, exactly what you want to eat at “21,” was hopeless, the sliced romaine unevenly dressed and dumped on a plate with stale, dry croutons that might have come from a box. Creamed spinach was a rough paste of chopped greenery in a floury white sauce. That was the worst of it. Most of the food prepared under the chef, John Greeley, a 17-year veteran of “21,” was classic, unsuspenseful and solidly prepared, like the chilled shrimp with cocktail sauce, the grilled lamb chops, the salmon fillet and the steak tartare that wasn’t as neatly hacked up as it might have been but did hold a properly honed edge of mustard and pepper. I ate only four things at “21” that I’d go back for with any anticipation: the famous chicken hash, as creamy and agreeable as Jo Stafford’s voice; the “21” burger, blended with onions and thyme for a homey taste, like meatloaf without the bread; the coconut cake, topped with a beehive of white meringue and toasted coconut; and the olives in the martinis that are as cold as a walk along Park Avenue in January. But to judge “21” as a restaurant is to miss the point of the place. Like Galatoire’s in New Orleans, “21” is at its best when you treat the food as a solid foundation for the liquid entertainment. Take note of the first question you are asked at the table. It is not an offer of still or sparkling, as if you had gone out to dinner because you were tired of the bottled-water selection at home. No, servers at “21” lead off the way they should at all restaurants: “Can I get you something to drink?” On a good night, everybody who works at “21” behaves like a bartender, and the meal sails along on a river of alcohol and high spirits. The wine director, Phil Pratt, has a practiced theatricality and patter more often heard above the splash of gin than the gentle swirl of old Bordeaux. To feel out a customer’s budget, he might ask “How ... painful do you want it to be?” He is not above exploiting the dramatic possibilities of the silver tastevin swinging from his neck, filling it with a splash of Burgundy, lifting it to his lips, rocking back on his heels, popping his eyes and pursing his lips. Many sommeliers tell stories these days. Often they are the tales of ardent fans, and when the story gets to the part about meeting the winemaker, as such stories always seem to do, the sommelier will blush like a sixth grader who has Justin Bieber’s autograph on her backpack. None of that for Mr. Pratt. One night he brought one of Michel Chapoutier’s Rhône reds to a table and asked the diners there to feel the bottle. Mr. Chapoutier, he explained, had embossed his labels with Braille ever since he had poured his wines for a blind man. “And that man,” he said, pausing before the punch line, “was Ray Charles.” It probably didn’t happen that way, but you don’t interrupt an actor mid-monologue any more than you would forget to tip the attendant in the men’s room whom everybody calls the Rev. “Hello, young man,” he said to me one night, then embroidered on his lie. “It’s a good thing you brought your driver’s license, or you’d be drinking Coca-Cola.” By some logic I didn’t follow, this led to a warning that if I didn’t behave, they were going to ask Halle Berry to spank me, and of course she’d expect to be spanked in return. (Personal and confidential to Ms. Berry: I didn’t believe a word of this.) The Rev holds court among vintage pastel murals that depict men and women relieving themselves in complicated ways, scenes that were naughty once and will be bizarre forever. The sense of time travel in that room was intense and not always comfortable, and after a few minutes I felt the urgent need to get back to my table before a portal slammed shut and I was trapped in 1952. It’s not an experience I’d want every night, any more than I could regularly afford to pay $32 for a burger or $37 for chicken hash. But I’ll be back, because I have enough regrets already. I regret all the songs I could have belted out around the piano at Bill’s Gay Nineties. I regret the nights I didn’t tune in to hear the huge mahogany doors on Danny Stiles’s Art Deco penthouse swing shut as Mr. Stiles bid all his radio listeners “Good night, dear hearts.” I regret the rides I didn’t take on Checker cabs while they still prowled the avenues. I don’t want to add “21” to the list.',\n",

       "  'review': 'YES, Nougatine. You didn’t forget about it, did you? I hope not. So does Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who established it 15 years ago as the easygoing bistro next door to the demure elegance of Jean Georges, Audrey Tautou to the flagship’s Catherine Deneuve. Since then, New Yorkers have come to rely on Nougatine at Jean Georges, to give the name that nobody ever uses, for working lunches that could be expensed without waking up the auditors, yet they also tended to take it for granted. It has never been reviewed before in The New York Times, and it rarely comes up in conversations about favorite Vongerichten restaurants, although it is one of the most dependable. Part of the trouble is that it can be hard to say just what kind of place Nougatine is. There’s that slightly embarrassing name, which suggests a shop that sells chocolates or lingerie or maybe both. There’s the menu, roaming from burgers and fries to foie gras with a hotel-lobby inclusiveness. But the biggest reason Nougatine never quite emerged from the long shadow of its sister may have been its design, meant originally as a hotel lounge. Particularly after Jean Georges was brought up to date by the architect Thomas Juul-Hansen several years ago, Nougatine resembled an afterthought. It was as if Nougatine were meant to make the diners who passed through on their way to Jean Georges feel better about what they were about to spend, the way a glimpse past the curtains into the shantytown in the back of a plane reassures first-class passengers. Then in April, Mr. Vongerichten brought Mr. Juul-Hansen in to redo everything but the floors. Suddenly, Nougatine feels like a destination. It’s a livelier, more kinetic space than Jean Georges; there’s a long, mail-slot window into the kitchen where you can see the cooks, and often Mr. Vongerichten. A mirror right above the mail slot, and another window behind the cooks that looks out on Broadway, roughly doubles the energy at that end of the room. Gone now are the blocky woven-back chairs and the lounge tables that looked as if they’d been left behind by a percussionist on his way to a drum circle in Central Park. The furniture is more graceful now, with echoes of Charles and Ray Eames in the creamy leather chairs and walnut tabletops. There’s a bit of Rat Pack-era verve; the skinny pendant lights above the bar even look like smoldering cigarettes. (Nougatine’s newfound glamour is weakest at the low and awkward tables along the wall between the bar and the kitchen; after the hosts recognized me, they went to some lengths to avoid seating me there.) Despite Nougatine’s night-on-the-town gloss, though, the soul of the menu is not far from what you might cook at home — or, to be more realistic, what Mr. Vongerichten might cook if you came to his apartment on Perry Street. If the weather was hot, he might cut open a watermelon, whittle it down to cubes, arrange them in a circle like a pink Stonehenge, and scatter white fluffs of goat cheese all around. This almost preposterously simple appetizer soars above salad-bar level thanks to good green olive oil and a sly kick of cracked white pepper. After that, if you were effusive in your praise of Mr. Vongerichten’s collection of toasters, he might grill you a pork chop, then surround it with fruity habanero sauce made with cherries in early summer, or plums as fall nears. Comfortable as this down-home bone-in chop and this emphatically spicy condiment would feel in a home kitchen, they are almost unimaginable next door at Jean Georges. Nor would any restaurant of Jean Georges’s aspirations send out Nougatine’s massive, handsomely trimmed whole globe artichoke, as imposing as Vitali Klitschko’s fist, and ask you to pull it apart with your hands to dip leaves and bites of heart in a lemony, mustardy chervil mayonnaise. Too bad, because it’s a treat. A few dishes look so casual they seem to have been whipped up by Mr. Vongerichten and his chef de cuisine, Mark Lapico, after a morning run to the farmers’ market, like the crisp chicken breast with summer squash and very gently roasted tomatoes. Does it sound ordinary? Try making it yourself, then go to Nougatine and get back to me. On a menu as wide ranging as Nougatine’s, which must cater to guests in the Trump International Hotel upstairs, there must be a few slackers. I liked the idea of Cantonese-style salt-and-pepper lobster, and the warm cabbage slaw that came with it, more than I liked the chewy lobster meat itself. Still, that was a better use for the shellfish than the “lobster burger,” interred, bizarrely, under green chile mayonnaise and a blanket of melted Gruyère. And if a French-born chef serves fries, you expect more than the pale and not terribly crunchy ones at Nougatine. (For a refresher in how to cook a potato, look no further than the spectacularly crisped wedges that come with a good but unthrilling strip loin.) Since Johnny Iuzzini stepped down as pastry chef at Nougatine and Jean Georges last year, a successor, Joseph Murphy, has been settling in. His straightforward, American touch was most assured in an impressively fluffy sour cream cheesecake and in a group of ice cream sandwiches. But scraps of dough on a peach cobbler were pasty and floury, and I could never get a perfect spoonful out of a bowl of bland butterscotch pudding with heavily salted crème fraîche and bittersweet caramel. (Recent desserts at Jean Georges suggested that the changeover isn’t seamless there, either.) The redesign did nothing to change Nougatine’s weak spot, the wide runway to Jean Georges that cuts the dining room in half. Some intimacy and liveliness are lost, but something is gained, too: a front-row seat to the lavishly dressed parade of pilgrims. There are the gastrotourists, set to document the entire meal in photos; there are out-of-towners whose one big splurge this will be; there are women whose dresses and heels make you wonder exactly how long ago they met their dates. And then the parade is over, and the little dining room returns to normal. Like all successful restaurants in the grand old style, Jean Georges belongs to the world. But Nougatine belongs to New York.',\n",

       "  'review': 'IN restaurants, as in high school, popularity can be a burden. Just ask the host at Rosemary’s who was cheerfully trying to marshal the wildly oversubscribed waiting list the other night. (The list has been oversubscribed pretty much continuously since the restaurant opened in June.) In the kindest possible way, she tried to dissuade one member of my party from adding his name. Under strict orders from me, my emissary insisted, and finally succeeded. He was asked to come back in an hour. My group of three passed the next 60 minutes very agreeably in a bar down the street, and we returned at the appointed time. Our host apologized and said there was a group lingering over drinks at the table she’d meant for us, so we would need to wait just a little longer. And we did, standing out front, watching Villagers strut past the corner of West 10th Street and Greenwich Avenue. That was agreeable, too, for a while. But its delights were wearing thin 25 minutes later, when the host came out to say that the lingerers were still lingering. There was one table ready now, though. It was usually a two-top, she said with a wince, but since we’d been standing so long perhaps we’d like to take it? She was doing her best, but the whole situation could have been avoided, thanks to a miraculous advance in technology. Although it may sound like science fiction, a remarkable new device has the potential to change the way we communicate. It is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand yet powerful enough to enable you to place and receive calls wherever you happen to be — even inside a bar. Yes, the “cellular telephone,” or “cellphone” for short, is real, and it is available now. One day, the owners of Rosemary’s may discover that this futuristic gadget can be a handy method of notifying customers when a table is ready. At the moment, they seem to have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. There are reasons to put up with the list at the door, if not the restaurant’s technophobic method of handling it. First among them is the spirited cooking of Wade Moises, who learned to move gracefully around a scalding pot of spaghetti at Mario Batali’s finishing school. You can spot some of the headmaster’s knack for energetic flavors in Rosemary’s linguine, tossed with preserved lemon and threads of hot pickled chiles. I’ve never met a dish of pasta more deeply infused with the sunny brightness of citrus. Nearly as satisfying, but in a richer, porkier mode, was the chitarra alla carbonara with meaty strips of guanciale. But with just four pastas on the menu, there should be no room for disappointments like the gummy house-made cavatelli with starchy, crunchy peas. Mr. Moises is adept at working vegetables and seafood into antipasti that bring your appetite to attention. With a spicy dressing of grated pecorino and pickled onions, he can make a treat out of slices of raw zucchini, typically as thrilling as an ice chip. The house-cured tuna is more voluptuous than cooked tuna has any right to be, and cold shrimp tossed with mint, jalapeño and ginger shows Mr. Moises knows when to color outside the lines. At nearly every table, some wise person has ordered the porchettina, sawed-off columns of brined and roasted pork loin standing upright like the ruins of a Roman temple. The main-course-size minestra di stagione didn’t seem to tempt as many diners, but it should. On the night I tasted it, elbow macaroni shared the bowl with sugar snap peas, young turnips, asparagus as thin as a knitting needle, purple carrots and cherry tomatoes, each vegetable cooked to its ideal point, all of them in a vegetable broth that was gentle but persuasive. The menu bills it as “the ultimate minestrone,” and the hyperbole is not far from the mark. The cherry tomatoes in the soup, along with the ones in a very pretty tomato salad, were ripened in the Greenwich Village sun that beats down on a kitchen garden on the roof. The restaurant’s owner, Carlos Suarez, who also runs BoBo nearby, seems rather proud of this. The words “Rooftop Farm” are printed on the menu, right below the name, and servers always mention the provenance of those tomatoes. Most of the produce could have been procured at any farmers’ market, but the urban agrarian notion does seem to have provided a theme for the décor. The interiors firm Dekar Design flirts with rustic-Italian clichés without falling too hard for them. Parquet tables sit on parquet floors below exposed rafters; glass doors are thrown wide open in warm weather; potted plants are everywhere. The place has the feel of a trellised patio in some corner of Italy that’s heavily populated by Upper East Siders, the women wearing expensive rings, the men wearing even more expensive watches. I skulked through this slender crowd feeling like a beagle among greyhounds. Many of those greyhounds look as if they could afford to pay far more than Rosemary’s asks: each vegetable antipasto is $5; the pastas are $14 or less. Given the quality, these are impressively low prices, and they provide another possible justification for the lines. There are exceptions, though. One is the bistecca gran mela for two, a dry-aged strip steak served on the bone, for $80. It isn’t nearly as flavorful as the skirt steak, which provides a much more pronounced beefiness and, at $22, costs about half as much for a serving. Rosemary’s wine list has a gimmick that seems to promise good deals: there are 40 wines, all for $40. That price feels comfortable until you find out how many of those wines can be picked up in stores for $12 or less. (If you want a reasonable return on your $40, try the 2010 Lia Vi Barbera d’Asti from Carussin; the 2009 Marzemino from Costaripa; or the 2007 Capitel Foscarino from Anselmi.) If I felt some chagrin at paying $40 for the kinds of bottles that might be opened at an office party, most of it melted away under the influence of the summer breezes and the servers’ ready smiles. Just think how charming Rosemary’s could be if it took reservations or, failing that, if cellphones ever catch on.',\n",

Is that Martin Amis?) so I could polish them off all by myself? It clearly has something to do with the way all the luxuriously soft qualities of confited artichokes are wrapped inside those crunchy fried leaves and hearts, and just as much to do with that sauce, a creamy aioli with force-multiplying jabs of anchovy. Nor did I swoon at the arrival of La Vara’s fideuà, thin noodles cooked paella fashion in a seafood broth. Brown, broken and floppy, the noodles look like a halfhearted attempt to disguise last night’s pasta. All leftovers should fare so well. Surrounded by tiny squid, clams and shrimp, cooked until done and not an instant longer, the fideuà tastes a little like toasted durum wheat and a lot like the dripping-wet haul from a Valencian fishing net. La Vara is the newest vessel in the small and nimble Spanish armada commanded by Alex Raij and her husband and co-chef, Eder Montero. Txikito and El Quinto Pino in Manhattan, which make up the rest of their fleet, have done much to broaden the range of Spanish flavors in the city. With La Vara, Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero are exploring new territory, the vast legacy of the Jews and Muslims who shared the Iberian Peninsula with Christians for centuries. This three-way marriage, known as la convivencia, had its tensions, and the breakup was ugly, but it did wonderful things for the country’s kitchens. Its imprint on Spain’s cuisine isn’t always evident. La Vara urges, and rewards, a closer inspection. During their long rule of Spain, as Claudia Roden writes in “The Food of Spain,” the Muslims introduced ingredients that remain staples, like rice, artichokes, eggplants, bitter oranges, cumin and saffron. They brought skewers, noodles (fideuà comes from an Arabic word for pasta, al-fidawsh), the shatteringly crisp savory pastries known as bricks and chickpea-spinach stews. All are on offer at La Vara. I’m not convinced that sweet-and-savory chopped greens with pine nuts and currants are the ideal stuffing for a brick. But grilled chicken hearts made plenty of sense on a skewer, and while they could have been more tender, their pepper, caraway and coriander seed seasoning was inviting, as was the herb salad alongside, vibrant with lime. Another gift from the Moors was deep-fried fish, a term that doesn’t suggest just how delicious the long ribbons of fried, marinated, pimentón-dusted skate called raya en adobo turn out to be. But is La Vara good for the Jews? The history of Jewish cooking in Spain is fraught, to put it mildly, especially after 1492, when Ferdinand and Isabella compelled the Jews to convert or leave the kingdom. Converts were often watched for suspiciously pork-free kitchens and smoke-free chimneys on the Sabbath. Forced into hiding, Spanish-Jewish cuisine virtually disappeared. Traces remain, though, and Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero have excavated some of them. Those fried artichokes, for instance, may remind you of the carciofi alla giudea placed in the Roman repertory by Sephardic Jews. One of La Vara’s two best desserts is an almond cake called Torta de Santiago. Thought to be Jewish in origin, it survived in, of all places, Catholic convents. Understandably, La Vara skips the cake’s traditional ornament, a cross outlined in sugar. (The other standout is the Egipcio, an improved Pop-Tart with date-and-walnut paste inside an exquisitely tender semolina shortbread.) The restaurant doesn’t force-feed you any of this history, not in menu footnotes or in carefully memorized tableside lectures. What most people will notice is simply how inviting the place is behind its glass storefront, brick walls glowing under white light, and how it manages to feel intimate without feeling cramped. At any given table, the plates are scattered all over, because La Vara serves most things as small tapas-size dishes. \\xa0Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn’t. If the bar isn’t crowded and time isn’t tight, you could certainly stop for a glass of fino sherry and crunch on a dish of excellent fried chickpeas, a marvelously crisp and creamy croqueta or a single oil-cured sardine under sliced radish pickles. But the pleasures of eating tapas-style can get lost at a table for four, where you may find that just as you realize how much you’re enjoying a dish, the person next to you has managed to stab the last forkful. (See the Amis stratagem, above.) When will New York restaurants stop peddling the myth of “small plates meant for sharing”? Small plates are meant for hoarding. This might be why the most satisfying meal I had here was at a table for two. (If you have eaten out in the last decade, you can guess that while the prices at La Vara may seem low, the check won’t.) In truth, I was content to let others finish a few items at La Vara, including the strange stewed bacon sandwiches, the thin and meek ajo blanco with strands of squid, and the braised beef tongue in a watery tomato-caper sauce. But such dishes were far outnumbered by the ones I competed avidly for. If the griddled red shrimp came 12 to an order instead of 2, I could have eaten them all, and sucked the bittersweet juice from the head of each one. And I need to return for a second run at the pasta called gurullos, if only to figure out how any pasta can be as fluffy as an Italian grandmother’s prizewinning gnocchi. La Vara, by the way, was the name of a Jewish newspaper published in New York until it ceased in 1948. It was written in Ladino, a Castilian-Hebrew hybrid that was to Spain what Yiddish was to Eastern Europe. The language has all but vanished from the city, but it remains on the headstones of Sephardic graveyards in Queens and the Bronx, out in plain sight for those who know where to look.',\n",

       "  'review': 'IF you are one of those people who believes that ingredients should always be treated with respect, by all means stay away from Biang!, an excitable name for a frequently exciting new restaurant in Flushing, Queens. Before they arrive in the dining room, the biang biang noodles, a specialty of the house and its namesake, are punished in ways that might have unnerved the Spanish Inquisition. They are repeatedly swung up and down through the air, slapped on a table, ripped right down the center and then dropped in boiling water. After handling like that, the final application of searing chile oil must come as a relief. When you eat those noodles, you might suffer, too, but only for a minute. Even if you have little fear of spices, the chile oil can bead your forehead with perspiration and make you blink back tears. Then you emerge on the other side, wide awake and energized, and you understand that the abuse in the kitchen helped make those noodles that much more fun to eat. All that swinging and slapping stretches them until they are so long that when you lift one from the bowl to your mouth, it seems to go on forever, like a magician’s handkerchief. Even better, ripping the noodles gives them ragged edges that hang on to any nearby sauce. You will want to hang on to those sauces, too. The one called “spicy and tingly beef with wide hand-ripped noodles” brings the hypnotic pairing of chiles and Sichuan peppercorn to bits of deeply concentrated braised beef. “Spicy and sour diced pork meat,” meanwhile, is a sauce that revels in oppositions: the sharp edge of black vinegar versus the supple fattiness of pork, the soothing spice-cake flavor of star anise against the fury of roasted dried chiles. Then there is the biang biang dish that almost everyone gets, lamb noodles seasoned with longhorn peppers and with cumin so intensely fragrant that it seems to penetrate every taste bud you have. Like everything at Biang!, the lamb noodles are a specialty of Xian, the ancient city in central China. The recipes come from David Shi, a native of Xian, who recreated them from his memories of cooking with his grandfather before moving to the United States in 1998. Biang! is essentially a cleaner, brighter, more modern sit-down version of Mr. Shi’s food stall inside the Golden Shopping Mall, an extremely ramshackle food court on Main Street in Flushing. He named the stall Xi’an Famous Foods. This may have been wishful thinking at first, when as far as most New Yorkers were concerned, Xian was famous only as the home base of the emperor who ordered up an army of terra-cotta soldiers and horses to keep him company after his death, in 210 B.C. But famous is what the food of Xi’an became, and quickly, because Mr. Shi’s cooking was so vibrant and his recipes so novel to customers who did not grow up in China. His menu was drawn from all over Xian. Lamb soup came from the Muslim Quarter. The biang biang noodles are served in innumerable casual shops. Another noodle, called liang pi, is a street food as common in Xian as the hot dog in Manhattan, said Mr. Shi’s son, Jason Wang. Cool, smooth, chewy ribbons of steamed wheat starch, liang pi are tossed with wrinkled tablets of house-made seitan and a head-clearing dose of stoplight-red chile oil. As Xi’an Famous Foods accrued a following, Mr. Wang, then a business student in college, began to help his father. He set up a Web site and led an expansion into Manhattan, where there are now three branches. Biang! is their latest move forward, a place where people Mr. Wang’s age might be happy to hang out and eat dishes that their grandparents would remember. The menu at Xi’an Famous Foods is the template of the one at Biang!, with some additions. There is now a whole page of skewers, like grilled cumin lamb and tofu skin (surprisingly flavorful in a nutty sauce of fermented tofu and sesame paste). The standout skewer, though, holds one meaty grilled chicken wing with salty, peppery, crunchy skin and sweet, smoky flesh. The other skewers cost $3 for three; the wings are $2 each. Laudably, the prices as Biang! follow the heroically low ones at Xi’an Famous Foods, a nice surprise considering how much more attractive the space is. Mr. Wang designed it, liberally taking cues from downtown Manhattan places like the Momofuku restaurants. Light comes from hanging Edison bulbs, and you sit on polished wood benches at polished wood tables. There are tunes by Beyoncé and Kanye West, and enigmatic propaganda-style prints of pandas by the Singapore artist William Chua. The transition from stall to restaurant has not been seamless. The servers’ notions of what it means to clear a table may not coincide with your own, and the kitchen can appear to struggle with the pace. One night, spaghetti-like strands of cold buckwheat noodles with cilantro and scallions were doused with mercilessly pungent mustard oil that stampeded its way into nasal passages I didn’t know I had. On another visit, I could barely taste the mustard oil. My suggested strategy is to order an extra dish or two, just in case. Get the cold tofu in chile oil with pickled vegetables and get the crisp, zippily dressed lotus root salad. Get the improbably elegant canapés of rough-hewn pork sausage topped with fried quail eggs, and by all means get the juicy lamb dumplings in hot-and-sour broth. And even though they are served on a bun without much flavor of its own, get either the cumin lamb sandwiches or, even better, the chopped pork belly sandwiches. In my case, the order-too-much strategy ended when dessert began. A cold egg drop soup made with fermented rice was vaguely beery and very peculiar, like a home brewer’s first batch. The one sweet I truly enjoyed was steamed sticky rice with sesame seeds and jujubes, which are not the jaw-fatigue-inducing candy, but fruits that look like olives and taste a little like dates. (Watch the pits, though.) There are many ways to adapt the cuisine of immigrants to a new country. But the father-and-son team at Biang! have hit on a model worth imitating: keep the recipes and the prices the same, and buy nicer furniture.',\n",

He talks a lot. They laugh a lot. As the night moves along, both women hand him their cards. Their friendship had better be strong. It may soon face an awkward test. One of the cast members of \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\" arrives, a pretty and chattering posse around him, and claims a prime piece of real estate in the main dining room. The designer David Rockwell passes the group as he leaves. He didn\\'t contrive the cool, clean, white-on-white look of Morimoto (an architect named Tadao Ando did), but he probably feels compelled to check it out. It\\'s a stunning piece of work: a sparkly wonderland for glittery people, who always get the word and always hop onboard. They drink their bright cocktails, fiddle with their chopsticks, survey their compatriots and tap-tap into their cellphones and other devices, presumably checking on the whereabouts of less fortunate friends, perhaps informing them that the place to be is right here, right now. It\\'s Morimoto\\'s moment. Stephen Starr\\'s, too. He\\'s a Philadelphia restaurateur in the midst of an ambitious Manhattan transfer. In late January he opened this 12,000-square-foot restaurant, which is named for, and modeled after, a sibling in the City of Brotherly Love. It was followed this month by Buddakan, another Philadelphia import, another visually bedazzling behemoth, just a few hundred feet away. Both restaurants bet on a proven formula of Asian-inflected food, thoroughly tricked-out digs, theatrical presentations and pure buzz, although Morimoto has an additional ace up its sleeve. Masaharu Morimoto, a Nobu alumnus familiar to viewers of \"Iron Chef,\" put together the menu, supervises the cooking and, at least for now, can be seen caroming around the open kitchen and into the dining rooms to greet guests. He never stands still, and neither does his menu, which zooms across national and continental borders. It presents the culinary equivalent of a round-the-world ticket. It also sets up the possibility of gastronomic jet lag. A vast selection of very fine sushi and sashimi roots the restaurant in Japan, which also asserts itself in preparations of Kobe-style beef, in tofu and noodle dishes, and in the recurrence of shiso, miso, wasabi and sudachi. But other dishes and ingredients branch out to other parts of Asia, and even to Europe and Latin America. Among the best appetizers I tried was a \"tuna pizza\" with raw bluefin tuna, jalapeño, red onion, olives and an anchovy aioli atop a crisp, thin tortilla. I also liked silky slices of \"lamb carpaccio,\" dressed with Japanese green onions, grated ginger and garlic oil. But I was confounded by a vegetable tempura that was clobbered by a Gorgonzola dip. From Italy it was off to China and France, mingled in an entree called \"duck, duck, duck.\" Why, why, why? Because it was a multifaceted fowl, roasted Peking style. The crisp-skinned, moist leg was served whole, while carved breast meat went into an unpleasantly soggy sandwich made with slices of cucumber and a foie gras-infused croissant. A gooey duck egg, placed between a patch of red miso sauce and a pool of port wine-flavored duck jus, completed the excessively busy composition. The appeal of the dishes at Morimoto, like their ethnic associations, was all over the place, due in part to their frantic nature and in part to the kitchen\\'s uneven performance. Rock shrimp tempura, half of the shrimp bathed in a wasabi aioli, half in a Korean red pepper sauce, were light and sweet. Black cod with a ginger and soy reduction and a spicy half chicken with roasted red and green finger peppers had tender flesh, and a delicate touch had been applied to the poached lobster in a wonderful salad with yellow beets, cauliflower and a soy beurre blanc. But a roasted lobster was overcooked, as was just about all of the shellfish, including shrimp and crab, in a Japanese bouillabaisse with a red miso broth that turned out, by default, to be the highlight of the dish. And limp ribbons of beef in a soy and mirin broth tasted as if they had been adrift in hot water three times longer than they should have been. Even more troubling than the unevenness was the way high concept repeatedly supplanted sound judgment, resulting in dishes more amusing to behold than to ingest. The utensils provided for appetizers of toro and hamachi tartare were wood sticks not unlike tongue depressors in their feel and lingering taste. The tartare was accompanied by a beautiful but exasperating spectrum of colorful condiments and herbs (an avocado purée, crème fraîche, micro radish sprouts, wasabi and so on) arranged in contiguous bands so slender that it was nearly impossible to isolate any one from another. The \"Morimoto sashimi,\" terrine-like cubes made from layers of hamachi, smoked salmon, barbecued eel and seared toro, was luscious and hugely flavorful, but which of five colorful liquids in five gimmicky pipettes should be used to anoint it? There wasn\\'t enough fish to make it possible to try all of the sauces and then circle back to a favorite one. Although plenty expensive, Morimoto is an often undisciplined restaurant, prone to silliness and crammed with servers whose extraordinary friendliness didn\\'t mask their mistakes. One night I arrived just a few minutes after three companions. When I checked in with the host station, I wasn\\'t told they had been seated, and I went to wait in the spare, sleek lounge downstairs. I kept asking servers if they had arrived, and my companions kept asking about me. For 35 minutes Morimoto never managed to connect us. But it has its luxe pleasures, including a serious array of not only sake but also shochu. It has its courtesies, like tables with ample space between them and a noise level kept somewhat in check by translucent partitions and by wavy white sheets of canvas and fiberglass on the ceiling and along the walls. And it has its amusements, some of them related to the paces apparently required of large-scale Japanese restaurants making a run at a fickle downtown crowd. There must be a signature design element. Morimoto\\'s is a two-story internal wall, which is made from water bottles and resembles a gargantuan sheet of illuminated Bubble Wrap. There should be arresting restrooms, and Morimoto\\'s take automation beyond the function of mere flushing. Step into a stall and the lid on the toilet rises to greet you. A sense of humor, a sense of style and definite sex appeal: Morimoto has all of these, along with the crowd they bring. If only more of the food lived up to the frisson.

       "  'review': 'YOU can look at the new P. J. Clarke\\'s in downtown Manhattan as an unremarkable illustration of the laws of supply and demand, as an economics lesson writ boozy and caloric. It puts broad slabs of beef, tall mounds of carbohydrates, stiff drinks and an atavistically musky atmosphere in the paths of hungry financial types, who have been known to respond to such things. Or you can take a dimmer view and see a dark capitalist allegory, a validation of the idea that no rarity is safe from replication or protected from conversion into a kind of franchise divorced from any particular place and time. For many decades, there was only one P. J. Clarke\\'s, and it was one of a kind. It occupied (and still occupies) a squat building in the East 50\\'s, a loud and proud saloon, dating back more than a century, where Scotch would never cede territory to flavored vodka. At P. J.\\'s you often didn\\'t glance at a menu. You glanced at the blackboard, and if you couldn\\'t read what was scrawled there, it meant you\\'d had too many pints or tumblers and should probably quit -- after one or two more. P. J.\\'s trafficked in its own singular history. Nat King Cole had a charge account there. Johnny Mercer supposedly wrote the hit song \"One for My Baby\" on a napkin at the bar. Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy had a favorite table and, of course, dibs on it. The new P. J.\\'s, a roughly 220-seat leviathan called P. J. Clarke\\'s on the Hudson, certainly has history around it. The space it inhabits in Battery Park City, in a building complex that\\'s also home to Merrill Lynch and American Express workers and a Starbucks with the longest midafternoon coffee lines I\\'ve ever seen, became available after 9/11 displaced businesses in the area. But P. J. Clarke\\'s on the Hudson owes just as much to an impulse to peddle the P .J.\\'s mystique beyond its cradle. There\\'s money in these initials, and the East Side isn\\'t the only place to make it. Philip Scotti, who put together the group of investors that took over the original P. J.\\'s in 2002, and who is also an owner of its spawn, said in a telephone conversation that he has plans to keep the brood growing. He\\'s all but finalized a deal to put a P. J.\\'s near Lincoln Center. He\\'s had thoughts about Washington, and he\\'s had 10 copies of the original\\'s famously oversize, winged porcelain urinals made, at a total cost of about $80,000. Ten was the minimum order that a special ceramics manufacturer in Ohio would accept, he said. Two of these urinals were installed in the new P. J.\\'s. Four pairs remain. P. J.\\'s could be the first restaurant chain with a destiny manifestly influenced by lavatory flourishes. In terms of food, the new P. J.\\'s, like the old P. J.\\'s, positions itself as an uncomplicated crowd pleaser. It\\'s an American steakhouse (shrimp cocktail, iceberg wedge, T-bone for two, creamed spinach, cheesecake), a British pub (fish and chips, shepherd\\'s pie), a brasserie (roasted chicken, steak tartare, oysters, other raw bar selections) and a diner (meatloaf, turkey club, corned beef Reuben) all wrapped into one. It\\'s better than snobs would like to think and worse than contrarians would hasten to claim, which may be another way of saying that it\\'s usually serviceable and sometimes respectable. It does nothing spectacularly well. It does some things badly. Its baked macaroni and cheese, almost stiff enough to be hoisted from its bowl in one clump, should be called macaroni and an unconfirmed rumor of cheese, and even that might be overstating dairy\\'s role in the affair. For their part clams had seemingly minimized their involvement in a chowder named for them. Other dishes betrayed their pedigrees or purposes in other ways. A Caesar salad was insufficiently salty and excessively watery. French fries were stony, mashed potatoes pasty, lump crabmeat chalky. But apart from that crab, the raw bar selections, including chilled lobster, chilled shrimp, littleneck clams and cherrystone clams, suggested that P. J.\\'s was finding good ingredients and, in the cases of the lobster and shrimp, cooking them well. It\\'s the kind of restaurant at which you can have a satisfying meal if you manage to hit the bright spots and avoid the dark ones. Heading toward the light means getting a 16-ounce rib-eye or that 36-ounce T-bone, both slightly charred, very juicy and just fatty enough when I tried them. It means crab cakes, moist, rich and more crabby than crumbly, which too often isn\\'t the case. It means burgers, of course, which were plump and tender, though not exceptionally so. (Forget the béarnaise burger, which layered a gratuitous glob of undistinguished adornment on something that didn\\'t need it.) And it means, for dessert, either rice pudding or a \"chocolate chip cookie soufflé,\" which wasn\\'t much of a soufflé at all. It tasted like a chocolate chip cookie dough mousse, if such a thing can be said to exist. Come warmer weather, these modest treats can be savored al fresco, and the views of the harbor and the Statue of Liberty, discernible now through a long wall of windows, will be even more striking. P. J. Clarke\\'s on the Hudson has a generous amount of outdoor space that will accommodate some 275 additional seats. For now lunch and dinner are served indoors at tables with red-and-white checkered cloths. There\\'s a black-and-white tiled floor, blackboards aplenty and dark wood galore. These motifs evoke the original without capturing its spirit or tapping into its myth. Light-filled, gleaming and so vast that the walk between the front tables and the bathrooms is almost a day\\'s worth of cardio, this P. J.\\'s feels too polished, too mass-market, like an upbeat Beyoncé cover of a downbeat Billie Holiday classic. Mr. Scotti said he could envision a P. J.\\'s in Las Vegas. It\\'s no longer such a stretch. P.J. Clarke\\'s on the Hudson  SATISFACTORY  4 World Financial Center, near intersection of Vesey Street and the West Side Highway; (212) 285-1500. ATMOSPHERE -- A musky midpoint between steakhouse and pub in an incredibly long space with about 220 indoor seats, a wall of windows and a view, in the distance, of Lady Liberty.  SOUND LEVEL -- Booming when crowded and only slightly less so when not, because of overloud music.  RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Raw seafood samplers; tomato and blue cheese salad; pigs in a blanket; burger with bacon and cheese; rib-eye steak; porterhouse for two; rice pudding; chocolate chip cookie soufflé.  WINE LIST -- Relatively short, fairly conservative and almost entirely American, with many bottles for under $50.  PRICE RANGE -- Soups, salads, sandwiches and appetizers, $5.05 to $15.95; entrees, $11.90 to $38; desserts, $4.80 to $8.75.  HOURS -- 11:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. seven days a week.

       "  'review': 'THE new restaurant Barbounia is very easy on the eyes, relatively easy on the ears and not so bad on the stomach, either. But it\\'s kindest of all to another part of the body, which is less delicately evoked and most often consigned to euphemism. How to put this into appropriately fuzzy language? Let\\'s just say that no matter where inside Barbounia you sit and no matter how long you sit there, you will feel cushioned, coddled and grateful. The barstools actually have some give, descending a few inches when you put your full weight on them. Chairs in the dining room are broad, soft and upholstered. Banquettes are pillow-paloozas, as suitable for napping as for noshing. In a city where diners\\' physical comfort often gets too little consideration, Barbounia is practically a massage of a restaurant, and its magic fingers reflect a broader eagerness to please. That attitude doesn\\'t always work in the restaurant\\'s favor. Barbounia\\'s Mediterranean menu smacks of a bit too much market research and a bit too little inspiration. Although the restaurant\\'s most obvious geographic allegiances are to Greece and Turkey, the cartography is permissive enough to encompass Italy, a more reliable culinary draw. There are categories on the dinner menu for cured meats and for Italian cheeses, and the carbophobe intent on simply prepared slabs of protein will find a category (\"from the grill\") for those, too. There\\'s a crudo dish -- in this case, yellowfin tuna -- among the appetizers, and there are sunchokes and polenta among the sides. These strategic inclusions may be the right recipe for popular success, but they render Barbounia less distinctive than it could have been. You relish and remember the sitting in part because it\\'s easy to forget the eating, which is often appealing but seldom exciting, cause for little smiles rather than big sighs. That Barbounia works as well as it does is in many ways surprising, given the turmoil before its November opening. The original chef, Matthew Accarrino, departed, and at the last minute Michael Cressotti, who worked as a corporate chef at Sushi Samba, was put at the helm. At least Mr. Cressotti was literally familiar with the waters. Years ago he worked at Patria, the nuevo Latino exemplar that inhabited this space. Barbounia\\'s food is less ambitious than its predecessor\\'s, and the dishes vary widely in appeal. It\\'s the kind of restaurant best navigated with detailed instructions. For a starter, try a grilled kebab of minced beef and minced lamb. Why did it summon memories of meatballs? Because there was parsley and Parmesan in the mix. Why did it taste so big and rich? Because there was lamb fat as well. Or go for saganaki, a pool of molten kasseri cheese. Does hot liquid cheese ever disappoint? If it isn\\'t something like Velveeta, the answer is no, and Barbounia cinches that verdict by adding a bevy of dark bread and an array of bright fruit -- apples, grapes, pomegranates -- to the equation. This restaurant knows how to assemble a nice spread, be it cheese or salumi. It understands the value of a good visual. But it stumbles in other regards. Marrow bones were awash in a reduction of red wine and veal stock that competed with the marrow instead of complementing it. A mushroom moussaka needed more seasoning and less eggplant, and a Greek salad needed a twist or a tweak of some kind, especially when the price tag was $12. A risotto entree with braised duck, butternut squash, cinnamon and truffle oil was blander than those ingredients suggested it would be, though Barbounia deserves credit for not going bonkers with the truffle oil, as so many restaurants trying to take easy routes to emphatic flavor payoffs do. Pan-seared veal medallions were tough during several visits. Rabbit braciola is a better bet. As with so many rabbit dishes, the rabbit seemed incidental; joking aside, the meat could almost have been chicken, except it wouldn\\'t have sounded as lofty on the menu. It looked fancy on the plate. To the right was a cylinder of loin wrapped in Serrano ham. To the left was slow-cooked, shredded leg meat in a shell of phyllo dough: Bugs in a blanket. Both components were terrific. As for chicken, Barbounia\\'s was moist, bathed in a lemon and rosemary sauce and served with a saffron orzo. But the restaurant excelled in particular at seafood, and that was fitting: its name is a reference to red mullet, which it serves as a crispy-skinned appetizer. It serves crispy-skinned red snapper as an entree, and on most nights it also presents the possibility of grilled dourade, branzino or pompano. All of this fish was impeccably cooked. Desserts, which include a yogurt panna cotta with elderflower syrup and a caramelized banana tart with sour cream ice cream, were less impressive. But if you order Turkish coffee, you are treated to a delightful flourish. The coffee arrives in a tiny brass pot with a crazily long, curved handle. There\\'s a lot about Barbounia that draws and pleases the eye: an open kitchen more tidily and theatrically framed than many an open kitchen is; shimmering blue tiles in the bathroom area; glass shelves along the big windows behind the bar; a whimsical, feathery chandelier that looks like a gargantuan version of Bjork\\'s famous Oscar dress. Gauzy drapery here, there and everywhere conspires with archways and rounded pillars to effect an Ottoman-style opulence. All of this fabric serves an additional purpose, absorbing and muffling noise, and represents another example of this restaurant\\'s rare thoughtfulness. Barbounia conjures enough atmospheric pizazz to wind you up while paying enough attention to basic creature comforts to let you wind down. It\\'s no major culinary event, but it\\'s an unusually pampering perch. Barbounia  * [Rating: One Star]  250 Park Avenue South (20th Street); (212) 995-0242.

       "  'review': 'IF you\\'ve ever been to Pylos or heard its fans talk about it, you know that one detail literally above all others defines it. The clay\\'s the thing. It\\'s what more than 1,000 unglazed pots attached to the restaurant\\'s ceiling are made of. They hang upside down, dramatic and seemingly perilous, drawing your eye and maybe even making you feel a little chicken. This sky really does look as if it could fall. This restaurant would never let that happen. Pylos has been put together with considerable care and operates with unusual grace, a conscientious ambassador of Greek cooking and a standout in the East Village, where the dining scene has improved over the last few years. Pylos (pronounced pee-LOHS), which roughly means \"things of clay,\" opened in 2003, replacing a more casual restaurant called It\\'s Greek to Me. The seriousness of its intent is clear in its pedigree. The owner, Christos Valtzoglou, hired Diane Kochilas, a widely recognized authority on Greek cuisine, as the consulting chef. Her cookbooks are on display. Her full name is on the menu. Her first name is attached to one of nearly 20 mezethes, or appetizers. \"Diane\\'s light-as-air meatballs\" were not quite as light as air when I tried them, but they were considerably better than average meatballs -- more pliant, juicier. A mix of beef and pork, they had been pan-seared in olive oil, and not a second too long. They represented one of several surprising mezethes. There was, for example, a vegetarian moussaka, made with artichoke hearts, caramelized onions and, in place of béchamel, a mix of melted cheeses. There was also a roasted red pepper filled with a frappé of feta cheese, olive oil and a mix of peppers, some sweet and some hot. Both dishes were terrific, and both signaled Pylos\\'s determination to stand out from other Greek restaurants by moving beyond lamb, whole grilled fish and stuffed grape leaves, all of which it served, none of which were its strong points. Pylos also musters a hipper ambience than Greek restaurants usually attempt, the clay canopy playing a major role in that. I was drawn here after a friend who designs theatrical sets said he considers it the prettiest restaurant he knows. Oversize, handsomely framed mirrors make it seem bigger than it is. The contrast between exposed brick walls in the front and whitewashed walls in the back make what is essentially one long dining room feel like two entirely separate areas. There\\'s a large marble table in the back, with seats on one side, a service corridor on the other and wine bottles in the middle. It functions as the bar, and lets solo diners feel fully integrated into the restaurant, not consigned to some antechamber to watch luckier peers penetrate a sanctum off-limits to them. The thoughtfulness goes beyond the design. Diners are greeted with a bounty of warm pita triangles, with a dip that changes nightly, so repeat customers don\\'t get bored. It might be a purée of fava beans; it might be a paste of sun-dried tomatoes. It will probably be addictive. Pylos is a restaurant that comes fast and strong out of the gate. And because it falters later on, not only with desserts (often a rough patch for Greek restaurants) but also with entrees, you might consider ordering three mezethes per person and then calling it quits. It would be enough, and odds are, judging from my visits, that most of it would be terrific. Whatever your strategy, you should not miss a starter of sautéed slices of haloumi cheese with sautéed grapes. Or another of fried zucchini and fried eggplant. The vegetables had the lightness of expert tempura, and they were composed more delicately than you\\'d expect, in ultrathin circles, layered like a cake. A Greek restaurant must ace grilled octopus, and Pylos did, braising it before charring it, teasing from it a tenderness that octopus frequently resists. It came with balsamic vinegar and capers. Pylos is mad for capers. Applied liberally to an otherwise typical Greek salad, they seemed like eccentric, salty little cousins to the olives. They dusted grilled dourade and grilled branzino, perking up fish that badly and sadly needed it. Among the entrees, which also included braised short ribs and braised lamb shank, roasted Cornish hen and pan-seared duck, my favorites were two Greek stalwarts, moussaka and pastitsio. Both benefited from béchamel sauces less heavy than such sauces can be, and both were pleasantly dizzy with cumin, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. So the best strategy, upon further thought, might be two mezethes and one of these. And Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts, the best of the dessert selections. These include ouzo-spiked chocolate mousse and a walnut cake as soggy as, and little more appealing than, a wet sponge. Pylos rewards adventurous wine drinkers with a long, all-Greek wine list. (The restaurant does not serve liquor.) After a few glasses, the clay pots, more than three pounds each, become even more transfixing. Mr. Valtzoglou said he initially thought he would import pots from Greece, but learned that a nonprofit group on his block taught teenagers to make pottery. He contracted to get his reddish-brown pots from them. They produced batches of only about 50, no more often than once a week. So the canopy grew slowly. It grows still. Each pot is secured with heavy wire: no danger of a claystorm or clayslide here. Just a flourish at once rustic and contemporary, an apt metaphor for Pylos itself.

       "  'review': 'THERE\\'S a secret to the surprising mellowness of the \"legendary mutton chop\" at Keens Steakhouse, a restaurant long synonymous with that gargantuan slab of meat. (The menu announces it with a verbal trumpet blast.) There\\'s a simple reason it has none of the gaminess that diners expect of mutton, which is sheep, and instead reminds them of lamb, the younger version they know and trust. Nix the trumpet and commence a drum roll: it is lamb. The mutton lore is a mutton lie. For at least two decades and perhaps many more, the legendary mutton chop has indeed been a matter of legend. The following sentence is inevitable, as is the one on its tail. Diners have had the wool pulled over their eyes. But they haven\\'t been fleeced. The mutton chop at Keens, a 26-ounce saddle of lamb, skirted with fat and nearly two inches tall, can wear whatever label it pleases, because it provides about as much pleasure as a carnivore could want. So, for that matter, does Keens, a meaty Mecca since 1885, artery-clogging proof that not all good things must come to pass, though they may indeed have to adapt to new times by toying with certain traditions. In the case of Keens, those traditions include true-blue mutton chops, which it once served. It kept the name even after it lost the sheep. It\\'s nostalgic like that. No restaurant in New York City pays the kind of lavish, often kooky, sometimes even touching tribute to the past that Keens does. Look to the ceilings of various dining rooms, which are spread over two floors of three connected townhouses, and behold row upon row of clay pipes. There are more than 50,000 of them, the property of Keens customers who, in tobacco-friendlier times, stowed and used them in the restaurant. Keens had what it called a pipe club, with members including Babe Ruth and Theodore Roosevelt. Even after smoking in restaurants went the way of absinthe, Keens inducted honorary members into the club, famous customers as diverse as Dr. Ruth Westheimer and Dr. Renee Richards, Liza Minnelli and Stephen King. There are pipes bearing their signatures in a glass case beside the main entrance. Keens is a trove not only of protein but also of memorabilia. Its dark-paneled walls display vintage photographs, vintage political cartoons and vintage playbills. On a poignant note, in a room often used for private dining, Keen has what it identifies as the theatrical program that Abraham Lincoln was holding when he was shot. On a humorous note, in the main vestibule, it has what it identifies as \"dinosaur sirloin,\" supposedly a fossil from the Red Rocks area of Utah. It looks like reddish-brown marble, and a sign with it says that in the opinion of Keens, it has not yet been aged long enough to be cooked. Keens expertly dry-ages its beef, which it serves in an array of cuts, all of them memorable and almost all of them mammoth: sirloin, filet mignon, prime rib, porterhouse for two, porterhouse for three. On my visits the restaurant put a nice char on any and every cut that was supposed to have it, and it cooked everything to its requested temperature. It proved itself to be not only one of the city\\'s most charming and diverting theaters for testosterone cuisine but also one of its most reliable. And it presented a few surprisingly effective cameos, most notably a fried chicken salad available only at lunch. Morsels of tender breast kept company with hunks of Stilton cheese, several kinds of lettuces and a sparingly applied vinaigrette. Keens doesn\\'t consign a diner to iceberg with blue cheese, though that\\'s a very happy fate. It also serves a salad of arugula, bibb lettuce, basil and watercress, and both times I had it, the greens and herbs were springy and fresh. Other digressions from the beefy, lamby norm proved perilous. A half chicken had been left on the rotisserie at least 10 minutes too long. A gigantic wedge of salmon had an impressively silken texture but a muffled flavor. (Was it really wild, as the menu claimed?) Fried calamari were a rubbery wreck. It could be argued that a person who orders these dishes in a steakhouse gets what he or she deserves. But a steakhouse should come through with a stronger lineup of desserts than Keens did. Most of the ones I tried were instantly forgettable. The service was usually a graceful departure from the studied gruffness of some other traditional steakhouses. Keens paid attention to details. A glass of iced tea arrived with a fresh mint leaf floating on its surface. A refill wasn\\'t a refill: it was a new glass with a new leaf. Water was poured from a pewter pitcher. In deference to the holiday season, a big stuffed moose head wore a little red Santa cap. Keens is mischievous like that. Cue the mutton. Because Keens changed ownership in the late 1970\\'s, a definitive, comprehensive mutton history seems to be out of reach. But the restaurant\\'s current manager, Bonnie Jenkins, investigated the matter at my request. Keens began with real mutton, which is often defined in this country as sheep of about a year or more in age. In 1935, the restaurant reached and publicly celebrated a milestone: one million mutton chops served. Apparently, Keens was an early, upscale McDonald\\'s of mutton. World War II came. Deprived Americans ate more mutton than they wanted, and as it later fell farther and farther out of fashion, getting fresh mutton of reliable quality became iffy. At some point Keens had to turn to lamb, choosing a cut with a winged shape that mimicked the mutton chop of yore. Keens was using lamb in place of mutton when its current owner reopened it in 1981 following several years of extensive renovations. It was using lamb when subsequent newspaper and magazine articles about Keens appeared under headlines like \"Mutton Place\" and \"Of Mutton and Men.\" And it is using lamb now, although it tries to get lamb around 10 months in age, which is older than most of the lamb we eat, including the thick-cut rack at Keens. That doesn\\'t make it mutton, but it does seem to give it a more robust taste, like lamb with an exponent, lamb on steroids. Call it near-mutton. Call it extreme lamb. Go ahead and call it legendary. In more ways than one, it warrants that tag. Keens Steakhouse  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  72 West 36th Street, Midtown; (212) 947-3636.

       "  'review': 'TO appreciate how far eating has evolved from a matter of survival to a statement of values, take a trip to Cookshop and a look at its chalkboards. They don\\'t list daily specials. They celebrate the restaurant\\'s \"favorite farmers,\" an honor roll of principled stewards and good shepherds who aren\\'t exhausting their land, immobilizing their livestock, tweaking genes or toying with hormones. Along with an elite fleet of chosen fishermen, these farmers stock Cookshop\\'s larder, and they are more or less local, or at least regional; the governing religion demands it. On a given night the number of them on those boards may rise as high as 10, just like the Commandments. Cookshop, you see, is selling more than Montauk squid, Catskill duck and a cornucopia of lettuces, legumes, root vegetables and fruits that dutifully obey their seasons. Cookshop is selling virtue, and it\\'s suffused with it, even in ways that aren\\'t bluntly advertised. The tables, for example, are made of a type of American oak that Cookshop\\'s proprietors chose over less expensive alternatives because those alternatives come from endangered forests. The menus, tawny and matte, use recycled paper. So you can sip, sup and simultaneously congratulate yourself, all of which might be a bit much but for this: You can also have a merry, heedless time. With the exception of those chalkboards, Cookshop renders its call to conscience as a murmur, audible to anyone soothed by the sound and ignorable by those who just want to chow down. More important, Cookshop\\'s theology incorporates the pleasure principle. Never mind the wood. The tables are well spaced throughout an L-shaped room with a long wall of windows, a magnanimous level of lighting and a décor that perfectly splits the difference between spare and cozy. The seafood, meat and produce aren\\'t just ethical; they\\'re fresh and flavorful. And while the dishes, individually and all together, strive for a quality that might well be called wholesomeness, it\\'s a hedonistic (as opposed to an extra-crunchy) wholesomeness, built around an all-American, old-fashioned emphasis on belly-filling comfort that brings to mind Prune and Little Giant. They and Cookshop are the deviled-egg restaurants. All three have served that dish, which is listed on their menus among snacks, a category separate from appetizers. And in all three cases the dish is part of a studied homeyness that also manifests itself in house-made sausages and liver-laden treats. But the deviled eggs at Cookshop are topped with caviar (from American paddlefish, mind you), signaling something else. Cookshop is a more ambitious production than its kinfolk. It\\'s also more polished and, with about 115 seats, much larger. The producers are the husband-wife team of Marc Meyer and Vicki Freeman and their partner, Chris Paraskevaides, who also collaborate on Five Points in NoHo. Mr. Meyer is the executive chef. Five Points opened in 1999 and has done brisk business ever since. It\\'s never exciting but frequently satisfying, while Cookshop is rarely exciting but almost always satisfying -- a child that improves upon the parent. It presents a balanced user-friendly menu that offers something for everyone (a meatless wood-oven pizza, a meatless pasta, halibut in a shower of olives and raisins, beef brisket in a swamp of grits and fried onions) without collapsing into incoherence. The food is amply portioned, fairly priced and completely sophisticated but not remotely fussy. The wine list is extensive and varied but not showy. Because Cookshop has made the rounds of small producers, acquiring wines that aren\\'t easy to find in retail stores, you can spend $30 to $40 and get an interesting, hugely enjoyable bottle. Try the 2002 Mas des Chimères from Languedoc, made primarily of syrah. None of those strengths may sound like a big deal, but it\\'s surprising how few restaurants combine them, how seldom I hear what I often did when I went to Cookshop: friends remarking that they would gladly return on their own time and dime. They most often said this as we sampled Cookshop\\'s irresistible desserts, the work of the pastry chef, Heather Miller. There was a single-serving chocolate meringue pie, which had stiff competition from a maple flan with warm gingerbread and from a hot fudge sundae with pecans, bourbon-spiked butterscotch and more. There was also, for the faint of stomach, a fantastic mix of ginger-lemon ice and cranberries, which sat on the table among its less restrained peers like a Merchant-Ivory film in a festival of Tarantino. The savory highlights at Cookshop include an appetizer of house-smoked bluefish that\\'s as fine a treatment of a blue as you\\'re likely to encounter. You can\\'t go wrong with any of the salads, one of which liberates beets from goat cheese and pairs them instead with tahini. You also can\\'t go wrong with Cookshop\\'s grits, and that\\'s fortunate, because they appear not only with the brisket but also with roasted shrimp and fried duck livers, and on their own, as a side. Among the snacks, the deviled egg is not as good a bet as sautéed chanterelle, oyster and maitake mushrooms on grilled rye toast, or as slices of smoked pork tenderloin with persimmon. Mr. Meyer clearly knows his way around a pig, because the best of the entrees is probably the pork, which pairs grilled loin with a pudgy link of sausage. It reflects Mr. Meyer\\'s attempt to use as many parts of the animals he buys as possible. He cooks whole young chickens and rabbits on an experimental, odd-looking vertical rotisserie that he helped design, but he seemingly hasn\\'t mastered this equipment or dealt adequately with its collateral effects. Both times I had the chicken, its skin wasn\\'t crisp, and the one time I sat near the open kitchen the heat from that rotisserie made me feel as if I should be wearing SPF 45. I\\'m betting Mr. Meyer and his partners will solve those problems, because their eagerness to please seems as keen as their exaltation of all things seasonal, free-range and line-caught. Of course these impulses are not contradictory, and Cookshop is proof: a place where eating well and doing good find common ground.

       "  'review': 'YOU don\\'t hear people talk much about Compass, which famously defied its name by so often losing its way. But you would if more of them tried its crispy skate appetizer, an expertly cooked indication that Compass is finally on course. When several friends and I recently had it, the moistness of the fish and the crunchiness of its panko crust played a textural tug of war. Neither side lost, so we won. Entrees arrived, and we were victors again. Our lobster, poached in olive oil before being pampered with butter and clementine juice, made a dreamy case for never treating lobster any other way. An hour or so later we were next door at Cafe Luxembourg, where we spotted skate as a main course and ordered it. It had been put through uneventful paces -- a sizzling encounter with olive oil, a subsequent shower of capers -- and had emerged somewhat gummy. It typified too much of the restaurant\\'s food, at once serviceable and disappointing. And yet Cafe Luxembourg, unlike Compass, was characteristically packed. The way people push to get in and wait three deep at the bar, you\\'d think the restaurant\\'s signature yellow tile walls were coated in some sort of culinary pheromone. Cafe Luxembourg is the soccer captain to Compass\\'s science club president. It has more sex appeal and an easier time getting dates. The disparate degrees of ardor that diners feel for these restaurants also illustrates something else: the way success perpetuates itself, a self-sustaining reality sometimes divorced from the merits, while a history of failure obscures current accomplishments. In the restaurant business, as in so much else, reputations linger and a herd mentality rules. Diners crowd Cafe Luxembourg, which is now 22 years old, in part because they see that it\\'s always crowded. Diners don\\'t rush to Compass, which is not yet 4, because they don\\'t notice any stampede in that direction. And why would they? Compass is already on its fifth head chef, the rapid turnover revealing frequent turmoil. But recent visits to both restaurants, which sit side by side on the Upper West Side, pointed out a need for reappraisals. It is the kitchen at Cafe Luxembourg, which received two stars from Bryan Miller in The New York Times in 1992, that has been struggling lately. After many months without an executive chef, the restaurant hired Victor Everitt about six weeks ago. The transition may partly explain the ordinariness of the food. But it doesn\\'t explain the service, almost always sluggish and often distracted. During one visit, we waited 35 minutes past our reservation time without anyone\\'s offering us an apology. On another visit, one friend, arriving mere minutes after the rest of us had been seated, was told there was no record of our party. We were 20 feet away. Perhaps because it has been desired for so long, Cafe Luxembourg doesn\\'t fret enough over its desirability. At brunch an omelet was overdone. At dinner loin of lamb and a strip steak, both ordered medium rare, were overcooked. So were the noodles in a dish of pappardelle with braised rabbit and almost no flavor. We tried to resuscitate it with salt, the same emergency treatment we administered to an anorexic, wheezing potato and fennel soup. But both were dead on arrival. The menu combines populist French stalwarts (onion soup, steak tartare, coq au vin) with American favorites (burger, fried calamari). By Manhattan standards the food isn\\'t extravagantly priced. And a diner can assemble an enjoyable meal, especially by starting with one of Mr. Everitt\\'s new appetizers -- a salad of peekytoe crab, avocado and grapefruit -- and proceeding to one of his new entrees, maple-glazed pork tenderloin. There isn\\'t a single letdown among a strong contingent of straightforward desserts (baked Alaska, rum-raisin bread pudding) by Alana Ford, the pastry chef. Apart from these bright spots, however, Cafe Luxembourg\\'s strongest claim on diners\\' affection may be its hip, brasserie lite mien. Compass, in contrast, can\\'t coast on comely pouts and poses. Its somewhat blankly contemporary dining room is the visual equivalent of the music that filled it one night: Dido, Sade, George Michael. Meet architectural easy listening. But if Cafe Luxembourg assumes your interest, Compass eagerly pins a corsage on you. A woman at the coat check called out to make sure a friend and I knew we could ditch whatever we wanted. (I think she would even have taken our dirty laundry.) The bread basket overflowed with slices of seven-grain, Manchego cheese rolls, corn bread -- all of it great. The current chef, John Fraser, on board now for six months, has put together an ambitious Continental-goes-global menu and buckled down to impressive cooking. It yielded succulent results in an appetizer of bay scallops, served with a potato purée and chanterelles, and an entree of wild salmon, served with Savoy cabbage, lentils and black trumpet mushrooms. Mr. Fraser combines formidable energy with fastidiousness, bringing fresh ideas to staples of high-end dining. Lamb? Tender medallions of loin were paired with a small, rich potpie of leg and belly. Duck? Out came more pastry: a tiny pastilla of braised leg to go along with seared breast meat. The skate, cooked on a plancha, was served with a swish of peanut purée and a Thai-theme salad of green papaya, pineapple and crab. A terrific appetizer of roasted beets included what a server called \"beet caviar,\" which was couscous stained with beet juice. That term, like the menu listing of entrees as \"compositions,\" reflects a tendency to embellish that can work against Compass, which received one star in The Times from Amanda Hesser last year. A veal chop was not so much coddled as clobbered by a cloak of peppers, chorizo and capers. And while the $32 price tag on Compass\\'s vigorously promoted three-course prix fixe sounds like a deal, the limited choices, including salmon tartare and beef short ribs, did not rank anywhere near the restaurant\\'s best dishes and reflected its unevenness. But those best dishes were truly distinctive, and so were the desserts, under the direction of Vera Tong. Ms. Tong\\'s work is as spirited as Mr. Fraser\\'s. Rolling with the seasons, she fashioned pumpkin panna cotta and gingerbread pudding. Recognizing the magic of salty with sweet, she affixed potato chips to the sides of a milk chocolate and hazlenut gâteau, where they fanned out like a hummingbird\\'s wings. If she, Mr. Fraser and the rest of the staff at Compass keep it up, they might soon be able to count on legions of fans. Perhaps their biggest hurdle is simply the lack of them.

       "  'review': 'AT Aburiya Kinnosuke, a new restaurant in Midtown, you probably won\\'t spot any celebrities, the way you might at a more lavish, trendy Japanese pleasure palace like Megu or Nobu. You definitely won\\'t find elaborately constructed, kaleidoscopic sushi rolls, the kind that look more like kites than supper, or whimsically shaped stemware filled with neon-colored potions, the kind that look more like chemistry experiments than drinks. Here\\'s what you will see, or at least what I did, every time I went: tables filled with Japanese businessmen, neckties still on, briefcases nearby, speaking Japanese to servers who fared much better in that language than in English. In front of them they had banquets of food that was largely unfamiliar, and on their faces they had very broad smiles. This restaurant was clearly delighting them, sating them and offering them something much closer to, and more consistent with, what they would get in Tokyo than what they would get in TriBeCa. That caught my attention, and my own delight kept me coming back for more. Plunging into the restaurant\\'s lengthy menu, which was supplemented each night by dozens of specials, I had a sense of seemingly boundless possibility, of new flavors that it would take quite some time to exhaust. I had a sense of discovery. And I had tuna collar, again and again, because like so much else at Aburiya Kinnosuke, it\\'s not something that many other New York restaurants serve. It looked like a veal chop, big bones and all. The meat was tawny and rich, not in the manner of toro but in a muskier, messier vein. Some bits were darker than others, and some hid in crevices between skin and bone. Using chopsticks to grab hold of them was like excavating layers of earth, each slightly different. It\\'s an activity I recommend, as I do Aburiya, with a few caveats. The menu is so expansive and arcane that a diner can encounter bad luck as easily as good and wind up with food that disappoints, if only because it\\'s so peculiar. One night I blithely ventured in the direction of dried baby squid, only to make a hasty retreat after one repellently fishy, intensely funky bite. Due in part to the language barrier, service can be awkward. The people who waited on my friends and me had trouble explaining what various dishes were and, in some cases, why it was taking so long for these dishes to arrive. A few of these servers, seemingly reluctant to intrude on us, succeeded in ignoring us. But for a diner in the right frame of mind, the oddities of Aburiya just seem like part of the adventure. Aburiya was opened several months ago by the restaurateurs who operate Yakitori Totto, a more casual Japanese restaurant in Midtown. Aburiya is more expensive; although the price of each modestly proportioned dish is often low, it can take four or five of those dishes, at an aggregate cost of $35 to $45, to fill a diner up. In return, the restaurant adds a layer of gloss and a measure of serenity to the kind of no-nonsense, no-compromises ethnic fidelity more easily found in no-frills haunts. It\\'s a pleasant escape that always made me feel as if I were traveling far away from the rest of the city. It provides several seating options. There are semiprivate nooks fronted by sliding latticed wood doors, a common area with tightly packed tables along a banquette and, in the back, a counter around a robata grill. The restaurant\\'s menu is divided into many parts, including house-made tofu, salads, sashimi, and rice and noodle dishes. But grilling occupies center stage. It can even occupy the center of the table. Under the heading \"Shichirin Grill,\" which refers to a small portable vessel, the restaurant serves meat and fish that diners can grill over bincho-tan charcoal, which produces little smoke. During my visits hanger steak and red snapper were among the options. In both cases, servers placed a big leaf over the grill, and we were instructed to slather that leaf with sweet red miso paste, then put the flesh and a heap of scallions over that. When the paste bubbled, we were told, the food would be done. But the bubbling was a poor barometer for both the beef, which needed more cooking, and the fish, which needed less. In addition, the miso and scallions registered too strongly. The fruits of the robata grill, which also uses bincho-tan charcoal, were more reliable. The tuna collar, listed on the menu as neck, came from that, and so did salmon neck, another fatty, slightly gamy, challenging and rewarding cut. The robata produced crisp-skinned chicken wings, succulent strips of pork cheek and tender ribbons of sea eel. It was the cradle of what the menu called a chicken meatball, really a chicken meatloaf, eggy, gooey and comforting. I hadn\\'t tried black sesame tofu before Aburiya, but I hope to have it again, especially now that I know what I didn\\'t when I took my first few bites: that the tiny mound of salt beside it had a real purpose. Applied sparingly, it played a pivotal role in blunting the edges of the sesame. Gomoku kinpira, a sautéed mixture of thinly sliced mushroom, carrot, burdock root, lotus root and more, was like a slaw that had begun evolving into a lo mein, taking on greater weight, more flavor and oiliness. Cold, circular wedges of Japanese sticky yam, with the taste and texture of a slick potato, had been pickled and seasoned with wasabi. They were slimy on the outside, softer within, and had a fiery finish on the tongue. I couldn\\'t stop eating them, and by that time -- my last visit to Aburiya -- I was no longer staring at the tables of Japanese diners or soliciting advice from Japan-savvy friends to determine what to eat. I was just guessing, improvising. In a way, that\\'s the most authentic experience of all. Aburiya Kinnosuke  * [Rating: One Star]  213 East 45th Street; (212) 867-5454.

       "  'review': \"ABBOCCATO is the 21st-century version of an Italian-American restaurant. There are no red tablecloths, no candles stuck in raffia-covered wine bottles, no lasagna or garlic bread. Instead there is an Italian restaurant with one foot firmly planted in Italy, the other in the New World: buffalo milk ricotta, meet sourdough bread; Umbrian truffles, meet fresh corn. And because no self-respecting upscale restaurant is entitled to high prices without it, foie gras. After an extensive tour of Italy, the Livanos family decided to add another restaurant to the two it owns in Midtown, Molyvos and Oceana. The Livanoses hired a chef who had worked at Felidia and Esca, and tried to make a grotto-like space in the Blakely Hotel into something bright and light. But there are too many things going on in the decorative effort. Jim Botsacos, the chef and a partner at Molyvos and Abboccato, and Jake Addeo, Abboccato's chef de cuisine, are cooking some interesting but seldom seen regional dishes and creating a few delightful combinations that would never see the light of day in Italy. It's a bit of a jumble, but often a pleasing one, like the heavenly buffalo milk ricotta soup with tomatoes, corn and crisp pancetta. I could eat it every week. Or the perfectly roasted black bass that is served with seared escarole stuffed with a zesty caponata, all of it moistened with a vinaigrette made with pork jowls. Foie gras has found its way into ravioli stuffed with wild radicchio and ricotta and served with a sage, walnut and balsamic butter sauce. The only complaint was that the ravioli were a little too al dente. Another felicitous marriage is foie gras -- the buttery interior bursting through the nicely crisp exterior -- served with a potato dumpling stuffed with tomato marmalade. Anyone who likes quail but despairs of the bones should go directly to Abboccato's boneless, beautifully roasted preparation, about the size of a Spaldeen. It is stuffed with mortadella and pistachios and served with lentils, the traditional balsamic onions and an unexpected slash of mostarda, the fruit and mustard preserves often found on a cheese plate. Carpaccio of tomatoes? Words take on meanings here they never had before. As you might suspect, the tomatoes are thinly sliced and make a base for sweet peekytoe crab meat, lightly flavored with scallions and punctuated with lovage. Of course, this dish depends entirely on the flavor of the raw ingredients, so it won't be around much longer this year. Tomatoes also depend on proper salting. And here is where the kitchen falls down on the not-so-simple task: the use of sea salt. It is a fault emblematic of the restaurant's drawbacks, and it prevents Abboccato, which means medium sweet, from being as good as it can be. There is not always a steady hand at the stove. On each visit some dishes tasted as if the chef had stock in a sea salt company. You can't sprinkle coarse salt the way you sprinkle Morton's. Not everyone wants a burst of salt in a bite. But in other dishes it was completely missing. The otherwise excellent spaghetti alla amatriciana, made with house-cured pig jowls -- which sound better in Italian, guanciale -- was oversalted. At the other extreme, the tagliatelle Bolognese was a tepid rendition of the old tradition, chiefly because it tasted salt-free. A side dish of peperonata lacked not only salt but also any evidence of the ingredients that give it its usual piquancy: onion, garlic and vinegar. The pan-seared potatoes with pancetta and onion tasted reheated and -- you guessed it -- devoid of salt. On the other hand, the rack of lamb for two, baked in a salt and mint crust, was not at all salty -- or minty for that matter. The meat, though perfectly cooked medium rare, was tough. For some reason most of the cheeses on the well-selected tray did not come with bread, though they were served with some delicious preparation of fruit, either macerated or marinated, fresh or dried. That's how Italians like to eat cheese. But Americans want bread, and when they ask for it in this country, in this city and in this restaurant, the waiter should not shoot them a look of disdain and say the restaurant does not have bread. It was this same waiter who on two occasions stood uncomfortably close to the table, staring at my guests and almost close enough to hear the conversation. Each time someone spilled a drop on the table cloth, he rushed over with a napkin and ceremoniously placed it over the offending spot -- four times at one meal. Did he know I was reviewing the restaurant? I doubt it -- it was service not with a smile but with a sneer. I think the maître d'hôtel needs to keep him busier. Otherwise, the service was pleasant and appropriate. The hardest course for an Italian restaurant in America to conjure up is dessert because Italians finish their meals with the cheese. But Abboccato's pastry chef, David Carmichael, has come up with some pleasing desserts connected to Italy. Tiny, warm cinnamon-dusted doughnuts with vanilla mascarpone were hard to resist. And the buffalo milk ricotta cheese tart with seasonal fruit poached in wine was a delightful mix of creamy, sweet and acidic. Thinly sliced, toasted panettone with an orange-marmalade-studded semifreddo, lovingly bathed in warm chocolate sauce, was a delicious deconstructed take on an ice cream sandwich. The gelati might have pink peppercorns, mostarda or just plain caramel. But Bonet was an overly dense, unpleasantly bitter chocolate mousse with a white chocolate topping. Though the menu says it is served with three citrus powders, the night we tried it the citrus had taken a powder. But when the espresso arrived with perfect little hazelnut meringues, we forgot about the Bonet. Simple is good. Reviews by Frank Bruni, who is on vacation, will resume next week.

       "  'review': 'IF you want to make the acquaintance of your dinner just before you ingest it, Oriental Garden is your place. In stacks of tanks flanking the entrance of this Chinatown mainstay, crabs crawl, sea bass swim and clams loll about, for want of an even less kinetic verb. But the presentation winds up seeming less theatrical than practical, less like an aquarium of incipient deliciousness than an unadorned aquatic larder, even a floating gallows. The tanks are drearily overcrowded and the room beyond them distressingly over-bright. Uptown, at the new restaurant Mainland, what draws your eye almost immediately after you walk through the door are picturesque bundles of firewood and, above them, a glass-fronted oven in which whole ducks are cooked. This display is all about appetite-whetting beauty. The birds glisten like amber jewels, and the setting for their consumption includes soft lighting, spacious semicircular booths and the kind of lounge music that seems designed to induce a trance. You can wash your duck down with specially named cocktails like the Yangtze Sigh. You can follow it up with a white chocolate macadamia pot du crème. In New York over recent years, Chinese has been trading up, ditching its often matter-of-fact trappings and trying to grab some of the glamour hogged by other cuisines. Mainland follows in the stylish footsteps of 66, Xing and Yumcha, all of which seek to readjust expectations about restaurants that label themselves Chinese. But when the lights are dimmed, the prices are raised and the beef in a main course of beef and broccoli is aged sirloin, with the broccoli to the side, does the pleasure increase? Are a shinier gloss and sometimes better cuts of meat harbingers of a better experience? It depends in large part on your mood. But it depends just as much on how well the dishes are prepared, how wisely that gloss is applied and whether the whole experience comes together in a way that feels special and satisfying. It hinges on judgment, not authenticity. On execution, not airs. Mainland aims high, starting with its Peking duck, which uses the birds from that oven. The chef, Brian Young, whose ancestry is Chinese, follows a fastidious process for making sure the external layers of skin and fat are as respectively crisp and luscious as possible. It takes more than a day and includes ladling a boiling liquid onto the birds and having fans blow air over them before they enter the oven, where they hang on hooks over a combination of cherry, apple and peach wood. The ducks are then wheeled out on a cart, carved tableside and served with steamed pancakes and plum sauce. On one visit the pancakes were soggy, but the duck impressive. Another time every facet of the dish was spot-on. Mainland takes multiple tacks in gussying up Chinese. It serves classic dishes, like that Peking duck or Cantonese-style lobster over crispy noodles, which are simply being given a more elaborately decorated theater than they usually receive. It does upscale riffs on downscale delivery staples, like that beef and broccoli, which came with an incongruous but excellent stack of Vidalia onion rings. It takes staples of New York restaurants of various ethnicities -- raw fish appetizers, short ribs, rack of lamb -- and brings Chinese or at least Asian vegetables, sauces and spices into play. The restaurant\\'s pot stickers, dumplings and spring rolls were almost always respectable and sometimes better, one of the standouts being the lamb spring rolls, which had an internal richness that the external crunchiness brought into relief. At Mainland, however, not all proteins are created equal. Duck got its due, both when roasted whole and when stir-fried with Chinese sausage, pine nuts, shiitake mushrooms and dried sour cherries. This amalgam was served with, and meant to be wrapped in, leaves of bibb lettuce. But prawns and shrimps of all sizes and in all kinds of dishes, including the fried rice, emerged undercooked, overcooked or just plain flavorless, as if there were a shrimp pox on the house. A corn soup with asparagus and crab was sludgy beyond belief one visit and cloying the next, the only link between the experiences being the faintness of the crab\\'s presence. Beyond the inconsistencies there were, in Mainland\\'s putative attempt to do something new, too many bows to the familiar: those raw fish appetizers, one with jalapeño and another with sesame; miso-glazed black cod; foie gras; even the music. Entering the series of hyperdecorated dining rooms means walking down several sets of stairs, passing that lovely oven and moving ever farther from any natural light. The effect can become crypt-like. And something about the service was always off-kilter. An intrusive waiter wouldn\\'t stop jabbering. Another server knocked a bottle of water to the floor, where its contents lapped over one of my shoes. He neither offered a replacement nor took the charge off the bill. An almost inaudible apology was all he mustered. The service at Oriental Garden can certainly be brusque, and more than a few of the restaurant\\'s selections flop -- or, in the case of drunken prawns, flail. You have to assure your server that you want this dish, which entailed the following: The server plucked prawns from a tank, put them in a glass bowl on the table and poured rice wine over them, at which point they convulsed so violently that the wine sprayed a friend and me in the face, even though the bowl had been covered. \"It\\'s an appetizer and a shower,\" the friend said. When the prawns stopped moving, the alcohol was set ablaze. The end result: prawns that tasted, sure enough, like prawns drowned in alcohol. It didn\\'t seem worth it, for us or them. But the blunt spectacle to some extent defined Oriental Garden, which isn\\'t about pretty pageantry, enchanting music (I didn\\'t detect any) or trends, as the matter-of-fact exhibition of those tanks also makes clear. Oriental Garden is about extremely fresh food -- fish in particular -- and a kind of no-nonsense preparation that defers to, and underscores, that freshness. Cantonese in inclination, Oriental Garden opened two decades ago and has repeatedly been renovated, but the golden dragons on its walls and mauve cloths on its tables don\\'t make much of a statement. Many of its dishes, however, do, and they support the estimation of some Chinese-Americans and food lovers that this is the best of Chinatown\\'s seafood restaurants. Don\\'t look too long at the menu, which is too long to look at. Engage the servers and eyeball the tanks, and if there\\'s geoduck clam, get that. The restaurant will slice its long neck in the manner of sashimi and then -- a phenomenal treat -- fry its belly. Order salt-and-pepper prawns, slightly sweet and not remotely greasy. If the restaurant\\'s selection of whole fish includes sea bass, and the sea bass seems to be swimming with ample vigor, ask for that as well. The kitchen will do little more than steam it briefly with soy sauce, scallions and ginger, an approach that yielded wonderful, custard-like flesh. The kitchen will put black bean sauce on a bevy of fresh razor clams. That was all they wanted or needed. There were additional, unexpected treats at Oriental Garden, including the spicy \"Ma Pau\" tofu with minced pork. Pan-fried noodles with assorted seafood didn\\'t just have the fabled breath of the wok. They had the deep-lunged, full-throated sigh of the wok. Although the restaurant is not as well known for dim sum as for dinner, I went one Sunday morning, randomly accepted items from the passing trays and ate marvelously. There were also disappointments, like crispy chicken with dry meat and rubbery, tasteless steamed scallops in XO sauce. OrientalGarden serves scads of diners at an often brisk clip, and the cooking sometimes reflects that. But it\\'s divorced from trends, devoted to simplicity and in those ways actually more memorable -- and even more distinctive -- than the cooking at many glitzy Asian newcomers, be they Japanese, Thai or Chinese. In promising to coddle and sometimes even dazzle you, those newcomers set a bar for themselves that they sometimes can\\'t reach. In promising to sate you, Oriental Garden hits its mark.

       "  'review': \"SOMETIMES the best way to move forward is to revisit the past. Sometimes the loudest statements are the quietest ones, made without undue fuss, in precise gestures. At his new restaurant, Perry St., Jean-Georges Vongerichten circles back, shuts up and cooks, electing earnestness over irony, controlled flourishes over cluttered frippery. In doing so he gives fresh currency to his stature as one of the most talented chefs at work in this country. He also gives his doubters, who had grown legion, reason to believe. For all his accolades and wealth, Mr. Vongerichten at this moment has something to prove, and Perry St. is more than just another potentially lucrative application of the Jean-Georges brand. It's a studied retreat from, and maybe even an act of amends for, the high-concept flamboyance of 66, Spice Market and V Steakhouse, the New York restaurants he opened between 2002 and 2004. All three have their significant merits and pleasures -- or at least the first two of them do -- but they rely as heavily on the novelty of their overarching conceits (Chinese goes sexy, the steakhouse does sarcasm) as they do on what happens in the kitchen. It was Jean-Georges the high-wire entrepreneur more than Jean-Georges the culinary genius who sired them. They have vacuous showmanship in their DNA. Perry St. doesn't. This one is from the heart, not the head. And while it is undeniably flawed and surprisingly inconsistent, it's cause for celebration, chiefly because it marks Mr. Vongerichten's return to the straightforwardness of Jo Jo, which he opened in 1991, and of his flagship, Jean Georges, which came along in 1997. Not since then has he produced a New York restaurant as tidily reflective of his culinary strengths and sensibility as Perry St. The expertly orchestrated interplay of flavors and yin-yang balance of effects in many of the dishes here are classic Jean-Georges, as are the clarity and lightness of his sauces and broths, which cast the stocks of previous eras as lumbering dinosaurs. For much of the summer the restaurant served as an amuse-bouche a version of gazpacho made with raspberry, cucumber, red and orange bell pepper, ginger, red wine vinegar and olive oil, discrete beads of which floated like a shiny archipelago on a ruby sea. The sweetness of the fruit set the stage for, then ceded it to, the sourness and gentle heat of other players, which arrived as a second wave, a delayed epiphany. The transition and contrast were transfixing. Mr. Vongerichten has mastered what might be called time-release gastronomy. An appetizer salad of frisée, goat cheese and pickled peach nailed a sweet heat that traveled a path similar to the gazpacho's: a cool front followed by a spike in the temperature, this time courtesy of crystallized wasabi. But sometimes a single sensation slowly intensified. An appetizer of bluefin tuna in a fried crust of Japanese rice crackers came with a salmon-colored, scallion-studded mayonnaise flavored with dashi, sriracha and various citrus juices. The controlled fire sparked by the scallions and sriracha blazed stronger in the middle of each bite than at the beginning and stronger still at the end. But it never singed. Roasted chicken rested in a broth made from chicken wings smoked with hickory, mesquite and cherry wood. The smokiness of that potion expanded with -- and even within -- each bite, and was cleverly offset by sweet kernels of fresh corn. The restaurant's ambience is as pruned of needless embellishment as the food. Perry St. has been decorated in a sleek contemporary vein and a subdued palette of white, beiges and grays, neither of which competes with the charmed setting. Located on the ground floor of one of the new West Village high-rises designed by Richard Meier, the restaurant has views of the Hudson River, the joggers and cyclists on its edge and, at dusk, the setting sun. Imagine some palm trees in the foreground and this could be coastal California. It feels that fixed on a watery horizon, that luminous and laid back. It also feels easy and easygoing, and in that sense represents another considered attempt, in these less formal times, to preserve the core pleasures of fine dining while jettisoning much of the ceremony and some of the expense. So there is ample elbow room and attentive service but only one type of bread and butter at the beginning, only a token cluster of petit fours at the end, and -- an informality too far -- brown paper place mats on the tables. It takes little time to peruse the concise wine list and almost none to absorb the menu: eight appetizers, eight entrees and five desserts. Given the winnowed options, there are too many disappointing dishes. An heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad was beautiful to behold but merely pleasant to eat. Steamed black bass was dressed in a basil vinaigrette so tart it suggested some kind of accident behind the scenes. So I tried this entree again on a subsequent night: still too tart, though appreciably less so. Other dishes also varied from visit to visit, the ginger vinaigrette on poached lobster proving sweeter one time than another, the dill broth around a gorgeous crop of summer vegetables proving sharper. Although Mr. Vongerichten's condominium apartment is just upstairs on the seventh floor and he has been spending much of his time in the kitchen here, it could use more discipline. But when Perry St. scores, it scores much, much bigger than most restaurants, and it scores on Mr. Vongerichten's instinct for flavor and texture combinations, his usually keen sense of equilibrium and of course his recruitment of traditions and ingredients from Asia, which seduced him before others. He tempts yawns by including grilled beef tenderloin among the entrees, but then sends it to the table with an onion jam and a sour cherry mustard that was like a less zingy horseradish sauce, a less cloying steak sauce. It was just right. In dish after dish, he let crunchiness frame succulence or thrust creaminess into relief. It happened with that tuna appetizer and with an appetizer of red snapper sashimi, the soft petals of fish hooded with strands of deep-fried snapper skin, fleur de sel, Thai chili pepper and lemon, which served as a counterpoint to a pool of olive oil below the fish. It happened as well with my favorite of the desserts, a bowl of chocolate pudding distinguished by a cover of crystallized violet and a pedestal of chocolate sponge cake. Johnny Iuzzini, the pastry chef at Jean Georges, shares credit with Mr. Vongerichten for the last act of a meal at Perry St., a finish that was usually happy and never histrionic, much like everything that preceded and surrounded it. Mr. Vongerichten has chosen a new tower of spare elegance in which to settle down -- in more ways than one. He's back from the carnival. It's a welcome homecoming.

       "  'review': 'MY friend reached our table in the dungeonlike hideaway of La Esquina\\'s main dining room about 25 minutes late. Only 15 of those were her fault. A few of the additional 10 had to do with her understandable difficulty believing my instructions that the street-level portal was the one marked \"No Admittance.\" The rest of the minutes had to do with the hostess she encountered when she hesitantly approached that door. The hostess claimed not to have any record of our reservation. \"She wouldn\\'t let the guy ahead of me in either,\" my friend reported. \"We both stood there pleading.\" Finally, my friend said, a manager intervened, recognizing her as the straggler in a group already seated and green-lighting her chutes-and-ladders passage down a harshly lighted staircase, along a corridor with kitchen supplies, through the kitchen itself, and into the contrived darkness of the vault where we waited. I asked her if she was miffed. She gave me the derisive, pitying look that a sane person gives a lunatic. \"The harder it is to get in, the more fun it is to be in,\" she said, articulating a maxim of Manhattan night life and a guiding principle of La Esquina, which is sort of like Studio 54 with chipotle instead of cocaine. \"I\\'m already in love with this place.\" Over time La Esquina, which serves pared-down, priced-up Mexican food, will rise or fall on the merits of its chorizo quesadilla, chiles rellenos, pulled-pork taquito and grilled whole red snapper. But for now the buzz that whirls around it, the stampede of diners toward it and the significant pleasures it delivers boil down to its air of cunningly manufactured mystery, its speakeasy-channeling pantomime of illicit, exclusive pleasure. The unveiling of La Esquina belongs in a textbook for public relations and marketing executives. The subterranean chamber opened in mid-July without a listed phone number or a clearly marked entrance. The aforementioned portal is inside a taqueria that says \"Corner Deli\" -- La Esquina means \"the corner\" -- and bears, in addition to the words \"No Admittance,\" the words \"Employees Only.\" Those are bogus caveats in a benign conspiracy that, early on, fueled insidery Internet chatter about this enigmatic taco belle with its unspoken identity and undisclosed location. On one Web site, clues to La Esquina\\'s whereabouts included an anagram of its name. The look of the underground bar area and dining room dovetails with the furtive shtick. Within weathered brick walls are wrought-iron gates that recall the bars of an ancient prison cell, chandeliers that hold fat wax candles and murals made with tiles painted in Mexico. If the Phantom of the Opera hired Zorro as an interior designer and asked him for something in contemporary Torquemada, this might be the result. The adjacent kitchen produces food not only for this netherworld hacienda but also for an attractive street-level cafe with an entrance around the corner. It operates under the same ownership and is clearly marked La Esquina. I visited the cafe as well as the vault. What I ate in both places was always serviceable, sometimes distinguished and less frequently exemplary. As invested as it is in its pose, La Esquina also cares about its ceviches, soups, tostadas, salads and main courses, including chipotle-glazed shrimp, spit-roasted chicken and steamed mussels. It uses discernibly fresher herbs, vegetables and other ingredients than many other Mexican restaurants, and it doesn\\'t resort to easy cheats: oceans of salsa, tides of sour cream, eddies of guacamole. Its kitchen exerts a lighter touch, exemplified by the very fine corn tortillas for its taquitos and the equally fine flour tortillas for its quesadillas. But its kitchen, supervised by Richard Ampudia, who also runs Café Habana, and Jim McDuffee, doesn\\'t always cook with care or verve. Chicken and steak taquitos had stringy meat. Shrimp tostadas were excessively salty. A side of black beans was a watery wasteland. That spit-roasted chicken was overdone and the carne asada -- grilled sirloin with a chimichurri-style sauce of parsley, cilantro, jalapeño and more -- was dull. But there are enough highlights to create the possibility of a charmed meal from start to finish. Begin with the chorizo quesadilla, followed by a tostada with lump crab meat and avocado in a chipotle mayonnaise. Move on to a main course of baby back ribs rubbed with chili pepper, star anise and cinnamon, among other ingredients, then cooked in a vacuum pouch before receiving a chipotle and guava glaze during a climactic grilling. This process yielded luscious results. Make sure to try sides of grilled corn and of \"gratin de rajas,\" which combines roasted poblano peppers with Yukon gold potatoes and Manchego and Cotija cheeses. It was terrific, as was a sandwich of roasted chicken, avocado and chipotle mayonnaise that was available in the cafe but not below. The menus are slightly different. So are the moods. The underworld has more attitude and courts more chaos, to the point of being off-putting at times. On some visits, I felt rushed by servers whose outward affability concealed a furious determination to liberate tables for the welling crowd at the bar. But those servers demonstrated considerable knowledge about, and enthusiasm for, La Esquina\\'s spectacular selection of about 100 tequilas. After a shot or two, the smartly chosen music -- Nina Simone, Soul II Soul, Nouvelle Vague -- seems to swell louder, but not so loud that eavesdropping becomes impossible. My tardy friend overheard several young women ask a waiter if the vault could be breached without a reservation. He told them that they were probably attractive enough to manage it, but that there were no guarantees. I bet that the hedged forecast thrilled them, and that they circled back nights later to join a crowd hungry for more than fried plantains and cactus salad.

       "  'review': 'THERE are many reasons to envy New York restaurant chefs these days, from the kitchen gadgetry at their disposal to their likelihood of receiving major publishing contracts. I for one covet their commutes. To arrive at his new restaurant, Perry St., in the West Village, Jean-Georges Vongerichten takes neither subway nor bus, taxi nor limousine. He travels via elevator, from the seventh floor of the condominium building in which he lives to the first. Daniel Boulud can use the stairs: his apartment is just one floor up from his flagship restaurant, Daniel, on the Upper East Side. And so can Scott and Heather Fratangelo, who live smack above their restaurant, Spigolo, also on the Upper East Side. For the Fratangelos, deciding how to get to work simply means choosing a pair of shoes. They can match their mode of transportation to the rest of their outfits. This arrangement doesn\\'t allow them much of a sense of separation between home and work. But it lets the Fratangelos, both 30 years old, dote on and fret over Spigolo, which has only about 25 seats and a half dozen bar stools. Both the degree and nature of their attentiveness show. Spigolo, which serves unpretentious Italian food in an uncontrived setting, feels unusually honest and earnest. And it feels that way from the moment you walk through the door. \"Oh, yes, hello!\" said Heather Fratangelo, who plays the role of hostess as well as pastry chef, on a warm Sunday evening in early July, when the loss of neighborhood residents to distant beaches was still evident on the becalmed sidewalks and streets. Her exuberant manner of greeting me had nothing to do with desperation -- despite the weekend exodus, Spigolo was full -- and the tone of familiarity in her voice suggested we had met many times before. We had in fact met only once, and that was 10 minutes earlier, when I had glanced briefly into the restaurant to see if my guests were there. But in Spigolo\\'s intensely hospitable world, that glance was enough to make me a veritable regular, and a summery lavender outfit worn by one of my guests, who trailed after me, was enough to prompt additional endearments. \"That\\'s such a pretty dress,\" Ms. Fratangelo said. If she didn\\'t really mean it, Cherry Jones better watch out. There\\'s an even better actress in town. While Ms. Fratangelo supervises the dining room, Mr. Fratangelo minds the kitchen, and does so with a similar grace and confidence. Although he is young and Spigolo is his first chance to run his own show, he doesn\\'t make the mistakes of flamboyant inventiveness and annoyingly cheeky conceits. The menu follows an instantly recognizable contemporary Italian layout: salumi and uncooked seafood in the prologue, followed by separate chapters of appetizers, pasta dishes and main courses, and then of course dessert, which is when his wife\\'s hugely pleasing culinary efforts come into play. It\\'s possible to take an unpersuasive journey through this narrative, because Spigolo\\'s dishes aren\\'t uniformly terrific. I recall an excessively sauced saltimbocca-like breast of veal, a somewhat dry red snapper, and a loin of lamb sliced into such thin ribbons that it surrendered much of its meaty appeal, becoming something daintier and droopier in the process. I remember an insufficiently thick risotto that came close to impersonating soup (and not even bisque at that). But more -- many more -- of my memories of Spigolo are extremely fond ones. Mr. Fratangelo excels at seafood and has put a grill in his kitchen that enables him to cook it over charcoal, which puts a distinctive stamp on it. During my visits, the terrific results included appetizers of plump jumbo shrimp and of tiny baby octopuses, the latter rendered especially pliant and zesty by a pregrill braising in white wine and chili peppers and a subsequent bath in preserved lemons, lemon juice and olive oil. Also grilled and also first-rate was a fairly straightforward salmon fillet, which was given robust accompaniment: charred corn, a mixture of oyster and shiitake mushrooms, and pea shoots. Mr. Fratangelo tends to cover his plates with many vegetables and herbs in different colors and shapes. These supporting players are at once pedestals, skirts and side dishes, and he doesn\\'t mold them into geometric wonders, because his purpose isn\\'t showmanship. What he\\'s clearly after is a sense of bounty and a bevy of familiar, comforting flavors. And he achieved precisely that with a main course of pan-roasted wild striped bass. The fish was just about as succulent and satisfying as it could be, and had a contrasting layer of crisp skin atop it. Below and around it were tomatoes, eggplant, red onion, brined capers, olives, pine nuts and more: a caponata that brought the Mediterranean sharply to mind. Mr. Fratangelo also has a few terrific pasta dishes up his sleeve. He makes his own fettuccine, adding lemon zest to the dough, and serves it in a bracing pesto that blends arugula with basil but edits out nuts and cheese. He doesn\\'t make his own garganelli, but no matter: the noodles he buys are combined with a sweet fennel sausage ragù and Parmesan cheese to delightful effect. Given all these options, it would be easy for a diner to fill up before dessert. It would also be foolish. While none of Ms. Fratangelo\\'s creations were blazingly original, almost all were irresistible, including a caramel affogato with sugary doughnuts and a mixed berry cobbler with vanilla gelato. Spigolo means \"edge\" or \"corner,\" and the corner-lot theater for this feast seems, at first glance, just about perfect: exposed brick walls that create a rustic aura, handsome glass doors that let in streams of light. But the hard surfaces translate into the kind of earsplitting noise you usually associate with a bigger, slicker, less intimate restaurant. The Fratangelos have hired an acoustic consultant to help them find a solution to this problem, which could easily deter diners and possibly annoy the neighbors. Lucky for the Fratangelos, they needn\\'t worry about complaints from the apartment closest to Spigolo. If the restaurant is at full tilt, that residence is empty.

       "  'review': 'RICE runs rampant. Always has. It does a pantomime of subservience, deferring to the sliver of hamachi astride it or the lobster tail and chorizo in its saffron embrace. But playing humble is easy once you\\'ve already insinuated your way into so many dishes and cuisines. And pasta? An unsinkable showboat. Few carbohydrates could have triumphed so handily over Atkins and South Beach. But pasta thrives, insistent and ineluctable, like Paris Hilton. Couscous, on the other hand, needs lessons in self-assertion, a better publicist, maybe even its own reality show on Fox. There\\'s no reason it should occupy such an underexposed niche among starchy, grain-based canvases for meat, fish and vegetables, no reason it should be so peripheral a side dish. It\\'s fluffy and flexible. And it\\'s all over the menu at Barbès, a Moroccan-French restaurant that attracts notice for that reason among others. Barbès is situated in -- well, it\\'s not easy to say. Although it is in the middle of Manhattan, it doesn\\'t really feel like a part of any distinct precinct, and a diner could spend part of his or her time here playing name that neighborhood. Empire State Building Mews? Herald Square Glens? Western Murray Hill is perhaps the technical answer, but Barbès really exists in a generic, low-energy limbo, which may partly explain why it takes its name from a section of another city. Barbès refers to a heavily Moroccan area of Paris. Morocco and France of course have a long, fraught history, and the arrangement between their cuisines at Barbès is less a matter of fusion than of time sharing. On the dinner menu, one tradition gets two or three lines of the appetizer or entree section, then the other gets a line or two. And so it goes, as a satisfying duck confit salad makes way for an excellent skewer of lamb with harissa and a respectable steak frites with green peppercorn sauce cedes the stage to the \"couscous royale,\" a hugely appealing and generously portioned platform for chunks of lamb, chicken and merguez sausage. The Moroccan dishes aren\\'t necessarily the better ones -- the food at Barbès is maddeningly uneven -- but they\\'re the most interesting, because they\\'re the least commonplace. While the American and European romance with Morocco is a robust one, illustrated by the instantly resonant names of so many of the cities (Casablanca, Tangier, Marrakesh) under that sheltering sky, Moroccan cuisine doesn\\'t claim much real estate in New York. Its meat of choice is lamb, sometimes served as a tagine, which refers both to the high-hooded earthenware vessel in which it\\'s slowly cooked and to the resulting stew. Its go-to seasonings include cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, saffron, ginger and paprika, all of which recur in dishes at Barbès. The restaurant\\'s chef and co-owner, Abdellah Ksiyer, is Moroccan. He opened Barbès early last year with Omar Balouma, who is Algerian and operates a Moroccan party-planning business called Omar the Tent Man. That name suggests a tendency toward shtick that, blessedly, doesn\\'t get a thorough workout at Barbès. It keeps the midnight-at-the-oasis motifs to a minimum. The simple, square, 50-seat room has a medium-size palm tree in the middle, marbled orange walls and interesting, triple-tiered Moroccan fixtures that hang from a wood-beam ceiling. Barbès could otherwise be mistaken for any old bistro, and some of its food has the straightforward appeal of bistro fare. Both that skewer of grilled lamb and a skewer of grilled chicken boasted tender meat redolent of the vegetables, herbs and spices in which it had been marinated: red onions, shallots, cumin and saffron for the lamb; saffron, powdered ginger and coriander seed for the chicken. The skewers were accompanied by a profusion of springy, lightly dressed greens, which exemplified the restaurant\\'s welcome habit of buttressing the main features of its dishes with fresh, unsullied produce. Arguably the best appetizer is a salad sampler that showcases the restaurant\\'s hummus, which has the magically light texture of whipped cream, and its zaalouk, a divinely smoky mash of eggplant, tomato, cumin, paprika and lemon juice. Sadly, the triangles of pita for the hummus verged on stale. The most adventurous appetizer and entree are similar dishes in different sizes and shapes: small triangles, dubbed briouats, in the first case; a large brick, dubbed a pistilla, in the second. Both encase chicken, caramelized onions, egg and an array of Moroccan seasonings in shells of thin pastry, which are then dusted with powdered sugar and cinnamon. This confluence of savory and sweet puts a much greater, more arresting emphasis on sweet than a diner typically encounters before dessert. It warrants a try. The tagines -- lamb, chicken or fish, the type of which changes regularly -- arrive in majestic pots, and the theater trumped the eating. The lamb, served with prunes, was leathery. The chicken had a faint, under-seasoned flavor, like run-of-the-mill, therapeutic chicken soup. \"I suppose it would be good if you had a Moroccan cold,\" quipped a companion. A crab cake appetizer wouldn\\'t be good under any circumstances, so paltry was the discernible presence of crab, as if it weren\\'t an ingredient in the construction of the cake so much as a vaguely crustaceous thought in the mind of the person constructing it. Desserts skewed French -- chocolate mousse, crème brûlée -- and tasted pro forma. But the couscous was good in all circumstances. Couscous is steamed granular semolina, airy and sandy, with a mouth-feel all its own. Barbès alternately gussied it up with raisins and placed petals of chicken breast atop it in the \"couscous au poulet\"; laced it with basil and skirted it with diced tomatoes as an accompaniment for grilled shrimp; and seasoned it with ginger, paprika and a touch of cumin in that busy \"royale.\" Mr. Ksiyer apparently steams his couscous four times, an elaborate process with a pillowy payoff. In his worshipful hands, couscous could rattle rice\\'s hegemony. It could even put linguine on the defensive. Barbès  * [Rating: One Star]  21 East 36th Street, Murray Hill; (212)684-0215.

       "  'review': 'IF you\\'re the kind of well-fed, restaurant-knowledgeable New Yorker who doles out recommendations about where to eat, there are three syllables that regularly escape your lips, a ready answer for what acquaintances want when they know vaguely, but not precisely, what they want. A place with sophisticated food but not a whiff of arrogance about it? The Red Cat. A place that looks good but not too good, that simmers attractively without sizzling flamboyantly? The Red Cat. Somewhere you can treat a business associate or a family member to a dinner that feels sufficiently special and not bust the bank? The Red Cat. Somewhere you can take someone who might be a date (but, then again, might not) and leave your designs ambiguous, your options open. Hint: a domesticated animal in a popular color for fast cars. By turns cozy and sexy, laid-back and fleet, the Red Cat is a restaurant Rorschach, different things at different times to different people, which is just what its owners, Jimmy Bradley and Danny Abrams, intended. The simultaneously prosaic and cryptic name they gave it alludes to nothing, connotes nothing. It\\'s a phrase to be imbued with whatever meaning the imbuing party deems fit. Mr. Bradley and Mr. Abrams did not want to be pigeonholed into any one tidy theme or identity, so they jumbled the decorative motifs, hanging Moroccan lanterns from the ceilings, putting framed paintings and photographs on the walls and using reclaimed barn wood from Pennsylvania, some of it painted red and some white, as paneling. The Red Cat feels vaguely colonial and tavernlike, except when it feels downtown-gallery cool, and apart from those moments when it feels modestly and eclectically elegant. Choose your mood. The menu is more coherent, more of a piece. It doesn\\'t take ethnic sides. But it fairly consistently mines a middle ground between Continental and new American, timeless Mediterranean and of-the-moment Manhattan, where unabashedly hearty preparations and ingredients meet seasonal produce and whimsical flourishes, where comfort and classicism welcome innovation without letting it run roughshod. It\\'s an immensely appealing place, recently inhabited by a loin of rabbit wrapped in pancetta and surrounded by fava beans, cipollini onions and dates. On many menus this dish would be an entree, but Mr. Bradley, the restaurant\\'s chef, does it as an appetizer. In a similar vein he includes among the starters a baby lamb chop Milanese, which is encrusted with mustard and panko and skirted with baked tomatoes, olives and capers. Mr. Bradley loves Italy, and so there is also a simple, excellent appetizer of sautéed zucchini slivers with pecorino cheese and toasted almonds. But his heart is roomy enough to open the door to potato pierogi sautéed in plenty of butter and paired with hon shimeji mushrooms and chunks of poached lobster. He bends to accommodate trends and has lately been serving a seared tuna appetizer, albeit one with real personality, thanks to currents of curry and a chili pepper vinaigrette. He accommodates lighter appetites with a delightful salad with chevrot cheese, pear and pumpkin seeds. The menu changes frequently, so some of those dishes will soon be retired or significantly tweaked. But you can count on encountering the zucchini sauté, a Red Cat staple, along with green beans tempura, an addictive side dish with a dipping sauce of extra-zingy honey mustard -- honey mustard on steroids. You can count on a terrific pork tenderloin among the entrees. It is bathed before cooking in a sugar marinade, and served with morels. You can count on an expertly grilled shell steak. You can count on the rest of the entrees running a predictable but sensible gamut: chicken and duck; salmon or Arctic char; cod or black bass or such. You can count on plates that are composed generously, with a bounty of vegetables and sometimes a whole extra dimension, like the richly satisfying vegetable risotto on which Mr. Bradley placed cod. And you can pretty much count on careful cooking. A skate wing was ideally crispy on the outside without being remotely dry on the inside. The Red Cat opened in 1999, when it received one star in The New York Times from William Grimes. Its location, on a fringe of Chelsea, among a growing gallery scene, seemed much more remote then than now, but the Red Cat has never relied solely on its neighborhood for business. Its fluid, flexible nature is such that it seems -- and is -- in equal measures a local joint and a destination. It\\'s the exceedingly rare place that can often take a reservation only a few days in advance and yet is almost always packed. Some of the locals eat at the bar -- and began doing so here long before that practice became a citywide fashion. The Red Cat was also ahead of the curve in grouping the wines on its list not by country but by character: \"Floral Whites,\" \"Sangiovese, Nebbiolo and Earthy Reds.\" It has been a prolific sire: first of the Harrison, which has a slightly stiffer posture; then of the Mermaid Inn, which frolics casually in the surf; and most recently of Pace, which went full-on Italian and stumbled a bit. None have quite the Red Cat\\'s easy confidence or irresistible spirit. Mr. Bradley even roasts and serves suckling pig here every Sunday. That\\'s a Red Cat kind of thing to do. Dishes at the Red Cat do not rise to sublime heights; that\\'s not a Red Cat thing. Not all the desserts are as terrific as a rocky road sundae and an orange panna cotta, and a cookie sampler is entirely forgettable. The intensely friendly service can turn spacey, as when no one remembered to put a requested candle in the dessert of a friend who was celebrating a birthday. But I always leave the Red Cat happy. It doesn\\'t have the best this or the best that. It isn\\'t a star pitcher or a marquee shortstop. It\\'s an expert utility player, and maybe that\\'s what red cat means -- or should mean from now on. The Red Cat  ** [Rating: Two stars]  227 10th Avenue (23rd Street), Chelsea; (212)242-1122.

       "  'review': '\"I HAVEN\\'T been here in three years,\" one gentlemen said to another as they passed my table at Periyali the other night. \"Do you remember what the food was like?\" his companion asked him. I didn\\'t hear the answer. But the question made me think: at many pricey Manhattan restaurants, summoning the memory of an experience from three years ago would produce a misleading compass for the journey ahead. The passage of three years would guarantee a tweaking of the concept, a reshuffle in the kitchen or at least the arrival of a slate of new dishes and an expansion of the spice cabinet to include coriander and cardamom. Not at Periyali. This restaurant served octopus marinated in red wine back then, and it serves octopus marinated in red wine now. Time marches on; the moussaka at Periyali stands still. If you remember what Periyali was like 3 years or 10 years or even 15 years ago, you know what it\\'s like today. And you know that it\\'s a lulling antidote to the frequent overdoses of restless innovation and runaway imagination at other restaurants. That it\\'s a pleasant sigh of a place, and a bit, but only a bit, of a yawn. That you eat simply here and you eat well: fish grilled over charcoal and sprinkled with lemon; lamb and beef seasoned with nothing more daring than rosemary and thyme. Periyali is the same as it ever was, right down to the décor: white stucco walls, enormous bouquets of fresh flowers and a ceiling of undulating white linen, which poetically evokes sails as it serves the more prosaic purpose of muffling noise. Periyali is as calm and calming as the Aegean on a windless day. While it\\'s strange to think of a restaurant this retiring as a trailblazer, Periyali indeed was one. When it opened 18 years ago, upscale Greek was an oxymoron, a gyro-defying leap of imagination and faith. Its owners, Steve Tzolis and Nicola Kotsoni, had made a success out of Il Cantinori, an Italian restaurant featuring rustic food in a polished, handsome setting, and fellow Greeks who dined there would constantly ask where to find a Greek analogue to it. There was none, Ms. Kotsoni said in a recent telephone interview. She and Mr. Tzolis decided that there should be, that if a refined trattoria could work, so could a refined taverna. Besides, she said, they found a location on West 20th Street that limited their financial risk. \"We were paying $700 a month in rent,\" she said, laughing. \"We thought it was O.K. to take a chance.\" So they did, creating a restaurant devoted to some of the fish and meat best loved in Greece, where they were born. (They met later, in New York.) Their influence on Manhattan was subtle, gradual and certain, visible today in the restaurants Estiatorio Milos, Molyvos and Thalassa. Greek didn\\'t exactly become the new French, the new Italian, the new anything. It\\'s a cuisine with less variety and ambition than those, rooted in a poorer and less populous country with less vanity about its culinary traditions. But Greek became something more than leaden spanakopita that sits and sags in a display case for half the day. Periyali\\'s spanakopita, served as an appetizer, had a flaky, wonderful pastry shell when I sampled it. Fried rings of calamari, also served as an appetizer, had a similar lightness and delicacy. They made all those reckless pub versions seem like so many oily bread crumbs with specious claims to maritime paternity. Other appetizers ranged from modestly delightful (smoked trout with an emphatic presence of dill; puréed yellow split peas with red onion) to extremely satisfying (sautéed sweetbreads over gigante beans; sautéed chicken livers over lentils). The best of the appetizer bunch was the octopus. New Yorkers are currently enjoying an octopus renaissance, an octopus apotheosis, with restaurants as different as BLT Fish and Ama having cinched preparations that render this flesh unusually pliant. I like to think that Periyali, which marinates its octopus for two days, paved the way. It grills its octopus over charcoal, which is also how it cooks many of its seafood entrees. I tried branzino, dorade, red snapper and shrimp, all faintly crisp and moist. Periyali grills its lamb chops and its kebabs of filet mignon with similarly delightful results. The recurring virtues of its entrees are fine flesh treated with restraint, generous portions and fully composed plates -- some broccoli here, some couscous there -- incorporating side dishes, which many other restaurants list separately. The final bill at Periyali seldom shocks. The less austere preparations include veal medallions in a sauce of veal jus and wild mushrooms; a dish of cubed lamb, mushrooms, pine nuts and feta cheese, all swaddled in a fluffy phyllo comforter; and, of course, the moussaka, which managed the difficult trick of being rich but not smothering. Nothing at Periyali proves hugely intriguing. Nothing wows. But the little touches add up slowly and nicely. I think of the terrific mix of Greek olives at the start of the meal and the creamy quality of the Greek yogurt that mingles with honey and walnuts in the simplest and best of a limited selection of desserts. The ambience also has a way of sneaking up on you. Tables here are not squished together, and the series of rooms go deep enough, culminating in an enclosed garden, to give the restaurant a truly spacious feel. There have indeed been some changes over the years. The Greek wines on the primarily Greek wine list are more varied and better, a reflection of Greece\\'s strides in that department. The first chef left, turning the kitchen over to Thomas Xanthopoulos. But that happened 17 years ago. Mr. Xanthopoulos has been cooking here ever since. He performs with relative anonymity in these cult-of-chef times and with admirable steadiness. One of my companions could not recall ever having a bad meal at Periyali, where he had dined repeatedly. How often? About every three years, he said. That seems to be a common span of time between visits to Periyali. Diners should shorten it. Periyali ** [Rating: Two stars]  35 West 20th Street, Flatiron district; (212)463-7890. ATMOSPHERE -- Understated, with white stucco walls, wood floors and enormous bouquets.

       "  'review': \"I AM ashamed of my past. Horrified by it, really. I need to glance back only a little more than a decade to catch a glimpse of my wantonness, to see myself treating something precious as if it were just so much flesh. When it came to sushi, I was a cad. I degraded it with excess wasabi paste, and my use of soy sauce was nothing short of promiscuous. Then again, there wasn't an abundance of exemplary sushi or expert sushi chefs back then. All too often the fish, overly chewy, and the rice, needlessly clumpy, didn't deserve gentler treatment. At Gari, a new Japanese restaurant on the Upper West Side, they do. I would never drag Gari's sushi carelessly through a salty, spicy murk. Gari's sushi would be especially ill served by that impulse, because much of it is prepared with more intricate and emphatic seasoning than sushi typically is. Any additional embellishments would distort the chefs' artful compositions and overload a diner's palate, which already has plenty to ponder. One night, for example, an omakase sushi tasting menu included a thin sliver of yellowtail, which had been caressed with sesame paste. A much fatter slab of salmon carried a warm red tomato sauce, which tasted as if it had just migrated from a mound of tagliatelle in a nearby trattoria. Red snapper was crowned with a tangle of baby mesclun and toasted pine nuts. Seared toro was sprinkled with soy-marinated garlic and scallions. A piece of bluefin tuna sported an ecru plumage of tofu mousse. Gari's calling card is sushi that has been tweaked slightly or gussied up significantly, but this restaurant usually doesn't let the process get out of hand. (One exception was an à la carte maki roll of fried oysters, which were held hostage by a ruthlessly unctuous mayonnaise.) Gari takes its cues from -- and arguably betters -- its sire, Sushi of Gari, an unadorned, uncomfortably jammed cranny on the Upper East Side with a cult following and, on the night I visited it, a hectic, brusque air. (A server and a sushi chef sped a friend and me through an omakase menu in one hour flat.) Gari is not exactly sluggish, serene, spacious or stylish. But it does have more surface polish than its forebear, its clean lines and warm woods forging a minimalist, quasi-Scandinavian appeal. It also has ostensibly Japanese-inspired dishes that go well beyond the sushi and sashimi to which Sushi of Gari largely limits itself. And some of this cooked food is as impressive as the uncooked fish. I think in particular of a dish called Mishima beef with a jolting price tag of $45. Both the term and expense are unexplained by the menu. Mishima refers to a place in Japan where special cattle are pampered and fattened to produce rich, Kobe-like flesh. Gari gets its beef from similar cattle in Texas. It pan-sears strips of rib-eye and then swaddles them in shimeji, shiitake mushrooms, an intricately seasoned chickpea purée and red miso sauce. The result was sublime. A shockingly succulent deboned young chicken luxuriated under a light soy glaze and a dusting of sansho pepper. Chilean sea bass and salmon had robust flavors and delicate textures and turned out to be wiser choices than roasted lobster, an insufficiently tender waste of an upstanding crustacean. The desserts, courtesy of Petrossian, are pro forma (molten chocolate cake, Black Forest cake), but a diner may have eaten so well by that point that he or she won't care. Besides, the check may have risen plenty high already. Cost is my biggest qualm with Gari, which struck me as too expensive for the neighborhood, the portions and the matter-of-factness of the ambience and service. Consider the sake selections: only two bottles are under $45, and they are only 10 ounces each. But the splendor of Gari's sushi and sashimi cannot be denied. The fish used is of discernibly high quality. I wouldn't put it on a par with the seafood at Masa, Sushi Yasuda or Kurumazushi, but I wouldn't put Gari all that far behind. Like those restaurants, Gari does right by sushi rice, serving it warm, so that the temperature of the fish atop it is raised. And my extended omakase menu at Gari, which cost about $100, was in fact less expensive than comparable experiences at those other restaurants. Gari claims its own niche in the increasingly crowded sushi marketplace with its colorful flourishes, like brilliant slices of avocado beneath a sweet mash of chopped sea eel. But Gari can also take a simpler approach, as it does in a $28 sashimi sampler, which arrives in a boat-shape bowl. I consumed the luscious toro as it was, even though the barest dab of wasabi or the subtlest splash of soy sauce would have been O.K. Now that I'm older and wiser, I know how to show a little restraint and respect. Gari  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  370 Columbus Avenue (78th Street), Upper West Side; (212)362-4816. ATMOSPHERE -- A well-lighted room with warm woods, exposed brick and a long sushi counter as its focal point.  SOUND LEVEL -- Moderate.

A broader, but limited, and expensive, list of sake.  PRICE RANGE -- Appetizers, $7 to $21. Entrees, $23 to $45. Sushi and sashimi by the piece, except for toro, $3 to $8. Omakase sushi and sashimi menus from about $65 to more than $100.

       "  'review': 'I PITY the Duane Park Café, but I respect it. I fear for it, but I root for it, this solid supporting player in the company of so many actual and aspirant stars, this earnest tradesman in the proximity of so many self-conscious, self-aggrandizing artists. Just across the street stand Bouley and Danube with their regal and whimsical interior décor, their annual Zagat Survey validations, their luxurious tasting menus. Not far away is Nobu, ever jammed, ever electric, still a celebrity magnet after all these years. To these neighbors add Megu, the expensively accessorized epitome of the wasabi-fringed fun houses in ascendance right now, and Odeon, which defined downtown cool decades ago and maintains an alluring temperature today. The list goes on because the milieu is TriBeCa, and few other patches of Manhattan are soil for such a high-flying, charismatic collection of destination restaurants. This is tough turf. And I was first drawn to the Duane Park Café by my curiosity about how a place that tried neither to be a glittery peer nor a frumpy counterpoint to so many luminaries had managed to fare for so many years in their midst. But I returned to Duane Park for an additional reason. At some point during my first visit -- perhaps when my fork slid through a beautifully grilled fillet of John Dory with fennel and blood orange, or when my spoon sank into an immensely appealing chocolate and banana brioche pudding with cranberries -- it occurred to me that there was a moral and a message in the relative anonymity of this restaurant. That the way it fades into the woodwork of New York was illustrative and instructive. More than culinary standouts like Per Se and Masa, Duane Park speaks to what a surfeit of options for sophisticated dining we New Yorkers enjoy. It tells us this precisely because it makes such a small impression. It serves pheasant breast and venison osso buco, and yet it would be aptly characterized as an unpretentious neighborhood bistro. It does a terrific job with sautéed Chilean sea bass, which comes with a celery and verjus reduction, and with roasted rack of lamb, which is embellished with blueberries and pickled walnuts, and yet it enjoys only run-of-the-mill regard. In many other American cities, Duane Park would probably create a fair degree of notice and lay claim to being one of the more interesting restaurants in its neighborhood. In New York City it\\'s pretty much an afterthought. This status is understandable; I cannot and would not challenge or quibble with it. Duane Park is not exactly a bargain; its dinner entrees go as high as $30 and don\\'t drop below $20. Although the restaurant\\'s exterior is inviting and its foyer and bar area radiate a cozy air, its dining room feels boxy and banal, and the owner and managers obviously know that. They regularly vary the level of illumination in the room, and they keep several large vases filled with bright, fresh flowers. Late last year they had the rear wall of the dining room upholstered in golden silk panels. Even so, a slightly downbeat visual spirit persists. Some of what the kitchen does is badly conceived, poorly executed or both. That venison was infused with a blackberry tea that conspired with the overcooked meat to turn the dish into a murky, gummy gastronomic apocalypse. The sins of mustard-crusted tuna were twofold: vapidity and aridity. But tuna tartare, which could have been deadly dull, wasn\\'t, partly because the tahini sauce around it was not the usual framing device, at least not these days, and was a commendable tahini sauce to boot. An even better appetizer, rife with prudently juxtaposed flavors and textures, was a mixture of shredded smoked trout, crème fraîche and horseradish that was perched atop a crunchy potato pancake and then surrounded with bits of Gorgonzola and roasted pear. The food at Duane Park often reflects pride, care and a commitment to fresh and very fine ingredients, qualities that were evident both in the rich, dark ribbons of air-cured duck breast in an arugula salad that I sampled and in the moistness and delicacy of a semolina-crusted halibut that I tried. Those dishes were mainstays of the menu, while a satisfying appetizer of grilled shrimp, calamari and cauliflower and a hearty braised short rib entree came and went, examples of the restaurant\\'s efforts not to get stuck in a rut. It has struggled off and on since its chef and owner, Seiji Maeda, opened it in 1989. (The following year it received one star from Bryan Miller in The New York Times.) Marisa Ferrarin, who manages the restaurant, told me in a telephone conversation that Duane Park went so far as to bring in a feng shui expert five years ago. \"He hung special stones above the door to create new energy,\" she said, adding that those stones were still there. I never noticed them. But I noticed other details that reflected Duane Park\\'s quest to survive in a difficult environment, to hatch strategies and hone attributes all its own. It has a way of greeting and saying goodbye to customers that feels gracious and grateful but not sycophantic. It has a simple two-page wine list that is considerate in its concision and prices, which are moderate. It has good desserts, which tend to be crowd-pleasing rather than trailblazing. During my visits they included a quince and apple cobbler and a chocolate, pecan and caramel tartlet. Those charms, modest and part of a more complicated and flawed picture, would be more than enough for a restaurant in less privileged precincts, a restaurant that didn\\'t have to rub shoulders with Chanterelle and Montrachet on its own patch of Manhattan and compete with so many distinguished performers on the rest of the island. Those charms have been just enough to carry Duane Park through the years. They have done so in a decidedly fitful, humble fashion that ultimately says as much about how lucky we are as how limited this restaurant is.

       "  'review': 'IF you were a piece of raw fish, you would be feeling awfully confused about your worth these days. On the one hand, you\\'re a crossover hit, a polyglot star. Restaurateurs give you top billing even in Italian and French productions, crowning you crudo and tweaking you into tartare. Long gone is that lean epoch on the Japanese margins. But with each new day and newfangled menu, the very people who cast you show less faith in your innate luster. They tease you out, tart you up and saddle you with eccentric accessories. It\\'s one extreme makeover after another, and the next thing you know, you\\'re wearing pickled Thai chilies and a beret of emulsified olive oil that looks like a toasted marshmallow. Such is the fate of uncooked cubes of yellowfin tuna at Lure Fishbar, where seafood endures more costume changes and a zanier array of accents than Jennifer Garner in \"Alias.\" Lure wants not just to participate in the crudo craze -- the first quarter of this restaurant\\'s menu presents nearly a dozen kinds of raw or barely cooked fish -- but also to add something to it. Unfortunately Lure adds too much too weirdly and too often. Fashioned to evoke the teak-paneled cabin of a luxury yacht, Lure makes a nifty visual promise of communion with the high seas. But with a few of its cooked dishes as well as its raw ones, it fails to trust the fruits of those waters. It lets the condiments steer the ship, abetting a mutiny by a bounty of relishes and vinaigrettes. When proper order reigns, this restaurant can provide a handsome, pleasant voyage. It looks great, its decorative conceit realized so shrewdly that you cannot help smiling as you take it all in: the bar stool cushions that bring to mind flotation devices, the windows that resemble portholes. More important, Lure makes you look great, its dimness as flattering as an interview by Larry King. If all the world were lighted as Lure is, a great many dermatologists would be out of work (and a great many ophthalmologists would be twice as busy). Lure\\'s owners, John McDonald and Josh Pickard, who opened Lever House in late 2003, understand that scene is as potent a magnet as cuisine. With the help of the design firm CAN Resources, they have contrived an alluring one. It\\'s the food, under the direction of the chef Josh Capon, that sometimes sends Lure into choppy waters. The menu is elaborately segmented in a manner that strands you with too many questions about how and how much you should order. Beyond the \"raw fishbar\" at the start, there\\'s a section for shellfish, another for soups and still others for fried fish, kebabs, seafood entrees, meat entrees and sides. It took me many visits to identify and isolate the best from the rest. At least a half dozen kinds of oysters are available, and the ones I tried were terrific. Lure seemingly doesn\\'t stint on the quality of its seafood, a virtue that was apparent in the best entrees I sampled. Grilled swordfish was meaty, moist and enlivened -- but not enslaved -- by an Asian-inflected marinade of soy sauce, butter, garlic and ginger. Grilled salmon provided the silky texture and rich flavor that we salmon lovers crave, and the amalgam of bell peppers atop it was both tolerable and easily swept aside. My favorite entree was one of the recurring specials: a vaguely corny, almost classic surf and turf of an enormous, succulent lobster tail (butter-poached and served with a truffled bordelaise sauce) and a pliant, juicy filet mignon. I followed this dish with my favorite of Lure\\'s desserts, a hokey but irresistible collection of creative ice cream sandwiches like one with strawberry ice cream between vanilla shortbread cookies. And as a companion and I laid waste to them, it hit us: Lure\\'s true calling. This restaurant works best as an upscale, downtown Red Lobster -- a Garnet or Ruby Lobster. Even by that conception, it has problems. The New England clam chowder was a watery shipwreck. The shrimp in shrimp soup were strangely mushy. But as a general rule, Lure hits the rocks when it harbors pretensions. Steamed black cod cowered beneath an oppressive mash of mushrooms, sake, lemon zest and Thai chilies. Sautéed halibut -- rather, oversautéed halibut -- had been doused with a pink peppercorn vinaigrette that rendered the fish almost irrelevant. Going back to the raw selections, the ginger vinaigrette on slivers of toro and the marinade of soy sauce, ginger and kaffir lime with Nantucket Bay scallops were too assertive. Japanese red snapper was meant to be dunked in a \"citrus-olive oil foam\" that looked and smelled more like a gooey, perfumed facial mask. You may wonder whether to eat it or moisturize with it. In these cases the very fine fish can be enjoyed more if liberated from its ablutions and adornments. And in cases like the Arctic char and the Tasmanian sea trout, both subjected to more prudent fiddling and both more easily divorced from their condiments, you will likely find ample pleasure. But you will still wonder: isn\\'t a hint of wasabi or a sprinkling of rock salt and minced herbs about as much primping as a piece of raw fish needs? What must we be doing to its floundering self-esteem? Lure Fishbar  * [Rating: One Star]  142 Mercer Street (Prince Street), SoHo; (212) 431-7676.

       "  'review': \"ONLY a small minority of restaurants exert a pull so strong that you go to them without much consideration for their location, their type of cuisine or the nuances of their ambience. The vast majority survive because they meet a specific craving or need: for something spicy or something romantic, something inexpensive or something nearby. They punch the ticket of a whim. They solve a riddle of requirements. Where, for example, do you go if you don't want to shuffle more than a few paces from the Broadway theater in which the show you're seeing is playing? If you want a place that feels a bit indulgent but not remotely reckless? That favors hearty fare over dainty fillips? That pays fitting tribute to the milky glory of mozzarella? You go to La Masseria. And you go knowing that, while you won't have the meal of your life -- or even the meal of your month -- most of your food will be good, you will certainly eat plenty, and you will sidestep the many disasters along the Great White Way, a culinary minefield of considerable peril. In fact my first meal at La Masseria was significantly better than good, and that judgment transcended the mozzarella, a subject to which I will later return. Along with a colleague, I dropped by La Masseria for lunch, not really knowing what -- beyond the probability of pasta -- to expect. The restaurant was almost empty, which may be why the food was more impressively prepared than it would turn out to be on subsequent visits. The kitchen wasn't stretched anywhere close to thin. And so the baby octopus appetizer was a many-tentacled, many-splendored thing: supple rather than rubbery, with a garland of slightly crunchy broccoli rabe and a cushion of puréed fava beans. A tangle of tagliatelle did the Bolognese sauce atop and around it proud, providing a vehicle that was sturdy but never clunky. Although many Italian restaurants sputter when it comes to main courses, La Masseria zipped right along, as if on cruise control. A decadently thick, expansively broad veal chop, seasoned in a restrained fashion with rosemary and sage, was a juicy invitation to gluttony, which we promptly and unconditionally accepted, leaving very little meat on the bone. An extremely moist fillet of pompano, sautéed in a bit of butter and white wine and sprinkled judiciously with lemon, provided precisely the right, light counterpoint, reprieve and amends that we felt we needed. We decided it was O.K. to eat the whole thing, and rapidly did so. Then we waddled back to the office with that special brand of contentment -- a satisfaction mingled with a sense of discovery -- that you get when you've had a terrific meal at a restaurant about which no one had made grand pronouncements or promises. And while La Masseria occasionally disappointed me over time, that lunch underscored how diligent and deft this restaurant can be with the highlights of its menu and under the most optimal of circumstances. Masseria means farm or farmhouse, and it's not only the restaurant's name but also its design cue, readying the stage for walls of stone or rough stucco, exposed wooden beams along the ceiling and, dangling on some of those walls, antique farm tools: a pitchfork, harnesses. Thankfully, the restaurant doesn't overplay this conceit. You notice it but then forget it, holding on to a vague awareness that the visual environment, like the food, veers deliberately and fetchingly in the direction of rustic. But the most appealing aspect of this restaurant's setting is the dimensions. The dining room is relatively broad and extraordinarily deep, with a few unexpected nooks toward the back. All this space translates into tables that are not wedged tightly together, and the absence of crowding is a balm for the ears as well as the elbows. It helps keep a lid on noise. The menu ranges far and wide over land and sea, carpaccio and capesante, in a naked bid to appeal to all audiences. There are unfamiliar scene-stealers, including a dish of fettucinelike noodles with wedges of eggplant and smoked mozzarella in a light tomato sauce. There are familiar star turns, including that tagliatelle. And there are unfamiliar performances from familiar players, most conspicuously a limoncello-flavored tiramisù that, like most other desserts, was worthy of nothing more than faint applause. You can pretty much count on generous portions but not, sadly, on careful preparations. With the exception of that pompano and the shrimp, scallops and squid in an absolutely wonderful fritto misto, the seafood I sampled at La Masseria was overcooked. So was grilled chicken, which bore the additional indignity of too much salt. Other meat, including rabbit and rack of lamb, fared better. An enormous rib-eye steak was tender and flavorful enough to warrant a presentation more imaginative than the one it received. It was buried beneath an unruly clump of fried shoestring potatoes, a gimmick that grew tired about a decade ago but somehow refuses to die. Then again, maybe La Masseria was making a decorative statement with it. Maybe Mount Spud was supposed to evoke a bale of hay. Now to that mozzarella. La Masseria makes it fresh daily, from cow's milk, and spreads it out in large sheets. Onto those sheets goes asparagus or eggplant or sun-dried tomato or speck, and then the sheets are rolled and sliced so that the mozzarella and its company make a colorful spiral, as delectable to the eye as to the palate. That mozzarella goes a long way -- although not quite the full distance -- toward redeeming La Masseria's frequently off-pitch service, which caroms from excessively chatty to inexplicably absent and only occasionally hits what seems to be its intended mark, affable availability. While the mozzarella doesn't represent a reason to go out of your way to get to La Masseria, it argues for a stop at this restaurant if you happen to be in its vicinity: if Italy is in your thoughts, a farmhouse is on your mind, and a show is part of the rest of the afternoon's or evening's itinerary.

       "  'review': \"THERE came a moment during one of my meals at Casa la Femme North when my companion and I confronted a decision more critical than hummus versus baba ghanouj, a choice more pivotal than prawns or lamb, a consequential crossroads that captured the very soul of the place. Did we want a flap of our tent lifted so that we could assess the abdominal achievements of the belly dancer who had just begun to whirl through the dining room? Or did we prefer to stay hidden behind our gauzy white veil, shrouded sheiks in pseudo-Arabian isolation? We picked privacy over pulchritude. But I still couldn't shut out the screechy soundtrack for the performance, the clapping of other patrons or the dispiriting fact that an otherwise fine meal had been hijacked by high jinks that felt awfully kitschy in the context of the East Side of Manhattan. The nature of your response to Casa la Femme North, which serves Egyptian food in an ersatz Alexandria under the Queensboro Bridge, largely boils down to this: How much music and midriff do you like with your mezes? Does the sudden appearance of a sinuous siren count as dinner and a show or dinner and a distraction? If you arrive early and take your last bite of the restaurant's sublime baklava before 9 p.m., you can avoid the dancer. But there's really no escaping Casa la Femme North's facile exoticism, built around such obvious props as palm fronds and shisha (a k a hookah) pipes and such over-the-top indulgences as the private tents that ring the dining room. Don't get me wrong: I'm all for a sheltered, spacious niche of my very own, especially on date night, and Casa la Femme North deserves serious consideration from anyone who wants to pair grape leaves with groping or nibble on more than what's on the table. But there's something incrementally ridiculous about a server constantly having to pop through a gossamer cocoon to check on the level of your wineglass. It's a gas the first time and a goof the second. By the 9th or 10th, it's a gimmick that's wearing out its welcome. The tents are available by special request; the restaurant also has extremely comfortable untented tables in the center of the dining room, some with lavishly upholstered high-backed chairs and semicircular booths. At least until the dancer descended and I found myself smack in her gyrating path, I preferred this seating arrangement. But no matter my perch, I enjoyed Casa la Femme North's food, the ingredients of which tasted as fresh as I could desire, the spicing of which was as clear and well calibrated as I could hope for, the cooking of which was often spot-on. For all the restaurant's aesthetic eccentricities, it makes a serious, impressive effort in the kitchen, producing many minor and major delights. The pita bread, for example. It comes hot from the oven in generously proportioned wheels that have been encrusted with sesame seeds, dusted with oregano and rock salt and brushed lightly with olive oil. It provides the perfect canvas for the flavorful mezes, which the restaurant labels mazzas: hummus, baba ghanouj, tahini, zabadi, ful medames (puréed fava beans) and gibnah domiaty (a wonderful Egyptian cheese that is like a less chalky, less salty feta). Some of the dishes at Casa la Femme North will be familiar to anyone who has sampled Middle Eastern cuisine, but the versions presented here are extremely refined ones. Take those grape leaves, which are obviously assembled at regular intervals and do not sit around for long. When I had them, they arrived at the table warm, the rice inside not at all clumpy, the notes of dill and coriander sharp and crisp. Tamaya were like falafel: densely spongy dumplings, or really cakes, of chickpea and fava bean. They were also an excuse to use more of the restaurant's terrific bread and tahini, building blocks for a satisfying appetizer sandwich. Other standout starters included a baked bell pepper stuffed with rice and -- more surprising -- Egyptian crab cakes, packed with sweet meat. Casa la Femme North prides itself on relatively straightforward fish, and yet seafood was what I found most uneven here. A baked whole red snapper was somewhat dry and, because of a clumsy job of tableside filleting, slightly dangerous. Grilled prawns were too chewy. But grilled chicken, which can dry out so easily with such a slender margin of overcooking, was sensationally tender and juicy on both of the nights I sampled it. It was seasoned with sumac, oregano and crushed red pepper and had just enough fat and skin left on it. The restaurant's lamb chops and filet mignon were also first rate. As for the previously lauded baklava, it made me rethink and renounce the anti-baklava peeves and prejudices I had nursed for most of my adult life. The layers of phyllo dough were crunchy and airy and the cinnamon syrup that sweetened them had been applied sparingly, so that the pistachios, almonds and walnuts did not drown in a cloying tide. Open since February, Casa la Femme North is the relocation of -- and successor to -- Casa la Femme, a restaurant in SoHo that closed last December after 12 years. So it has its act down pat. But must that act be so flamboyant, so strenuous? The restaurant seems intent on turning everything into a production, even the pitchers of ice water, stuffed so densely with mint leaves that they look like cylindrical swamps. What ends up in your glass tastes like cold tea. On my first visit, there was a smothering quality to the hyperattentive service. Two garrulous servers at separate times dropped by the table to recommend favorite dishes and suggest strategies for ordering; one would have done the trick. On all of my visits, the servers and their supervisors paced the room endlessly, peering into the tents discreetly and assiduously weaving the vibe that Casa la Femme North is where the desert of daily drudgery ends and an oasis of nightly hedonism begins. But the more I felt like an overpampered sultan, the harder I found it to relax and simply eat. Casa la Femme North  * [Rating: one star]  1076 First Avenue (59th Street); (212) 505-0005.

       "  'review': \"ARTISANAL and tofu are not two words I normally think of together, but artisanal tofu is what they showcase at En Japanese Brasserie, which essays the brave and, to my mind, quixotic challenge of casting tofu as the most refined of delicacies and rarest of dramatic events. Tofu does not merely appear on the En menu. It is given advertised, neatly spaced show times, much like a killer whale at Sea World. At roughly 90-minute intervals from 6 p.m. through 11:30 p.m., tofu comes fresh, glue-white and gooey from pots in En's kitchen; if you time your dinner reservation just right, you can get it while it's merely seconds (as opposed to, say, a whole hour) old and positively brimming with its pasty charms. You can order it warm or chilled, or you can really go for broke and get its dynamic cousin, yuba, which is the skimmed skin of heated soy milk, omelet-esque in texture. Yuba arguably has more character than plain tofu, which is like saying that Britney Spears lip-synchs less transparently than Ashlee Simpson. Some virtues are minor, and everything is relative. With its tofu and its house-made miso pastes, its julienne of burdock root and beef tongue hot pot, En promises an especially authentic, home-style Japanese dining experience. It also claims to channel the spirit of the izakaya, a Japanese pub devoted to what might well be called Japanese comfort food. The Japanese restaurateurs behind En run several dozen similar establishments in Japan. En marks their American debut. But what is so paradoxically striking about it is how familiar and redundant it feels, how faithfully this transglobal tweaking and translation of an izakaya obeys dining trends in New York and how perfectly it encapsulates a certain kind of Manhattan restaurant today. En, which means destiny, adheres to the same formula that Matsuri, Megu and Ono do: Find a location in a putatively hip or genuinely desirable downtown neighborhood. (En goes for the West Village instead of TriBeCa or the meatpacking district.) Arrange the tables and sushi counters in a vast, visually arresting space that looks as much like a stage set as a place to eat. (The main dining room at En has a celestially high ceiling, a central column covered in tin tiles, a two-story wall of enormous windows and an entirely open kitchen with cooks rushing to and fro.) Garnish with theatrical flourishes. (As at Megu, the staff at En screeches a greeting as newcomers enter the main dining room; upon hearing it, I never failed to flinch.) Construct an extremely long, confusing menu that suggests boundlessness, emphasizes small plates, encourages sharing and, most important of all, accommodates rampant carbohydrate phobias. (Japanese is the vehicle; Dr. Atkins would surely have invented sashimi if someone else had not beaten him to the punch.) Even En's identification as a Japanese brasserie suggests a have-it-all, connect-the-dots sensibility: it wants both the healthful allure of an ethnic cuisine in continued ascendance and the timeless appeal of an unfussy, teeming environment in which you can pass many a merry hour with copious drink as well as food. You can indeed do that at En, which I found more aesthetically attractive and relaxing than many of its counterparts, if only because it is slightly more low key. Although much of the seating is at two counters -- one skirts the kitchen, and the other envelops that central column -- there are also oak tables with significant space between them and a pronounced air of privacy and tranquillity. There are many specialty drinks, many kinds of sake and many flavors of shochu, a Japanese distilled liquor. En stands ready to lubricate you every bit as well as you want to be lubricated. In terms of feeding you, En delivers a more scattershot performance, and that assessment holds even if I put my tofu skepticism to the side. Among the cold small plates and the hot small plates, which constitute two separate and equally substantial categories, there are a few real winners, namely a salad of mushrooms and tender chicken, a plate of oysters sautéed in soy sauce and a crudité platter with leaves of cabbage to be dipped in different miso pastes, including sesame miso and peanut butter miso. But there are losers, too: fried chicken nuggets that were, on the night I had them, as succulent as gravel; an avocado and shrimp salad that tasted like a relic from a country-club banquet in the 1970's; a gruel of overgrilled eggplant, uni and mustard that amounted to a slimy mishap. Most of the food that I sampled -- including sushi rolls and chilled soba noodles, a bowl of thick rice with crab meat and a platter of tempura vegetables -- hovered between those poles, relatively satisfying at the moment of ingestion, pretty much forgotten 30 minutes later. I was surprised in a good way by how juicy and flavorful slices of sautéed duck breast were and in a bad way by how utterly ordinary slices of seared chu toro turned out to be. (The chu toro sashimi, by contrast, was terrific.) If you like your meat sizzling on a stone, both Wagyu beef and organic chicken come that way. Both are packed with flavor, although the $38 price tag on the beef is not warranted by the paltry portion. As for desserts, well, I have yet to encounter a Japanese restaurant that wowed me with this final act, and En hangs with the pack. There are tea ice creams and a tea pudding, and you can guess even before you order them if they are going to be your, um, cup of tea. Tofu reappears, taking a final bow in the form of a tofu mousse with brown sugar syrup and sweet soy powder. I suppose it is good enough for what it is, but I figure that its days are numbered the minute the chefs at En ace a yuba brûlée.

       "  'review': 'WE often wind up associating restaurants with the life dramas and junctures they guided us through. I will always associate Devi with the 2004 presidential election. And I will always credit Devi with making the campaign seem less ugly than it was, with making it recede, if only for the duration of a plate of pyramid-shaped rice puffs, too golden, crunchy and airy to permit unpleasant thoughts. It was in Devi that four companions and I gathered exactly a week before the election and inevitably made predictions. While the uncertainty of the race pressed down on us, we didn\\'t feel it just then. We were too distracted and happy fishing creamy yam dumplings from a fragrant pool of salmon-colored tomato sauce that had been seasoned enticingly with cloves and cardamom seeds, cinnamon and red pepper. It was also in Devi, two nights after the election, that a man at the next table could not resist treating everyone around him -- strangers all -- to a passionate deconstruction of what the returns meant, where the country was heading, the challenges and threats it faced. But his soliloquy felt more like frivolous theater than an example of how heated and polarized so many voters had become, because nothing could seem too weighty in the golden glow of Devi\\'s main dining room, where sheets of raw silk shimmer on the walls, servers glide past in what look like orange pajamas, and the scents of mint, cilantro and tamarind sweeten the air. There are restaurants that bring you back to yourself and those that spirit you away. Devi belongs to the latter group, delivering a heady retreat even when the odds against such an escape are longest. Devi works its exotic magic through its take on Indian food, more varied, multidimensional, nimble and surprising here than at the scores of samosa factories throughout these vindaloo-bewitched precincts, where a tandoor and delivery menu are sometimes all that a culinary entrepreneur needs to get by. It casts its spell visually, by making you feel as if you have been lifted -- lofted really -- to a realm more enchanted than any blue or red state could offer. Devi does not have the design budget or square footage of a Spice Market or a Megu, but it has a galaxy of brilliantly glowing glass fixtures -- white, red, blue, yellow and green -- that hang from the ceiling like gargantuan gemstones. It has a curved marble staircase that rises from the main dining room, each step flanked by votive candles, to a more intimate second floor that puts you at eye level with that sky of diamonds and rubies and sapphires. Best of all, Devi has chefs, Suvir Saran and Hemant Mathur, who do not feel bound by your expectations for Indian food. Yes, there is chicken tikka masala on the menu, but you have to hunt for it, and if you ask your server for suggestions, he will steer you in less tired directions. Toward the crispy fried okra, for example, which is dusted with ground mango peel, pomegranate seed and toasted cumin, for an effect so tangy and salty that this dish could easily oust potato skins or nachos as the new appetizer sensation at a T.G.I. Friday\\'s. (I mean that as an unfettered compliment.) Or toward the cauliflower with ketchup. That is not, to be truthful, how Devi advertises the dish in question, but that is essentially what it is, and there is positively no shame in that. Manchurian cauliflower, to use the proper tag, pairs firm, crunchy florets with a tomato ketchup that has been spiked with garlic and chili peppers. It is entirely simple, crazily good and a fine example of Mr. Saran\\'s laudable pragmatism: what matters is the bigness and seductiveness of the taste achieved, not the method for achieving it. Mr. Saran and Mr. Mathur previously teamed at the Indian restaurant Amma, which they left last April. Devi reprises many of Amma\\'s hits and pursues the same goal of placing Indian cooking, or at least putatively Indian cooking, on a higher plane of New York City dining. That aspiration is perhaps most evident in an item available only on a seven-course tasting menu: a mash of calf\\'s brain, green chili, quail eggs and pickled ginger that serves as the ethereal topping for a bruschetta. But that aspiration is also clear in the quality of seafood and meat that Devi puts into the tandoor. On both of the nights I tried them, the jumbo prawns, seasoned with toasted chickpea flour, cayenne, lemon, ginger and garlic, had a wonderful texture: slightly bouncy on the outside, soft within. Lamb chops, which had been marinated in yogurt, garlic and ginger, were faultless. Both the halibut and salmon at Devi are sealed and cooked in banana leaves and both emerged from their cocoons in splendidly moist form. But just when I was ready to pronounce Devi a master of all flesh, I waded into two different dishes -- one with a fiery curry sauce, the other with a marvelous gravy of pistachios, saffron and cream -- that included chunks of excessively chewy chicken. A beef entree -- sirloin pounded into thin strips -- was similarly tough and unappealing. In its bid for \"crispy,\" which was how the menu advertised it, it came up dry. Devi wobbles from time to time, and the prices for a few dishes are rather high in relation to the portions. A few of the restaurant\\'s uniformly courteous servers are prone to distraction and more eager to please than efficient at it. Almost all of its desserts proved disappointing. I found only one, the \"falooda,\" a parfait that combined strawberry and mango sorbets with coconut-lemon-grass milk, that I truly liked. But there was much to compensate, including an unexpected standout: finely minced turkey with fenugreek leaves, spinach, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and onions. It packs so many tastes of India into a hash so sublime that I feel happier and calmer just knowing it exists. I cannot guess whether, over the next four years, some of the acrimony of the past four months will lessen. But at least I know that if I need a vacation from the fighting and fretting, Devi is there for me. Devi  ** [Rating: Two stars]  8 East 18th Street; (212) 691-1300.

       "  'review': 'CUISINES end up married for all sorts of reasons: a chef\\'s inspiration, perhaps, or the movement of one ethnic group to another\\'s turf. At Convivium Osteria in Brooklyn, the cause and agent are love. Italian and Portuguese are bed mates on the menu because the Italian chef and the Portuguese manager are bed mates off it. Carlo Pulixi, the chef, and Michelle Pulixi, the manager, have family trees planted in different patches of European soil: his in Italy, hers in Portugal. When the couple opened this charming restaurant on the fringe of Park Slope nearly four years ago, they decided not to favor either bloodline. They even went a step further, splitting the geographical distance between their heritages and adding Spanish dishes to the menu. That menu, written in Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, is like a dual-purpose primer on Romance languages and southern European cooking: Berlitz with bacalao. Seafood is translated \"al pescador\" for a Spanish assortment of tapas and \"de peixe\" for a Portuguese stew. I got nourishment, a new vocabulary and a fruity, feisty Ribera del Duero with which to wash it all down. Convivium Osteria is primarily a neighborhood restaurant, of the kind and level that every neighborhood wants. It does not force you to splurge, but it allows you to. You can eat conventionally or graze. Convivium accommodates different moods, and it changes with the seasons, opening up a lovely back garden with a wisteria-covered trellis during warm months. And it does a few things well enough to argue for attention from food lovers from more than a few blocks away. One of those things, as it happens, is steak. Inspired less by its muse countries than by an appreciation for sheer gluttony, Convivium offers a thick, broad rib-eye for two. The beef comes from Niman Ranch, and the steak comes to the table on a wood board, with an extremely sharp, long knife that looks like the gleaming love child of a scalpel and a machete. A server uses it to carve a few smoky, tender slices, then lets you use it to carve many more. The experience turns into a thrilling piece of participatory theater: \"The Carnivore Cometh.\" The pleasures for a carnivore on the Convivium menu are many. Tender slices of pork loin are accompanied by small coins of chorizo, which are meant to join the loin in each forkful, bringing a crispiness and a saltiness to the fleshy fun. A roasted baby chicken -- succulent on the night that a friend and I tried it -- was splayed on the plate in a way that all but demanded that it be picked up. Or maybe we thought so and heeded that call simply because we wanted to get to the meat closest to the bone. A platter of cured meats and cheeses, listed as an appetizer for two, has serrano ham, chorizo and Italian speck, all first-rate. A friend and I ordered it at dusk one evening, as we waited for a tardy companion, and it perfectly accomplished such a platter\\'s occasional mission of occupying people who are simultaneously trying to tame their hunger and pass an indeterminate period of time. We nibbled, we talked, we tried slivers of meat and wedges of Spanish cheeses (Cabrales, Roncal, Garrotxa). Our friend finally arrived, and there was still plenty for her. All dinners at Convivium begin with a bowl of olives and a basket of terrific bread, soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The quality of the appetizers varies widely, with a few too many failing to make a strong impression. These underperformers include the fried fillets of salted codfish we tasted on one night and the braised artichokes we tasted on another. Grilled baby octopus with black olives and celery was too tender on the outside, not tender enough on the inside and phlegmatic through and through. In contrast, roasted whole prawns had all the right textures, and the coarse sea salt that seasoned them was a simple, well-chosen stroke. But there were just three of them, for $17, and they should have been elephantine at that price. (They were not.) A much better value, for $9, was a salad of perfectly cooked string beans and bits of hard-boiled egg, a pairing of crunchy and slick textures that worked superbly. Among entrees, the most disappointing was a rack of lamb with a pine nut crust that was too thick and too intrusive. The most satisfying, in addition to the steak and chicken, was a dish of half-moon pockets of pasta that had been filled with duck, topped with shredded radicchio and speck and placed on a tawny, shallow pond of porcini cream sauce. A filling and pleasing salted codfish casserole with mashed potatoes and spinach tasted like a Portuguese spin on shepherd\\'s pie. The standout desserts are a crisp apple tart and a silky chocolate cake, which is served with a heaping mound of freshly whipped cream. Michelle Pulixi makes these, in a fashion untethered by her ancestry, which is part Irish as well. She simply bakes what strikes her as delicious. The service could -- and should -- be better. Tell a server you need 10 more seconds to make up your mind, and he may disappear for the next 10 minutes. Do not go to Convivium if you are in a hurry, but know that even forced lingering feels good here. Much of the soft romantic light comes from tall, slender candles, some arranged like sconces on walls that have been made, with sponge painting, to look as if they are centuries old. Copper pots hang from racks mounted on those walls. You can almost believe that you are in a rustic haunt in Rome, or for that matter in Lisbon. The Pulixis deposit you at the Strait of Gibraltar and let you decide: east or west; his or hers. They chose both, which was no doubt maritally sensible. It turns out to be gastronomically rewarding as well. Convivium Osteria  * [Rating: One Star]  68 Fifth Avenue (St Mark\\'s Place), Park Slope, Brooklyn; (718) 857-1833.

       "  'review': 'SELDOM has a Manhattan neighborhood gone from intriguing to annoying -- from on-the-cusp to over-the-top -- with the distressing speed and depressing thoroughness of the meatpacking district. It is not really a neighborhood anymore. It is an urban theme park: a gaudy epicurean grab bag that weds cuisines from here and there to cocktails from the here and now. It is a \"Sex and the City\" fantasy in which would-be Carries and could-be Bigs look for love and settle for lamb under supremely flattering lighting. The lighting is terrific at 5 Ninth; the would-be\\'s are at every third table, and they are pressed in tight. This sexy, exciting, exasperating restaurant is not for anyone who wants peace and calm. Like its neighborhood, it is for people who crave the jostle of too many bodies in too limited a space. It is also for people willing to choose unsteady exuberance over steady expertise. It has style and energy to burn, but 5 Ninth lacks discipline and judgment in terms of its service and, to a lesser extent, its food. It feels adolescent: ambitious but imprudent, creative but sloppy. Its chef, Zak Pelaccio, did a brief stint at the short-lived Chickenbone Cafe in Brooklyn, where his culinary eclecticism and adventurousness generated more than a bit of buzz. He has brought those traits and that buzz with him to 5 Ninth, which opened in late May. Named for its address and avenue, 5 Ninth actually refuses to be fixed in any one place: even more than most restaurants in these boundary-blurring times, it defies simple categorization. Asian-American? Malaysian-Mediterranean? Thai-Vietnamese-Italian? You could try a dozen geographical references, allow yourself three or four hyphens and still come up short. \"Serious global dazzle\" is how the publicity materials for the restaurant characterize Mr. Pelaccio\\'s cuisine. That is a felicitous phrase with one serious flaw: at least at 5 Ninth, his food manages to dazzle only half of the time. When it is good, it is excellent, a symphony of grace notes in gorgeous balance. Several friends and I shared a steamed loup de mer, also known as branzino, that was beyond succulent. Its seasonings -- including lime juice, coriander root, bird\\'s-eye chili and garlic -- provided hints of flavor that swirled into and out of the mix, hovering briefly, never lingering too long. Two other entrees were also quiet knockouts. One mingled slices of seared duck breast with slices of seared foie gras and roasted figs, arranged so that it was easy to get all three of those players -- meaty, gooey and sweet -- into each bite. The other entree was a baby chicken that had been gently cooked with white wine and a generous amount of deeply aromatic rosemary in a small cast iron pot. It came to the table in that pot and could not have tasted much moister, simpler or more satisfying. How, then, to explain the roasted squab of another night? It could not have been much tougher, and one friend had such trouble cutting into it that servers not only noticed his vain, heroic efforts but, to their credit, insisted on taking the entree off the bill. Or the grilled goat of a different night? It was presented as an unrefined excursion into unfettered protein. But a bit of extra butchering would have been appreciated. Excessively bony and fatty, the goat was difficult and unappealing to eat. The greatest puzzle of all, however, was a lobster appetizer that buried the sea\\'s sweetest flesh in a coffin of fried batter that rendered it indistinguishable. Why put such a delicacy to such indelicate use? Above and beyond those scattered misfires, there is an impressive balance and diversity of meat and fish on the frequently changing menu at 5 Ninth, where I sampled, as appetizers or entrees, tuna belly and octopus, wild salmon and halibut, beef short ribs and lamb shoulder. Most were nicely cooked. The menu also has a separate category for noodles. A signature dish called noodles raja chulan features an engrossing broth of coconut milk, fish stock, Thai chili, garlic, ginger and shallots. A lusty dish of garganelli comes with braised lamb hearts and Parmesan. If the food at 5 Ninth is occasionally befuddling, the service is much more so. One night my friends and I waited more than 30 minutes for our table; another night we waited nearly 40 minutes for our appetizers. The bread that was supposed to come at the beginning of one meal never materialized, and the espresso that came at the end was lukewarm at best. We ordered blueberry crisp and got raspberry crisp, although the dessert menu and our server had not made note of the substitution. That menu promised peanut butter ice cream with the \"chocolate sandwich,\" but cherry ice cream arrived. 5 Ninth is also hindered by an awkward layout. Spread over a three-story town house with wood-beamed ceilings, many fireplaces and a leafy garden out back, the restaurant looks fabulous. But the kitchen is in the basement, while the main dining room is on the second floor. As a result servers are clumping up and down the stairs and often muscling their way through a tangle of bodies in the first-floor bar area. The lanes of foot traffic are easily jammed. And the town house is so narrow that 5 Ninth, in order to maximize the space, has a few tables that barely fit two people but are used for three or four. For some diners, no doubt, the crowded, frenetic air of the restaurant is an adrenaline-pumping (or maybe pheromone-priming) turn-on. It certainly connects 5 Ninth to its addling environs, toward which the restaurant exhibits an interesting ambivalence. Its only identifying mark is a tiny numeral on its inconspicuous front door. 5 Ninth seems to be coyly retreating from its neighbors, trying to stand a few refined paces apart. That goal is laudable, and not yet attained. 5 Ninth  * [Rating: One Star]  5 Ninth Avenue (Gansevoort Street), meatpacking district; (212) 929-9460. ATMOSPHERE -- A sleekly, beautifully renovated three-story town house with a garden in the back, a bar on the first floor, a narrow dining room on the second and a lounge on the third.  SOUND LEVEL -- Relatively but not oppressively loud.  RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Garganelli with lamb hearts; steamed loup de mer; baby chicken with Malaysian marinade or white wine and rosemary; duck with foie gras and figs; banana pudding.  WINE LIST -- Concise and multinational, encompassing about 50 wines with an emphasis on Italy and on bottles between $20 and $50, several of which can also be ordered by the half-carafe.  PRICE RANGE -- Appetizers, $12 to $20. Noodle dishes, $13 to $19. Entrees, $25 to $32. Desserts, $8.

       "  'review': 'IN recent years restaurateurs in Manhattan have increasingly embraced Japanese as one of the cuisines best suited to stylish, visually arresting, loud and large restaurants, the kind with ruinously expensive cocktails in ridiculously bright hues. Japanese has become culinary fodder for all-purpose fabulousness, a low-carbohydrate prop in elaborate theatrical productions that are ultimately about much more than food. But not at Donguri, a Japanese restaurant that directs your attention squarely to what is on your plate. Where else would you look? What else could distract you? The dining room is tiny, unadorned and merely functional, with just 24 seats. There is no music, and there are no martinis, traditional or newfangled. The people sitting at the adjacent table are not talking about \"Entourage\" and trying to look as casually fashionable as the characters in that HBO show. They have their noses deep in bowls of buckwheat noodles, and they are much too content to be self-conscious about the slurping sounds they are making. Donguri is an antihip Japanese restaurant, matter-of-fact and brightly lighted, with servers who briskly and almost wordlessly ferry dishes to and from the kitchen, their banter minimal as they strive to make sure your tabletop is never, ever barren. It feels like a Japanese trattoria or bistro, to borrow terms from other dining traditions. It serves what some of its many longtime fans call Japanese home cooking or Japanese comfort food: lightly fried fish in addition to sashimi, simply grilled chicken with ponzu sauce as well as tempura. You do not come here to sit and pose. You come here to eat well. Donguri was opened in 1998 by Shuji Fujita, who runs the kitchen, and his wife, Michiko, who presides over the dining room. Since then it has evolved into a Manhattan-restaurant oxymoron: the successful secret. It is not even listed in the current Zagat Survey. The people who know about it tend not to talk it up, lest they find themselves unable to get a seat. But my mandate and my nature are to tattle -- make that share -- and so I am doing precisely that. Give Donguri a try, but call first and make a reservation. And know that even if you do that, you may nonetheless find yourself waiting for 10 to 20 minutes on the curb outside. Donguri has no bar, no lounge. It barely has a foyer. Your meal will begin with a small, complimentary dish that will be the first signal that you are in a charmed realm of supremely fresh, utterly straightforward food. One night a friend and I received about eight tiny shrimp, still in their shells, still with their heads. They had been thrown, while alive, into corn oil and deep-fried for just an instant. \"Eat whole,\" said our server, in tentative English and a soft voice. \"Be careful. Very sharp.\" They were, with ridges and edges that vaguely scratched the inside of my mouth and made the experience all the more exciting. Another night our meal started with a Lilliputian bowl of pickled vegetables in a cold miso broth and along with it a broiled rectangle of tofu with a pinprick of wasabi on top. Again, so simple. Again, so good. If the lengthy list of daily specials includes oysters, order them. The Kumamoto oysters that several friends and I had one night were first-rate. So was the sashimi that followed. On the nights I visited Donguri the restaurant did not offer sushi, and the sashimi options had been edited down -- in a way that I greatly appreciated -- to a few fresh selections: kanpachi, which is a kind of yellowtail; sea urchin; bluefin; and bluefin otoro and chutoro. The toro, subtly stippled with fat and buttery in texture, was our favorite. Toro usually is. You build a meal at Donguri through a succession of small and medium-size plates, proceeding in general from cold to hot and from fish to meat, and you throw in some vegetable sides and perhaps a bowl of noodles along the way. All of this makes for a pleasantly paced experience in which the grazing almost never stops. But it also translates into a bill that can be higher than the generally restrained prices of individual items and the plainness of the atmosphere lead you to believe it will be. You can easily spend $60 a person on food, and much more if you order some wine, from an extremely short but judicious list, or sake, a much broader selection of which is available. Raw and cooked, sautéed and deep-fried, fish predominates on the Donguri menu. My favorites included grilled squid, which was a special one night. It was unusually supple and had been seasoned only with salt, although there were scallions and grated ginger on the side. Just as good was the broiled Chilean sea bass, a staple on the menu, which had been marinated in dashi, sake, soy sauce and pickled yuzu. The tempura at Donguri -- shrimp, sweet potato, lotus root, maitake mushroom, zucchini and other kinds -- is dependably airy, faintly crunchy and never oily. The boiled spinach with sesame sauce might not draw your eye, but make room for it on your table. That sauce bears only slight relation to the gloppy, gooey sesame paste that so many Chinese takeout places ladle indiscriminately onto cold noodles. It is much nimbler, much more finely balanced. Among limited dessert options, the sliced Asian pear that we tried was fresh and refreshing, and the interplay between sweet and savory in vanilla ice cream with red bean sauce made for a satisfying conclusion to a more than satisfying meal. Donguri is the kind of restaurant at which you could happily eat once every week or two, and I got the sense that a significant percentage of the diners around me do precisely that. Some of them were Japanese and were speaking that language. Many of them seemed to know the servers well and vice versa. That familiarity lent an easygoing air to the restaurant, which lacks the polish or sparkle to qualify as a big night out. It is more like a little night in, and a memorable one at that. Donguri  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  309 East 83rd Street (Second Avenue); (212) 737-5656.

       "  'review': \"FROM the outside, it's difficult to fathom why Butter, which opened not long ago a few doors down from the Public Theater, requires a pair of grim hosts posted like sentries in a glass-walled vestibule, their arms mentally crossed. As with London beefeaters, I felt compelled on a recent visit to try to make them laugh, but I decided that they must have serious work to do, like fending off people who want to be seated before their full party has arrived. Everything changes once you get past the welcoming committee, though. A long hallway that resembles nothing so much as a sauna gives way to a slender bar and then to a vaulted dining room designed by Andrew Phillips that is done up in a cedar veneer with an illuminated photo mural of a birch forest filling the back wall. The waiters, in their checked shirts with ties tucked between the buttons military style, are eager to please, filling tiny goblets with free welcoming aperitifs and offering little treats to start. In many ways, Butter epitomizes the conflicted priorities of certain downtown restaurants that teeter between being dining rooms and clubs. From the velvet-rope vibe of the hosts to the fawning friendliness of the waiters, Butter tries to have it both ways. The chef, Keith Harry, once cooked at Chanterelle and has put together a serious contemporary American menu with all the requisite high-end ingredients and global touches. Yet Butter only half-promises the opportunity for an enjoyable meal. The dining room is serene enough, but a downstairs lounge with a ceiling made of saplings, two walls constructed of birch trunks and a third of wine bottles lighted in red and black, is loud and smoky, with the unappealing prospect of a D.J. booth that gets going later in the evening. Upstairs, appetizers in particular struggle to hold up the food end. For every success -- crisp sweetbreads surrounded by mustard greens, their nutlike flavor enhanced by a tangy mustard-caper sauce, or a mâche salad, the leaves as tender as baby cress, with sweet striped beets and little chunks of smoky sturgeon -- there is a miscue. Spanish mackerel was grilled to the point of mushiness, and a thin slice of raw hamachi in tamari and ginger juice was unfortunately withered around the ends. The fish was pristine in the tuna tartare, a well-conceived blend of clean ahi and smoky tuna ''bacon,'' but the sesame oil dressing overwhelmed the tuna flavors. Mr. Harry is more sure-footed with his main courses, especially fish dishes, in which he combines reticent and robust flavors without sacrificing balance. Roasted peppers, braised escarole and bits of Smithfield ham tease an almost Chinese cast from a fine piece of black sea bass. The delicate grilled turbot with snow peas and braised savoy cabbage also has an Asian character, perhaps because of the sake in the beurre blanc. A tapenade coating enlivened a rosy piece of tuna, though grilled swordfish was too dry. Roast chicken breast is not my idea of excitement, but Mr. Harry conceals morels and slivers of truffles underneath the meat, touches that seem wasted on the otherwise routine bird. A lamb chop and loin are juicy enough, and a beef fillet will do the job of placating beef lovers, but I don't see any reason other than novelty for ordering ostrich, a lean meat that, but for the faintest gamy aftertaste, falls into the lamb-beef spectrum with little to distinguish it. It would be easy to imagine Butter playing to the showoff crowd with a list of expensive wines. But the restaurant instead emphasizes good, moderately priced bottles, like a mineral-laden Austrian grüner veltliner from Bründlmayer and a full-bodied Crozes-Hermitage from Alain Graillot. The amiable list of desserts does not break new ground, though some offer appealing architecture. Dense and creamy chocolate-mocha cake comes with coffee gelato, the two linked by a spiral bridge of crisp cocoa pastry, while passion-fruit curd joins a pineapple tart and its accompanying coconut gelato. Soothing tapioca pudding needs no structural enhancement, nor does a bombe of fromage blanc sweetened with berry consommé. For those heading to the restaurant rather than to the lounge, Butter offers sound pleasures without much promise of excitement. Later in the evening, after 10:30 or so, a crowd indeed gathers out front, waiting to enter, many presumably en route to the lounge. The grim-faced sentries are still there, and regardless of what I've eaten for dinner, I know that I've had a better evening than they will. Butter * [rating: one star] 415 Lafayette Street near Astor Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 253-2828. ATMOSPHERE Upstairs, a professionally run dining room that looks like a cross between a chalet and a sauna. Downstairs, a dim and smoky lounge. SOUND LEVEL Upstairs, relatively quiet, though background music occasionally shoots to the forefront; downstairs is loud. RECOMMENDED DISHES Crisp sweetbreads with mustard greens; mâche salad with beets and smoked sturgeon; sautéed black sea bass with roasted peppers and Smithfield ham; seared black olive tuna with lemon risotto; grilled lamb chop and roasted loin; mocha marquise; pineapple tart; vanilla tapioca; fromage blanc bombe. SERVICE Friendly and efficient. WINE LIST Well-chosen list of about 100 bottles, with many attractive choices in the $40 to $50 range. HOURS Monday through Saturday, 5:30 to 11 p.m. Late-night service in the lounge, Wednesday through Saturday, midnight to 2 a.m. Closed Sunday. PRICE RANGE Appetizers, $10 to $16; main courses, $27 to $30; desserts, $8 to $10. CREDIT CARDS All major cards. WHEELCHAIR ACCESS Three steps to main dining room with a few tables on same level as entrance; one restroom is accessible.

       "'IF a restaurateur is going to enter the competitive downtown arena of pseudo-Asian pleasure domes, he might as well go for broke. He might as well blow out more than 15,000 square feet of space, fill it with bright colors and festoon it with jumbled visual allusions: an enormous fake European tapestry here, scores of artfully showcased Buddha pictures over there. He might as well set the ceiling of the central dining room as high as the Himalayas, hang a row of gargantuan chandeliers from it, and, ignoring the constraints of stiletto heels and the possible tipsiness of their wearers, make diners descend into this gaudy banquet hall — and the maze of moody chambers around it — via a vertiginous staircase. He might as well dim the lights, crank up the hypnotic music and flood the zone with dozens of servers. He might as well try to leave Megu and Matsuri in the dust and Spice Market gasping for air. That seems to be the philosophy that Stephen Starr brought to Buddakan, a restaurant as flashy as any this city has seen. Buddakan is the apotheosis, at least for the next 60 seconds, of a distinct genre: the post-millennial urban mess hall as supersize cocktail lounge with superstylized dishes, which chart a far-out trip to the Far East. The specific cuisine in its sights  is Chinese, and the real surprise is how good many of Buddakan\\'s alternately faithful and fanciful interpretations of it are. A restaurant this sexy doesn\\'t need to be smart. But its chef, Michael Schulson, breathes intelligence and creativity into it. His mao poe tofu may be the most crazily addictive thing I\\'ve tasted in months. Cubes of silky bean curd act as crucial moments of calm in a wet, fiery mix of garlic, Thai chili peppers and, well, minced pork. If you want tofu to bust loose like this, you have to give it meat as well as heat. There\\'s an appealing spin on tuna tartare that actually manages to taste somewhat novel, with the diced big-eye tuna layered atop bits of poached egg in scallion oil. It comes on an undulating white plate that looks like a snowdrift. There\\'s also a nifty take on beef tartare, which has tapioca, mint and fish sauce in the mix. Cantonese spring rolls were so plump with shrimp and chicken and so crunchy on the outside that a companion who shared them with me was still raving about them a month later. She wasn\\'t saying much about the Peking duck, which lacked sufficiently crisp skin and notably tender flesh. But that\\'s the thing about Buddakan — more than a few losers keep company with the many winners. Buddakan, which opened in early March, has an identically named forebear in Philadelphia, where Mr. Starr operates 12 restaurants. He\\'s not so much testing the waters of New York as doing a headlong dive into them, and his chosen point of entry is the fringes of the meatpacking district, where the crush of fabulousness is getting a little confusing. Buddakan, with 275 seats for dining and about 50 more for drinking,  should not be confused with the unrelated Buddha-Bar, which just opened a few blocks to the south and can squeeze in at least as many people. Nor should it be confused with Morimoto, another Starr newcomer, which serves quasi-Japanese food on a similarly glitzy stage no more than a few hundred yards away. Entering Buddakan, you encounter a host station nearly as large — and often as thronged — as an airline check-in counter. The journey to your table takes you past what look like the lacquered windows of a Chinese temple to a red room or a teal room or maybe a shimmering gold \"library,\" its walls lined with fake books. Make a bid for the library, which is fittingly quieter than other areas. Order a cocktail called \"heat.\" Made with tequila, Cointreau and cucumbers muddled with a chili paste, it\\'s like a margarita with martial arts training — and it\\'s the only specialty drink I didn\\'t find too sweet. Among appetizers, avoid anything in the shape of a ball — meaning dumplings and fritters, which tended to be dull — with the exception of the sui mei. Each of them had a rich amalgam of crab meat and shrimp mousse on the inside and, on the outside, a tiara of additional crab meat. Consider the tartares, spring rolls or boneless pork spare ribs, sauced sweetly but not cloyingly. In a restaurant this mammoth, you don\\'t expect fish to be as beautifully cooked as Buddakan\\'s steamed red snapper, a dish cribbed  from the short-lived restaurant Yumcha in Greenwich Village. It was served with black fungus mushrooms and lily bulb, which had a pleasant bitterness. An equally moist steamed sole wore a glistening coat of oil infused with ginger and scallions. The kitchen dutifully rounded out more than a half-dozen seafood entrees with glazed black cod because, ever since Nobu, a splashy Asian restaurant has to. Mr. Schulson told me on the telephone that he serves about 80 orders of that cod, which happens to be excellent, a night. He serves about five of the mao poe tofu. The world is unjust. Tea-smoked chicken with a scallion and ginger chutney was about as tender as chicken gets. While various red meat entrees — pork belly, short ribs, lamb chops — were prepared with obvious care, they felt too rote. Among solid noodle and rice dishes, the standout was fried rice with a creamy congee of scallops on top. Like Mr. Schulson, the pastry chef, Daniel Skurnick, does work distinctive enough to compete with the décor. A \"crying chocolate\" cake wept delectable tears of white chocolate ganache, while intensely flavored sorbets of blood orange and ginger lemon grass were bedecked with fried ginger chips. Buddakan won\\'t please diners of all ages equally. It\\'s better suited to the young, and its own youth is crucial to its appeal. Restaurants like this tend to look junky upon fifth or sixth inspection, and it\\'s hard to believe this kitchen, serving so many diners at such a fleet pace, won\\'t show signs of strain over time. But for now it\\'s keeping up with the crowds — and providing more reason than many patrons need to teeter down those scary steps into a labyrinth that Kubla Khan would undoubtedly have found appetizing.'"
