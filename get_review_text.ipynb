       "  'review': 'READERS who look forward to the dark thrill of a public execution on days when there are no stars attached to this column should turn elsewhere to satisfy their blood lust. This is going to be a kind of love letter to a restaurant where the food is largely forgettable and the prices are almost always unwarranted. Years had gone by since I had last sat beneath the toy trucks and boxing gloves, the model airplanes and beer steins in the barroom at “21.” Too many years, I realized in March, when another reformed speakeasy in Midtown, Bill’s Gay Nineties, went out of business. I stopped by on its last night, annoyed with myself for how long it had been since my last drink there. Then, like a man who has just returned from a funeral, I checked in on some old acquaintances. The “21” Club is in no apparent danger, although its status as a corporate trophy is nervous-making. (Last week a luxury hotel group based in India made a takeover bid for its owner, a luxury hotel group based in London.) All the same, I put on a blazer, left the jeans and sneakers at home so I wouldn’t be turned away at the door, and went for dinner. Sadly, the future of “21” might be grim if it had to survive as a restaurant alone. To get the violence over quickly: a game platter, with venison, a boar chop, house-made bacon and rabbit sausage, was as cold as if it had been carried all the way from the hunting lodge. Caesar salad, exactly what you want to eat at “21,” was hopeless, the sliced romaine unevenly dressed and dumped on a plate with stale, dry croutons that might have come from a box. Creamed spinach was a rough paste of chopped greenery in a floury white sauce. That was the worst of it. Most of the food prepared under the chef, John Greeley, a 17-year veteran of “21,” was classic, unsuspenseful and solidly prepared, like the chilled shrimp with cocktail sauce, the grilled lamb chops, the salmon fillet and the steak tartare that wasn’t as neatly hacked up as it might have been but did hold a properly honed edge of mustard and pepper. I ate only four things at “21” that I’d go back for with any anticipation: the famous chicken hash, as creamy and agreeable as Jo Stafford’s voice; the “21” burger, blended with onions and thyme for a homey taste, like meatloaf without the bread; the coconut cake, topped with a beehive of white meringue and toasted coconut; and the olives in the martinis that are as cold as a walk along Park Avenue in January. But to judge “21” as a restaurant is to miss the point of the place. Like Galatoire’s in New Orleans, “21” is at its best when you treat the food as a solid foundation for the liquid entertainment. Take note of the first question you are asked at the table. It is not an offer of still or sparkling, as if you had gone out to dinner because you were tired of the bottled-water selection at home. No, servers at “21” lead off the way they should at all restaurants: “Can I get you something to drink?” On a good night, everybody who works at “21” behaves like a bartender, and the meal sails along on a river of alcohol and high spirits. The wine director, Phil Pratt, has a practiced theatricality and patter more often heard above the splash of gin than the gentle swirl of old Bordeaux. To feel out a customer’s budget, he might ask “How ... painful do you want it to be?” He is not above exploiting the dramatic possibilities of the silver tastevin swinging from his neck, filling it with a splash of Burgundy, lifting it to his lips, rocking back on his heels, popping his eyes and pursing his lips. Many sommeliers tell stories these days. Often they are the tales of ardent fans, and when the story gets to the part about meeting the winemaker, as such stories always seem to do, the sommelier will blush like a sixth grader who has Justin Bieber’s autograph on her backpack. None of that for Mr. Pratt. One night he brought one of Michel Chapoutier’s Rhône reds to a table and asked the diners there to feel the bottle. Mr. Chapoutier, he explained, had embossed his labels with Braille ever since he had poured his wines for a blind man. “And that man,” he said, pausing before the punch line, “was Ray Charles.” It probably didn’t happen that way, but you don’t interrupt an actor mid-monologue any more than you would forget to tip the attendant in the men’s room whom everybody calls the Rev. “Hello, young man,” he said to me one night, then embroidered on his lie. “It’s a good thing you brought your driver’s license, or you’d be drinking Coca-Cola.” By some logic I didn’t follow, this led to a warning that if I didn’t behave, they were going to ask Halle Berry to spank me, and of course she’d expect to be spanked in return. (Personal and confidential to Ms. Berry: I didn’t believe a word of this.) The Rev holds court among vintage pastel murals that depict men and women relieving themselves in complicated ways, scenes that were naughty once and will be bizarre forever. The sense of time travel in that room was intense and not always comfortable, and after a few minutes I felt the urgent need to get back to my table before a portal slammed shut and I was trapped in 1952. It’s not an experience I’d want every night, any more than I could regularly afford to pay $32 for a burger or $37 for chicken hash. But I’ll be back, because I have enough regrets already. I regret all the songs I could have belted out around the piano at Bill’s Gay Nineties. I regret the nights I didn’t tune in to hear the huge mahogany doors on Danny Stiles’s Art Deco penthouse swing shut as Mr. Stiles bid all his radio listeners “Good night, dear hearts.” I regret the rides I didn’t take on Checker cabs while they still prowled the avenues. I don’t want to add “21” to the list.',\n",

       "  'review': 'YES, Nougatine. You didn’t forget about it, did you? I hope not. So does Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who established it 15 years ago as the easygoing bistro next door to the demure elegance of Jean Georges, Audrey Tautou to the flagship’s Catherine Deneuve. Since then, New Yorkers have come to rely on Nougatine at Jean Georges, to give the name that nobody ever uses, for working lunches that could be expensed without waking up the auditors, yet they also tended to take it for granted. It has never been reviewed before in The New York Times, and it rarely comes up in conversations about favorite Vongerichten restaurants, although it is one of the most dependable. Part of the trouble is that it can be hard to say just what kind of place Nougatine is. There’s that slightly embarrassing name, which suggests a shop that sells chocolates or lingerie or maybe both. There’s the menu, roaming from burgers and fries to foie gras with a hotel-lobby inclusiveness. But the biggest reason Nougatine never quite emerged from the long shadow of its sister may have been its design, meant originally as a hotel lounge. Particularly after Jean Georges was brought up to date by the architect Thomas Juul-Hansen several years ago, Nougatine resembled an afterthought. It was as if Nougatine were meant to make the diners who passed through on their way to Jean Georges feel better about what they were about to spend, the way a glimpse past the curtains into the shantytown in the back of a plane reassures first-class passengers. Then in April, Mr. Vongerichten brought Mr. Juul-Hansen in to redo everything but the floors. Suddenly, Nougatine feels like a destination. It’s a livelier, more kinetic space than Jean Georges; there’s a long, mail-slot window into the kitchen where you can see the cooks, and often Mr. Vongerichten. A mirror right above the mail slot, and another window behind the cooks that looks out on Broadway, roughly doubles the energy at that end of the room. Gone now are the blocky woven-back chairs and the lounge tables that looked as if they’d been left behind by a percussionist on his way to a drum circle in Central Park. The furniture is more graceful now, with echoes of Charles and Ray Eames in the creamy leather chairs and walnut tabletops. There’s a bit of Rat Pack-era verve; the skinny pendant lights above the bar even look like smoldering cigarettes. (Nougatine’s newfound glamour is weakest at the low and awkward tables along the wall between the bar and the kitchen; after the hosts recognized me, they went to some lengths to avoid seating me there.) Despite Nougatine’s night-on-the-town gloss, though, the soul of the menu is not far from what you might cook at home — or, to be more realistic, what Mr. Vongerichten might cook if you came to his apartment on Perry Street. If the weather was hot, he might cut open a watermelon, whittle it down to cubes, arrange them in a circle like a pink Stonehenge, and scatter white fluffs of goat cheese all around. This almost preposterously simple appetizer soars above salad-bar level thanks to good green olive oil and a sly kick of cracked white pepper. After that, if you were effusive in your praise of Mr. Vongerichten’s collection of toasters, he might grill you a pork chop, then surround it with fruity habanero sauce made with cherries in early summer, or plums as fall nears. Comfortable as this down-home bone-in chop and this emphatically spicy condiment would feel in a home kitchen, they are almost unimaginable next door at Jean Georges. Nor would any restaurant of Jean Georges’s aspirations send out Nougatine’s massive, handsomely trimmed whole globe artichoke, as imposing as Vitali Klitschko’s fist, and ask you to pull it apart with your hands to dip leaves and bites of heart in a lemony, mustardy chervil mayonnaise. Too bad, because it’s a treat. A few dishes look so casual they seem to have been whipped up by Mr. Vongerichten and his chef de cuisine, Mark Lapico, after a morning run to the farmers’ market, like the crisp chicken breast with summer squash and very gently roasted tomatoes. Does it sound ordinary? Try making it yourself, then go to Nougatine and get back to me. On a menu as wide ranging as Nougatine’s, which must cater to guests in the Trump International Hotel upstairs, there must be a few slackers. I liked the idea of Cantonese-style salt-and-pepper lobster, and the warm cabbage slaw that came with it, more than I liked the chewy lobster meat itself. Still, that was a better use for the shellfish than the “lobster burger,” interred, bizarrely, under green chile mayonnaise and a blanket of melted Gruyère. And if a French-born chef serves fries, you expect more than the pale and not terribly crunchy ones at Nougatine. (For a refresher in how to cook a potato, look no further than the spectacularly crisped wedges that come with a good but unthrilling strip loin.) Since Johnny Iuzzini stepped down as pastry chef at Nougatine and Jean Georges last year, a successor, Joseph Murphy, has been settling in. His straightforward, American touch was most assured in an impressively fluffy sour cream cheesecake and in a group of ice cream sandwiches. But scraps of dough on a peach cobbler were pasty and floury, and I could never get a perfect spoonful out of a bowl of bland butterscotch pudding with heavily salted crème fraîche and bittersweet caramel. (Recent desserts at Jean Georges suggested that the changeover isn’t seamless there, either.) The redesign did nothing to change Nougatine’s weak spot, the wide runway to Jean Georges that cuts the dining room in half. Some intimacy and liveliness are lost, but something is gained, too: a front-row seat to the lavishly dressed parade of pilgrims. There are the gastrotourists, set to document the entire meal in photos; there are out-of-towners whose one big splurge this will be; there are women whose dresses and heels make you wonder exactly how long ago they met their dates. And then the parade is over, and the little dining room returns to normal. Like all successful restaurants in the grand old style, Jean Georges belongs to the world. But Nougatine belongs to New York.',\n",

       "  'review': 'IN restaurants, as in high school, popularity can be a burden. Just ask the host at Rosemary’s who was cheerfully trying to marshal the wildly oversubscribed waiting list the other night. (The list has been oversubscribed pretty much continuously since the restaurant opened in June.) In the kindest possible way, she tried to dissuade one member of my party from adding his name. Under strict orders from me, my emissary insisted, and finally succeeded. He was asked to come back in an hour. My group of three passed the next 60 minutes very agreeably in a bar down the street, and we returned at the appointed time. Our host apologized and said there was a group lingering over drinks at the table she’d meant for us, so we would need to wait just a little longer. And we did, standing out front, watching Villagers strut past the corner of West 10th Street and Greenwich Avenue. That was agreeable, too, for a while. But its delights were wearing thin 25 minutes later, when the host came out to say that the lingerers were still lingering. There was one table ready now, though. It was usually a two-top, she said with a wince, but since we’d been standing so long perhaps we’d like to take it? She was doing her best, but the whole situation could have been avoided, thanks to a miraculous advance in technology. Although it may sound like science fiction, a remarkable new device has the potential to change the way we communicate. It is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand yet powerful enough to enable you to place and receive calls wherever you happen to be — even inside a bar. Yes, the “cellular telephone,” or “cellphone” for short, is real, and it is available now. One day, the owners of Rosemary’s may discover that this futuristic gadget can be a handy method of notifying customers when a table is ready. At the moment, they seem to have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. There are reasons to put up with the list at the door, if not the restaurant’s technophobic method of handling it. First among them is the spirited cooking of Wade Moises, who learned to move gracefully around a scalding pot of spaghetti at Mario Batali’s finishing school. You can spot some of the headmaster’s knack for energetic flavors in Rosemary’s linguine, tossed with preserved lemon and threads of hot pickled chiles. I’ve never met a dish of pasta more deeply infused with the sunny brightness of citrus. Nearly as satisfying, but in a richer, porkier mode, was the chitarra alla carbonara with meaty strips of guanciale. But with just four pastas on the menu, there should be no room for disappointments like the gummy house-made cavatelli with starchy, crunchy peas. Mr. Moises is adept at working vegetables and seafood into antipasti that bring your appetite to attention. With a spicy dressing of grated pecorino and pickled onions, he can make a treat out of slices of raw zucchini, typically as thrilling as an ice chip. The house-cured tuna is more voluptuous than cooked tuna has any right to be, and cold shrimp tossed with mint, jalapeño and ginger shows Mr. Moises knows when to color outside the lines. At nearly every table, some wise person has ordered the porchettina, sawed-off columns of brined and roasted pork loin standing upright like the ruins of a Roman temple. The main-course-size minestra di stagione didn’t seem to tempt as many diners, but it should. On the night I tasted it, elbow macaroni shared the bowl with sugar snap peas, young turnips, asparagus as thin as a knitting needle, purple carrots and cherry tomatoes, each vegetable cooked to its ideal point, all of them in a vegetable broth that was gentle but persuasive. The menu bills it as “the ultimate minestrone,” and the hyperbole is not far from the mark. The cherry tomatoes in the soup, along with the ones in a very pretty tomato salad, were ripened in the Greenwich Village sun that beats down on a kitchen garden on the roof. The restaurant’s owner, Carlos Suarez, who also runs BoBo nearby, seems rather proud of this. The words “Rooftop Farm” are printed on the menu, right below the name, and servers always mention the provenance of those tomatoes. Most of the produce could have been procured at any farmers’ market, but the urban agrarian notion does seem to have provided a theme for the décor. The interiors firm Dekar Design flirts with rustic-Italian clichés without falling too hard for them. Parquet tables sit on parquet floors below exposed rafters; glass doors are thrown wide open in warm weather; potted plants are everywhere. The place has the feel of a trellised patio in some corner of Italy that’s heavily populated by Upper East Siders, the women wearing expensive rings, the men wearing even more expensive watches. I skulked through this slender crowd feeling like a beagle among greyhounds. Many of those greyhounds look as if they could afford to pay far more than Rosemary’s asks: each vegetable antipasto is $5; the pastas are $14 or less. Given the quality, these are impressively low prices, and they provide another possible justification for the lines. There are exceptions, though. One is the bistecca gran mela for two, a dry-aged strip steak served on the bone, for $80. It isn’t nearly as flavorful as the skirt steak, which provides a much more pronounced beefiness and, at $22, costs about half as much for a serving. Rosemary’s wine list has a gimmick that seems to promise good deals: there are 40 wines, all for $40. That price feels comfortable until you find out how many of those wines can be picked up in stores for $12 or less. (If you want a reasonable return on your $40, try the 2010 Lia Vi Barbera d’Asti from Carussin; the 2009 Marzemino from Costaripa; or the 2007 Capitel Foscarino from Anselmi.) If I felt some chagrin at paying $40 for the kinds of bottles that might be opened at an office party, most of it melted away under the influence of the summer breezes and the servers’ ready smiles. Just think how charming Rosemary’s could be if it took reservations or, failing that, if cellphones ever catch on.',\n",

Is that Martin Amis?) so I could polish them off all by myself? It clearly has something to do with the way all the luxuriously soft qualities of confited artichokes are wrapped inside those crunchy fried leaves and hearts, and just as much to do with that sauce, a creamy aioli with force-multiplying jabs of anchovy. Nor did I swoon at the arrival of La Vara’s fideuà, thin noodles cooked paella fashion in a seafood broth. Brown, broken and floppy, the noodles look like a halfhearted attempt to disguise last night’s pasta. All leftovers should fare so well. Surrounded by tiny squid, clams and shrimp, cooked until done and not an instant longer, the fideuà tastes a little like toasted durum wheat and a lot like the dripping-wet haul from a Valencian fishing net. La Vara is the newest vessel in the small and nimble Spanish armada commanded by Alex Raij and her husband and co-chef, Eder Montero. Txikito and El Quinto Pino in Manhattan, which make up the rest of their fleet, have done much to broaden the range of Spanish flavors in the city. With La Vara, Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero are exploring new territory, the vast legacy of the Jews and Muslims who shared the Iberian Peninsula with Christians for centuries. This three-way marriage, known as la convivencia, had its tensions, and the breakup was ugly, but it did wonderful things for the country’s kitchens. Its imprint on Spain’s cuisine isn’t always evident. La Vara urges, and rewards, a closer inspection. During their long rule of Spain, as Claudia Roden writes in “The Food of Spain,” the Muslims introduced ingredients that remain staples, like rice, artichokes, eggplants, bitter oranges, cumin and saffron. They brought skewers, noodles (fideuà comes from an Arabic word for pasta, al-fidawsh), the shatteringly crisp savory pastries known as bricks and chickpea-spinach stews. All are on offer at La Vara. I’m not convinced that sweet-and-savory chopped greens with pine nuts and currants are the ideal stuffing for a brick. But grilled chicken hearts made plenty of sense on a skewer, and while they could have been more tender, their pepper, caraway and coriander seed seasoning was inviting, as was the herb salad alongside, vibrant with lime. Another gift from the Moors was deep-fried fish, a term that doesn’t suggest just how delicious the long ribbons of fried, marinated, pimentón-dusted skate called raya en adobo turn out to be. But is La Vara good for the Jews? The history of Jewish cooking in Spain is fraught, to put it mildly, especially after 1492, when Ferdinand and Isabella compelled the Jews to convert or leave the kingdom. Converts were often watched for suspiciously pork-free kitchens and smoke-free chimneys on the Sabbath. Forced into hiding, Spanish-Jewish cuisine virtually disappeared. Traces remain, though, and Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero have excavated some of them. Those fried artichokes, for instance, may remind you of the carciofi alla giudea placed in the Roman repertory by Sephardic Jews. One of La Vara’s two best desserts is an almond cake called Torta de Santiago. Thought to be Jewish in origin, it survived in, of all places, Catholic convents. Understandably, La Vara skips the cake’s traditional ornament, a cross outlined in sugar. (The other standout is the Egipcio, an improved Pop-Tart with date-and-walnut paste inside an exquisitely tender semolina shortbread.) The restaurant doesn’t force-feed you any of this history, not in menu footnotes or in carefully memorized tableside lectures. What most people will notice is simply how inviting the place is behind its glass storefront, brick walls glowing under white light, and how it manages to feel intimate without feeling cramped. At any given table, the plates are scattered all over, because La Vara serves most things as small tapas-size dishes. \\xa0Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn’t. If the bar isn’t crowded and time isn’t tight, you could certainly stop for a glass of fino sherry and crunch on a dish of excellent fried chickpeas, a marvelously crisp and creamy croqueta or a single oil-cured sardine under sliced radish pickles. But the pleasures of eating tapas-style can get lost at a table for four, where you may find that just as you realize how much you’re enjoying a dish, the person next to you has managed to stab the last forkful. (See the Amis stratagem, above.) When will New York restaurants stop peddling the myth of “small plates meant for sharing”? Small plates are meant for hoarding. This might be why the most satisfying meal I had here was at a table for two. (If you have eaten out in the last decade, you can guess that while the prices at La Vara may seem low, the check won’t.) In truth, I was content to let others finish a few items at La Vara, including the strange stewed bacon sandwiches, the thin and meek ajo blanco with strands of squid, and the braised beef tongue in a watery tomato-caper sauce. But such dishes were far outnumbered by the ones I competed avidly for. If the griddled red shrimp came 12 to an order instead of 2, I could have eaten them all, and sucked the bittersweet juice from the head of each one. And I need to return for a second run at the pasta called gurullos, if only to figure out how any pasta can be as fluffy as an Italian grandmother’s prizewinning gnocchi. La Vara, by the way, was the name of a Jewish newspaper published in New York until it ceased in 1948. It was written in Ladino, a Castilian-Hebrew hybrid that was to Spain what Yiddish was to Eastern Europe. The language has all but vanished from the city, but it remains on the headstones of Sephardic graveyards in Queens and the Bronx, out in plain sight for those who know where to look.',\n",

       "  'review': 'IF you are one of those people who believes that ingredients should always be treated with respect, by all means stay away from Biang!, an excitable name for a frequently exciting new restaurant in Flushing, Queens. Before they arrive in the dining room, the biang biang noodles, a specialty of the house and its namesake, are punished in ways that might have unnerved the Spanish Inquisition. They are repeatedly swung up and down through the air, slapped on a table, ripped right down the center and then dropped in boiling water. After handling like that, the final application of searing chile oil must come as a relief. When you eat those noodles, you might suffer, too, but only for a minute. Even if you have little fear of spices, the chile oil can bead your forehead with perspiration and make you blink back tears. Then you emerge on the other side, wide awake and energized, and you understand that the abuse in the kitchen helped make those noodles that much more fun to eat. All that swinging and slapping stretches them until they are so long that when you lift one from the bowl to your mouth, it seems to go on forever, like a magician’s handkerchief. Even better, ripping the noodles gives them ragged edges that hang on to any nearby sauce. You will want to hang on to those sauces, too. The one called “spicy and tingly beef with wide hand-ripped noodles” brings the hypnotic pairing of chiles and Sichuan peppercorn to bits of deeply concentrated braised beef. “Spicy and sour diced pork meat,” meanwhile, is a sauce that revels in oppositions: the sharp edge of black vinegar versus the supple fattiness of pork, the soothing spice-cake flavor of star anise against the fury of roasted dried chiles. Then there is the biang biang dish that almost everyone gets, lamb noodles seasoned with longhorn peppers and with cumin so intensely fragrant that it seems to penetrate every taste bud you have. Like everything at Biang!, the lamb noodles are a specialty of Xian, the ancient city in central China. The recipes come from David Shi, a native of Xian, who recreated them from his memories of cooking with his grandfather before moving to the United States in 1998. Biang! is essentially a cleaner, brighter, more modern sit-down version of Mr. Shi’s food stall inside the Golden Shopping Mall, an extremely ramshackle food court on Main Street in Flushing. He named the stall Xi’an Famous Foods. This may have been wishful thinking at first, when as far as most New Yorkers were concerned, Xian was famous only as the home base of the emperor who ordered up an army of terra-cotta soldiers and horses to keep him company after his death, in 210 B.C. But famous is what the food of Xi’an became, and quickly, because Mr. Shi’s cooking was so vibrant and his recipes so novel to customers who did not grow up in China. His menu was drawn from all over Xian. Lamb soup came from the Muslim Quarter. The biang biang noodles are served in innumerable casual shops. Another noodle, called liang pi, is a street food as common in Xian as the hot dog in Manhattan, said Mr. Shi’s son, Jason Wang. Cool, smooth, chewy ribbons of steamed wheat starch, liang pi are tossed with wrinkled tablets of house-made seitan and a head-clearing dose of stoplight-red chile oil. As Xi’an Famous Foods accrued a following, Mr. Wang, then a business student in college, began to help his father. He set up a Web site and led an expansion into Manhattan, where there are now three branches. Biang! is their latest move forward, a place where people Mr. Wang’s age might be happy to hang out and eat dishes that their grandparents would remember. The menu at Xi’an Famous Foods is the template of the one at Biang!, with some additions. There is now a whole page of skewers, like grilled cumin lamb and tofu skin (surprisingly flavorful in a nutty sauce of fermented tofu and sesame paste). The standout skewer, though, holds one meaty grilled chicken wing with salty, peppery, crunchy skin and sweet, smoky flesh. The other skewers cost $3 for three; the wings are $2 each. Laudably, the prices as Biang! follow the heroically low ones at Xi’an Famous Foods, a nice surprise considering how much more attractive the space is. Mr. Wang designed it, liberally taking cues from downtown Manhattan places like the Momofuku restaurants. Light comes from hanging Edison bulbs, and you sit on polished wood benches at polished wood tables. There are tunes by Beyoncé and Kanye West, and enigmatic propaganda-style prints of pandas by the Singapore artist William Chua. The transition from stall to restaurant has not been seamless. The servers’ notions of what it means to clear a table may not coincide with your own, and the kitchen can appear to struggle with the pace. One night, spaghetti-like strands of cold buckwheat noodles with cilantro and scallions were doused with mercilessly pungent mustard oil that stampeded its way into nasal passages I didn’t know I had. On another visit, I could barely taste the mustard oil. My suggested strategy is to order an extra dish or two, just in case. Get the cold tofu in chile oil with pickled vegetables and get the crisp, zippily dressed lotus root salad. Get the improbably elegant canapés of rough-hewn pork sausage topped with fried quail eggs, and by all means get the juicy lamb dumplings in hot-and-sour broth. And even though they are served on a bun without much flavor of its own, get either the cumin lamb sandwiches or, even better, the chopped pork belly sandwiches. In my case, the order-too-much strategy ended when dessert began. A cold egg drop soup made with fermented rice was vaguely beery and very peculiar, like a home brewer’s first batch. The one sweet I truly enjoyed was steamed sticky rice with sesame seeds and jujubes, which are not the jaw-fatigue-inducing candy, but fruits that look like olives and taste a little like dates. (Watch the pits, though.) There are many ways to adapt the cuisine of immigrants to a new country. But the father-and-son team at Biang! have hit on a model worth imitating: keep the recipes and the prices the same, and buy nicer furniture.',\n",

He talks a lot. They laugh a lot. As the night moves along, both women hand him their cards. Their friendship had better be strong. It may soon face an awkward test. One of the cast members of \"Queer Eye for the Straight Guy\" arrives, a pretty and chattering posse around him, and claims a prime piece of real estate in the main dining room. The designer David Rockwell passes the group as he leaves. He didn\\'t contrive the cool, clean, white-on-white look of Morimoto (an architect named Tadao Ando did), but he probably feels compelled to check it out. It\\'s a stunning piece of work: a sparkly wonderland for glittery people, who always get the word and always hop onboard. They drink their bright cocktails, fiddle with their chopsticks, survey their compatriots and tap-tap into their cellphones and other devices, presumably checking on the whereabouts of less fortunate friends, perhaps informing them that the place to be is right here, right now. It\\'s Morimoto\\'s moment. Stephen Starr\\'s, too. He\\'s a Philadelphia restaurateur in the midst of an ambitious Manhattan transfer. In late January he opened this 12,000-square-foot restaurant, which is named for, and modeled after, a sibling in the City of Brotherly Love. It was followed this month by Buddakan, another Philadelphia import, another visually bedazzling behemoth, just a few hundred feet away. Both restaurants bet on a proven formula of Asian-inflected food, thoroughly tricked-out digs, theatrical presentations and pure buzz, although Morimoto has an additional ace up its sleeve. Masaharu Morimoto, a Nobu alumnus familiar to viewers of \"Iron Chef,\" put together the menu, supervises the cooking and, at least for now, can be seen caroming around the open kitchen and into the dining rooms to greet guests. He never stands still, and neither does his menu, which zooms across national and continental borders. It presents the culinary equivalent of a round-the-world ticket. It also sets up the possibility of gastronomic jet lag. A vast selection of very fine sushi and sashimi roots the restaurant in Japan, which also asserts itself in preparations of Kobe-style beef, in tofu and noodle dishes, and in the recurrence of shiso, miso, wasabi and sudachi. But other dishes and ingredients branch out to other parts of Asia, and even to Europe and Latin America. Among the best appetizers I tried was a \"tuna pizza\" with raw bluefin tuna, jalapeño, red onion, olives and an anchovy aioli atop a crisp, thin tortilla. I also liked silky slices of \"lamb carpaccio,\" dressed with Japanese green onions, grated ginger and garlic oil. But I was confounded by a vegetable tempura that was clobbered by a Gorgonzola dip. From Italy it was off to China and France, mingled in an entree called \"duck, duck, duck.\" Why, why, why? Because it was a multifaceted fowl, roasted Peking style. The crisp-skinned, moist leg was served whole, while carved breast meat went into an unpleasantly soggy sandwich made with slices of cucumber and a foie gras-infused croissant. A gooey duck egg, placed between a patch of red miso sauce and a pool of port wine-flavored duck jus, completed the excessively busy composition. The appeal of the dishes at Morimoto, like their ethnic associations, was all over the place, due in part to their frantic nature and in part to the kitchen\\'s uneven performance. Rock shrimp tempura, half of the shrimp bathed in a wasabi aioli, half in a Korean red pepper sauce, were light and sweet. Black cod with a ginger and soy reduction and a spicy half chicken with roasted red and green finger peppers had tender flesh, and a delicate touch had been applied to the poached lobster in a wonderful salad with yellow beets, cauliflower and a soy beurre blanc. But a roasted lobster was overcooked, as was just about all of the shellfish, including shrimp and crab, in a Japanese bouillabaisse with a red miso broth that turned out, by default, to be the highlight of the dish. And limp ribbons of beef in a soy and mirin broth tasted as if they had been adrift in hot water three times longer than they should have been. Even more troubling than the unevenness was the way high concept repeatedly supplanted sound judgment, resulting in dishes more amusing to behold than to ingest. The utensils provided for appetizers of toro and hamachi tartare were wood sticks not unlike tongue depressors in their feel and lingering taste. The tartare was accompanied by a beautiful but exasperating spectrum of colorful condiments and herbs (an avocado purée, crème fraîche, micro radish sprouts, wasabi and so on) arranged in contiguous bands so slender that it was nearly impossible to isolate any one from another. The \"Morimoto sashimi,\" terrine-like cubes made from layers of hamachi, smoked salmon, barbecued eel and seared toro, was luscious and hugely flavorful, but which of five colorful liquids in five gimmicky pipettes should be used to anoint it? There wasn\\'t enough fish to make it possible to try all of the sauces and then circle back to a favorite one. Although plenty expensive, Morimoto is an often undisciplined restaurant, prone to silliness and crammed with servers whose extraordinary friendliness didn\\'t mask their mistakes. One night I arrived just a few minutes after three companions. When I checked in with the host station, I wasn\\'t told they had been seated, and I went to wait in the spare, sleek lounge downstairs. I kept asking servers if they had arrived, and my companions kept asking about me. For 35 minutes Morimoto never managed to connect us. But it has its luxe pleasures, including a serious array of not only sake but also shochu. It has its courtesies, like tables with ample space between them and a noise level kept somewhat in check by translucent partitions and by wavy white sheets of canvas and fiberglass on the ceiling and along the walls. And it has its amusements, some of them related to the paces apparently required of large-scale Japanese restaurants making a run at a fickle downtown crowd. There must be a signature design element. Morimoto\\'s is a two-story internal wall, which is made from water bottles and resembles a gargantuan sheet of illuminated Bubble Wrap. There should be arresting restrooms, and Morimoto\\'s take automation beyond the function of mere flushing. Step into a stall and the lid on the toilet rises to greet you. A sense of humor, a sense of style and definite sex appeal: Morimoto has all of these, along with the crowd they bring. If only more of the food lived up to the frisson.

       "  'review': 'YOU can look at the new P. J. Clarke\\'s in downtown Manhattan as an unremarkable illustration of the laws of supply and demand, as an economics lesson writ boozy and caloric. It puts broad slabs of beef, tall mounds of carbohydrates, stiff drinks and an atavistically musky atmosphere in the paths of hungry financial types, who have been known to respond to such things. Or you can take a dimmer view and see a dark capitalist allegory, a validation of the idea that no rarity is safe from replication or protected from conversion into a kind of franchise divorced from any particular place and time. For many decades, there was only one P. J. Clarke\\'s, and it was one of a kind. It occupied (and still occupies) a squat building in the East 50\\'s, a loud and proud saloon, dating back more than a century, where Scotch would never cede territory to flavored vodka. At P. J.\\'s you often didn\\'t glance at a menu. You glanced at the blackboard, and if you couldn\\'t read what was scrawled there, it meant you\\'d had too many pints or tumblers and should probably quit -- after one or two more. P. J.\\'s trafficked in its own singular history. Nat King Cole had a charge account there. Johnny Mercer supposedly wrote the hit song \"One for My Baby\" on a napkin at the bar. Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy had a favorite table and, of course, dibs on it. The new P. J.\\'s, a roughly 220-seat leviathan called P. J. Clarke\\'s on the Hudson, certainly has history around it. The space it inhabits in Battery Park City, in a building complex that\\'s also home to Merrill Lynch and American Express workers and a Starbucks with the longest midafternoon coffee lines I\\'ve ever seen, became available after 9/11 displaced businesses in the area. But P. J. Clarke\\'s on the Hudson owes just as much to an impulse to peddle the P .J.\\'s mystique beyond its cradle. There\\'s money in these initials, and the East Side isn\\'t the only place to make it. Philip Scotti, who put together the group of investors that took over the original P. J.\\'s in 2002, and who is also an owner of its spawn, said in a telephone conversation that he has plans to keep the brood growing. He\\'s all but finalized a deal to put a P. J.\\'s near Lincoln Center. He\\'s had thoughts about Washington, and he\\'s had 10 copies of the original\\'s famously oversize, winged porcelain urinals made, at a total cost of about $80,000. Ten was the minimum order that a special ceramics manufacturer in Ohio would accept, he said. Two of these urinals were installed in the new P. J.\\'s. Four pairs remain. P. J.\\'s could be the first restaurant chain with a destiny manifestly influenced by lavatory flourishes. In terms of food, the new P. J.\\'s, like the old P. J.\\'s, positions itself as an uncomplicated crowd pleaser. It\\'s an American steakhouse (shrimp cocktail, iceberg wedge, T-bone for two, creamed spinach, cheesecake), a British pub (fish and chips, shepherd\\'s pie), a brasserie (roasted chicken, steak tartare, oysters, other raw bar selections) and a diner (meatloaf, turkey club, corned beef Reuben) all wrapped into one. It\\'s better than snobs would like to think and worse than contrarians would hasten to claim, which may be another way of saying that it\\'s usually serviceable and sometimes respectable. It does nothing spectacularly well. It does some things badly. Its baked macaroni and cheese, almost stiff enough to be hoisted from its bowl in one clump, should be called macaroni and an unconfirmed rumor of cheese, and even that might be overstating dairy\\'s role in the affair. For their part clams had seemingly minimized their involvement in a chowder named for them. Other dishes betrayed their pedigrees or purposes in other ways. A Caesar salad was insufficiently salty and excessively watery. French fries were stony, mashed potatoes pasty, lump crabmeat chalky. But apart from that crab, the raw bar selections, including chilled lobster, chilled shrimp, littleneck clams and cherrystone clams, suggested that P. J.\\'s was finding good ingredients and, in the cases of the lobster and shrimp, cooking them well. It\\'s the kind of restaurant at which you can have a satisfying meal if you manage to hit the bright spots and avoid the dark ones. Heading toward the light means getting a 16-ounce rib-eye or that 36-ounce T-bone, both slightly charred, very juicy and just fatty enough when I tried them. It means crab cakes, moist, rich and more crabby than crumbly, which too often isn\\'t the case. It means burgers, of course, which were plump and tender, though not exceptionally so. (Forget the béarnaise burger, which layered a gratuitous glob of undistinguished adornment on something that didn\\'t need it.) And it means, for dessert, either rice pudding or a \"chocolate chip cookie soufflé,\" which wasn\\'t much of a soufflé at all. It tasted like a chocolate chip cookie dough mousse, if such a thing can be said to exist. Come warmer weather, these modest treats can be savored al fresco, and the views of the harbor and the Statue of Liberty, discernible now through a long wall of windows, will be even more striking. P. J. Clarke\\'s on the Hudson has a generous amount of outdoor space that will accommodate some 275 additional seats. For now lunch and dinner are served indoors at tables with red-and-white checkered cloths. There\\'s a black-and-white tiled floor, blackboards aplenty and dark wood galore. These motifs evoke the original without capturing its spirit or tapping into its myth. Light-filled, gleaming and so vast that the walk between the front tables and the bathrooms is almost a day\\'s worth of cardio, this P. J.\\'s feels too polished, too mass-market, like an upbeat Beyoncé cover of a downbeat Billie Holiday classic. Mr. Scotti said he could envision a P. J.\\'s in Las Vegas. It\\'s no longer such a stretch. P.J. Clarke\\'s on the Hudson  SATISFACTORY  4 World Financial Center, near intersection of Vesey Street and the West Side Highway; (212) 285-1500. ATMOSPHERE -- A musky midpoint between steakhouse and pub in an incredibly long space with about 220 indoor seats, a wall of windows and a view, in the distance, of Lady Liberty.  SOUND LEVEL -- Booming when crowded and only slightly less so when not, because of overloud music.  RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Raw seafood samplers; tomato and blue cheese salad; pigs in a blanket; burger with bacon and cheese; rib-eye steak; porterhouse for two; rice pudding; chocolate chip cookie soufflé.  WINE LIST -- Relatively short, fairly conservative and almost entirely American, with many bottles for under $50.

       "  'review': 'THE new restaurant Barbounia is very easy on the eyes, relatively easy on the ears and not so bad on the stomach, either. But it\\'s kindest of all to another part of the body, which is less delicately evoked and most often consigned to euphemism. How to put this into appropriately fuzzy language? Let\\'s just say that no matter where inside Barbounia you sit and no matter how long you sit there, you will feel cushioned, coddled and grateful. The barstools actually have some give, descending a few inches when you put your full weight on them. Chairs in the dining room are broad, soft and upholstered. Banquettes are pillow-paloozas, as suitable for napping as for noshing. In a city where diners\\' physical comfort often gets too little consideration, Barbounia is practically a massage of a restaurant, and its magic fingers reflect a broader eagerness to please. That attitude doesn\\'t always work in the restaurant\\'s favor. Barbounia\\'s Mediterranean menu smacks of a bit too much market research and a bit too little inspiration. Although the restaurant\\'s most obvious geographic allegiances are to Greece and Turkey, the cartography is permissive enough to encompass Italy, a more reliable culinary draw. There are categories on the dinner menu for cured meats and for Italian cheeses, and the carbophobe intent on simply prepared slabs of protein will find a category (\"from the grill\") for those, too. There\\'s a crudo dish -- in this case, yellowfin tuna -- among the appetizers, and there are sunchokes and polenta among the sides. These strategic inclusions may be the right recipe for popular success, but they render Barbounia less distinctive than it could have been. You relish and remember the sitting in part because it\\'s easy to forget the eating, which is often appealing but seldom exciting, cause for little smiles rather than big sighs. That Barbounia works as well as it does is in many ways surprising, given the turmoil before its November opening. The original chef, Matthew Accarrino, departed, and at the last minute Michael Cressotti, who worked as a corporate chef at Sushi Samba, was put at the helm. At least Mr. Cressotti was literally familiar with the waters. Years ago he worked at Patria, the nuevo Latino exemplar that inhabited this space. Barbounia\\'s food is less ambitious than its predecessor\\'s, and the dishes vary widely in appeal. It\\'s the kind of restaurant best navigated with detailed instructions. For a starter, try a grilled kebab of minced beef and minced lamb. Why did it summon memories of meatballs? Because there was parsley and Parmesan in the mix. Why did it taste so big and rich? Because there was lamb fat as well. Or go for saganaki, a pool of molten kasseri cheese. Does hot liquid cheese ever disappoint? If it isn\\'t something like Velveeta, the answer is no, and Barbounia cinches that verdict by adding a bevy of dark bread and an array of bright fruit -- apples, grapes, pomegranates -- to the equation. This restaurant knows how to assemble a nice spread, be it cheese or salumi. It understands the value of a good visual. But it stumbles in other regards. Marrow bones were awash in a reduction of red wine and veal stock that competed with the marrow instead of complementing it. A mushroom moussaka needed more seasoning and less eggplant, and a Greek salad needed a twist or a tweak of some kind, especially when the price tag was $12. A risotto entree with braised duck, butternut squash, cinnamon and truffle oil was blander than those ingredients suggested it would be, though Barbounia deserves credit for not going bonkers with the truffle oil, as so many restaurants trying to take easy routes to emphatic flavor payoffs do. Pan-seared veal medallions were tough during several visits. Rabbit braciola is a better bet. As with so many rabbit dishes, the rabbit seemed incidental; joking aside, the meat could almost have been chicken, except it wouldn\\'t have sounded as lofty on the menu. It looked fancy on the plate. To the right was a cylinder of loin wrapped in Serrano ham. To the left was slow-cooked, shredded leg meat in a shell of phyllo dough: Bugs in a blanket. Both components were terrific. As for chicken, Barbounia\\'s was moist, bathed in a lemon and rosemary sauce and served with a saffron orzo. But the restaurant excelled in particular at seafood, and that was fitting: its name is a reference to red mullet, which it serves as a crispy-skinned appetizer. It serves crispy-skinned red snapper as an entree, and on most nights it also presents the possibility of grilled dourade, branzino or pompano. All of this fish was impeccably cooked. Desserts, which include a yogurt panna cotta with elderflower syrup and a caramelized banana tart with sour cream ice cream, were less impressive. But if you order Turkish coffee, you are treated to a delightful flourish. The coffee arrives in a tiny brass pot with a crazily long, curved handle. There\\'s a lot about Barbounia that draws and pleases the eye: an open kitchen more tidily and theatrically framed than many an open kitchen is; shimmering blue tiles in the bathroom area; glass shelves along the big windows behind the bar; a whimsical, feathery chandelier that looks like a gargantuan version of Bjork\\'s famous Oscar dress. Gauzy drapery here, there and everywhere conspires with archways and rounded pillars to effect an Ottoman-style opulence. All of this fabric serves an additional purpose, absorbing and muffling noise, and represents another example of this restaurant\\'s rare thoughtfulness. Barbounia conjures enough atmospheric pizazz to wind you up while paying enough attention to basic creature comforts to let you wind down. It\\'s no major culinary event, but it\\'s an unusually pampering perch. Barbounia  * [Rating: One Star]  250 Park Avenue South (20th Street); (212) 995-0242.

       "  'review': 'FOOD lovers who live in Brooklyn, especially food lovers who moved there from Manhattan, love to say that they have better restaurants, ones that wed equally fine food to a humility often absent in the taller, shinier, haughtier borough across the water. Sometimes these people are simply falling prey to local pride and grading on a generous curve. Other times they\\'re talking about Al di Là. I resisted Al di Là for a good long while. One reason was practical: it doesn\\'t take reservations, and I wasn\\'t wild about traveling to Park Slope to wait an hour or more for a table, which can happen if you visit at a prime time on a weeknight or just about any time on a weekend. Another reason was journalistic: the charms of Al di Là weren\\'t exactly secrets (hence those waits), so what purpose did a fresh look serve? But the main reason was pure stubbornness: so many Brooklyn friends were so smug in asserting that this little Italian gem was the ideal neighborhood restaurant. Even if they were right, I didn\\'t want to grant them that. I hereby grant it, and I sing the praises of Al di Là, sung so many times before, because it deserves the music. Because there are food lovers from outside Brooklyn who have never been, and Al di Là is worth a trip. Because occasional chatter that it has grown tired and sloppy after more than seven years of extraordinary popularity needs to be corrected. It hasn\\'t. True, Anna Klinger and Emiliano Coppa, the wife-and-husband, American-and-Italian couple who own and run Al di Là, haven\\'t changed the menu all that much since they opened it in late 1998, but why should they? What was described as great then was great when I tried it over recent months, and the restaurant\\'s fans would justifiably squawk if something like the casunziei, a dish of house-made ravioli, disappeared. It\\'s not a complicated dish, and it\\'s an important reminder, like so much at Al di Là, that Italian food doesn\\'t need to be fancied up or elaborately fussed over to rise to a high level. The ravioli are stuffed with a blend of roasted beets and ricotta, then coated with melted butter and poppy seeds. Both times I had them, they were impeccably cooked, firm but not hard, pliant but not mushy, with pillowy insides and a rich, vaguely grainy gloss. Al di Là has also been doing its tripe appetizer since the beginning, and I hope it will do its tripe appetizer until the end. Blissfully slimy and appropriately chewy, the tripe is cooked and served in a bath of white wine, soffritto and tomatoes, with grilled peasant bread that you can, and should, use to mop up the liquid remnants. Al di Là prods and trusts you to eat adventurously by presenting that tripe; other appetizers of salt cod and bagna cauda; and entrees of calf\\'s liver, basted with butter and sage as it finishes roasting, and rabbit, braised in white wine and chicken stock. But you can also play it safe. On a given night, the half-dozen appetizers are likely to include steamed mussels and carpaccio. The half-dozen pasta and risotto dishes will probably include tagliatelle with a chunky, immensely flavorful ragù of ground beef, pork and veal. And among the half-dozen entrees will be pan-roasted hanger steak served with a balsamic-sweetened sauce and grilled young chicken, tart with lemon juice. Over the past year, Al di Là has been preparing a terrific dish of pan-roasted cod, wild striped bass or hake, depending on the night, with hen-of-the-woods mushrooms and plenty of butter. Al di Là is unabashed about butter, embracing it in a way that many Italian restaurants in New York don\\'t but that\\'s consistent with the cooking in some areas of northern Italy, which is this restaurant\\'s compass. There was a browned butter and sage sauce, for example, over house-made tortelli filled with squash. During my visits the kitchen usually exhibited remarkable precision. A risotto special, made with cuttlefish and cuttlefish ink, had a textbook texture - the elusive sweet spot between gloppy and soupy. But there were missteps. That rabbit, bedecked with olives, was tender the second time I had it, but stringy the first. The chicken, which I sampled once, was dry. Al di Là has additional shortcomings, including desserts of widely varying success. While the gianduiotto, an amalgam of chocolate ice cream, hazelnuts and whipped cream, was out of this world, a ricotta tart was earthbound. Servers can become harried and distracted, and then there\\'s the anxiety-making threat or reality of a long wait. I usually avoided it by going on a weeknight before 7. If you can\\'t do that, know that about two years ago Al di Là annexed a space with an entrance around the corner and turned it into a pleasant wine bar where you can bide your time. The restaurant presents its food on plates that are pretty but mismatched and sometimes chipped, and that seems just right. The dining room isn\\'t dramatic, but it\\'s comfy and warm, with big windows, a combination of lovely yellow wallpaper and exposed brick on the walls, one set of red striped drapes inside the entrance and another framing a passageway to the kitchen. It can feel romantic, which is why you see so many young couples, heads bowed toward each other. It can feel homey, which is why you see solo diners and families with young children. You see a diverse community of people united by a desire to eat extremely well without preciousness or daunting prices, but you don\\'t really see a neighborhood restaurant, at least not anymore. Al di Là, whose name is a kind of Italian double entendre, referring literally to \"the other side\" and figuratively to the great beyond, beckons and rightfully attracts food lovers from far and wide, their local prejudices trumped by its universal appeal.

       "  'review': 'IF you\\'ve ever been to Pylos or heard its fans talk about it, you know that one detail literally above all others defines it. The clay\\'s the thing. It\\'s what more than 1,000 unglazed pots attached to the restaurant\\'s ceiling are made of. They hang upside down, dramatic and seemingly perilous, drawing your eye and maybe even making you feel a little chicken. This sky really does look as if it could fall. This restaurant would never let that happen. Pylos has been put together with considerable care and operates with unusual grace, a conscientious ambassador of Greek cooking and a standout in the East Village, where the dining scene has improved over the last few years. Pylos (pronounced pee-LOHS), which roughly means \"things of clay,\" opened in 2003, replacing a more casual restaurant called It\\'s Greek to Me. The seriousness of its intent is clear in its pedigree. The owner, Christos Valtzoglou, hired Diane Kochilas, a widely recognized authority on Greek cuisine, as the consulting chef. Her cookbooks are on display. Her full name is on the menu. Her first name is attached to one of nearly 20 mezethes, or appetizers. \"Diane\\'s light-as-air meatballs\" were not quite as light as air when I tried them, but they were considerably better than average meatballs -- more pliant, juicier. A mix of beef and pork, they had been pan-seared in olive oil, and not a second too long. They represented one of several surprising mezethes. There was, for example, a vegetarian moussaka, made with artichoke hearts, caramelized onions and, in place of béchamel, a mix of melted cheeses. There was also a roasted red pepper filled with a frappé of feta cheese, olive oil and a mix of peppers, some sweet and some hot. Both dishes were terrific, and both signaled Pylos\\'s determination to stand out from other Greek restaurants by moving beyond lamb, whole grilled fish and stuffed grape leaves, all of which it served, none of which were its strong points. Pylos also musters a hipper ambience than Greek restaurants usually attempt, the clay canopy playing a major role in that. I was drawn here after a friend who designs theatrical sets said he considers it the prettiest restaurant he knows. Oversize, handsomely framed mirrors make it seem bigger than it is. The contrast between exposed brick walls in the front and whitewashed walls in the back make what is essentially one long dining room feel like two entirely separate areas. There\\'s a large marble table in the back, with seats on one side, a service corridor on the other and wine bottles in the middle. It functions as the bar, and lets solo diners feel fully integrated into the restaurant, not consigned to some antechamber to watch luckier peers penetrate a sanctum off-limits to them. The thoughtfulness goes beyond the design. Diners are greeted with a bounty of warm pita triangles, with a dip that changes nightly, so repeat customers don\\'t get bored. It might be a purée of fava beans; it might be a paste of sun-dried tomatoes. It will probably be addictive. Pylos is a restaurant that comes fast and strong out of the gate. And because it falters later on, not only with desserts (often a rough patch for Greek restaurants) but also with entrees, you might consider ordering three mezethes per person and then calling it quits. It would be enough, and odds are, judging from my visits, that most of it would be terrific. Whatever your strategy, you should not miss a starter of sautéed slices of haloumi cheese with sautéed grapes. Or another of fried zucchini and fried eggplant. The vegetables had the lightness of expert tempura, and they were composed more delicately than you\\'d expect, in ultrathin circles, layered like a cake. A Greek restaurant must ace grilled octopus, and Pylos did, braising it before charring it, teasing from it a tenderness that octopus frequently resists. It came with balsamic vinegar and capers. Pylos is mad for capers. Applied liberally to an otherwise typical Greek salad, they seemed like eccentric, salty little cousins to the olives. They dusted grilled dourade and grilled branzino, perking up fish that badly and sadly needed it. Among the entrees, which also included braised short ribs and braised lamb shank, roasted Cornish hen and pan-seared duck, my favorites were two Greek stalwarts, moussaka and pastitsio. Both benefited from béchamel sauces less heavy than such sauces can be, and both were pleasantly dizzy with cumin, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. So the best strategy, upon further thought, might be two mezethes and one of these. And Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts, the best of the dessert selections. These include ouzo-spiked chocolate mousse and a walnut cake as soggy as, and little more appealing than, a wet sponge. Pylos rewards adventurous wine drinkers with a long, all-Greek wine list. (The restaurant does not serve liquor.) After a few glasses, the clay pots, more than three pounds each, become even more transfixing. Mr. Valtzoglou said he initially thought he would import pots from Greece, but learned that a nonprofit group on his block taught teenagers to make pottery. He contracted to get his reddish-brown pots from them. They produced batches of only about 50, no more often than once a week. So the canopy grew slowly. It grows still. Each pot is secured with heavy wire: no danger of a claystorm or clayslide here. Just a flourish at once rustic and contemporary, an apt metaphor for Pylos itself.

       "  'review': 'THERE\\'S a secret to the surprising mellowness of the \"legendary mutton chop\" at Keens Steakhouse, a restaurant long synonymous with that gargantuan slab of meat. (The menu announces it with a verbal trumpet blast.) There\\'s a simple reason it has none of the gaminess that diners expect of mutton, which is sheep, and instead reminds them of lamb, the younger version they know and trust. Nix the trumpet and commence a drum roll: it is lamb. The mutton lore is a mutton lie. For at least two decades and perhaps many more, the legendary mutton chop has indeed been a matter of legend. The following sentence is inevitable, as is the one on its tail. Diners have had the wool pulled over their eyes. But they haven\\'t been fleeced. The mutton chop at Keens, a 26-ounce saddle of lamb, skirted with fat and nearly two inches tall, can wear whatever label it pleases, because it provides about as much pleasure as a carnivore could want. So, for that matter, does Keens, a meaty Mecca since 1885, artery-clogging proof that not all good things must come to pass, though they may indeed have to adapt to new times by toying with certain traditions. In the case of Keens, those traditions include true-blue mutton chops, which it once served. It kept the name even after it lost the sheep. It\\'s nostalgic like that. No restaurant in New York City pays the kind of lavish, often kooky, sometimes even touching tribute to the past that Keens does. Look to the ceilings of various dining rooms, which are spread over two floors of three connected townhouses, and behold row upon row of clay pipes. There are more than 50,000 of them, the property of Keens customers who, in tobacco-friendlier times, stowed and used them in the restaurant. Keens had what it called a pipe club, with members including Babe Ruth and Theodore Roosevelt. Even after smoking in restaurants went the way of absinthe, Keens inducted honorary members into the club, famous customers as diverse as Dr. Ruth Westheimer and Dr. Renee Richards, Liza Minnelli and Stephen King. There are pipes bearing their signatures in a glass case beside the main entrance. Keens is a trove not only of protein but also of memorabilia. Its dark-paneled walls display vintage photographs, vintage political cartoons and vintage playbills. On a poignant note, in a room often used for private dining, Keen has what it identifies as the theatrical program that Abraham Lincoln was holding when he was shot. On a humorous note, in the main vestibule, it has what it identifies as \"dinosaur sirloin,\" supposedly a fossil from the Red Rocks area of Utah. It looks like reddish-brown marble, and a sign with it says that in the opinion of Keens, it has not yet been aged long enough to be cooked. Keens expertly dry-ages its beef, which it serves in an array of cuts, all of them memorable and almost all of them mammoth: sirloin, filet mignon, prime rib, porterhouse for two, porterhouse for three. On my visits the restaurant put a nice char on any and every cut that was supposed to have it, and it cooked everything to its requested temperature. It proved itself to be not only one of the city\\'s most charming and diverting theaters for testosterone cuisine but also one of its most reliable. And it presented a few surprisingly effective cameos, most notably a fried chicken salad available only at lunch. Morsels of tender breast kept company with hunks of Stilton cheese, several kinds of lettuces and a sparingly applied vinaigrette. Keens doesn\\'t consign a diner to iceberg with blue cheese, though that\\'s a very happy fate. It also serves a salad of arugula, bibb lettuce, basil and watercress, and both times I had it, the greens and herbs were springy and fresh. Other digressions from the beefy, lamby norm proved perilous. A half chicken had been left on the rotisserie at least 10 minutes too long. A gigantic wedge of salmon had an impressively silken texture but a muffled flavor. (Was it really wild, as the menu claimed?) Fried calamari were a rubbery wreck. It could be argued that a person who orders these dishes in a steakhouse gets what he or she deserves. But a steakhouse should come through with a stronger lineup of desserts than Keens did. Most of the ones I tried were instantly forgettable. The service was usually a graceful departure from the studied gruffness of some other traditional steakhouses. Keens paid attention to details. A glass of iced tea arrived with a fresh mint leaf floating on its surface. A refill wasn\\'t a refill: it was a new glass with a new leaf. Water was poured from a pewter pitcher. In deference to the holiday season, a big stuffed moose head wore a little red Santa cap. Keens is mischievous like that. Cue the mutton. Because Keens changed ownership in the late 1970\\'s, a definitive, comprehensive mutton history seems to be out of reach. But the restaurant\\'s current manager, Bonnie Jenkins, investigated the matter at my request. Keens began with real mutton, which is often defined in this country as sheep of about a year or more in age. In 1935, the restaurant reached and publicly celebrated a milestone: one million mutton chops served. Apparently, Keens was an early, upscale McDonald\\'s of mutton. World War II came. Deprived Americans ate more mutton than they wanted, and as it later fell farther and farther out of fashion, getting fresh mutton of reliable quality became iffy. At some point Keens had to turn to lamb, choosing a cut with a winged shape that mimicked the mutton chop of yore. Keens was using lamb in place of mutton when its current owner reopened it in 1981 following several years of extensive renovations. It was using lamb when subsequent newspaper and magazine articles about Keens appeared under headlines like \"Mutton Place\" and \"Of Mutton and Men.\" And it is using lamb now, although it tries to get lamb around 10 months in age, which is older than most of the lamb we eat, including the thick-cut rack at Keens. That doesn\\'t make it mutton, but it does seem to give it a more robust taste, like lamb with an exponent, lamb on steroids. Call it near-mutton. Call it extreme lamb. Go ahead and call it legendary. In more ways than one, it warrants that tag. Keens Steakhouse  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  72 West 36th Street, Midtown; (212) 947-3636.

       "  'review': 'TO appreciate how far eating has evolved from a matter of survival to a statement of values, take a trip to Cookshop and a look at its chalkboards. They don\\'t list daily specials. They celebrate the restaurant\\'s \"favorite farmers,\" an honor roll of principled stewards and good shepherds who aren\\'t exhausting their land, immobilizing their livestock, tweaking genes or toying with hormones. Along with an elite fleet of chosen fishermen, these farmers stock Cookshop\\'s larder, and they are more or less local, or at least regional; the governing religion demands it. On a given night the number of them on those boards may rise as high as 10, just like the Commandments. Cookshop, you see, is selling more than Montauk squid, Catskill duck and a cornucopia of lettuces, legumes, root vegetables and fruits that dutifully obey their seasons. Cookshop is selling virtue, and it\\'s suffused with it, even in ways that aren\\'t bluntly advertised. The tables, for example, are made of a type of American oak that Cookshop\\'s proprietors chose over less expensive alternatives because those alternatives come from endangered forests. The menus, tawny and matte, use recycled paper. So you can sip, sup and simultaneously congratulate yourself, all of which might be a bit much but for this: You can also have a merry, heedless time. With the exception of those chalkboards, Cookshop renders its call to conscience as a murmur, audible to anyone soothed by the sound and ignorable by those who just want to chow down. More important, Cookshop\\'s theology incorporates the pleasure principle. Never mind the wood. The tables are well spaced throughout an L-shaped room with a long wall of windows, a magnanimous level of lighting and a décor that perfectly splits the difference between spare and cozy. The seafood, meat and produce aren\\'t just ethical; they\\'re fresh and flavorful. And while the dishes, individually and all together, strive for a quality that might well be called wholesomeness, it\\'s a hedonistic (as opposed to an extra-crunchy) wholesomeness, built around an all-American, old-fashioned emphasis on belly-filling comfort that brings to mind Prune and Little Giant. They and Cookshop are the deviled-egg restaurants. All three have served that dish, which is listed on their menus among snacks, a category separate from appetizers. And in all three cases the dish is part of a studied homeyness that also manifests itself in house-made sausages and liver-laden treats. But the deviled eggs at Cookshop are topped with caviar (from American paddlefish, mind you), signaling something else. Cookshop is a more ambitious production than its kinfolk. It\\'s also more polished and, with about 115 seats, much larger. The producers are the husband-wife team of Marc Meyer and Vicki Freeman and their partner, Chris Paraskevaides, who also collaborate on Five Points in NoHo. Mr. Meyer is the executive chef. Five Points opened in 1999 and has done brisk business ever since. It\\'s never exciting but frequently satisfying, while Cookshop is rarely exciting but almost always satisfying -- a child that improves upon the parent. It presents a balanced user-friendly menu that offers something for everyone (a meatless wood-oven pizza, a meatless pasta, halibut in a shower of olives and raisins, beef brisket in a swamp of grits and fried onions) without collapsing into incoherence. The food is amply portioned, fairly priced and completely sophisticated but not remotely fussy. The wine list is extensive and varied but not showy. Because Cookshop has made the rounds of small producers, acquiring wines that aren\\'t easy to find in retail stores, you can spend $30 to $40 and get an interesting, hugely enjoyable bottle. Try the 2002 Mas des Chimères from Languedoc, made primarily of syrah. None of those strengths may sound like a big deal, but it\\'s surprising how few restaurants combine them, how seldom I hear what I often did when I went to Cookshop: friends remarking that they would gladly return on their own time and dime. They most often said this as we sampled Cookshop\\'s irresistible desserts, the work of the pastry chef, Heather Miller. There was a single-serving chocolate meringue pie, which had stiff competition from a maple flan with warm gingerbread and from a hot fudge sundae with pecans, bourbon-spiked butterscotch and more. There was also, for the faint of stomach, a fantastic mix of ginger-lemon ice and cranberries, which sat on the table among its less restrained peers like a Merchant-Ivory film in a festival of Tarantino. The savory highlights at Cookshop include an appetizer of house-smoked bluefish that\\'s as fine a treatment of a blue as you\\'re likely to encounter. You can\\'t go wrong with any of the salads, one of which liberates beets from goat cheese and pairs them instead with tahini. You also can\\'t go wrong with Cookshop\\'s grits, and that\\'s fortunate, because they appear not only with the brisket but also with roasted shrimp and fried duck livers, and on their own, as a side. Among the snacks, the deviled egg is not as good a bet as sautéed chanterelle, oyster and maitake mushrooms on grilled rye toast, or as slices of smoked pork tenderloin with persimmon. Mr. Meyer clearly knows his way around a pig, because the best of the entrees is probably the pork, which pairs grilled loin with a pudgy link of sausage. It reflects Mr. Meyer\\'s attempt to use as many parts of the animals he buys as possible. He cooks whole young chickens and rabbits on an experimental, odd-looking vertical rotisserie that he helped design, but he seemingly hasn\\'t mastered this equipment or dealt adequately with its collateral effects. Both times I had the chicken, its skin wasn\\'t crisp, and the one time I sat near the open kitchen the heat from that rotisserie made me feel as if I should be wearing SPF 45. I\\'m betting Mr. Meyer and his partners will solve those problems, because their eagerness to please seems as keen as their exaltation of all things seasonal, free-range and line-caught. Of course these impulses are not contradictory, and Cookshop is proof: a place where eating well and doing good find common ground.

       "  'review': 'YOU don\\'t hear people talk much about Compass, which famously defied its name by so often losing its way. But you would if more of them tried its crispy skate appetizer, an expertly cooked indication that Compass is finally on course. When several friends and I recently had it, the moistness of the fish and the crunchiness of its panko crust played a textural tug of war. Neither side lost, so we won. Entrees arrived, and we were victors again. Our lobster, poached in olive oil before being pampered with butter and clementine juice, made a dreamy case for never treating lobster any other way. An hour or so later we were next door at Cafe Luxembourg, where we spotted skate as a main course and ordered it. It had been put through uneventful paces -- a sizzling encounter with olive oil, a subsequent shower of capers -- and had emerged somewhat gummy. It typified too much of the restaurant\\'s food, at once serviceable and disappointing. And yet Cafe Luxembourg, unlike Compass, was characteristically packed. The way people push to get in and wait three deep at the bar, you\\'d think the restaurant\\'s signature yellow tile walls were coated in some sort of culinary pheromone. Cafe Luxembourg is the soccer captain to Compass\\'s science club president. It has more sex appeal and an easier time getting dates. The disparate degrees of ardor that diners feel for these restaurants also illustrates something else: the way success perpetuates itself, a self-sustaining reality sometimes divorced from the merits, while a history of failure obscures current accomplishments. In the restaurant business, as in so much else, reputations linger and a herd mentality rules. Diners crowd Cafe Luxembourg, which is now 22 years old, in part because they see that it\\'s always crowded. Diners don\\'t rush to Compass, which is not yet 4, because they don\\'t notice any stampede in that direction. And why would they? Compass is already on its fifth head chef, the rapid turnover revealing frequent turmoil. But recent visits to both restaurants, which sit side by side on the Upper West Side, pointed out a need for reappraisals. It is the kitchen at Cafe Luxembourg, which received two stars from Bryan Miller in The New York Times in 1992, that has been struggling lately. After many months without an executive chef, the restaurant hired Victor Everitt about six weeks ago. The transition may partly explain the ordinariness of the food. But it doesn\\'t explain the service, almost always sluggish and often distracted. During one visit, we waited 35 minutes past our reservation time without anyone\\'s offering us an apology. On another visit, one friend, arriving mere minutes after the rest of us had been seated, was told there was no record of our party. We were 20 feet away. Perhaps because it has been desired for so long, Cafe Luxembourg doesn\\'t fret enough over its desirability. At brunch an omelet was overdone. At dinner loin of lamb and a strip steak, both ordered medium rare, were overcooked. So were the noodles in a dish of pappardelle with braised rabbit and almost no flavor. We tried to resuscitate it with salt, the same emergency treatment we administered to an anorexic, wheezing potato and fennel soup. But both were dead on arrival. The menu combines populist French stalwarts (onion soup, steak tartare, coq au vin) with American favorites (burger, fried calamari). By Manhattan standards the food isn\\'t extravagantly priced. And a diner can assemble an enjoyable meal, especially by starting with one of Mr. Everitt\\'s new appetizers -- a salad of peekytoe crab, avocado and grapefruit -- and proceeding to one of his new entrees, maple-glazed pork tenderloin. There isn\\'t a single letdown among a strong contingent of straightforward desserts (baked Alaska, rum-raisin bread pudding) by Alana Ford, the pastry chef. Apart from these bright spots, however, Cafe Luxembourg\\'s strongest claim on diners\\' affection may be its hip, brasserie lite mien. Compass, in contrast, can\\'t coast on comely pouts and poses. Its somewhat blankly contemporary dining room is the visual equivalent of the music that filled it one night: Dido, Sade, George Michael. Meet architectural easy listening. But if Cafe Luxembourg assumes your interest, Compass eagerly pins a corsage on you. A woman at the coat check called out to make sure a friend and I knew we could ditch whatever we wanted. (I think she would even have taken our dirty laundry.) The bread basket overflowed with slices of seven-grain, Manchego cheese rolls, corn bread -- all of it great. The current chef, John Fraser, on board now for six months, has put together an ambitious Continental-goes-global menu and buckled down to impressive cooking. It yielded succulent results in an appetizer of bay scallops, served with a potato purée and chanterelles, and an entree of wild salmon, served with Savoy cabbage, lentils and black trumpet mushrooms. Mr. Fraser combines formidable energy with fastidiousness, bringing fresh ideas to staples of high-end dining. Lamb? Tender medallions of loin were paired with a small, rich potpie of leg and belly. Duck? Out came more pastry: a tiny pastilla of braised leg to go along with seared breast meat. The skate, cooked on a plancha, was served with a swish of peanut purée and a Thai-theme salad of green papaya, pineapple and crab. A terrific appetizer of roasted beets included what a server called \"beet caviar,\" which was couscous stained with beet juice. That term, like the menu listing of entrees as \"compositions,\" reflects a tendency to embellish that can work against Compass, which received one star in The Times from Amanda Hesser last year. A veal chop was not so much coddled as clobbered by a cloak of peppers, chorizo and capers. And while the $32 price tag on Compass\\'s vigorously promoted three-course prix fixe sounds like a deal, the limited choices, including salmon tartare and beef short ribs, did not rank anywhere near the restaurant\\'s best dishes and reflected its unevenness. But those best dishes were truly distinctive, and so were the desserts, under the direction of Vera Tong. Ms. Tong\\'s work is as spirited as Mr. Fraser\\'s. Rolling with the seasons, she fashioned pumpkin panna cotta and gingerbread pudding. Recognizing the magic of salty with sweet, she affixed potato chips to the sides of a milk chocolate and hazlenut gâteau, where they fanned out like a hummingbird\\'s wings. If she, Mr. Fraser and the rest of the staff at Compass keep it up, they might soon be able to count on legions of fans. Perhaps their biggest hurdle is simply the lack of them.

       "  'review': 'AT Aburiya Kinnosuke, a new restaurant in Midtown, you probably won\\'t spot any celebrities, the way you might at a more lavish, trendy Japanese pleasure palace like Megu or Nobu. You definitely won\\'t find elaborately constructed, kaleidoscopic sushi rolls, the kind that look more like kites than supper, or whimsically shaped stemware filled with neon-colored potions, the kind that look more like chemistry experiments than drinks. Here\\'s what you will see, or at least what I did, every time I went: tables filled with Japanese businessmen, neckties still on, briefcases nearby, speaking Japanese to servers who fared much better in that language than in English. In front of them they had banquets of food that was largely unfamiliar, and on their faces they had very broad smiles. This restaurant was clearly delighting them, sating them and offering them something much closer to, and more consistent with, what they would get in Tokyo than what they would get in TriBeCa. That caught my attention, and my own delight kept me coming back for more. Plunging into the restaurant\\'s lengthy menu, which was supplemented each night by dozens of specials, I had a sense of seemingly boundless possibility, of new flavors that it would take quite some time to exhaust. I had a sense of discovery. And I had tuna collar, again and again, because like so much else at Aburiya Kinnosuke, it\\'s not something that many other New York restaurants serve. It looked like a veal chop, big bones and all. The meat was tawny and rich, not in the manner of toro but in a muskier, messier vein. Some bits were darker than others, and some hid in crevices between skin and bone. Using chopsticks to grab hold of them was like excavating layers of earth, each slightly different. It\\'s an activity I recommend, as I do Aburiya, with a few caveats. The menu is so expansive and arcane that a diner can encounter bad luck as easily as good and wind up with food that disappoints, if only because it\\'s so peculiar. One night I blithely ventured in the direction of dried baby squid, only to make a hasty retreat after one repellently fishy, intensely funky bite. Due in part to the language barrier, service can be awkward. The people who waited on my friends and me had trouble explaining what various dishes were and, in some cases, why it was taking so long for these dishes to arrive. A few of these servers, seemingly reluctant to intrude on us, succeeded in ignoring us. But for a diner in the right frame of mind, the oddities of Aburiya just seem like part of the adventure. Aburiya was opened several months ago by the restaurateurs who operate Yakitori Totto, a more casual Japanese restaurant in Midtown. Aburiya is more expensive; although the price of each modestly proportioned dish is often low, it can take four or five of those dishes, at an aggregate cost of $35 to $45, to fill a diner up. In return, the restaurant adds a layer of gloss and a measure of serenity to the kind of no-nonsense, no-compromises ethnic fidelity more easily found in no-frills haunts. It\\'s a pleasant escape that always made me feel as if I were traveling far away from the rest of the city. It provides several seating options. There are semiprivate nooks fronted by sliding latticed wood doors, a common area with tightly packed tables along a banquette and, in the back, a counter around a robata grill. The restaurant\\'s menu is divided into many parts, including house-made tofu, salads, sashimi, and rice and noodle dishes. But grilling occupies center stage. It can even occupy the center of the table. Under the heading \"Shichirin Grill,\" which refers to a small portable vessel, the restaurant serves meat and fish that diners can grill over bincho-tan charcoal, which produces little smoke. During my visits hanger steak and red snapper were among the options. In both cases, servers placed a big leaf over the grill, and we were instructed to slather that leaf with sweet red miso paste, then put the flesh and a heap of scallions over that. When the paste bubbled, we were told, the food would be done. But the bubbling was a poor barometer for both the beef, which needed more cooking, and the fish, which needed less. In addition, the miso and scallions registered too strongly. The fruits of the robata grill, which also uses bincho-tan charcoal, were more reliable. The tuna collar, listed on the menu as neck, came from that, and so did salmon neck, another fatty, slightly gamy, challenging and rewarding cut. The robata produced crisp-skinned chicken wings, succulent strips of pork cheek and tender ribbons of sea eel. It was the cradle of what the menu called a chicken meatball, really a chicken meatloaf, eggy, gooey and comforting. I hadn\\'t tried black sesame tofu before Aburiya, but I hope to have it again, especially now that I know what I didn\\'t when I took my first few bites: that the tiny mound of salt beside it had a real purpose. Applied sparingly, it played a pivotal role in blunting the edges of the sesame. Gomoku kinpira, a sautéed mixture of thinly sliced mushroom, carrot, burdock root, lotus root and more, was like a slaw that had begun evolving into a lo mein, taking on greater weight, more flavor and oiliness. Cold, circular wedges of Japanese sticky yam, with the taste and texture of a slick potato, had been pickled and seasoned with wasabi. They were slimy on the outside, softer within, and had a fiery finish on the tongue. I couldn\\'t stop eating them, and by that time -- my last visit to Aburiya -- I was no longer staring at the tables of Japanese diners or soliciting advice from Japan-savvy friends to determine what to eat. I was just guessing, improvising. In a way, that\\'s the most authentic experience of all. Aburiya Kinnosuke  * [Rating: One Star]  213 East 45th Street; (212) 867-5454.

       "  'review': 'CONFUSING the point of a restaurant with the mission of a \"Saturday Night Live\" skit, Ninja New York deposits you in a kooky, dreary subterranean labyrinth that seems better suited to coal mining than to supping. You are greeted there by servers in black costumes who ceaselessly bow, regularly yelp and ever so occasionally tumble, and you are asked to choose between two routes to your table. The first is described by a ninja escort as simple and direct. The second is \"dark, dangerous and narrow,\" involving a long tunnel and a drawbridge that descends only when your escort intones a special command, which he later implores you to keep secret. I recommend a third path: right back out the door. Granted, you will be denied the sating of any curiosity about what a $3.5 million design budget permits in the way of faux stone walls, make-believe gorges and mock torches. You will forgo an iota of modest amusement. But you will be spared an infinitely larger measure of tedium, a visually histrionic smorgasbord of undistinguished food and a discordant bill that can easily exceed $100 a person with tax, tip and drinks. Ninja acts like a Disney ride -- Space Mountain under a hailstorm of run-of-the-mill or unappealing sushi -- but charges like Le Bernardin. It has a stringy crab dish served on a grapefruit that belches smoke, a ridiculous dessert in the shape of a frog and a whole lot of nerve. An American offshoot of a restaurant in Tokyo, Ninja intends to evoke a Japanese mountain village inhabited by ninjas, a special breed of stealthy warriors. In this case they come armed not only with swords and sorcery but also with recipes, which may be their most dangerous weapons of all. And they roam, romp and perform dopey magic tricks, including sleight of hand with rubber bands, over 6,000 square feet of darkened crannies and well-separated, quiet nooks. Each party of diners receives its own nook, which quickly takes on the aspect of a jail cell as the ninjas, delivering and removing dishes, laboriously slide the latticed doors open and closed, closed and open, ad infinitum. On my first visit, when I tried a $150 tasting menu with a dearth of culinary highlights but a surfeit of ninja pageantry, they reliably garnished this gesture with loud expectorations of a putative courtesy that sounded more like a rebuke, the phonetic rendering of which would be something along the lines of \"Go-mayn!\" \"Go-mayn!\" coughed a ninja, and onto the table dropped an appetizer of octopus drowned in vinegar. Not soon enough, it was spirited away (\"Go-mayn!\"), to be replaced and rivaled later on by a wedge of dry black cod in edible paper (\"Go-mayn!\"). I grew so weary of these syllables that I asked if they could be varied, if something along the lines of a \"Surrender, Dorothy!\" could be thrown into the mix. I was dead serious. The lineup of dishes isn\\'t. Presented on a scroll, it mingles straightforward Japanese fare (tempura, sashimi, soba, yakitori) with flights of fancy that are grounded, but only somewhat, in Japanese and French traditions. In the name of \"new style sushi\" Ninja employs rice cakes as beds -- or sometimes graves -- for a rectangle of truffle-flecked omelet (it tasted like soggy French toast), a sliver of sautéed foie gras (pleasant, but how could it not be?) and a finger of seaweed-crowned mackerel (fishy in the extreme). It trots out a golden tower roll, which inexplicably embeds uni in spongecake, and a spring snow roll, which engulfs eel in an obliterating puck of sweetened cream cheese. In the service of table-side derring-do the restaurant spotlights what it calls a meteorite pot, a milky brew with Thai seasonings and slices of pork loin. A ninja cooks it in close, sizzling proximity to diners by heaving a large, hot rock into the broth. It\\'s a soup and a sauna, not to mention a pointless effort for the thin, dull outcome. And in the interest of decadence Ninja concocts appetizers like a \"crème brûlée\" that combines egg custard with Parmesan, potato, foie gras and veal for a quichelike effect. It was actually good, a judgment that applied to only about a third of the food, much too small a fraction for a restaurant this expensive. The shoddy service also contradicted the cost. If a restaurant wants to promote six multicourse meals that range from $80 to $200, it should make sure that the menu on which these options appear doesn\\'t have a big red food stain, as a companion\\'s menu did. If a restaurant wants to charge between $12 and $18 a glass for white wine and $15 for weak specialty drinks, it should respond to an expressed interest in sake with a presentation of its sake list, not with the words \"I\\'ll bring half a liter,\" which is what a ninja said. It should not run out of sparkling water, as it did one night. It should also advise its ninjas that it\\'s not nice to brag about having entertained a Hollywood celebrity who, by the account of the ninja in question, was the apparent beneficiary of recent breast augmentation. I was happy for the disclosure and appalled at the indiscretion, as I was at so much else. A \"fatty tuna steak,\" available à la carte for $45, was no larger than a cutlet, and while I expected o-toro, I detected no toro. Once the bright red bits of shell that decorated a $40 lobster entrée were removed, all that remained was about eight bites of flesh, neither tender nor sweet. That frog dessert was just $10, but it was little more than a cloying blob of cunningly molded cream cheese. A ho-hum amalgam of chocolate cake, green tea cake and vanilla and green tea ice creams (also $10) was another triumph of shape over substance, resembling a bonsai. For a toddler with a trust fund and a yen for udon and maki, Ninja might be a valid alternative to the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant. For just about anybody else it\\'s nonsensical, and its climactic illusion may well be a disappearing act. Ninja New York  POOR 25 Hudson Street (Duane Street), TriBeCa; (212)274-8500.

       "  'review': \"ABBOCCATO is the 21st-century version of an Italian-American restaurant. There are no red tablecloths, no candles stuck in raffia-covered wine bottles, no lasagna or garlic bread. Instead there is an Italian restaurant with one foot firmly planted in Italy, the other in the New World: buffalo milk ricotta, meet sourdough bread; Umbrian truffles, meet fresh corn. And because no self-respecting upscale restaurant is entitled to high prices without it, foie gras. After an extensive tour of Italy, the Livanos family decided to add another restaurant to the two it owns in Midtown, Molyvos and Oceana. The Livanoses hired a chef who had worked at Felidia and Esca, and tried to make a grotto-like space in the Blakely Hotel into something bright and light. But there are too many things going on in the decorative effort. Jim Botsacos, the chef and a partner at Molyvos and Abboccato, and Jake Addeo, Abboccato's chef de cuisine, are cooking some interesting but seldom seen regional dishes and creating a few delightful combinations that would never see the light of day in Italy. It's a bit of a jumble, but often a pleasing one, like the heavenly buffalo milk ricotta soup with tomatoes, corn and crisp pancetta. I could eat it every week. Or the perfectly roasted black bass that is served with seared escarole stuffed with a zesty caponata, all of it moistened with a vinaigrette made with pork jowls. Foie gras has found its way into ravioli stuffed with wild radicchio and ricotta and served with a sage, walnut and balsamic butter sauce. The only complaint was that the ravioli were a little too al dente. Another felicitous marriage is foie gras -- the buttery interior bursting through the nicely crisp exterior -- served with a potato dumpling stuffed with tomato marmalade. Anyone who likes quail but despairs of the bones should go directly to Abboccato's boneless, beautifully roasted preparation, about the size of a Spaldeen. It is stuffed with mortadella and pistachios and served with lentils, the traditional balsamic onions and an unexpected slash of mostarda, the fruit and mustard preserves often found on a cheese plate. Carpaccio of tomatoes? Words take on meanings here they never had before. As you might suspect, the tomatoes are thinly sliced and make a base for sweet peekytoe crab meat, lightly flavored with scallions and punctuated with lovage. Of course, this dish depends entirely on the flavor of the raw ingredients, so it won't be around much longer this year. Tomatoes also depend on proper salting. And here is where the kitchen falls down on the not-so-simple task: the use of sea salt. It is a fault emblematic of the restaurant's drawbacks, and it prevents Abboccato, which means medium sweet, from being as good as it can be. There is not always a steady hand at the stove. On each visit some dishes tasted as if the chef had stock in a sea salt company. You can't sprinkle coarse salt the way you sprinkle Morton's. Not everyone wants a burst of salt in a bite. But in other dishes it was completely missing. The otherwise excellent spaghetti alla amatriciana, made with house-cured pig jowls -- which sound better in Italian, guanciale -- was oversalted. At the other extreme, the tagliatelle Bolognese was a tepid rendition of the old tradition, chiefly because it tasted salt-free. A side dish of peperonata lacked not only salt but also any evidence of the ingredients that give it its usual piquancy: onion, garlic and vinegar. The pan-seared potatoes with pancetta and onion tasted reheated and -- you guessed it -- devoid of salt. On the other hand, the rack of lamb for two, baked in a salt and mint crust, was not at all salty -- or minty for that matter. The meat, though perfectly cooked medium rare, was tough. For some reason most of the cheeses on the well-selected tray did not come with bread, though they were served with some delicious preparation of fruit, either macerated or marinated, fresh or dried. That's how Italians like to eat cheese. But Americans want bread, and when they ask for it in this country, in this city and in this restaurant, the waiter should not shoot them a look of disdain and say the restaurant does not have bread. It was this same waiter who on two occasions stood uncomfortably close to the table, staring at my guests and almost close enough to hear the conversation. Each time someone spilled a drop on the table cloth, he rushed over with a napkin and ceremoniously placed it over the offending spot -- four times at one meal. Did he know I was reviewing the restaurant? I doubt it -- it was service not with a smile but with a sneer. I think the maître d'hôtel needs to keep him busier. Otherwise, the service was pleasant and appropriate. The hardest course for an Italian restaurant in America to conjure up is dessert because Italians finish their meals with the cheese. But Abboccato's pastry chef, David Carmichael, has come up with some pleasing desserts connected to Italy. Tiny, warm cinnamon-dusted doughnuts with vanilla mascarpone were hard to resist. And the buffalo milk ricotta cheese tart with seasonal fruit poached in wine was a delightful mix of creamy, sweet and acidic. Thinly sliced, toasted panettone with an orange-marmalade-studded semifreddo, lovingly bathed in warm chocolate sauce, was a delicious deconstructed take on an ice cream sandwich. The gelati might have pink peppercorns, mostarda or just plain caramel. But Bonet was an overly dense, unpleasantly bitter chocolate mousse with a white chocolate topping. Though the menu says it is served with three citrus powders, the night we tried it the citrus had taken a powder. But when the espresso arrived with perfect little hazelnut meringues, we forgot about the Bonet. Simple is good. Reviews by Frank Bruni, who is on vacation, will resume next week.

       "  'review': 'JACKIE MASON and Raoul Felder. Who cares about the food, or the service, at Ben & Jack\\'s Steak House when a nightly cast of New York City characters straight out of \"Broadway Danny Rose\" occupies center stage? Woody Allen, of course, sits in the back room, where the spotlight shines not on the guests but on a life-size golden bull. Or is it a fatted calf? In fact, who needs Peter Luger when several of its former waiters and a grill cook, following in the footsteps of those who went to Wolfgang\\'s, have decamped to this latest attempt to imitate that legendary steakhouse in Brooklyn? It\\'s unfortunate that the food at Ben & Jack\\'s strives to mimic Peter Luger\\'s, rather than to aim higher. The prices for steak are within a nickel of each other: $36.95 at Ben & Jack\\'s in Manhattan, $36.90 in Brooklyn. The question is whether either one is worth it. And at Ben & Jack\\'s, when the service is off, the answer is definitely no. On my visits the service was generally very pleasant (if absent-minded) -- especially the night when two guests at my table fell into the category of boldface names -- although it could be rock-bottom insulting. For example, the night of the \"almost three hour dinner from hell,\" when it helped to pass the time speculating on what Mr. Felder, the celebrity divorce lawyer, who observes kosher dietary laws, was going to eat in a nonkosher steakhouse. (Salmon and spinach.) Still, it was annoying to wait 30 minutes for a waiter to take the drink order. We were further riveted by Mr. Felder\\'s pal Mr. Mason, with his pale-orange coif touched by hints of pink, snacking on the bottled \"salad dressing\" (another Luger derivative) and proclaiming it \"delicious, delicious.\" But celebrity-watching barely kept our minds off the 60 additional minutes it took for the first course to arrive. We were not alone: patrons at several tables around us (Felder-Mason excluded) kept looking from their watches to the empty spaces where their plates should have been. Finally someone at my table practically tripped our waiter to inquire about our long-lost meal. \"We have a lot of private parties, and they have to be served first,\" was his brutally honest reply. He was not just harried; he was insulting. And who can forget the sight of the maître d\\'hôtel -- or was he an owner? -- chewing gum while pacing the dining room. The food at Ben & Jack\\'s is equally uneven, though the onion rolls, described by one guest as \"very Brooklyn,\" are just like the famous ones at the mother ship. One night some slices of a porterhouse were tough, but on two other visits, all were tender, juicy and full of flavor: what you always hope a steak will be, but seldom is. Then on a fourth visit the steak was slightly chewy and not very beefy in flavor. Filet mignon, though cooked to death at the diner\\'s request, was still tender. Another evening, a medium-rare fillet was also tender, with flavor as good as that cut of meat can have. But it was dry. A rib-eye steak was tender but flavorless; lamb chops were not memorable. In both cases the meat was not much different from what I had recently sampled on a visit to Luger. In keeping with the expected over-the-top steakhouse experience, there was far too much of everything. But it\\'s hard to come to grips with the practice of pouring sizzling butter over a grilled steak. Is it to add flavor to flavorless meat? To make dry meat juicy? Or simply wretched excess? Weighing in at four pounds, the lobster was rubbery and tasteless from stem to stern. Most of the meat ended up in a doggie bag, in hopes that it would make a decent lobster salad. The lobster cocktail fared no better. But the crab meat cocktail was deliciously sweet. That sort of inconsistency plagued the rest of the menu. There was perfectly cooked tuna one night: nicely grilled outside, rare inside. On another evening the Chilean sea bass was inedible, and the shrimp were overcooked. One night the oysters were tasteless; on two other visits they were briny and sweet. There was a nice Caesar salad, but at the height of tomato season where was the restaurant buying such hard, not-very-red tomatoes for its mozzarella salad? The best thing about the Ben & Jack\\'s salad for two was the crispy bacon. The waiter forgot the blue cheese dressing. \"O.K., I\\'ll owe you nice desserts,\" he said, but only two arrived for our party of four. Without additional plates. No loss there: the desserts don\\'t rise about coffee-shop level. But like everything else they are big and sweet and are served with the same bizarre bowl of schlag (whipped cream) Luger serves. It is designed to improve any dessert, and it would, if only it tasted as if it came from a cow (the restaurant assured me it did) and had some flavor beyond sweet. But I still haven\\'t figured out what kind of stabilizer they use to keep the cream so firm. The recommended salad dressing that Mr. Mason was eating with such gusto falls somewhere between cocktail sauce and the red sauce you get at a bad Chinese restaurant. The wines are certainly better than Luger\\'s. There are plenty of decent choices between $40 and $60. The quality of the food and of the service in this 10-week-old restaurant matches its mishmash décor: an 1890\\'s saloon here, a 1920\\'s speakeasy there. Over all it\\'s a 1940\\'s steakhouse, with etched glass on the private dining room dividers, red and cream patterned carpeting and floral upholstered chairs. Maybe it\\'s that décor, a far cry from Luger\\'s down-market look, that is attracting such a wide range of diners, among them deeply tanned hipsters in pinkie rings and turtlenecks, and preppies in crew necks over T-shirts and jeans. For Manhattanites who love the idea of a Luger-style steakhouse but think they might as well go to Bhutan if they have to cross a body of water, Ben & Jack\\'s has two advantages over the Brooklyn original: the seats are more comfortable, and you don\\'t have to cross any bridges. Besides, where else can you see Bruce Cutler, the high-profile criminal lawyer who defended John J. Gotti, sitting alone? But if you want to go, choose a night when the restaurant isn\\'t busy. Or take along your connected friends. Reviews by Frank Bruni, who is on vacation, will resume on Oct. 26.

       "  'review': 'IF you want to make the acquaintance of your dinner just before you ingest it, Oriental Garden is your place. In stacks of tanks flanking the entrance of this Chinatown mainstay, crabs crawl, sea bass swim and clams loll about, for want of an even less kinetic verb. But the presentation winds up seeming less theatrical than practical, less like an aquarium of incipient deliciousness than an unadorned aquatic larder, even a floating gallows. The tanks are drearily overcrowded and the room beyond them distressingly over-bright. Uptown, at the new restaurant Mainland, what draws your eye almost immediately after you walk through the door are picturesque bundles of firewood and, above them, a glass-fronted oven in which whole ducks are cooked. This display is all about appetite-whetting beauty. The birds glisten like amber jewels, and the setting for their consumption includes soft lighting, spacious semicircular booths and the kind of lounge music that seems designed to induce a trance. You can wash your duck down with specially named cocktails like the Yangtze Sigh. You can follow it up with a white chocolate macadamia pot du crème. In New York over recent years, Chinese has been trading up, ditching its often matter-of-fact trappings and trying to grab some of the glamour hogged by other cuisines. Mainland follows in the stylish footsteps of 66, Xing and Yumcha, all of which seek to readjust expectations about restaurants that label themselves Chinese. But when the lights are dimmed, the prices are raised and the beef in a main course of beef and broccoli is aged sirloin, with the broccoli to the side, does the pleasure increase? Are a shinier gloss and sometimes better cuts of meat harbingers of a better experience? It depends in large part on your mood. But it depends just as much on how well the dishes are prepared, how wisely that gloss is applied and whether the whole experience comes together in a way that feels special and satisfying. It hinges on judgment, not authenticity. On execution, not airs. Mainland aims high, starting with its Peking duck, which uses the birds from that oven. The chef, Brian Young, whose ancestry is Chinese, follows a fastidious process for making sure the external layers of skin and fat are as respectively crisp and luscious as possible. It takes more than a day and includes ladling a boiling liquid onto the birds and having fans blow air over them before they enter the oven, where they hang on hooks over a combination of cherry, apple and peach wood. The ducks are then wheeled out on a cart, carved tableside and served with steamed pancakes and plum sauce. On one visit the pancakes were soggy, but the duck impressive. Another time every facet of the dish was spot-on. Mainland takes multiple tacks in gussying up Chinese. It serves classic dishes, like that Peking duck or Cantonese-style lobster over crispy noodles, which are simply being given a more elaborately decorated theater than they usually receive. It does upscale riffs on downscale delivery staples, like that beef and broccoli, which came with an incongruous but excellent stack of Vidalia onion rings. It takes staples of New York restaurants of various ethnicities -- raw fish appetizers, short ribs, rack of lamb -- and brings Chinese or at least Asian vegetables, sauces and spices into play. The restaurant\\'s pot stickers, dumplings and spring rolls were almost always respectable and sometimes better, one of the standouts being the lamb spring rolls, which had an internal richness that the external crunchiness brought into relief. At Mainland, however, not all proteins are created equal. Duck got its due, both when roasted whole and when stir-fried with Chinese sausage, pine nuts, shiitake mushrooms and dried sour cherries. This amalgam was served with, and meant to be wrapped in, leaves of bibb lettuce. But prawns and shrimps of all sizes and in all kinds of dishes, including the fried rice, emerged undercooked, overcooked or just plain flavorless, as if there were a shrimp pox on the house. A corn soup with asparagus and crab was sludgy beyond belief one visit and cloying the next, the only link between the experiences being the faintness of the crab\\'s presence. Beyond the inconsistencies there were, in Mainland\\'s putative attempt to do something new, too many bows to the familiar: those raw fish appetizers, one with jalapeño and another with sesame; miso-glazed black cod; foie gras; even the music. Entering the series of hyperdecorated dining rooms means walking down several sets of stairs, passing that lovely oven and moving ever farther from any natural light. The effect can become crypt-like. And something about the service was always off-kilter. An intrusive waiter wouldn\\'t stop jabbering. Another server knocked a bottle of water to the floor, where its contents lapped over one of my shoes. He neither offered a replacement nor took the charge off the bill. An almost inaudible apology was all he mustered. The service at Oriental Garden can certainly be brusque, and more than a few of the restaurant\\'s selections flop -- or, in the case of drunken prawns, flail. You have to assure your server that you want this dish, which entailed the following: The server plucked prawns from a tank, put them in a glass bowl on the table and poured rice wine over them, at which point they convulsed so violently that the wine sprayed a friend and me in the face, even though the bowl had been covered. \"It\\'s an appetizer and a shower,\" the friend said. When the prawns stopped moving, the alcohol was set ablaze. The end result: prawns that tasted, sure enough, like prawns drowned in alcohol. It didn\\'t seem worth it, for us or them. But the blunt spectacle to some extent defined Oriental Garden, which isn\\'t about pretty pageantry, enchanting music (I didn\\'t detect any) or trends, as the matter-of-fact exhibition of those tanks also makes clear. Oriental Garden is about extremely fresh food -- fish in particular -- and a kind of no-nonsense preparation that defers to, and underscores, that freshness. Cantonese in inclination, Oriental Garden opened two decades ago and has repeatedly been renovated, but the golden dragons on its walls and mauve cloths on its tables don\\'t make much of a statement. Many of its dishes, however, do, and they support the estimation of some Chinese-Americans and food lovers that this is the best of Chinatown\\'s seafood restaurants. Don\\'t look too long at the menu, which is too long to look at. Engage the servers and eyeball the tanks, and if there\\'s geoduck clam, get that. The restaurant will slice its long neck in the manner of sashimi and then -- a phenomenal treat -- fry its belly. Order salt-and-pepper prawns, slightly sweet and not remotely greasy. If the restaurant\\'s selection of whole fish includes sea bass, and the sea bass seems to be swimming with ample vigor, ask for that as well. The kitchen will do little more than steam it briefly with soy sauce, scallions and ginger, an approach that yielded wonderful, custard-like flesh. The kitchen will put black bean sauce on a bevy of fresh razor clams. That was all they wanted or needed. There were additional, unexpected treats at Oriental Garden, including the spicy \"Ma Pau\" tofu with minced pork. Pan-fried noodles with assorted seafood didn\\'t just have the fabled breath of the wok. They had the deep-lunged, full-throated sigh of the wok. Although the restaurant is not as well known for dim sum as for dinner, I went one Sunday morning, randomly accepted items from the passing trays and ate marvelously. There were also disappointments, like crispy chicken with dry meat and rubbery, tasteless steamed scallops in XO sauce. OrientalGarden serves scads of diners at an often brisk clip, and the cooking sometimes reflects that. But it\\'s divorced from trends, devoted to simplicity and in those ways actually more memorable -- and even more distinctive -- than the cooking at many glitzy Asian newcomers, be they Japanese, Thai or Chinese. In promising to coddle and sometimes even dazzle you, those newcomers set a bar for themselves that they sometimes can\\'t reach. In promising to sate you, Oriental Garden hits its mark.

       "  'review': \"SOMETIMES the best way to move forward is to revisit the past. Sometimes the loudest statements are the quietest ones, made without undue fuss, in precise gestures. At his new restaurant, Perry St., Jean-Georges Vongerichten circles back, shuts up and cooks, electing earnestness over irony, controlled flourishes over cluttered frippery. In doing so he gives fresh currency to his stature as one of the most talented chefs at work in this country. He also gives his doubters, who had grown legion, reason to believe. For all his accolades and wealth, Mr. Vongerichten at this moment has something to prove, and Perry St. is more than just another potentially lucrative application of the Jean-Georges brand. It's a studied retreat from, and maybe even an act of amends for, the high-concept flamboyance of 66, Spice Market and V Steakhouse, the New York restaurants he opened between 2002 and 2004. All three have their significant merits and pleasures -- or at least the first two of them do -- but they rely as heavily on the novelty of their overarching conceits (Chinese goes sexy, the steakhouse does sarcasm) as they do on what happens in the kitchen. It was Jean-Georges the high-wire entrepreneur more than Jean-Georges the culinary genius who sired them. They have vacuous showmanship in their DNA. Perry St. doesn't. This one is from the heart, not the head. And while it is undeniably flawed and surprisingly inconsistent, it's cause for celebration, chiefly because it marks Mr. Vongerichten's return to the straightforwardness of Jo Jo, which he opened in 1991, and of his flagship, Jean Georges, which came along in 1997. Not since then has he produced a New York restaurant as tidily reflective of his culinary strengths and sensibility as Perry St. The expertly orchestrated interplay of flavors and yin-yang balance of effects in many of the dishes here are classic Jean-Georges, as are the clarity and lightness of his sauces and broths, which cast the stocks of previous eras as lumbering dinosaurs. For much of the summer the restaurant served as an amuse-bouche a version of gazpacho made with raspberry, cucumber, red and orange bell pepper, ginger, red wine vinegar and olive oil, discrete beads of which floated like a shiny archipelago on a ruby sea. The sweetness of the fruit set the stage for, then ceded it to, the sourness and gentle heat of other players, which arrived as a second wave, a delayed epiphany. The transition and contrast were transfixing. Mr. Vongerichten has mastered what might be called time-release gastronomy. An appetizer salad of frisée, goat cheese and pickled peach nailed a sweet heat that traveled a path similar to the gazpacho's: a cool front followed by a spike in the temperature, this time courtesy of crystallized wasabi. But sometimes a single sensation slowly intensified. An appetizer of bluefin tuna in a fried crust of Japanese rice crackers came with a salmon-colored, scallion-studded mayonnaise flavored with dashi, sriracha and various citrus juices. The controlled fire sparked by the scallions and sriracha blazed stronger in the middle of each bite than at the beginning and stronger still at the end. But it never singed. Roasted chicken rested in a broth made from chicken wings smoked with hickory, mesquite and cherry wood. The smokiness of that potion expanded with -- and even within -- each bite, and was cleverly offset by sweet kernels of fresh corn. The restaurant's ambience is as pruned of needless embellishment as the food. Perry St. has been decorated in a sleek contemporary vein and a subdued palette of white, beiges and grays, neither of which competes with the charmed setting. Located on the ground floor of one of the new West Village high-rises designed by Richard Meier, the restaurant has views of the Hudson River, the joggers and cyclists on its edge and, at dusk, the setting sun. Imagine some palm trees in the foreground and this could be coastal California. It feels that fixed on a watery horizon, that luminous and laid back. It also feels easy and easygoing, and in that sense represents another considered attempt, in these less formal times, to preserve the core pleasures of fine dining while jettisoning much of the ceremony and some of the expense. So there is ample elbow room and attentive service but only one type of bread and butter at the beginning, only a token cluster of petit fours at the end, and -- an informality too far -- brown paper place mats on the tables. It takes little time to peruse the concise wine list and almost none to absorb the menu: eight appetizers, eight entrees and five desserts. Given the winnowed options, there are too many disappointing dishes. An heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad was beautiful to behold but merely pleasant to eat. Steamed black bass was dressed in a basil vinaigrette so tart it suggested some kind of accident behind the scenes. So I tried this entree again on a subsequent night: still too tart, though appreciably less so. Other dishes also varied from visit to visit, the ginger vinaigrette on poached lobster proving sweeter one time than another, the dill broth around a gorgeous crop of summer vegetables proving sharper. Although Mr. Vongerichten's condominium apartment is just upstairs on the seventh floor and he has been spending much of his time in the kitchen here, it could use more discipline. But when Perry St. scores, it scores much, much bigger than most restaurants, and it scores on Mr. Vongerichten's instinct for flavor and texture combinations, his usually keen sense of equilibrium and of course his recruitment of traditions and ingredients from Asia, which seduced him before others. He tempts yawns by including grilled beef tenderloin among the entrees, but then sends it to the table with an onion jam and a sour cherry mustard that was like a less zingy horseradish sauce, a less cloying steak sauce. It was just right. In dish after dish, he let crunchiness frame succulence or thrust creaminess into relief. It happened with that tuna appetizer and with an appetizer of red snapper sashimi, the soft petals of fish hooded with strands of deep-fried snapper skin, fleur de sel, Thai chili pepper and lemon, which served as a counterpoint to a pool of olive oil below the fish. It happened as well with my favorite of the desserts, a bowl of chocolate pudding distinguished by a cover of crystallized violet and a pedestal of chocolate sponge cake. Johnny Iuzzini, the pastry chef at Jean Georges, shares credit with Mr. Vongerichten for the last act of a meal at Perry St., a finish that was usually happy and never histrionic, much like everything that preceded and surrounded it. Mr. Vongerichten has chosen a new tower of spare elegance in which to settle down -- in more ways than one. He's back from the carnival. It's a welcome homecoming.

       "  'review': 'MY friend reached our table in the dungeonlike hideaway of La Esquina\\'s main dining room about 25 minutes late. Only 15 of those were her fault. A few of the additional 10 had to do with her understandable difficulty believing my instructions that the street-level portal was the one marked \"No Admittance.\" The rest of the minutes had to do with the hostess she encountered when she hesitantly approached that door. The hostess claimed not to have any record of our reservation. \"She wouldn\\'t let the guy ahead of me in either,\" my friend reported. \"We both stood there pleading.\" Finally, my friend said, a manager intervened, recognizing her as the straggler in a group already seated and green-lighting her chutes-and-ladders passage down a harshly lighted staircase, along a corridor with kitchen supplies, through the kitchen itself, and into the contrived darkness of the vault where we waited. I asked her if she was miffed. She gave me the derisive, pitying look that a sane person gives a lunatic. \"The harder it is to get in, the more fun it is to be in,\" she said, articulating a maxim of Manhattan night life and a guiding principle of La Esquina, which is sort of like Studio 54 with chipotle instead of cocaine. \"I\\'m already in love with this place.\" Over time La Esquina, which serves pared-down, priced-up Mexican food, will rise or fall on the merits of its chorizo quesadilla, chiles rellenos, pulled-pork taquito and grilled whole red snapper. But for now the buzz that whirls around it, the stampede of diners toward it and the significant pleasures it delivers boil down to its air of cunningly manufactured mystery, its speakeasy-channeling pantomime of illicit, exclusive pleasure. The unveiling of La Esquina belongs in a textbook for public relations and marketing executives. The subterranean chamber opened in mid-July without a listed phone number or a clearly marked entrance. The aforementioned portal is inside a taqueria that says \"Corner Deli\" -- La Esquina means \"the corner\" -- and bears, in addition to the words \"No Admittance,\" the words \"Employees Only.\" Those are bogus caveats in a benign conspiracy that, early on, fueled insidery Internet chatter about this enigmatic taco belle with its unspoken identity and undisclosed location. On one Web site, clues to La Esquina\\'s whereabouts included an anagram of its name. The look of the underground bar area and dining room dovetails with the furtive shtick. Within weathered brick walls are wrought-iron gates that recall the bars of an ancient prison cell, chandeliers that hold fat wax candles and murals made with tiles painted in Mexico. If the Phantom of the Opera hired Zorro as an interior designer and asked him for something in contemporary Torquemada, this might be the result. The adjacent kitchen produces food not only for this netherworld hacienda but also for an attractive street-level cafe with an entrance around the corner. It operates under the same ownership and is clearly marked La Esquina. I visited the cafe as well as the vault. What I ate in both places was always serviceable, sometimes distinguished and less frequently exemplary. As invested as it is in its pose, La Esquina also cares about its ceviches, soups, tostadas, salads and main courses, including chipotle-glazed shrimp, spit-roasted chicken and steamed mussels. It uses discernibly fresher herbs, vegetables and other ingredients than many other Mexican restaurants, and it doesn\\'t resort to easy cheats: oceans of salsa, tides of sour cream, eddies of guacamole. Its kitchen exerts a lighter touch, exemplified by the very fine corn tortillas for its taquitos and the equally fine flour tortillas for its quesadillas. But its kitchen, supervised by Richard Ampudia, who also runs Café Habana, and Jim McDuffee, doesn\\'t always cook with care or verve. Chicken and steak taquitos had stringy meat. Shrimp tostadas were excessively salty. A side of black beans was a watery wasteland. That spit-roasted chicken was overdone and the carne asada -- grilled sirloin with a chimichurri-style sauce of parsley, cilantro, jalapeño and more -- was dull. But there are enough highlights to create the possibility of a charmed meal from start to finish. Begin with the chorizo quesadilla, followed by a tostada with lump crab meat and avocado in a chipotle mayonnaise. Move on to a main course of baby back ribs rubbed with chili pepper, star anise and cinnamon, among other ingredients, then cooked in a vacuum pouch before receiving a chipotle and guava glaze during a climactic grilling. This process yielded luscious results. Make sure to try sides of grilled corn and of \"gratin de rajas,\" which combines roasted poblano peppers with Yukon gold potatoes and Manchego and Cotija cheeses. It was terrific, as was a sandwich of roasted chicken, avocado and chipotle mayonnaise that was available in the cafe but not below. The menus are slightly different. So are the moods. The underworld has more attitude and courts more chaos, to the point of being off-putting at times. On some visits, I felt rushed by servers whose outward affability concealed a furious determination to liberate tables for the welling crowd at the bar. But those servers demonstrated considerable knowledge about, and enthusiasm for, La Esquina\\'s spectacular selection of about 100 tequilas. After a shot or two, the smartly chosen music -- Nina Simone, Soul II Soul, Nouvelle Vague -- seems to swell louder, but not so loud that eavesdropping becomes impossible. My tardy friend overheard several young women ask a waiter if the vault could be breached without a reservation. He told them that they were probably attractive enough to manage it, but that there were no guarantees. I bet that the hedged forecast thrilled them, and that they circled back nights later to join a crowd hungry for more than fried plantains and cactus salad.

       "  'review': 'THERE are many reasons to envy New York restaurant chefs these days, from the kitchen gadgetry at their disposal to their likelihood of receiving major publishing contracts. I for one covet their commutes. To arrive at his new restaurant, Perry St., in the West Village, Jean-Georges Vongerichten takes neither subway nor bus, taxi nor limousine. He travels via elevator, from the seventh floor of the condominium building in which he lives to the first. Daniel Boulud can use the stairs: his apartment is just one floor up from his flagship restaurant, Daniel, on the Upper East Side. And so can Scott and Heather Fratangelo, who live smack above their restaurant, Spigolo, also on the Upper East Side. For the Fratangelos, deciding how to get to work simply means choosing a pair of shoes. They can match their mode of transportation to the rest of their outfits. This arrangement doesn\\'t allow them much of a sense of separation between home and work. But it lets the Fratangelos, both 30 years old, dote on and fret over Spigolo, which has only about 25 seats and a half dozen bar stools. Both the degree and nature of their attentiveness show. Spigolo, which serves unpretentious Italian food in an uncontrived setting, feels unusually honest and earnest. And it feels that way from the moment you walk through the door. \"Oh, yes, hello!\" said Heather Fratangelo, who plays the role of hostess as well as pastry chef, on a warm Sunday evening in early July, when the loss of neighborhood residents to distant beaches was still evident on the becalmed sidewalks and streets. Her exuberant manner of greeting me had nothing to do with desperation -- despite the weekend exodus, Spigolo was full -- and the tone of familiarity in her voice suggested we had met many times before. We had in fact met only once, and that was 10 minutes earlier, when I had glanced briefly into the restaurant to see if my guests were there. But in Spigolo\\'s intensely hospitable world, that glance was enough to make me a veritable regular, and a summery lavender outfit worn by one of my guests, who trailed after me, was enough to prompt additional endearments. \"That\\'s such a pretty dress,\" Ms. Fratangelo said. If she didn\\'t really mean it, Cherry Jones better watch out. There\\'s an even better actress in town. While Ms. Fratangelo supervises the dining room, Mr. Fratangelo minds the kitchen, and does so with a similar grace and confidence. Although he is young and Spigolo is his first chance to run his own show, he doesn\\'t make the mistakes of flamboyant inventiveness and annoyingly cheeky conceits. The menu follows an instantly recognizable contemporary Italian layout: salumi and uncooked seafood in the prologue, followed by separate chapters of appetizers, pasta dishes and main courses, and then of course dessert, which is when his wife\\'s hugely pleasing culinary efforts come into play. It\\'s possible to take an unpersuasive journey through this narrative, because Spigolo\\'s dishes aren\\'t uniformly terrific. I recall an excessively sauced saltimbocca-like breast of veal, a somewhat dry red snapper, and a loin of lamb sliced into such thin ribbons that it surrendered much of its meaty appeal, becoming something daintier and droopier in the process. I remember an insufficiently thick risotto that came close to impersonating soup (and not even bisque at that). But more -- many more -- of my memories of Spigolo are extremely fond ones. Mr. Fratangelo excels at seafood and has put a grill in his kitchen that enables him to cook it over charcoal, which puts a distinctive stamp on it. During my visits, the terrific results included appetizers of plump jumbo shrimp and of tiny baby octopuses, the latter rendered especially pliant and zesty by a pregrill braising in white wine and chili peppers and a subsequent bath in preserved lemons, lemon juice and olive oil. Also grilled and also first-rate was a fairly straightforward salmon fillet, which was given robust accompaniment: charred corn, a mixture of oyster and shiitake mushrooms, and pea shoots. Mr. Fratangelo tends to cover his plates with many vegetables and herbs in different colors and shapes. These supporting players are at once pedestals, skirts and side dishes, and he doesn\\'t mold them into geometric wonders, because his purpose isn\\'t showmanship. What he\\'s clearly after is a sense of bounty and a bevy of familiar, comforting flavors. And he achieved precisely that with a main course of pan-roasted wild striped bass. The fish was just about as succulent and satisfying as it could be, and had a contrasting layer of crisp skin atop it. Below and around it were tomatoes, eggplant, red onion, brined capers, olives, pine nuts and more: a caponata that brought the Mediterranean sharply to mind. Mr. Fratangelo also has a few terrific pasta dishes up his sleeve. He makes his own fettuccine, adding lemon zest to the dough, and serves it in a bracing pesto that blends arugula with basil but edits out nuts and cheese. He doesn\\'t make his own garganelli, but no matter: the noodles he buys are combined with a sweet fennel sausage ragù and Parmesan cheese to delightful effect. Given all these options, it would be easy for a diner to fill up before dessert. It would also be foolish. While none of Ms. Fratangelo\\'s creations were blazingly original, almost all were irresistible, including a caramel affogato with sugary doughnuts and a mixed berry cobbler with vanilla gelato. Spigolo means \"edge\" or \"corner,\" and the corner-lot theater for this feast seems, at first glance, just about perfect: exposed brick walls that create a rustic aura, handsome glass doors that let in streams of light. But the hard surfaces translate into the kind of earsplitting noise you usually associate with a bigger, slicker, less intimate restaurant. The Fratangelos have hired an acoustic consultant to help them find a solution to this problem, which could easily deter diners and possibly annoy the neighbors. Lucky for the Fratangelos, they needn\\'t worry about complaints from the apartment closest to Spigolo. If the restaurant is at full tilt, that residence is empty. Spigolo  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  1561 Second Avenue (81st Street); (212)744-1100.

       "  'review': 'THE restaurant Taboon was built from the ground up in a peculiar and particular sense. Its back story is a tale of love and parquet. Its owners, Danny Hodak and Gadi Ruham, run a successful New York City wood flooring business, and over the years their list of prominent clients grew to include many restaurants and restaurateurs. They installed or maintained the floors at Mesa Grill. At Gotham Bar and Grill. At the home of its chef, Alfred Portale. Perhaps inevitably, Mr. Hodak and Mr. Ruham found themselves intrigued by the people whose work they so literally supported. Romance turned that interest into action. In the late 1990\\'s, Mr. Hodak traveled to Tel Aviv and met an Israeli woman, who later moved to New York and married him. Her brother-in-law, Haim Cohen, is a celebrity chef in Israel. Using Mr. Cohen\\'s counsel on a menu and a cook from one of his restaurants, Mr. Hodak and Mr. Ruham opened Taboon a year and half ago. Of the infinite ways that restaurants spring into being, Taboon\\'s is surely among the more unusual, and I probably wouldn\\'t find it charming if the result had been a bust. But Taboon puts a deft, sophisticated spin on Middle Eastern food, and it\\'s better on the far side of its first anniversary than it was at the start. I visited it back then, and I recall loving the restaurant\\'s bread, a kind of halfway point between focaccia and pizza, rubbed with olive oil and sprinkled with rosemary and sage. I recall liking the restaurant\\'s ambience. Its corner lot in a relatively tranquil patch of Clinton means two walls of windows and an airy, open, lulling feel, which is accentuated by cinched white curtains, white brick and white tables. But the quality of the food was erratic, and the sluggish service left more than a bit to be desired. I gave Taboon another try about a month and a half ago and had a very different experience. Just about every dish was superb, beginning with an appetizer of falafel: four sublimely seasoned balls, crunchy on the outside but not at all dry within. Each had a sort of orange squib atop it, a surprising and welcome engine for a hint of tartness and a rumor of sweetness. It was pickled mango, and it illustrated Taboon\\'s habit of inventively and smartly tweaking Middle Eastern staples. On that visit we also had Taboon\\'s terrific oversize lamb kebabs, which are really more like quenelle-shaped hamburgers. They are made from ground lamb, parsley and pistachio nuts and drizzled with an extraordinary tahini sauce that Mr. Hodak told me he imports from a vendor in Nablus in the West Bank. We had Taboon\\'s remarkably moist halibut, plump wedges of which were submerged in a robust ragout of tomato, red pepper, paprika, harissa and cumin. And we had efficient, even ebullient, service from a waiter who was clearly as excited about promoting Taboon\\'s food as we were about eating it. The quality of Taboon\\'s service fluctuated over subsequent visits, including one night when servers circled back to our table so infrequently and did such a heroic job of avoiding eye contact with us that we had to plead loudly for their attention, which even then wasn\\'t guaranteed. But except for a smattering of disappointments (a rubbery octopus appetizer, a boring branzino entree, run-of-the-mill short ribs) and a lackluster roster of desserts, Taboon\\'s food remained impressive, and no meal was without its formidable pleasures. One of these was Taboon\\'s hummus, which carries an extra, unexpected jolt: jalapeño. The seared zucchini cakes, made with feta and Parmesan cheeses and fresh mint, were another. The hummus and zucchini cakes may be the best meze, or appetizers, although a case can be made for the kube: fried pockets of bulgur wheat filled with ground skirt steak, onion and pine nuts, among other ingredients. Possibly the best main course is a half chicken, the leg of which is deboned and filled with cured lemon. The meat is then arranged around portobello mushrooms and a pool of kale-flavored polenta, and it was succulent enough the two times I tried it to suggest that poultry should never be cooked in any vessel that doesn\\'t burn wood and isn\\'t walled with brick. At Taboon, it\\'s all about that oven. The restaurant\\'s name is an Arabic word for oven. The restaurant is laid out so that the special oven, mammoth and domed, with a coat of white concrete over the bricks, snatches your gaze and demands your attention the moment you walk through the door. Like the chicken and halibut, almost every hot dish spends at least some time in this hive-like chamber, which imparts a faintly woodsy, smoky quality to its charges and perfumes the air. It\\'s the Kathleen Turner of cooking implements: a fiery diva at center stage. And Efi Nahon, the chef whom Mr. Cohen trained back in Tel Aviv, knows how to coax an expert performance from it. His efforts are complemented by a relatively concise but interesting wine list, which adequately and affordably represents not only the most prolific countries (France, Italy) but also less heralded ones (Greece, Israel). The selections of wine by the glass change frequently, an example of a general courteousness at Taboon that transcends the unpredictable service. The milk for coffee arrived heated. Smokers are given an area out front with a bench, several chairs, potted plants and a proper ashtray. Mr. Hodak still holds on to his other venture, Norwegian Wood, which he said recently worked on Jean-Georges Vongerichten\\'s new condominium on Perry Street. Mr. Hodak and Mr. Ruham are decidedly less practiced restaurateurs than he, and Mr. Hodak said in our telephone conversation that he made many mistakes over Taboon\\'s first year. But, he said, he got one detail absolutely right. \"I put in a stone floor,\" he said, later adding: \"My business is maintaining wood floors. I know the hell involved.\" Taboon  **  [rating: two stars]  773 Tenth Avenue (52nd Street), Clinton; (212)713-0271.

       "  'review': 'RICE runs rampant. Always has. It does a pantomime of subservience, deferring to the sliver of hamachi astride it or the lobster tail and chorizo in its saffron embrace. But playing humble is easy once you\\'ve already insinuated your way into so many dishes and cuisines. And pasta? An unsinkable showboat. Few carbohydrates could have triumphed so handily over Atkins and South Beach. But pasta thrives, insistent and ineluctable, like Paris Hilton. Couscous, on the other hand, needs lessons in self-assertion, a better publicist, maybe even its own reality show on Fox. There\\'s no reason it should occupy such an underexposed niche among starchy, grain-based canvases for meat, fish and vegetables, no reason it should be so peripheral a side dish. It\\'s fluffy and flexible. And it\\'s all over the menu at Barbès, a Moroccan-French restaurant that attracts notice for that reason among others. Barbès is situated in -- well, it\\'s not easy to say. Although it is in the middle of Manhattan, it doesn\\'t really feel like a part of any distinct precinct, and a diner could spend part of his or her time here playing name that neighborhood. Empire State Building Mews? Herald Square Glens? Western Murray Hill is perhaps the technical answer, but Barbès really exists in a generic, low-energy limbo, which may partly explain why it takes its name from a section of another city. Barbès refers to a heavily Moroccan area of Paris. Morocco and France of course have a long, fraught history, and the arrangement between their cuisines at Barbès is less a matter of fusion than of time sharing. On the dinner menu, one tradition gets two or three lines of the appetizer or entree section, then the other gets a line or two. And so it goes, as a satisfying duck confit salad makes way for an excellent skewer of lamb with harissa and a respectable steak frites with green peppercorn sauce cedes the stage to the \"couscous royale,\" a hugely appealing and generously portioned platform for chunks of lamb, chicken and merguez sausage. The Moroccan dishes aren\\'t necessarily the better ones -- the food at Barbès is maddeningly uneven -- but they\\'re the most interesting, because they\\'re the least commonplace. While the American and European romance with Morocco is a robust one, illustrated by the instantly resonant names of so many of the cities (Casablanca, Tangier, Marrakesh) under that sheltering sky, Moroccan cuisine doesn\\'t claim much real estate in New York. Its meat of choice is lamb, sometimes served as a tagine, which refers both to the high-hooded earthenware vessel in which it\\'s slowly cooked and to the resulting stew. Its go-to seasonings include cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, saffron, ginger and paprika, all of which recur in dishes at Barbès. The restaurant\\'s chef and co-owner, Abdellah Ksiyer, is Moroccan. He opened Barbès early last year with Omar Balouma, who is Algerian and operates a Moroccan party-planning business called Omar the Tent Man. That name suggests a tendency toward shtick that, blessedly, doesn\\'t get a thorough workout at Barbès. It keeps the midnight-at-the-oasis motifs to a minimum. The simple, square, 50-seat room has a medium-size palm tree in the middle, marbled orange walls and interesting, triple-tiered Moroccan fixtures that hang from a wood-beam ceiling. Barbès could otherwise be mistaken for any old bistro, and some of its food has the straightforward appeal of bistro fare. Both that skewer of grilled lamb and a skewer of grilled chicken boasted tender meat redolent of the vegetables, herbs and spices in which it had been marinated: red onions, shallots, cumin and saffron for the lamb; saffron, powdered ginger and coriander seed for the chicken. The skewers were accompanied by a profusion of springy, lightly dressed greens, which exemplified the restaurant\\'s welcome habit of buttressing the main features of its dishes with fresh, unsullied produce. Arguably the best appetizer is a salad sampler that showcases the restaurant\\'s hummus, which has the magically light texture of whipped cream, and its zaalouk, a divinely smoky mash of eggplant, tomato, cumin, paprika and lemon juice. Sadly, the triangles of pita for the hummus verged on stale. The most adventurous appetizer and entree are similar dishes in different sizes and shapes: small triangles, dubbed briouats, in the first case; a large brick, dubbed a pistilla, in the second. Both encase chicken, caramelized onions, egg and an array of Moroccan seasonings in shells of thin pastry, which are then dusted with powdered sugar and cinnamon. This confluence of savory and sweet puts a much greater, more arresting emphasis on sweet than a diner typically encounters before dessert. It warrants a try. The tagines -- lamb, chicken or fish, the type of which changes regularly -- arrive in majestic pots, and the theater trumped the eating. The lamb, served with prunes, was leathery. The chicken had a faint, under-seasoned flavor, like run-of-the-mill, therapeutic chicken soup. \"I suppose it would be good if you had a Moroccan cold,\" quipped a companion. A crab cake appetizer wouldn\\'t be good under any circumstances, so paltry was the discernible presence of crab, as if it weren\\'t an ingredient in the construction of the cake so much as a vaguely crustaceous thought in the mind of the person constructing it. Desserts skewed French -- chocolate mousse, crème brûlée -- and tasted pro forma. But the couscous was good in all circumstances. Couscous is steamed granular semolina, airy and sandy, with a mouth-feel all its own. Barbès alternately gussied it up with raisins and placed petals of chicken breast atop it in the \"couscous au poulet\"; laced it with basil and skirted it with diced tomatoes as an accompaniment for grilled shrimp; and seasoned it with ginger, paprika and a touch of cumin in that busy \"royale.\" Mr. Ksiyer apparently steams his couscous four times, an elaborate process with a pillowy payoff. In his worshipful hands, couscous could rattle rice\\'s hegemony. It could even put linguine on the defensive. Barbès  * [Rating: One Star]  21 East 36th Street, Murray Hill; (212)684-0215. ATMOSPHERE -- A simple square room with a few Moroccan flourishes and the feel of a bistro.  SOUND LEVEL -- Extremely noisy along banquettes when restaurant is crowded.  RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Zaalouk and hummus; lentil salad; lamb skewer with harissa; chicken skewer with yogurt cucumber sauce; briouats of chicken; shrimp with pesto couscous; couscous with lamb, chicken and merguez sausage.

Dinner appetizers, $7.75 to $12.95; entrees, $15.75 to $26.75; desserts, $7.  HOURS -- 11 a.m. to midnight Monday through Friday and, until Labor Day, 4 p.m. to midnight Saturday and Sunday. After Labor Day, 11 a.m. to midnight Saturday and Sunday.  RESERVATIONS -- Often possible on the same day, but for prime dinner times, call two or three days ahead to be safe.

       "  'review': 'IF you\\'re the kind of well-fed, restaurant-knowledgeable New Yorker who doles out recommendations about where to eat, there are three syllables that regularly escape your lips, a ready answer for what acquaintances want when they know vaguely, but not precisely, what they want. A place with sophisticated food but not a whiff of arrogance about it? The Red Cat. A place that looks good but not too good, that simmers attractively without sizzling flamboyantly? The Red Cat. Somewhere you can treat a business associate or a family member to a dinner that feels sufficiently special and not bust the bank? The Red Cat. Somewhere you can take someone who might be a date (but, then again, might not) and leave your designs ambiguous, your options open. Hint: a domesticated animal in a popular color for fast cars. By turns cozy and sexy, laid-back and fleet, the Red Cat is a restaurant Rorschach, different things at different times to different people, which is just what its owners, Jimmy Bradley and Danny Abrams, intended. The simultaneously prosaic and cryptic name they gave it alludes to nothing, connotes nothing. It\\'s a phrase to be imbued with whatever meaning the imbuing party deems fit. Mr. Bradley and Mr. Abrams did not want to be pigeonholed into any one tidy theme or identity, so they jumbled the decorative motifs, hanging Moroccan lanterns from the ceilings, putting framed paintings and photographs on the walls and using reclaimed barn wood from Pennsylvania, some of it painted red and some white, as paneling. The Red Cat feels vaguely colonial and tavernlike, except when it feels downtown-gallery cool, and apart from those moments when it feels modestly and eclectically elegant. Choose your mood. The menu is more coherent, more of a piece. It doesn\\'t take ethnic sides. But it fairly consistently mines a middle ground between Continental and new American, timeless Mediterranean and of-the-moment Manhattan, where unabashedly hearty preparations and ingredients meet seasonal produce and whimsical flourishes, where comfort and classicism welcome innovation without letting it run roughshod. It\\'s an immensely appealing place, recently inhabited by a loin of rabbit wrapped in pancetta and surrounded by fava beans, cipollini onions and dates. On many menus this dish would be an entree, but Mr. Bradley, the restaurant\\'s chef, does it as an appetizer. In a similar vein he includes among the starters a baby lamb chop Milanese, which is encrusted with mustard and panko and skirted with baked tomatoes, olives and capers. Mr. Bradley loves Italy, and so there is also a simple, excellent appetizer of sautéed zucchini slivers with pecorino cheese and toasted almonds. But his heart is roomy enough to open the door to potato pierogi sautéed in plenty of butter and paired with hon shimeji mushrooms and chunks of poached lobster. He bends to accommodate trends and has lately been serving a seared tuna appetizer, albeit one with real personality, thanks to currents of curry and a chili pepper vinaigrette. He accommodates lighter appetites with a delightful salad with chevrot cheese, pear and pumpkin seeds. The menu changes frequently, so some of those dishes will soon be retired or significantly tweaked. But you can count on encountering the zucchini sauté, a Red Cat staple, along with green beans tempura, an addictive side dish with a dipping sauce of extra-zingy honey mustard -- honey mustard on steroids. You can count on a terrific pork tenderloin among the entrees. It is bathed before cooking in a sugar marinade, and served with morels. You can count on an expertly grilled shell steak. You can count on the rest of the entrees running a predictable but sensible gamut: chicken and duck; salmon or Arctic char; cod or black bass or such. You can count on plates that are composed generously, with a bounty of vegetables and sometimes a whole extra dimension, like the richly satisfying vegetable risotto on which Mr. Bradley placed cod. And you can pretty much count on careful cooking. A skate wing was ideally crispy on the outside without being remotely dry on the inside. The Red Cat opened in 1999, when it received one star in The New York Times from William Grimes. Its location, on a fringe of Chelsea, among a growing gallery scene, seemed much more remote then than now, but the Red Cat has never relied solely on its neighborhood for business. Its fluid, flexible nature is such that it seems -- and is -- in equal measures a local joint and a destination. It\\'s the exceedingly rare place that can often take a reservation only a few days in advance and yet is almost always packed. Some of the locals eat at the bar -- and began doing so here long before that practice became a citywide fashion. The Red Cat was also ahead of the curve in grouping the wines on its list not by country but by character: \"Floral Whites,\" \"Sangiovese, Nebbiolo and Earthy Reds.\" It has been a prolific sire: first of the Harrison, which has a slightly stiffer posture; then of the Mermaid Inn, which frolics casually in the surf; and most recently of Pace, which went full-on Italian and stumbled a bit. None have quite the Red Cat\\'s easy confidence or irresistible spirit. Mr. Bradley even roasts and serves suckling pig here every Sunday. That\\'s a Red Cat kind of thing to do. Dishes at the Red Cat do not rise to sublime heights; that\\'s not a Red Cat thing. Not all the desserts are as terrific as a rocky road sundae and an orange panna cotta, and a cookie sampler is entirely forgettable. The intensely friendly service can turn spacey, as when no one remembered to put a requested candle in the dessert of a friend who was celebrating a birthday. But I always leave the Red Cat happy. It doesn\\'t have the best this or the best that. It isn\\'t a star pitcher or a marquee shortstop. It\\'s an expert utility player, and maybe that\\'s what red cat means -- or should mean from now on. The Red Cat  ** [Rating: Two stars]  227 10th Avenue (23rd Street), Chelsea; (212)242-1122. ATMOSPHERE -- A quietly stylish cross between a neighborhood tavern and a snazzier destination restaurant.  SOUND LEVEL -- Lively but not oppressive.  RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Potato pierogi; lamb chop Milanese; sautéed zucchini; loin of rabbit; green beans tempura; skate wing; pork tenderloin; rocky road sundae; orange panna cotta; chocolate soufflée cake.

       "  'review': 'THE gates of the ancient Greek underworld were patrolled by a pooch with multiple snouts and a mean streak. The gates of Koi are patrolled by a man with a single clipboard and an aloof mien. He makes sure that no one without a reservation slips past, but his snarling purpose is as much a messenger\\'s as a guard\\'s. He wants the diners who breach this sanctum to believe that they have made a heroically privileged passage. If they visit Koi during one of the kitchen\\'s better moments, explore the menu\\'s sunniest regions and don\\'t mind a cacophonous din, they may well feel that way. But that\\'s a pretty big if. While this restaurant has some fine ideas, first-rate ingredients and propitious convergences of the two, such high points are trampled and toppled by a more consistent mediocrity and a profusion of errors. Like an aged pop star on the latest of several proclaimed farewell tours, Koi ultimately relies on pose more than performance. Many utterly respectable restaurants bungle one dish of every five or one dinner of every three. Koi\\'s success rate during my visits was worse than that. The kitchen\\'s mistakes piled up: cold and soggy vegetable tempura; overcooked meat; a couple of instances of seafood that tasted like it had been carelessly stored. Koi sunk on occasion to depths lower than any restaurant this vain and expensive should allow itself. An entrée of ginger-glazed Alaskan king crab legs consisted of stringy flesh under a cloying varnish. It tasted like a canned seafood candy bar, so odd and unappealing that the friend who ordered it justifiably said she wouldn\\'t have felt any more dispirited if a server had mugged her for the $27 that the dish cost. An entrée of what the menu advertised as Kobe-style beef had the dusky color, dreary texture and quotidian flavor of reheated pot roast. The pan-seared meat had been ordered medium-rare, but much of it was closer to medium-well, and if its provenance was indeed some preserve of specially pampered cattle, I predict a bovine class action suit in the offing. Those cows should be growing much fatter, happier and more flavorful than this. Koi recreates a popular, buzz-bedecked establishment with the same name and same principal owner in Los Angeles, and it belongs to a well-worn Japanese genre that includes, in Manhattan, Megu, Geisha, Ono, Matsuri and En Japanese Brasserie. These restaurants invest in flashy design, mix colorful cocktails and construct menus that hedge any daring bets with the safety of sushi rolls and versions of dishes popularized by Nobu, the less flamboyant, more dependable sire of this expanding brood. Koi\\'s design is indeed flashy, pivoting on leafy bamboo stalks along some walls and an enormous, latticed white canopy that evokes both the honeycombs of a beehive and the intersecting strands of a spider\\'s web. Koi made me feel like an insect, and I say that with gratitude for a new sensation in a city that frequently seems to have run through all the possible ones already. Sometimes Koi even made me happy. Its miso-bronzed black cod, one of the many homages to Nobu, was as pleasant as it promised to be. A hangar steak had a delightful dusting of sansho pepper on its nicely charred exterior. Poached halibut with maitake mushrooms and steamed Chilean sea bass with shiitake mushrooms were both carefully cooked and prudently garnished, the fish in each case allowed to speak ably for itself. And a few of Koi\\'s signature experiments in Asian fusion or Asian reinterpretation -- petals of hamachi brushed not only with soy sauce, wasabi and yuzu but also with white truffle essence; petals of albacore bathed in ponzu and basil -- yielded intriguing, honorable results. Perhaps best of all, during one dinner visit, was the restaurant\\'s crispy rice with spicy tuna. This dish tweaks the usual approach to sushi by frying the rice cake, ideally to a golden, crunchy state that provides a wonderful textural contrast to the fish atop it. But during another dinner visit a soggy cake minimized that contrast, foiling the dish. The excessively gooey dressing in a \"spicy shrimp tempura\" hand roll wasn\\'t remotely spicy, nor was the tempura remotely crisp. Koi concocts an ambitious array of sauces, trying to balance fiery and sweet and sometimes succeeding. But it treats the flesh these sauces accompany in perfunctory ways. A pan-seared chicken breast with a tamarind dressing was dry. A roasted duck breast with a sriracha dressing had little character and could have easily been passed off as another meat. Slices of chu-toro sashimi were gray around the edges and shockingly fishy. A companion and I immediately stopped eating them, and our ebullient server never noticed or asked why. His tendency toward distraction was a rampant affliction, shared by the rest of the Koi-stone Kops, who alternately forgot to deliver side orders, tried to deliver another table\\'s food to ours and poured boiling tea into a wineglass that was being used for iced tea. The hostesses at a front counter often failed to acknowledge us for many minutes on end. More than once, my companions and I were escorted to tables that turned out to be occupied, and we had to stand in the center of the dining room while a hostess circled back to the front to recheck the seating chart. There was a haphazard quality to almost every aspect of Koi beyond its eye-catching props and pulse-pounding music. What seems to matter most to its managers are a sexy setting, a chic vibe and an exclusive air, which brings us back to the human watchdog at the gates. Koi isn\\'t the only restaurant to employ this Cerberus-like breed or to have some justification, in terms of traffic management and crowd control, for doing so. But it\\'s a restaurant whose shortcomings are neatly signaled and summarized by that sentry. Attitude reigns here. The discipline and diligence required for dependably good meals have not yet made it through the door. Koi  Satisfactory  40 West 40th Street, in the Bryant Park Hotel; (212)921-3330.

       "  'review': '\"I HAVEN\\'T been here in three years,\" one gentlemen said to another as they passed my table at Periyali the other night. \"Do you remember what the food was like?\" his companion asked him. I didn\\'t hear the answer. But the question made me think: at many pricey Manhattan restaurants, summoning the memory of an experience from three years ago would produce a misleading compass for the journey ahead. The passage of three years would guarantee a tweaking of the concept, a reshuffle in the kitchen or at least the arrival of a slate of new dishes and an expansion of the spice cabinet to include coriander and cardamom. Not at Periyali. This restaurant served octopus marinated in red wine back then, and it serves octopus marinated in red wine now. Time marches on; the moussaka at Periyali stands still. If you remember what Periyali was like 3 years or 10 years or even 15 years ago, you know what it\\'s like today. And you know that it\\'s a lulling antidote to the frequent overdoses of restless innovation and runaway imagination at other restaurants. That it\\'s a pleasant sigh of a place, and a bit, but only a bit, of a yawn. That you eat simply here and you eat well: fish grilled over charcoal and sprinkled with lemon; lamb and beef seasoned with nothing more daring than rosemary and thyme. Periyali is the same as it ever was, right down to the décor: white stucco walls, enormous bouquets of fresh flowers and a ceiling of undulating white linen, which poetically evokes sails as it serves the more prosaic purpose of muffling noise. Periyali is as calm and calming as the Aegean on a windless day. While it\\'s strange to think of a restaurant this retiring as a trailblazer, Periyali indeed was one. When it opened 18 years ago, upscale Greek was an oxymoron, a gyro-defying leap of imagination and faith. Its owners, Steve Tzolis and Nicola Kotsoni, had made a success out of Il Cantinori, an Italian restaurant featuring rustic food in a polished, handsome setting, and fellow Greeks who dined there would constantly ask where to find a Greek analogue to it. There was none, Ms. Kotsoni said in a recent telephone interview. She and Mr. Tzolis decided that there should be, that if a refined trattoria could work, so could a refined taverna. Besides, she said, they found a location on West 20th Street that limited their financial risk. \"We were paying $700 a month in rent,\" she said, laughing. \"We thought it was O.K. to take a chance.\" So they did, creating a restaurant devoted to some of the fish and meat best loved in Greece, where they were born. (They met later, in New York.) Their influence on Manhattan was subtle, gradual and certain, visible today in the restaurants Estiatorio Milos, Molyvos and Thalassa. Greek didn\\'t exactly become the new French, the new Italian, the new anything. It\\'s a cuisine with less variety and ambition than those, rooted in a poorer and less populous country with less vanity about its culinary traditions. But Greek became something more than leaden spanakopita that sits and sags in a display case for half the day. Periyali\\'s spanakopita, served as an appetizer, had a flaky, wonderful pastry shell when I sampled it. Fried rings of calamari, also served as an appetizer, had a similar lightness and delicacy. They made all those reckless pub versions seem like so many oily bread crumbs with specious claims to maritime paternity. Other appetizers ranged from modestly delightful (smoked trout with an emphatic presence of dill; puréed yellow split peas with red onion) to extremely satisfying (sautéed sweetbreads over gigante beans; sautéed chicken livers over lentils). The best of the appetizer bunch was the octopus. New Yorkers are currently enjoying an octopus renaissance, an octopus apotheosis, with restaurants as different as BLT Fish and Ama having cinched preparations that render this flesh unusually pliant. I like to think that Periyali, which marinates its octopus for two days, paved the way. It grills its octopus over charcoal, which is also how it cooks many of its seafood entrees. I tried branzino, dorade, red snapper and shrimp, all faintly crisp and moist. Periyali grills its lamb chops and its kebabs of filet mignon with similarly delightful results. The recurring virtues of its entrees are fine flesh treated with restraint, generous portions and fully composed plates -- some broccoli here, some couscous there -- incorporating side dishes, which many other restaurants list separately. The final bill at Periyali seldom shocks. The less austere preparations include veal medallions in a sauce of veal jus and wild mushrooms; a dish of cubed lamb, mushrooms, pine nuts and feta cheese, all swaddled in a fluffy phyllo comforter; and, of course, the moussaka, which managed the difficult trick of being rich but not smothering. Nothing at Periyali proves hugely intriguing. Nothing wows. But the little touches add up slowly and nicely. I think of the terrific mix of Greek olives at the start of the meal and the creamy quality of the Greek yogurt that mingles with honey and walnuts in the simplest and best of a limited selection of desserts. The ambience also has a way of sneaking up on you. Tables here are not squished together, and the series of rooms go deep enough, culminating in an enclosed garden, to give the restaurant a truly spacious feel. There have indeed been some changes over the years. The Greek wines on the primarily Greek wine list are more varied and better, a reflection of Greece\\'s strides in that department. The first chef left, turning the kitchen over to Thomas Xanthopoulos. But that happened 17 years ago. Mr. Xanthopoulos has been cooking here ever since. He performs with relative anonymity in these cult-of-chef times and with admirable steadiness. One of my companions could not recall ever having a bad meal at Periyali, where he had dined repeatedly. How often? About every three years, he said. That seems to be a common span of time between visits to Periyali. Diners should shorten it.

       "  'review': 'PARTING company with most literary scholars, utopianists and ovo-lacto vegetarians, I like to think that when Henry David Thoreau wrote in \"Walden\" that he wanted to \"live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,\" he wasn\\'t dabbling in metaphor. He was fantasizing about dinner, his pent-up carnivorous impulses breaking through his reputed meatless resolve. To live deep is to eat deep, at least in my book, and nothing gets at the unfettered, unrefined core of things like marrow, so obscenely rich, so absurdly fatty, so enticingly suspended in a gelatinous limbo between liquid and solid. If that description disgusts you, I want you with me the next time I dine at the Stone Park Cafe, because you are unlikely to encroach on my appetizer of roasted marrow bones. If your hunger is primed, I respect you profoundly but want you far away from my table. Stone Park Cafe isn\\'t the only New York restaurant that serves marrow bones. Prune, in the East Village, has been cooking them for years, and they are also available at Landmarc in TriBeCa. But marrow bones don\\'t pop up often. When they do, you immediately know a few things. You know that a restaurant is willing to flout conformity and flirt with adventure and to do so in an earthy rather than a prissy way. You know it appreciates and indulges a basic kind of gluttony. Stone Park Cafe has those virtues and more. The marrow bones belong to a menu that is sagely balanced between curiosity-piquing surprises and consoling favorites, one that establishes a personality of sophisticated robustness while accommodating many predilections and moods. Among the appetizers are plenty of unexpected dishes or dishes with clever twists. Instead of crab cakes, Stone Park serves bluefish cakes, taming the assertiveness and oiliness of the fish by smoking it with alder chips and then flaking, breading and pan-searing it. The result was terrific, and the restaurant garnished the crisp cakes with a fantastic slaw that used celery root in place of cabbage and threw in capers. A palm-size short-rib sandwich arrived with a fried quail\\'s egg perched atop the meat and poised to bathe it in an extra, unnecessary and wholly appreciated measure of moistness. Tempura-style oysters came with lightly fried caperberries. There are also more predictable starters: a frisée aux lardons, grilled artichoke, an asparagus risotto. Stone Park clearly intends to be the kind of restaurant where you can take your finicky brother-in-law, just back from the farmer\\'s market, and your grumpy teenager, just back from the multiplex. It\\'s smart and self-protective enough to proceed more conservatively with entrees, to know that diners become less daring when the stakes rise higher than the modest portions and prices of appetizers. And so there is a grilled pork chop and a grilled sirloin and seared salmon and seared scallops. But there\\'s also braised rabbit, which was appreciably more tender than similar dishes at more expensive restaurants in Manhattan. Stone Park is yet another example of the expanded dining options in Brooklyn in general and on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope in particular. It keeps company with Blue Ribbon and Al di Là and can hold its head high among them. It opened last September, the lovingly realized dream of two childhood friends, Josh Foster and Josh Grinker. Mr. Grinker supervises the kitchen with Tracy Young. All three learned their restaurant ropes elsewhere and are striking out on their own for the first time. They took a rundown bodega, broke through its rear wall to connect to a garage and then decorated the expanded space in a pleasant, modest fashion, making generous use of exposed brick and Brazilian cherrywood floors. Stone Park has few airs: if the L-shape bar isn\\'t crowded, the servers will tell you to throw your coats and stow your bags on and around the stools closest to the wall. Those servers sometimes seem overextended, their interactions with the table rushed or perfunctory. But the restaurant feels utterly comfortable in a way that more polished ones sometimes don\\'t, and it\\'s full of happy discoveries. When one of my dining companions ordered a cosmopolitan, I inwardly groaned, but the server steered her toward a marvelous one made with a passion fruit purée. I confess to stealing more sips than a mere appraisal needed. The cooking is careful, and the flourishes and grace notes are prudent. Only once in my repeated visits did the kitchen clearly misfire, sending out a seriously overdone roasted chicken. But a grilled rib-eye for two, seasoned with hints of rosemary, was as tender as could be, and so was the grilled pork chop, flanked by a heap of homemade applesauce. An excellent eight-ounce hamburger was crisply charred on the outside, juicy in the center and could be ordered with a choice of accessories that included blue cheese, which I always appreciate. For diners who want a less conventional sandwich, there is a grilled wedge of fish -- tilapia when I was there, mahi mahi or grouper at other times -- with avocado and chipotle mayonnaise on top and plantain chips on the side. I loved it. Desserts were the weakest part of my meals at Stone Park. While an apple and blueberry crisp was satisfying enough, a buttermilk panna cotta had little flavor, and the tangerine mint sauce around it tasted slightly medicinal. This restaurant nonetheless deserves to be a hit. Its charms will only multiply when the weather becomes warmer and it supplements the 55 seats inside with 25 outside, facing the leafy square from which it takes its name. Sadly, summer isn\\'t marrow weather, so now is the time for this dish, which is made with beef bones, as it usually is. You spoon out dabs of the marrow, slather them on grilled peasant bread and sprinkle them generously with sea salt. Then you take a big lusty bite, at which point you find yourself in any truly committed carnivore\\'s utopia. Stone Park Cafe  324 Fifth Avenue (Third Street), Park Slope, Brooklyn; (718)369-0082.

       "  'review': \"I AM ashamed of my past. Horrified by it, really. I need to glance back only a little more than a decade to catch a glimpse of my wantonness, to see myself treating something precious as if it were just so much flesh. When it came to sushi, I was a cad. I degraded it with excess wasabi paste, and my use of soy sauce was nothing short of promiscuous. Then again, there wasn't an abundance of exemplary sushi or expert sushi chefs back then. All too often the fish, overly chewy, and the rice, needlessly clumpy, didn't deserve gentler treatment. At Gari, a new Japanese restaurant on the Upper West Side, they do. I would never drag Gari's sushi carelessly through a salty, spicy murk. Gari's sushi would be especially ill served by that impulse, because much of it is prepared with more intricate and emphatic seasoning than sushi typically is. Any additional embellishments would distort the chefs' artful compositions and overload a diner's palate, which already has plenty to ponder. One night, for example, an omakase sushi tasting menu included a thin sliver of yellowtail, which had been caressed with sesame paste. A much fatter slab of salmon carried a warm red tomato sauce, which tasted as if it had just migrated from a mound of tagliatelle in a nearby trattoria. Red snapper was crowned with a tangle of baby mesclun and toasted pine nuts. Seared toro was sprinkled with soy-marinated garlic and scallions. A piece of bluefin tuna sported an ecru plumage of tofu mousse. Gari's calling card is sushi that has been tweaked slightly or gussied up significantly, but this restaurant usually doesn't let the process get out of hand. (One exception was an à la carte maki roll of fried oysters, which were held hostage by a ruthlessly unctuous mayonnaise.) Gari takes its cues from -- and arguably betters -- its sire, Sushi of Gari, an unadorned, uncomfortably jammed cranny on the Upper East Side with a cult following and, on the night I visited it, a hectic, brusque air. (A server and a sushi chef sped a friend and me through an omakase menu in one hour flat.) Gari is not exactly sluggish, serene, spacious or stylish. But it does have more surface polish than its forebear, its clean lines and warm woods forging a minimalist, quasi-Scandinavian appeal. It also has ostensibly Japanese-inspired dishes that go well beyond the sushi and sashimi to which Sushi of Gari largely limits itself. And some of this cooked food is as impressive as the uncooked fish. I think in particular of a dish called Mishima beef with a jolting price tag of $45. Both the term and expense are unexplained by the menu. Mishima refers to a place in Japan where special cattle are pampered and fattened to produce rich, Kobe-like flesh. Gari gets its beef from similar cattle in Texas. It pan-sears strips of rib-eye and then swaddles them in shimeji, shiitake mushrooms, an intricately seasoned chickpea purée and red miso sauce. The result was sublime. A shockingly succulent deboned young chicken luxuriated under a light soy glaze and a dusting of sansho pepper. Chilean sea bass and salmon had robust flavors and delicate textures and turned out to be wiser choices than roasted lobster, an insufficiently tender waste of an upstanding crustacean. The desserts, courtesy of Petrossian, are pro forma (molten chocolate cake, Black Forest cake), but a diner may have eaten so well by that point that he or she won't care. Besides, the check may have risen plenty high already. Cost is my biggest qualm with Gari, which struck me as too expensive for the neighborhood, the portions and the matter-of-factness of the ambience and service. Consider the sake selections: only two bottles are under $45, and they are only 10 ounces each. But the splendor of Gari's sushi and sashimi cannot be denied. The fish used is of discernibly high quality. I wouldn't put it on a par with the seafood at Masa, Sushi Yasuda or Kurumazushi, but I wouldn't put Gari all that far behind. Like those restaurants, Gari does right by sushi rice, serving it warm, so that the temperature of the fish atop it is raised. And my extended omakase menu at Gari, which cost about $100, was in fact less expensive than comparable experiences at those other restaurants. Gari claims its own niche in the increasingly crowded sushi marketplace with its colorful flourishes, like brilliant slices of avocado beneath a sweet mash of chopped sea eel. But Gari can also take a simpler approach, as it does in a $28 sashimi sampler, which arrives in a boat-shape bowl. I consumed the luscious toro as it was, even though the barest dab of wasabi or the subtlest splash of soy sauce would have been O.K. Now that I'm older and wiser, I know how to show a little restraint and respect. Gari  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  370 Columbus Avenue (78th Street), Upper West Side; (212)362-4816.

       "  'review': 'I PITY the Duane Park Café, but I respect it. I fear for it, but I root for it, this solid supporting player in the company of so many actual and aspirant stars, this earnest tradesman in the proximity of so many self-conscious, self-aggrandizing artists. Just across the street stand Bouley and Danube with their regal and whimsical interior décor, their annual Zagat Survey validations, their luxurious tasting menus. Not far away is Nobu, ever jammed, ever electric, still a celebrity magnet after all these years. To these neighbors add Megu, the expensively accessorized epitome of the wasabi-fringed fun houses in ascendance right now, and Odeon, which defined downtown cool decades ago and maintains an alluring temperature today. The list goes on because the milieu is TriBeCa, and few other patches of Manhattan are soil for such a high-flying, charismatic collection of destination restaurants. This is tough turf. And I was first drawn to the Duane Park Café by my curiosity about how a place that tried neither to be a glittery peer nor a frumpy counterpoint to so many luminaries had managed to fare for so many years in their midst. But I returned to Duane Park for an additional reason. At some point during my first visit -- perhaps when my fork slid through a beautifully grilled fillet of John Dory with fennel and blood orange, or when my spoon sank into an immensely appealing chocolate and banana brioche pudding with cranberries -- it occurred to me that there was a moral and a message in the relative anonymity of this restaurant. That the way it fades into the woodwork of New York was illustrative and instructive. More than culinary standouts like Per Se and Masa, Duane Park speaks to what a surfeit of options for sophisticated dining we New Yorkers enjoy. It tells us this precisely because it makes such a small impression. It serves pheasant breast and venison osso buco, and yet it would be aptly characterized as an unpretentious neighborhood bistro. It does a terrific job with sautéed Chilean sea bass, which comes with a celery and verjus reduction, and with roasted rack of lamb, which is embellished with blueberries and pickled walnuts, and yet it enjoys only run-of-the-mill regard. In many other American cities, Duane Park would probably create a fair degree of notice and lay claim to being one of the more interesting restaurants in its neighborhood. In New York City it\\'s pretty much an afterthought. This status is understandable; I cannot and would not challenge or quibble with it. Duane Park is not exactly a bargain; its dinner entrees go as high as $30 and don\\'t drop below $20. Although the restaurant\\'s exterior is inviting and its foyer and bar area radiate a cozy air, its dining room feels boxy and banal, and the owner and managers obviously know that. They regularly vary the level of illumination in the room, and they keep several large vases filled with bright, fresh flowers. Late last year they had the rear wall of the dining room upholstered in golden silk panels. Even so, a slightly downbeat visual spirit persists. Some of what the kitchen does is badly conceived, poorly executed or both. That venison was infused with a blackberry tea that conspired with the overcooked meat to turn the dish into a murky, gummy gastronomic apocalypse. The sins of mustard-crusted tuna were twofold: vapidity and aridity. But tuna tartare, which could have been deadly dull, wasn\\'t, partly because the tahini sauce around it was not the usual framing device, at least not these days, and was a commendable tahini sauce to boot. An even better appetizer, rife with prudently juxtaposed flavors and textures, was a mixture of shredded smoked trout, crème fraîche and horseradish that was perched atop a crunchy potato pancake and then surrounded with bits of Gorgonzola and roasted pear. The food at Duane Park often reflects pride, care and a commitment to fresh and very fine ingredients, qualities that were evident both in the rich, dark ribbons of air-cured duck breast in an arugula salad that I sampled and in the moistness and delicacy of a semolina-crusted halibut that I tried. Those dishes were mainstays of the menu, while a satisfying appetizer of grilled shrimp, calamari and cauliflower and a hearty braised short rib entree came and went, examples of the restaurant\\'s efforts not to get stuck in a rut. It has struggled off and on since its chef and owner, Seiji Maeda, opened it in 1989. (The following year it received one star from Bryan Miller in The New York Times.) Marisa Ferrarin, who manages the restaurant, told me in a telephone conversation that Duane Park went so far as to bring in a feng shui expert five years ago. \"He hung special stones above the door to create new energy,\" she said, adding that those stones were still there. I never noticed them. But I noticed other details that reflected Duane Park\\'s quest to survive in a difficult environment, to hatch strategies and hone attributes all its own. It has a way of greeting and saying goodbye to customers that feels gracious and grateful but not sycophantic. It has a simple two-page wine list that is considerate in its concision and prices, which are moderate. It has good desserts, which tend to be crowd-pleasing rather than trailblazing. During my visits they included a quince and apple cobbler and a chocolate, pecan and caramel tartlet. Those charms, modest and part of a more complicated and flawed picture, would be more than enough for a restaurant in less privileged precincts, a restaurant that didn\\'t have to rub shoulders with Chanterelle and Montrachet on its own patch of Manhattan and compete with so many distinguished performers on the rest of the island. Those charms have been just enough to carry Duane Park through the years. They have done so in a decidedly fitful, humble fashion that ultimately says as much about how lucky we are as how limited this restaurant is.

       "  'review': 'IF you were a piece of raw fish, you would be feeling awfully confused about your worth these days. On the one hand, you\\'re a crossover hit, a polyglot star. Restaurateurs give you top billing even in Italian and French productions, crowning you crudo and tweaking you into tartare. Long gone is that lean epoch on the Japanese margins. But with each new day and newfangled menu, the very people who cast you show less faith in your innate luster. They tease you out, tart you up and saddle you with eccentric accessories. It\\'s one extreme makeover after another, and the next thing you know, you\\'re wearing pickled Thai chilies and a beret of emulsified olive oil that looks like a toasted marshmallow. Such is the fate of uncooked cubes of yellowfin tuna at Lure Fishbar, where seafood endures more costume changes and a zanier array of accents than Jennifer Garner in \"Alias.\" Lure wants not just to participate in the crudo craze -- the first quarter of this restaurant\\'s menu presents nearly a dozen kinds of raw or barely cooked fish -- but also to add something to it. Unfortunately Lure adds too much too weirdly and too often. Fashioned to evoke the teak-paneled cabin of a luxury yacht, Lure makes a nifty visual promise of communion with the high seas. But with a few of its cooked dishes as well as its raw ones, it fails to trust the fruits of those waters. It lets the condiments steer the ship, abetting a mutiny by a bounty of relishes and vinaigrettes. When proper order reigns, this restaurant can provide a handsome, pleasant voyage. It looks great, its decorative conceit realized so shrewdly that you cannot help smiling as you take it all in: the bar stool cushions that bring to mind flotation devices, the windows that resemble portholes. More important, Lure makes you look great, its dimness as flattering as an interview by Larry King. If all the world were lighted as Lure is, a great many dermatologists would be out of work (and a great many ophthalmologists would be twice as busy). Lure\\'s owners, John McDonald and Josh Pickard, who opened Lever House in late 2003, understand that scene is as potent a magnet as cuisine. With the help of the design firm CAN Resources, they have contrived an alluring one. It\\'s the food, under the direction of the chef Josh Capon, that sometimes sends Lure into choppy waters. The menu is elaborately segmented in a manner that strands you with too many questions about how and how much you should order. Beyond the \"raw fishbar\" at the start, there\\'s a section for shellfish, another for soups and still others for fried fish, kebabs, seafood entrees, meat entrees and sides. It took me many visits to identify and isolate the best from the rest. At least a half dozen kinds of oysters are available, and the ones I tried were terrific. Lure seemingly doesn\\'t stint on the quality of its seafood, a virtue that was apparent in the best entrees I sampled. Grilled swordfish was meaty, moist and enlivened -- but not enslaved -- by an Asian-inflected marinade of soy sauce, butter, garlic and ginger. Grilled salmon provided the silky texture and rich flavor that we salmon lovers crave, and the amalgam of bell peppers atop it was both tolerable and easily swept aside. My favorite entree was one of the recurring specials: a vaguely corny, almost classic surf and turf of an enormous, succulent lobster tail (butter-poached and served with a truffled bordelaise sauce) and a pliant, juicy filet mignon. I followed this dish with my favorite of Lure\\'s desserts, a hokey but irresistible collection of creative ice cream sandwiches like one with strawberry ice cream between vanilla shortbread cookies. And as a companion and I laid waste to them, it hit us: Lure\\'s true calling. This restaurant works best as an upscale, downtown Red Lobster -- a Garnet or Ruby Lobster. Even by that conception, it has problems. The New England clam chowder was a watery shipwreck. The shrimp in shrimp soup were strangely mushy. But as a general rule, Lure hits the rocks when it harbors pretensions. Steamed black cod cowered beneath an oppressive mash of mushrooms, sake, lemon zest and Thai chilies. Sautéed halibut -- rather, oversautéed halibut -- had been doused with a pink peppercorn vinaigrette that rendered the fish almost irrelevant. Going back to the raw selections, the ginger vinaigrette on slivers of toro and the marinade of soy sauce, ginger and kaffir lime with Nantucket Bay scallops were too assertive. Japanese red snapper was meant to be dunked in a \"citrus-olive oil foam\" that looked and smelled more like a gooey, perfumed facial mask. You may wonder whether to eat it or moisturize with it. In these cases the very fine fish can be enjoyed more if liberated from its ablutions and adornments. And in cases like the Arctic char and the Tasmanian sea trout, both subjected to more prudent fiddling and both more easily divorced from their condiments, you will likely find ample pleasure. But you will still wonder: isn\\'t a hint of wasabi or a sprinkling of rock salt and minced herbs about as much primping as a piece of raw fish needs? What must we be doing to its floundering self-esteem? Lure Fishbar  * [Rating: One Star]  142 Mercer Street (Prince Street), SoHo; (212) 431-7676.

       "  'review': \"ONLY a small minority of restaurants exert a pull so strong that you go to them without much consideration for their location, their type of cuisine or the nuances of their ambience. The vast majority survive because they meet a specific craving or need: for something spicy or something romantic, something inexpensive or something nearby. They punch the ticket of a whim. They solve a riddle of requirements. Where, for example, do you go if you don't want to shuffle more than a few paces from the Broadway theater in which the show you're seeing is playing? If you want a place that feels a bit indulgent but not remotely reckless? That favors hearty fare over dainty fillips? That pays fitting tribute to the milky glory of mozzarella? You go to La Masseria. And you go knowing that, while you won't have the meal of your life -- or even the meal of your month -- most of your food will be good, you will certainly eat plenty, and you will sidestep the many disasters along the Great White Way, a culinary minefield of considerable peril. In fact my first meal at La Masseria was significantly better than good, and that judgment transcended the mozzarella, a subject to which I will later return. Along with a colleague, I dropped by La Masseria for lunch, not really knowing what -- beyond the probability of pasta -- to expect. The restaurant was almost empty, which may be why the food was more impressively prepared than it would turn out to be on subsequent visits. The kitchen wasn't stretched anywhere close to thin. And so the baby octopus appetizer was a many-tentacled, many-splendored thing: supple rather than rubbery, with a garland of slightly crunchy broccoli rabe and a cushion of puréed fava beans. A tangle of tagliatelle did the Bolognese sauce atop and around it proud, providing a vehicle that was sturdy but never clunky. Although many Italian restaurants sputter when it comes to main courses, La Masseria zipped right along, as if on cruise control. A decadently thick, expansively broad veal chop, seasoned in a restrained fashion with rosemary and sage, was a juicy invitation to gluttony, which we promptly and unconditionally accepted, leaving very little meat on the bone. An extremely moist fillet of pompano, sautéed in a bit of butter and white wine and sprinkled judiciously with lemon, provided precisely the right, light counterpoint, reprieve and amends that we felt we needed. We decided it was O.K. to eat the whole thing, and rapidly did so. Then we waddled back to the office with that special brand of contentment -- a satisfaction mingled with a sense of discovery -- that you get when you've had a terrific meal at a restaurant about which no one had made grand pronouncements or promises. And while La Masseria occasionally disappointed me over time, that lunch underscored how diligent and deft this restaurant can be with the highlights of its menu and under the most optimal of circumstances. Masseria means farm or farmhouse, and it's not only the restaurant's name but also its design cue, readying the stage for walls of stone or rough stucco, exposed wooden beams along the ceiling and, dangling on some of those walls, antique farm tools: a pitchfork, harnesses. Thankfully, the restaurant doesn't overplay this conceit. You notice it but then forget it, holding on to a vague awareness that the visual environment, like the food, veers deliberately and fetchingly in the direction of rustic. But the most appealing aspect of this restaurant's setting is the dimensions. The dining room is relatively broad and extraordinarily deep, with a few unexpected nooks toward the back. All this space translates into tables that are not wedged tightly together, and the absence of crowding is a balm for the ears as well as the elbows. It helps keep a lid on noise. The menu ranges far and wide over land and sea, carpaccio and capesante, in a naked bid to appeal to all audiences. There are unfamiliar scene-stealers, including a dish of fettucinelike noodles with wedges of eggplant and smoked mozzarella in a light tomato sauce. There are familiar star turns, including that tagliatelle. And there are unfamiliar performances from familiar players, most conspicuously a limoncello-flavored tiramisù that, like most other desserts, was worthy of nothing more than faint applause. You can pretty much count on generous portions but not, sadly, on careful preparations. With the exception of that pompano and the shrimp, scallops and squid in an absolutely wonderful fritto misto, the seafood I sampled at La Masseria was overcooked. So was grilled chicken, which bore the additional indignity of too much salt. Other meat, including rabbit and rack of lamb, fared better. An enormous rib-eye steak was tender and flavorful enough to warrant a presentation more imaginative than the one it received. It was buried beneath an unruly clump of fried shoestring potatoes, a gimmick that grew tired about a decade ago but somehow refuses to die. Then again, maybe La Masseria was making a decorative statement with it. Maybe Mount Spud was supposed to evoke a bale of hay. Now to that mozzarella. La Masseria makes it fresh daily, from cow's milk, and spreads it out in large sheets. Onto those sheets goes asparagus or eggplant or sun-dried tomato or speck, and then the sheets are rolled and sliced so that the mozzarella and its company make a colorful spiral, as delectable to the eye as to the palate. That mozzarella goes a long way -- although not quite the full distance -- toward redeeming La Masseria's frequently off-pitch service, which caroms from excessively chatty to inexplicably absent and only occasionally hits what seems to be its intended mark, affable availability. While the mozzarella doesn't represent a reason to go out of your way to get to La Masseria, it argues for a stop at this restaurant if you happen to be in its vicinity: if Italy is in your thoughts, a farmhouse is on your mind, and a show is part of the rest of the afternoon's or evening's itinerary.

       "  'review': \"THERE came a moment during one of my meals at Casa la Femme North when my companion and I confronted a decision more critical than hummus versus baba ghanouj, a choice more pivotal than prawns or lamb, a consequential crossroads that captured the very soul of the place. Did we want a flap of our tent lifted so that we could assess the abdominal achievements of the belly dancer who had just begun to whirl through the dining room? Or did we prefer to stay hidden behind our gauzy white veil, shrouded sheiks in pseudo-Arabian isolation? We picked privacy over pulchritude. But I still couldn't shut out the screechy soundtrack for the performance, the clapping of other patrons or the dispiriting fact that an otherwise fine meal had been hijacked by high jinks that felt awfully kitschy in the context of the East Side of Manhattan. The nature of your response to Casa la Femme North, which serves Egyptian food in an ersatz Alexandria under the Queensboro Bridge, largely boils down to this: How much music and midriff do you like with your mezes? Does the sudden appearance of a sinuous siren count as dinner and a show or dinner and a distraction? If you arrive early and take your last bite of the restaurant's sublime baklava before 9 p.m., you can avoid the dancer. But there's really no escaping Casa la Femme North's facile exoticism, built around such obvious props as palm fronds and shisha (a k a hookah) pipes and such over-the-top indulgences as the private tents that ring the dining room. Don't get me wrong: I'm all for a sheltered, spacious niche of my very own, especially on date night, and Casa la Femme North deserves serious consideration from anyone who wants to pair grape leaves with groping or nibble on more than what's on the table. But there's something incrementally ridiculous about a server constantly having to pop through a gossamer cocoon to check on the level of your wineglass. It's a gas the first time and a goof the second. By the 9th or 10th, it's a gimmick that's wearing out its welcome. The tents are available by special request; the restaurant also has extremely comfortable untented tables in the center of the dining room, some with lavishly upholstered high-backed chairs and semicircular booths. At least until the dancer descended and I found myself smack in her gyrating path, I preferred this seating arrangement. But no matter my perch, I enjoyed Casa la Femme North's food, the ingredients of which tasted as fresh as I could desire, the spicing of which was as clear and well calibrated as I could hope for, the cooking of which was often spot-on. For all the restaurant's aesthetic eccentricities, it makes a serious, impressive effort in the kitchen, producing many minor and major delights. The pita bread, for example. It comes hot from the oven in generously proportioned wheels that have been encrusted with sesame seeds, dusted with oregano and rock salt and brushed lightly with olive oil. It provides the perfect canvas for the flavorful mezes, which the restaurant labels mazzas: hummus, baba ghanouj, tahini, zabadi, ful medames (puréed fava beans) and gibnah domiaty (a wonderful Egyptian cheese that is like a less chalky, less salty feta). Some of the dishes at Casa la Femme North will be familiar to anyone who has sampled Middle Eastern cuisine, but the versions presented here are extremely refined ones. Take those grape leaves, which are obviously assembled at regular intervals and do not sit around for long. When I had them, they arrived at the table warm, the rice inside not at all clumpy, the notes of dill and coriander sharp and crisp. Tamaya were like falafel: densely spongy dumplings, or really cakes, of chickpea and fava bean. They were also an excuse to use more of the restaurant's terrific bread and tahini, building blocks for a satisfying appetizer sandwich. Other standout starters included a baked bell pepper stuffed with rice and -- more surprising -- Egyptian crab cakes, packed with sweet meat. Casa la Femme North prides itself on relatively straightforward fish, and yet seafood was what I found most uneven here. A baked whole red snapper was somewhat dry and, because of a clumsy job of tableside filleting, slightly dangerous. Grilled prawns were too chewy. But grilled chicken, which can dry out so easily with such a slender margin of overcooking, was sensationally tender and juicy on both of the nights I sampled it. It was seasoned with sumac, oregano and crushed red pepper and had just enough fat and skin left on it. The restaurant's lamb chops and filet mignon were also first rate. As for the previously lauded baklava, it made me rethink and renounce the anti-baklava peeves and prejudices I had nursed for most of my adult life. The layers of phyllo dough were crunchy and airy and the cinnamon syrup that sweetened them had been applied sparingly, so that the pistachios, almonds and walnuts did not drown in a cloying tide. Open since February, Casa la Femme North is the relocation of -- and successor to -- Casa la Femme, a restaurant in SoHo that closed last December after 12 years. So it has its act down pat. But must that act be so flamboyant, so strenuous? The restaurant seems intent on turning everything into a production, even the pitchers of ice water, stuffed so densely with mint leaves that they look like cylindrical swamps. What ends up in your glass tastes like cold tea. On my first visit, there was a smothering quality to the hyperattentive service. Two garrulous servers at separate times dropped by the table to recommend favorite dishes and suggest strategies for ordering; one would have done the trick. On all of my visits, the servers and their supervisors paced the room endlessly, peering into the tents discreetly and assiduously weaving the vibe that Casa la Femme North is where the desert of daily drudgery ends and an oasis of nightly hedonism begins. But the more I felt like an overpampered sultan, the harder I found it to relax and simply eat. Casa la Femme North  * [Rating: one star]  1076 First Avenue (59th Street); (212) 505-0005. ATMOSPHERE -- A luxe, sybaritic Arabian fantasy, complete with gauzy white tents for private dining.  SOUND LEVEL -- Reasonably tame before 9 p.m., at which point the belly dancing begins and the music swells.  RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Fresh pita bread with tahini, puréed fava beans or Egyptian cheese; grape leaves; Egyptian crab cakes; bell pepper stuffed with rice; grilled chicken; lamb chops; baklava.  WINE LIST -- Relatively concise and varied in price, with French, Italian and Spanish wines supplemented by a handful from Morocco and Lebanon.  PRICE RANGE -- Appetizers, $5.95 to $10.95; entrees, $16.50 to $25.50; desserts, $7.50. Five-course prix fixe in private tent, $55.

       "  'review': \"ARTISANAL and tofu are not two words I normally think of together, but artisanal tofu is what they showcase at En Japanese Brasserie, which essays the brave and, to my mind, quixotic challenge of casting tofu as the most refined of delicacies and rarest of dramatic events. Tofu does not merely appear on the En menu. It is given advertised, neatly spaced show times, much like a killer whale at Sea World. At roughly 90-minute intervals from 6 p.m. through 11:30 p.m., tofu comes fresh, glue-white and gooey from pots in En's kitchen; if you time your dinner reservation just right, you can get it while it's merely seconds (as opposed to, say, a whole hour) old and positively brimming with its pasty charms. You can order it warm or chilled, or you can really go for broke and get its dynamic cousin, yuba, which is the skimmed skin of heated soy milk, omelet-esque in texture. Yuba arguably has more character than plain tofu, which is like saying that Britney Spears lip-synchs less transparently than Ashlee Simpson. Some virtues are minor, and everything is relative. With its tofu and its house-made miso pastes, its julienne of burdock root and beef tongue hot pot, En promises an especially authentic, home-style Japanese dining experience. It also claims to channel the spirit of the izakaya, a Japanese pub devoted to what might well be called Japanese comfort food. The Japanese restaurateurs behind En run several dozen similar establishments in Japan. En marks their American debut. But what is so paradoxically striking about it is how familiar and redundant it feels, how faithfully this transglobal tweaking and translation of an izakaya obeys dining trends in New York and how perfectly it encapsulates a certain kind of Manhattan restaurant today. En, which means destiny, adheres to the same formula that Matsuri, Megu and Ono do: Find a location in a putatively hip or genuinely desirable downtown neighborhood. (En goes for the West Village instead of TriBeCa or the meatpacking district.) Arrange the tables and sushi counters in a vast, visually arresting space that looks as much like a stage set as a place to eat. (The main dining room at En has a celestially high ceiling, a central column covered in tin tiles, a two-story wall of enormous windows and an entirely open kitchen with cooks rushing to and fro.) Garnish with theatrical flourishes. (As at Megu, the staff at En screeches a greeting as newcomers enter the main dining room; upon hearing it, I never failed to flinch.) Construct an extremely long, confusing menu that suggests boundlessness, emphasizes small plates, encourages sharing and, most important of all, accommodates rampant carbohydrate phobias. (Japanese is the vehicle; Dr. Atkins would surely have invented sashimi if someone else had not beaten him to the punch.) Even En's identification as a Japanese brasserie suggests a have-it-all, connect-the-dots sensibility: it wants both the healthful allure of an ethnic cuisine in continued ascendance and the timeless appeal of an unfussy, teeming environment in which you can pass many a merry hour with copious drink as well as food. You can indeed do that at En, which I found more aesthetically attractive and relaxing than many of its counterparts, if only because it is slightly more low key. Although much of the seating is at two counters -- one skirts the kitchen, and the other envelops that central column -- there are also oak tables with significant space between them and a pronounced air of privacy and tranquillity. There are many specialty drinks, many kinds of sake and many flavors of shochu, a Japanese distilled liquor. En stands ready to lubricate you every bit as well as you want to be lubricated. In terms of feeding you, En delivers a more scattershot performance, and that assessment holds even if I put my tofu skepticism to the side. Among the cold small plates and the hot small plates, which constitute two separate and equally substantial categories, there are a few real winners, namely a salad of mushrooms and tender chicken, a plate of oysters sautéed in soy sauce and a crudité platter with leaves of cabbage to be dipped in different miso pastes, including sesame miso and peanut butter miso. But there are losers, too: fried chicken nuggets that were, on the night I had them, as succulent as gravel; an avocado and shrimp salad that tasted like a relic from a country-club banquet in the 1970's; a gruel of overgrilled eggplant, uni and mustard that amounted to a slimy mishap. Most of the food that I sampled -- including sushi rolls and chilled soba noodles, a bowl of thick rice with crab meat and a platter of tempura vegetables -- hovered between those poles, relatively satisfying at the moment of ingestion, pretty much forgotten 30 minutes later. I was surprised in a good way by how juicy and flavorful slices of sautéed duck breast were and in a bad way by how utterly ordinary slices of seared chu toro turned out to be. (The chu toro sashimi, by contrast, was terrific.) If you like your meat sizzling on a stone, both Wagyu beef and organic chicken come that way. Both are packed with flavor, although the $38 price tag on the beef is not warranted by the paltry portion. As for desserts, well, I have yet to encounter a Japanese restaurant that wowed me with this final act, and En hangs with the pack. There are tea ice creams and a tea pudding, and you can guess even before you order them if they are going to be your, um, cup of tea. Tofu reappears, taking a final bow in the form of a tofu mousse with brown sugar syrup and sweet soy powder. I suppose it is good enough for what it is, but I figure that its days are numbered the minute the chefs at En ace a yuba brûlée. En  Japanese Brasserie  * [Rating: One star]  435 Hudson Street (Leroy), Greenwich Village; (212) 647-9196.

       "  'review': 'WE often wind up associating restaurants with the life dramas and junctures they guided us through. I will always associate Devi with the 2004 presidential election. And I will always credit Devi with making the campaign seem less ugly than it was, with making it recede, if only for the duration of a plate of pyramid-shaped rice puffs, too golden, crunchy and airy to permit unpleasant thoughts. It was in Devi that four companions and I gathered exactly a week before the election and inevitably made predictions. While the uncertainty of the race pressed down on us, we didn\\'t feel it just then. We were too distracted and happy fishing creamy yam dumplings from a fragrant pool of salmon-colored tomato sauce that had been seasoned enticingly with cloves and cardamom seeds, cinnamon and red pepper. It was also in Devi, two nights after the election, that a man at the next table could not resist treating everyone around him -- strangers all -- to a passionate deconstruction of what the returns meant, where the country was heading, the challenges and threats it faced. But his soliloquy felt more like frivolous theater than an example of how heated and polarized so many voters had become, because nothing could seem too weighty in the golden glow of Devi\\'s main dining room, where sheets of raw silk shimmer on the walls, servers glide past in what look like orange pajamas, and the scents of mint, cilantro and tamarind sweeten the air. There are restaurants that bring you back to yourself and those that spirit you away. Devi belongs to the latter group, delivering a heady retreat even when the odds against such an escape are longest. Devi works its exotic magic through its take on Indian food, more varied, multidimensional, nimble and surprising here than at the scores of samosa factories throughout these vindaloo-bewitched precincts, where a tandoor and delivery menu are sometimes all that a culinary entrepreneur needs to get by. It casts its spell visually, by making you feel as if you have been lifted -- lofted really -- to a realm more enchanted than any blue or red state could offer. Devi does not have the design budget or square footage of a Spice Market or a Megu, but it has a galaxy of brilliantly glowing glass fixtures -- white, red, blue, yellow and green -- that hang from the ceiling like gargantuan gemstones. It has a curved marble staircase that rises from the main dining room, each step flanked by votive candles, to a more intimate second floor that puts you at eye level with that sky of diamonds and rubies and sapphires. Best of all, Devi has chefs, Suvir Saran and Hemant Mathur, who do not feel bound by your expectations for Indian food. Yes, there is chicken tikka masala on the menu, but you have to hunt for it, and if you ask your server for suggestions, he will steer you in less tired directions. Toward the crispy fried okra, for example, which is dusted with ground mango peel, pomegranate seed and toasted cumin, for an effect so tangy and salty that this dish could easily oust potato skins or nachos as the new appetizer sensation at a T.G.I. Friday\\'s. (I mean that as an unfettered compliment.) Or toward the cauliflower with ketchup. That is not, to be truthful, how Devi advertises the dish in question, but that is essentially what it is, and there is positively no shame in that. Manchurian cauliflower, to use the proper tag, pairs firm, crunchy florets with a tomato ketchup that has been spiked with garlic and chili peppers. It is entirely simple, crazily good and a fine example of Mr. Saran\\'s laudable pragmatism: what matters is the bigness and seductiveness of the taste achieved, not the method for achieving it. Mr. Saran and Mr. Mathur previously teamed at the Indian restaurant Amma, which they left last April. Devi reprises many of Amma\\'s hits and pursues the same goal of placing Indian cooking, or at least putatively Indian cooking, on a higher plane of New York City dining. That aspiration is perhaps most evident in an item available only on a seven-course tasting menu: a mash of calf\\'s brain, green chili, quail eggs and pickled ginger that serves as the ethereal topping for a bruschetta. But that aspiration is also clear in the quality of seafood and meat that Devi puts into the tandoor. On both of the nights I tried them, the jumbo prawns, seasoned with toasted chickpea flour, cayenne, lemon, ginger and garlic, had a wonderful texture: slightly bouncy on the outside, soft within. Lamb chops, which had been marinated in yogurt, garlic and ginger, were faultless. Both the halibut and salmon at Devi are sealed and cooked in banana leaves and both emerged from their cocoons in splendidly moist form. But just when I was ready to pronounce Devi a master of all flesh, I waded into two different dishes -- one with a fiery curry sauce, the other with a marvelous gravy of pistachios, saffron and cream -- that included chunks of excessively chewy chicken. A beef entree -- sirloin pounded into thin strips -- was similarly tough and unappealing. In its bid for \"crispy,\" which was how the menu advertised it, it came up dry. Devi wobbles from time to time, and the prices for a few dishes are rather high in relation to the portions. A few of the restaurant\\'s uniformly courteous servers are prone to distraction and more eager to please than efficient at it. Almost all of its desserts proved disappointing. I found only one, the \"falooda,\" a parfait that combined strawberry and mango sorbets with coconut-lemon-grass milk, that I truly liked. But there was much to compensate, including an unexpected standout: finely minced turkey with fenugreek leaves, spinach, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and onions. It packs so many tastes of India into a hash so sublime that I feel happier and calmer just knowing it exists. I cannot guess whether, over the next four years, some of the acrimony of the past four months will lessen. But at least I know that if I need a vacation from the fighting and fretting, Devi is there for me. Devi  ** [Rating: Two stars]  8 East 18th Street; (212) 691-1300.

       "  'review': 'IF you drew a straight line from midtown Manhattan to the restaurant Sripraphai in the Woodside section of Queens, it would not cross Kennedy Airport. It would not even come close. But my map reading skills are so poor, and my sense of direction so pitiful, that on a recent night a friend and I found ourselves barreling down the road toward long-term parking when we were supposed to be bound for short-term Thai. I had been entrusted with navigating while he drove, and this was a colossal mistake. The trip took us nearly two hours. The friendship almost flat-lined. Almost, but not quite, and that is a measure of the pleasure of Sripraphai (pronounced see-PRA-pie). He needed only a few spoonfuls of fragrant, revivifying tom yum soup to forget our odyssey. By the time he sampled the restaurant\\'s roasted duck salad, its curry rice noodles and its sautéed \"drunken\" noodles, I had traveled in his estimation from cretin to genius, villain to hero, a culinary Columbus who had discovered an untrammeled new world. In truth I had followed the footprints of others. I just had not done so very concisely or coherently. Sripraphai has been around for more than a decade, and the most committed restaurant adventurers from outside Queens have long made pilgrimages to it. But plenty of less obsessive food lovers who would gladly venture to Woodside for something special do not know that this delicious destination awaits. They should. Sripraphai is to your corner Thai takeout what P. D. James is to Mary Higgins Clark: the real deal, well worth the extra time and effort. It is also about to expand and visually improve. Its Thai owner, Sripraphai Tipmanee, recognized that the original dining room, always spartan and charmless, had descended perhaps too far into outright frumpiness, and so she closed it last week for renovations and has moved for a month to an adjacent room next door, where the new blond wood furniture, black lacquered tables and clay-colored tile floor offer a preview of the restaurant\\'s spiffier future. Come December, she said, the wall will come down, and Sripraphai will double to about 70 seats (not counting a back garden). I doubt it will bloom into a raving beauty, and I do not care. About the food at Sripraphai there can be no sarcasm and little complaint. I ordered that roasted duck salad on two occasions, rationalizing that I was performing a vital check of the restaurant\\'s consistency and almost believing my argument. The truth: I was wild about this dish, and only partly because the ribbons of duck were more tender and flavorful than meat at many similarly inexpensive Asian restaurants, which tend to stint on the quality of flesh. What struck me even more forcefully were the variety and coordination of vegetables, herbs, spices and accents in the salad. Scallions, red onions, cucumbers, tomato, cilantro, lime juice, fish sauce, dried chili peppers and ground peanuts were all present in perfect proportion and perfect counterpoint, something tangy yielding to something soothing, a burst of cool mellowing a bit of fire. The balance of sweet, sour, salty and hot is what is often praised about Thai cooking, which focuses on bold flavors in blissful harmony. But at too many Thai restaurants in this country and this city the heat is tempered and the sweetness amplified as concessions to American palates. The spices are muted, the herbs less fresh than they could be and the lemon grass permitted to run roughshod over all else. Not at Sripraphai. Here the star anise, coriander and galangal sing clearly, identifiable voices that swell and recede as they hew to their carefully calibrated roles in a broader chorus. Sripraphai dutifully performs the requisite paces for a Thai restaurant in New York. You can have your pad thai and your chicken satay, and you can rest assured that this restaurant\\'s executions of them will be very fine. You can have your curries, and I can promise that none of them will disappoint you, although all of them may surprise you, because they have nuances and a nimbleness often lacking in the curries at lesser Thai restaurants. You can have a classic dish of ground pork with ginger, chili and tart citrus, and you will indeed find peanuts in the mix, but you will not find an overload of them. Sripraphai veers away from such easy effects. But you can also make less conventional choices, and I would urge you to. Try, for example, the beef tendon soup, which comes in light or dark broths, the latter signaling the presence of blood. Several friends and I went the dark route and found ourselves engrossed by the hints of cinnamon and the salty bits of crackling that peeked through and crucially leavened the bluntness of everything around it. Try the pickled barbecued pork, which has a bracing tartness that does to your palate what astringent does to your skin. I was impressed by the deft seasoning and cooking of the pork, beef and chicken that appeared in a variety of ways and a variety of dishes, my favorite being those long, broad, flat drunken noodles, entwined with red peppers, green peppers, garlic, holy basil and fish and soy sauces. I was less impressed with the seafood. A disappointing papaya salad featured hard shrimp, tough calamari and relatively tasteless mussels. Sripraphai has additional limitations. It does not sell alcohol, although you can come with your own, and a nearby store sells beer. Its mostly gelatinous, often cloying Thai desserts, on display in prepackaged containers in the dining room, are not for everyone (and were not for me). But the bang for buck here is atomic. For those without wheels or navigational skills, the 61st Street stop on the No. 7 train is nearby. The smiling servers are both kind and wise: if you puff up your chest and request your dishes very spicy, they will rightly redirect you to moderately spicy, which is spicy enough. Like Pam Real Thai in Midtown and too few other Thai restaurants in New York, this one does not pander. But it sure does delight.

       "  'review': 'I CANNOT remember many details of my visits to Indochine in the 1980\\'s, like where I sat or whom I ogled, but I vividly recall how special being at Indochine made me feel. Famous singers, actors and models went there. Political bigwigs and avant-garde artists went there. And the rest of us went there, if we could somehow luck into a table, even one at the farthest fringe of Indochine\\'s starry galaxy, because we got to grab on to just a bit of all that glitter. Did we eat? Did they? Maybe a little. Maybe not. Food was beside the point of Indochine, which was the epitome of cool, the epicenter of hot, the apotheosis of an extremely profitable idea: the downtown restaurant as badge of knowingness and belonging. Indochine was the child of Odeon and the sire of Balthazar, but it burned brighter in its way and its time than any of the other Brian or Keith McNally restaurants, and so it seemed the most ephemeral. Could something as perishable as Indochine possibly last? Yes, it turns out, and no. Indochine is celebrating its 20th birthday this month, and it still flaunts a noisy and crowded dining room, a tropical-bordello décor and a gaunt, gorgeous crew of servers who look as if they have just tumbled out of beds in which sleeping was not a priority. But Indochine as it once existed inevitably died (and not just because Brian McNally sold it in 1992). In its place stands a museum, more or less, that draws young people who clearly consider it an anachronistic hoot, patrons of the Joseph Papp Public Theater or the Blue Man Group who need a nearby trough, Midwestern and European tourists who do not know any better, and Iman. \"That\\'s her,\" a server confided to a friend and me when we dined at Indochine on a recent night. \"Over there, at that large table. She\\'s in here all the time.\" Really? I squinted. I could not quite make out the former supermodel, who is married to David Bowie. Our server offered to walk over and stand behind her. \"I\\'ll need a signal of some kind,\" I said conspiratorially. She whispered, \"I\\'ll scratch my hair,\" then stood over Iman and did precisely that. In the old days of course Iman was the umpteenth beautiful wraith at the umpteenth charmed table on which Vietnamese spring rolls, not yet ubiquitous, qualified as exotic props. The Indochine of yore would not have needed or deigned to point her out. The Indochine of now has a looser etiquette and less pride. I was drawn there this time around by astonishment that it was still open and intense curiosity about what it had become, about the temperature of a paradigmatic hot spot once the sun had stopped shining on it. On various nights I brought friends who are usually in the mood for a lark and occasionally good with a wisecrack. We turned our jaded eyes toward the familiar bamboo and wicker furniture in the front lounge area, the tropical trees that are still scattered throughout the place and the trademark wallpaper with gargantuan banana leaves. What had once looked exotic now looked campy, maybe because we had all been there and done that. \"Is this the 80\\'s,\" said one friend, \"or Rue McClanahan\\'s bedroom on \\'The Golden Girls\\'?\" Our group of four was led that night to one of the roomy, high-backed, circular booths that were always Indochine\\'s most coveted niches. It had the same tucked-away appeal that these booths had always had. But it looked out on a landscape with a changed population. A group of people in their 20\\'s, badly dressed and badly groomed, occupied a table nearby, and at one point, if our ears did not fail us, they shouted at one another to do shots. \"It was different in the 80\\'s,\" said my quipster friend, who visited Indochine often during that decade. \"Back then if you made noise, it was because you were attractive.\" Back then the kind of Asian-inspired food that Indochine served was more novel and perhaps much better. The last time the restaurant was reviewed by The New York Times, in 1988, Bryan Miller gave it two stars. But many of the gooey or deep-fried objects that came our way on this night and others had either no character or too much of it, their flavors muddled, their seasoning scattershot. They tasted tossed-off, generic, like something you might get from a chain hotel that was doing Vietnamese room service. \"It\\'s a pu pu platter that\\'s lost its way,\" said my pithy friend. We passed around a plate of the evening\\'s appetizer special, called \"won ton shrimp.\" A crunchy batter not only encased the shellfish but also formed a series of strands that dangled from it like the legs of a centipede. If your goal were to make a harmlessly oily dish look as repulsive as one of the gastronomic challenges served to gagging contestants on \"Fear Factor,\" this would be a wise way to go. During my recent visits to Indochine, the sauces tended to be too sweet. The meat and fish tended to be mistreated. I had overcooked duck, overdressed beef, rock-hard shrimp. But here is the odd, crazy thing: I also had a decent time, and the main reason was not Indochine\\'s delectable cocktails, especially the Indochine martini, made with pineapple, ginger, lime juice and Triple Sec. It was not the respectable desserts, especially the coconut crème brûlée. It was the way the servers strutted and sidled as if the 1980\\'s had never ended, as if the sexy beat went on. The Indochine dining room is usually that degree of dark that graciously air-brushes everyone\\'s wrinkles and pores, and when I was there, the soundtrack was heavy with hits from the 1980\\'s. If I closed my eyes and flexed my imagination, I could almost smell the cigarette smoke and hear the sniffling of people who had gone to the bathroom to powder their noses. I could travel back to a more careless time. The way in which Indochine makes that possible may well be why Iman still comes around and why Paper magazine did a photo shoot for its 20th anniversary issue there. Some places are so evocative of an era and sensibility that they cannot die. They must survive as relics and reminders, to be savored by those who did not experience them in real time and to inspire nostalgia or laughter in those who did.

       "  'review': 'CUISINES end up married for all sorts of reasons: a chef\\'s inspiration, perhaps, or the movement of one ethnic group to another\\'s turf. At Convivium Osteria in Brooklyn, the cause and agent are love. Italian and Portuguese are bed mates on the menu because the Italian chef and the Portuguese manager are bed mates off it. Carlo Pulixi, the chef, and Michelle Pulixi, the manager, have family trees planted in different patches of European soil: his in Italy, hers in Portugal. When the couple opened this charming restaurant on the fringe of Park Slope nearly four years ago, they decided not to favor either bloodline. They even went a step further, splitting the geographical distance between their heritages and adding Spanish dishes to the menu. That menu, written in Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, is like a dual-purpose primer on Romance languages and southern European cooking: Berlitz with bacalao. Seafood is translated \"al pescador\" for a Spanish assortment of tapas and \"de peixe\" for a Portuguese stew. I got nourishment, a new vocabulary and a fruity, feisty Ribera del Duero with which to wash it all down. Convivium Osteria is primarily a neighborhood restaurant, of the kind and level that every neighborhood wants. It does not force you to splurge, but it allows you to. You can eat conventionally or graze. Convivium accommodates different moods, and it changes with the seasons, opening up a lovely back garden with a wisteria-covered trellis during warm months. And it does a few things well enough to argue for attention from food lovers from more than a few blocks away. One of those things, as it happens, is steak. Inspired less by its muse countries than by an appreciation for sheer gluttony, Convivium offers a thick, broad rib-eye for two. The beef comes from Niman Ranch, and the steak comes to the table on a wood board, with an extremely sharp, long knife that looks like the gleaming love child of a scalpel and a machete. A server uses it to carve a few smoky, tender slices, then lets you use it to carve many more. The experience turns into a thrilling piece of participatory theater: \"The Carnivore Cometh.\" The pleasures for a carnivore on the Convivium menu are many. Tender slices of pork loin are accompanied by small coins of chorizo, which are meant to join the loin in each forkful, bringing a crispiness and a saltiness to the fleshy fun. A roasted baby chicken -- succulent on the night that a friend and I tried it -- was splayed on the plate in a way that all but demanded that it be picked up. Or maybe we thought so and heeded that call simply because we wanted to get to the meat closest to the bone. A platter of cured meats and cheeses, listed as an appetizer for two, has serrano ham, chorizo and Italian speck, all first-rate. A friend and I ordered it at dusk one evening, as we waited for a tardy companion, and it perfectly accomplished such a platter\\'s occasional mission of occupying people who are simultaneously trying to tame their hunger and pass an indeterminate period of time. We nibbled, we talked, we tried slivers of meat and wedges of Spanish cheeses (Cabrales, Roncal, Garrotxa). Our friend finally arrived, and there was still plenty for her. All dinners at Convivium begin with a bowl of olives and a basket of terrific bread, soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The quality of the appetizers varies widely, with a few too many failing to make a strong impression. These underperformers include the fried fillets of salted codfish we tasted on one night and the braised artichokes we tasted on another. Grilled baby octopus with black olives and celery was too tender on the outside, not tender enough on the inside and phlegmatic through and through. In contrast, roasted whole prawns had all the right textures, and the coarse sea salt that seasoned them was a simple, well-chosen stroke. But there were just three of them, for $17, and they should have been elephantine at that price. (They were not.) A much better value, for $9, was a salad of perfectly cooked string beans and bits of hard-boiled egg, a pairing of crunchy and slick textures that worked superbly. Among entrees, the most disappointing was a rack of lamb with a pine nut crust that was too thick and too intrusive. The most satisfying, in addition to the steak and chicken, was a dish of half-moon pockets of pasta that had been filled with duck, topped with shredded radicchio and speck and placed on a tawny, shallow pond of porcini cream sauce. A filling and pleasing salted codfish casserole with mashed potatoes and spinach tasted like a Portuguese spin on shepherd\\'s pie. The standout desserts are a crisp apple tart and a silky chocolate cake, which is served with a heaping mound of freshly whipped cream. Michelle Pulixi makes these, in a fashion untethered by her ancestry, which is part Irish as well. She simply bakes what strikes her as delicious. The service could -- and should -- be better. Tell a server you need 10 more seconds to make up your mind, and he may disappear for the next 10 minutes. Do not go to Convivium if you are in a hurry, but know that even forced lingering feels good here. Much of the soft romantic light comes from tall, slender candles, some arranged like sconces on walls that have been made, with sponge painting, to look as if they are centuries old. Copper pots hang from racks mounted on those walls. You can almost believe that you are in a rustic haunt in Rome, or for that matter in Lisbon. The Pulixis deposit you at the Strait of Gibraltar and let you decide: east or west; his or hers. They chose both, which was no doubt maritally sensible. It turns out to be gastronomically rewarding as well. Convivium Osteria  * [Rating: One Star]  68 Fifth Avenue (St Mark\\'s Place), Park Slope, Brooklyn; (718) 857-1833.

       "  'review': 'SELDOM has a Manhattan neighborhood gone from intriguing to annoying -- from on-the-cusp to over-the-top -- with the distressing speed and depressing thoroughness of the meatpacking district. It is not really a neighborhood anymore. It is an urban theme park: a gaudy epicurean grab bag that weds cuisines from here and there to cocktails from the here and now. It is a \"Sex and the City\" fantasy in which would-be Carries and could-be Bigs look for love and settle for lamb under supremely flattering lighting. The lighting is terrific at 5 Ninth; the would-be\\'s are at every third table, and they are pressed in tight. This sexy, exciting, exasperating restaurant is not for anyone who wants peace and calm. Like its neighborhood, it is for people who crave the jostle of too many bodies in too limited a space. It is also for people willing to choose unsteady exuberance over steady expertise. It has style and energy to burn, but 5 Ninth lacks discipline and judgment in terms of its service and, to a lesser extent, its food. It feels adolescent: ambitious but imprudent, creative but sloppy. Its chef, Zak Pelaccio, did a brief stint at the short-lived Chickenbone Cafe in Brooklyn, where his culinary eclecticism and adventurousness generated more than a bit of buzz. He has brought those traits and that buzz with him to 5 Ninth, which opened in late May. Named for its address and avenue, 5 Ninth actually refuses to be fixed in any one place: even more than most restaurants in these boundary-blurring times, it defies simple categorization. Asian-American? Malaysian-Mediterranean? Thai-Vietnamese-Italian? You could try a dozen geographical references, allow yourself three or four hyphens and still come up short. \"Serious global dazzle\" is how the publicity materials for the restaurant characterize Mr. Pelaccio\\'s cuisine. That is a felicitous phrase with one serious flaw: at least at 5 Ninth, his food manages to dazzle only half of the time. When it is good, it is excellent, a symphony of grace notes in gorgeous balance. Several friends and I shared a steamed loup de mer, also known as branzino, that was beyond succulent. Its seasonings -- including lime juice, coriander root, bird\\'s-eye chili and garlic -- provided hints of flavor that swirled into and out of the mix, hovering briefly, never lingering too long. Two other entrees were also quiet knockouts. One mingled slices of seared duck breast with slices of seared foie gras and roasted figs, arranged so that it was easy to get all three of those players -- meaty, gooey and sweet -- into each bite. The other entree was a baby chicken that had been gently cooked with white wine and a generous amount of deeply aromatic rosemary in a small cast iron pot. It came to the table in that pot and could not have tasted much moister, simpler or more satisfying. How, then, to explain the roasted squab of another night? It could not have been much tougher, and one friend had such trouble cutting into it that servers not only noticed his vain, heroic efforts but, to their credit, insisted on taking the entree off the bill. Or the grilled goat of a different night? It was presented as an unrefined excursion into unfettered protein. But a bit of extra butchering would have been appreciated. Excessively bony and fatty, the goat was difficult and unappealing to eat. The greatest puzzle of all, however, was a lobster appetizer that buried the sea\\'s sweetest flesh in a coffin of fried batter that rendered it indistinguishable. Why put such a delicacy to such indelicate use? Above and beyond those scattered misfires, there is an impressive balance and diversity of meat and fish on the frequently changing menu at 5 Ninth, where I sampled, as appetizers or entrees, tuna belly and octopus, wild salmon and halibut, beef short ribs and lamb shoulder. Most were nicely cooked. The menu also has a separate category for noodles. A signature dish called noodles raja chulan features an engrossing broth of coconut milk, fish stock, Thai chili, garlic, ginger and shallots. A lusty dish of garganelli comes with braised lamb hearts and Parmesan. If the food at 5 Ninth is occasionally befuddling, the service is much more so. One night my friends and I waited more than 30 minutes for our table; another night we waited nearly 40 minutes for our appetizers. The bread that was supposed to come at the beginning of one meal never materialized, and the espresso that came at the end was lukewarm at best. We ordered blueberry crisp and got raspberry crisp, although the dessert menu and our server had not made note of the substitution. That menu promised peanut butter ice cream with the \"chocolate sandwich,\" but cherry ice cream arrived. 5 Ninth is also hindered by an awkward layout. Spread over a three-story town house with wood-beamed ceilings, many fireplaces and a leafy garden out back, the restaurant looks fabulous. But the kitchen is in the basement, while the main dining room is on the second floor. As a result servers are clumping up and down the stairs and often muscling their way through a tangle of bodies in the first-floor bar area. The lanes of foot traffic are easily jammed. And the town house is so narrow that 5 Ninth, in order to maximize the space, has a few tables that barely fit two people but are used for three or four. For some diners, no doubt, the crowded, frenetic air of the restaurant is an adrenaline-pumping (or maybe pheromone-priming) turn-on. It certainly connects 5 Ninth to its addling environs, toward which the restaurant exhibits an interesting ambivalence. Its only identifying mark is a tiny numeral on its inconspicuous front door. 5 Ninth seems to be coyly retreating from its neighbors, trying to stand a few refined paces apart. That goal is laudable, and not yet attained. 5 Ninth  * [Rating: One Star]  5 Ninth Avenue (Gansevoort Street), meatpacking district; (212) 929-9460. ATMOSPHERE -- A sleekly, beautifully renovated three-story town house with a garden in the back, a bar on the first floor, a narrow dining room on the second and a lounge on the third.  SOUND LEVEL -- Relatively but not oppressively loud.  RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Garganelli with lamb hearts; steamed loup de mer; baby chicken with Malaysian marinade or white wine and rosemary; duck with foie gras and figs; banana pudding.  WINE LIST -- Concise and multinational, encompassing about 50 wines with an emphasis on Italy and on bottles between $20 and $50, several of which can also be ordered by the half-carafe.  PRICE RANGE -- Appetizers, $12 to $20. Noodle dishes, $13 to $19. Entrees, $25 to $32. Desserts, $8.  HOURS -- Dinner nightly, 6 to 11 p.m.; abbreviated late-night menu Wednesday through Saturday, 11 p.m. to 2 a.m.  RESERVATIONS -- Call about three weeks ahead for prime dinner hours.  CREDIT CARDS -- American Express, Visa, MasterCard.  WHEELCHAIR ACCESS -- A chairlift from garden to first floor, and one handicapped restroom.

       "  'review': 'IN recent years restaurateurs in Manhattan have increasingly embraced Japanese as one of the cuisines best suited to stylish, visually arresting, loud and large restaurants, the kind with ruinously expensive cocktails in ridiculously bright hues. Japanese has become culinary fodder for all-purpose fabulousness, a low-carbohydrate prop in elaborate theatrical productions that are ultimately about much more than food. But not at Donguri, a Japanese restaurant that directs your attention squarely to what is on your plate. Where else would you look? What else could distract you? The dining room is tiny, unadorned and merely functional, with just 24 seats. There is no music, and there are no martinis, traditional or newfangled. The people sitting at the adjacent table are not talking about \"Entourage\" and trying to look as casually fashionable as the characters in that HBO show. They have their noses deep in bowls of buckwheat noodles, and they are much too content to be self-conscious about the slurping sounds they are making. Donguri is an antihip Japanese restaurant, matter-of-fact and brightly lighted, with servers who briskly and almost wordlessly ferry dishes to and from the kitchen, their banter minimal as they strive to make sure your tabletop is never, ever barren. It feels like a Japanese trattoria or bistro, to borrow terms from other dining traditions. It serves what some of its many longtime fans call Japanese home cooking or Japanese comfort food: lightly fried fish in addition to sashimi, simply grilled chicken with ponzu sauce as well as tempura. You do not come here to sit and pose. You come here to eat well. Donguri was opened in 1998 by Shuji Fujita, who runs the kitchen, and his wife, Michiko, who presides over the dining room. Since then it has evolved into a Manhattan-restaurant oxymoron: the successful secret. It is not even listed in the current Zagat Survey. The people who know about it tend not to talk it up, lest they find themselves unable to get a seat. But my mandate and my nature are to tattle -- make that share -- and so I am doing precisely that. Give Donguri a try, but call first and make a reservation. And know that even if you do that, you may nonetheless find yourself waiting for 10 to 20 minutes on the curb outside. Donguri has no bar, no lounge. It barely has a foyer. Your meal will begin with a small, complimentary dish that will be the first signal that you are in a charmed realm of supremely fresh, utterly straightforward food. One night a friend and I received about eight tiny shrimp, still in their shells, still with their heads. They had been thrown, while alive, into corn oil and deep-fried for just an instant. \"Eat whole,\" said our server, in tentative English and a soft voice. \"Be careful. Very sharp.\" They were, with ridges and edges that vaguely scratched the inside of my mouth and made the experience all the more exciting. Another night our meal started with a Lilliputian bowl of pickled vegetables in a cold miso broth and along with it a broiled rectangle of tofu with a pinprick of wasabi on top. Again, so simple. Again, so good. If the lengthy list of daily specials includes oysters, order them. The Kumamoto oysters that several friends and I had one night were first-rate. So was the sashimi that followed. On the nights I visited Donguri the restaurant did not offer sushi, and the sashimi options had been edited down -- in a way that I greatly appreciated -- to a few fresh selections: kanpachi, which is a kind of yellowtail; sea urchin; bluefin; and bluefin otoro and chutoro. The toro, subtly stippled with fat and buttery in texture, was our favorite. Toro usually is. You build a meal at Donguri through a succession of small and medium-size plates, proceeding in general from cold to hot and from fish to meat, and you throw in some vegetable sides and perhaps a bowl of noodles along the way. All of this makes for a pleasantly paced experience in which the grazing almost never stops. But it also translates into a bill that can be higher than the generally restrained prices of individual items and the plainness of the atmosphere lead you to believe it will be. You can easily spend $60 a person on food, and much more if you order some wine, from an extremely short but judicious list, or sake, a much broader selection of which is available. Raw and cooked, sautéed and deep-fried, fish predominates on the Donguri menu. My favorites included grilled squid, which was a special one night. It was unusually supple and had been seasoned only with salt, although there were scallions and grated ginger on the side. Just as good was the broiled Chilean sea bass, a staple on the menu, which had been marinated in dashi, sake, soy sauce and pickled yuzu. The tempura at Donguri -- shrimp, sweet potato, lotus root, maitake mushroom, zucchini and other kinds -- is dependably airy, faintly crunchy and never oily. The boiled spinach with sesame sauce might not draw your eye, but make room for it on your table. That sauce bears only slight relation to the gloppy, gooey sesame paste that so many Chinese takeout places ladle indiscriminately onto cold noodles. It is much nimbler, much more finely balanced. Among limited dessert options, the sliced Asian pear that we tried was fresh and refreshing, and the interplay between sweet and savory in vanilla ice cream with red bean sauce made for a satisfying conclusion to a more than satisfying meal. Donguri is the kind of restaurant at which you could happily eat once every week or two, and I got the sense that a significant percentage of the diners around me do precisely that. Some of them were Japanese and were speaking that language. Many of them seemed to know the servers well and vice versa. That familiarity lent an easygoing air to the restaurant, which lacks the polish or sparkle to qualify as a big night out. It is more like a little night in, and a memorable one at that. Donguri  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  309 East 83rd Street (Second Avenue); (212) 737-5656. ATMOSPHERE -- A tiny, brightly lighted room with 24 seats and a long, unpainted brick wall with a few small oil paintings on it.  SOUND LEVEL -- Moderate.  RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Kumamoto oysters; chutoro and otoro sashimi; kanpachi sashimi; shrimp tempura; boiled spinach with sesame sauce; broiled Chilean sea bass; grilled chicken with ponzu sauce.  WINE LIST -- Just four whites, three reds and about a dozen kinds of sake, available by the glass, half-bottle or bottle and described succinctly and poetically on a menu bound with red, green or purple ribbon.  PRICE RANGE -- Appetizers, $3.50 to $28.00. Entrees, $13 to $26. Five-course tasting menu, $42. Eight-course tasting menu, $62.  HOURS -- Tuesday through Sunday, 5:30 to 9:45 p.m.  RESERVATIONS -- Absolutely essential, due to the size of the place. Call at least several days or a week ahead.  CREDIT CARDS -- All major cards.  WHEELCHAIR ACCESS -- Although the restaurant is at street level, it is too cramped for most wheelchairs, and the restroom is not accessible.

       "  'review': \"A TALL maple tree shades the Brooklyn backyard of Ici, a sweet new restaurant full of unpretentious pleasures. One of them is that broad canopy of leaves, under which I dined on a recent night. It filtered the last rays of sunlight and shimmied in a slight summer breeze, accentuating the feeling of calm that Ici weaves. I lifted my gaze to the darkening sky; I lifted a glass of a bracing southern Italian white wine to my lips. I was happy. When the food came, it prolonged and even deepened that spell. There was arugula at the start, and it is hard to imagine that it could have been fresher, or more sensibly dressed. A hint of bitter lemon clung to the greens. A diffuse sheen of olive oil tempered the lemon's bite. These ingredients and flavors were more like suggestions than outright presences, diffident stagehands rather than histrionic scene stealers. A salad can be produced with much more fanfare -- this one added fennel and grana Padano cheese to the mix -- but that does not make it any better. There was cod later on, with a refreshing Provençal-style sauce of tomato, garlic and onions, and my fork cut easily through the flesh rather than bouncing off it, as happens too often with a fish that can turn rubbery in the care of a careless kitchen. There was a plum tart after that, the ripe, sweet fruit buttressed by firm, flaky pastry. And along the way, bridging the beginning and the end, there was much -- perhaps too much -- wine. The Italian white was followed by several nimble French reds. When a server asked if I wanted yet another glass, I sheepishly muttered, ''I'm afraid I do.'' ''Don't be afraid,'' she said, her French accent and her sure delivery making the command sound oracular. ''There is the French paradox.'' She was referring to a belief that drinking wine saves many French people, with their fat-rich diets, from heart disease. She was giving me an excuse and an out, which I seized. There is a restaurant paradox, too. Sometimes restaurants succeed precisely because they do not try too hard. Because they are humble in reach. Because they are what they are, and they know what that is. Ici provides a good example. Its menu is extremely brief, with as few as a half-dozen appetizers and a half-dozen entrees. The handiwork behind some dishes is as simple as a sauté pan, butter and a few accents and herbs. There are only about 30 wines available -- all of them European, most of them French and many from small producers that eschew pesticides and embrace biodynamic techniques. Those criteria translate into curiosity-piquing selections, like that Italian white: a falanghina, which is an ancient varietal, made by Ocone. There is not a great deal by way of décor, but the walls in the 40-seat dining room, which is on the ground floor of a brownstone in Fort Greene, are freshly and immaculately painted, and they have handsome sconces that throw soft light. Ici has the intentions and soul of a neighborhood bistro, not a destination restaurant, although it turns out to be a very pleasant destination. It does not try to wow but to soothe, and every time I lingered there, I felt tranquil and content, in a modest way that befitted the place. For its married owners as well as its customers, Ici represents a retreat: it is what happens when two people who love restaurants but have soured on the scene decide to jettison all that jangle. Laurent and Catherine Saillard, both of whom are French, have the pooled experience of Bouley, Balthazar, Alain Ducasse and Pastis in their restaurant pasts. Mr. Saillard, who is in charge of the Ici menu, also put in time as the general manager of Rocco's, and appeared on the television reality show ''The Restaurant,'' coming across as a haughty villain. He told me during a recent telephone conversation that he hated that image. He said that he and his wife opened Ici so they could walk to work (they live a few blocks away), keep their 1- and 3-year-old sons underfoot and do things their own way. That way involves produce from nearby farms. It involves grass-fed beef from Arizona for the hanger steak, which is served in a terrific red wine and shallot sauce, and organic poultry for the roasted chicken, which comes with lemon-flavored couscous. It involves a comforting spaetzle appetizer with fresh corn, shards of dark chicken meat and tarragon. One of the other best appetizers is a frisée salad with smoked bluefish and a creamy horseradish dressing: it manages the trick of robustness without heaviness. The best entrees may well be the cod and the buttery skate, which features toasted hazelnuts and capers. Even within the limited scope of Ici's ambitions, not everything works. Mr. Saillard usually puts a pasta on the menu, and the one I sampled, with ricotta and asparagus, was dull. The roasted chicken on the night I tried it was seriously overcooked. Among the otherwise good desserts, the panna cotta had a lavender glaze that made me feel like I was licking a perfume bottle. But Ici does not promise perfection, and it delivers many small, happy surprises. It serves breakfast, including a fluffy vegetable frittata and a devilishly rich, homemade chocolate croissant. It has a vibrant mix of white, black, gay, straight, elderly and young customers, including plenty of neighborhood toddlers. That back garden has 36 seats and a white picket fence. And throughout the restaurant, there are little and big bunches of fresh fruit. My dinner check one night came with a trio of red cherries atop it, like paperweights. They were not so much exclamation points as little ellipses, and that was the right punctuation for Ici. Ici * [Rating: One Star] 246 Dekalb Avenue (Vanderbilt Avenue), Fort Greene, Brooklyn; (718) 789-2778.

       "  'review': \"ONE question more than any other hovers over Wolfgang's Steakhouse and its odds for success: are the juicy, buttery porterhouses here as delectably exceptional, in taste as well as heft, as the ones across the East River, at Peter Luger? In other words, does Wolfgang's manage to hold onto the beefy rapture as it edits out Brooklyn and the Williamsburg Bridge? An answer to that required a very special journey on a very caloric night, during which a friend and I willingly (and, truth be told, gleefully) sacrificed our cardiovascular futures on the altar of Thorough and Accurate Scientific Research. At 6:43, we had the Steak for Two at Wolfgang's. At 9:21, we had the Steak for Two at Luger. At 10:27, we should have had coronary bypass procedures. Instead, we called a taxi, then rode back to Manhattan in the deep silence of our shared protein comas, calculating how many years we had shaved off our lives and wondering whether we would ever again have reason, at company expense, to repeat the experiment. We certainly hoped so. The results follow in a bit, after an explanation of how Luger and Wolfgang's fit together and come apart. Wolfgang's does not refer to Wolfgang Puck but to Wolfgang Zwiener, who for many decades was the head waiter at Luger, the most celebrated steakhouse in New York City. His long service there gave him some access to the Luger secrets for making beef taste so great. He and his co-owners, including one of his sons and two former Luger waiters, endeavor to replicate this process at Wolfgang's, where steaks hang in a dry-aging box in the basement for weeks, then are cooked under a high-temperature broiler that produces a deeply charred exterior. As at Luger, the porterhouses at Wolfgang's are sized as Steak for Two, Three or Four and served on a tilted dish that lets blood and butter form a healthful dipping pool at one end. But Wolfgang's also tries to correct Luger's perceived inconveniences and limitations. It is simultaneously Luger-minus and Luger-plus, its sire's influence obvious in each deviation from, or genuflection before, the original. Wolfgang's stakes its claim smack in Midtown Manhattan. Unlike Luger, it takes major credit cards. There is a wider variety of salads, and Wolfgang's makes more than a perfunctory nod in the direction of the sea. Chilled crab meat and oysters have been added to the obligatory shrimp cocktail. For main courses, there is swordfish, yellowfin tuna, salmon and lobster. Wolfgang's also has the benefit of a beautiful main dining room in what used to be the Vanderbilt Hotel. The vaulted ceilings, tiled in blue and white, are designated as landmarks and a glory to behold. The atmosphere nonetheless feels gruff. The wait staff is all male and more efficient than warm. On my first visit, which preceded my porterhouse-a-palooza by several weeks, women were sparse in the early-evening dinner crowd, and the men had brought the bantam boisterousness of the trading floor into the restaurant, which was too loud for comfort. ''I feel like I'm in a gym,'' said one of my guests, who had never been in one. I set her straight: no Crunch would stay in business with clients who were carrying around, or rapidly accruing, this much paunch. Wolfgang's doles out mammoth portions, straight through dessert. I had a slice of cheesecake that was big enough for its own treadmill. It was also delicious. Other gargantuan desserts and large dishes ran the gamut from bad (a nut-deprived pecan pie, a tough slab of the swordfish) to satisfactory (a meaty but bland crab cake, overcooked lamb chops) to very good (the tuna, which was nicely grilled, and German potatoes, with sweeter onions than the Luger version). Best of all was the beef. A rib-eye steak (not on the Luger menu) yielded striations of color and texture: the black, crisp exterior gave way to soft red pinpricks in the center. A sirloin had similar virtues, and so did the porterhouse, arguably the raison d'être of Wolfgang's and Luger. My cholesterol-impervious friend and I tried just a few slices, knowing there would be more in another borough, at a later hour. Then we each had another slice. It was definitely time to stop. We had another. The meat was many wonderful things at once, or in rapid succession: crunchy, tender, smoky, earthy. It induced a kind of euphoria -- and a stab of guilt. We walked all the way to Williamsburg. Our gluttony demanded penance. The Luger porterhouse demanded awe. It was, amazingly, even better, chiefly because the steak had been cut about an eighth of an inch thicker (we measured), which allowed for more contrast between the exterior and interior. Luger also hewed to our medium-rare request. Wolfgang's had overbroiled. But not by much. I'll go back -- in two or three months, which is when I expect my arteries to reopen. Wolfgang's Steakhouse ** [Rating: two stars] 4 Park Avenue (33rd Street), Midtown; (212) 889-3369. ATMOSPHERE -- A beautiful room with vaulted tiled ceilings over thick clouds of testosterone. SERVICE -- Efficient but gruff. SOUND LEVEL -- Almost deafening when it is crowded. RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Shrimp cocktail; Canadian bacon; steak for two, three or four; rib-eye steak; sirloin steak; grilled tuna; German potatoes; onion rings; creamed spinach; cheesecake. WINE LIST -- Suitably varied but not very imaginative, with an emphasis on California. PRICE RANGE -- Lunch and dinner, appetizers, $7.95 to $17.95; entrees, $29.95 to $37.95; desserts, $7.95. HOURS -- Monday to Thursday, noon to 10 p.m. Friday, noon to 11 p.m. Saturday, 5 p.m. to 11 p.m. Closed Sundays.

       "  'review': \"THE menu at Megu begins with some counsel, or rather cheerleading, asking you to explore the 9 ensuing pages -- 12 if you count the glossary of ingredients and the map of Japan -- ''as you would a beautiful garden.'' What a lovely wish, and what a ludicrous one. Without a machete and a G.P.S. device, there is no easy way to navigate this thicket. ''It's all good,'' said a waiter, chuckling nervously, when I asked about the seemingly infinite iterations of toro and Kobe, sushi and sashimi, clumped into such semantically indistinct categories as ''Gems From Japan,'' ''Jewels From Japan,'' ''Crown Gems'' and ''Crown Jewels.'' Were these starters or main courses? Little tastes or big bites? Best eaten in a certain sequence? ''Order a lot,'' the waiter suggested, which did not really help. But it did hint at the overarching problem with Megu, a flamboyant addition to the expanding ranks of Japanese restaurants in New York. In too many ways, Megu is oblivious to the not-so-fine lines between welcome extravagance and unwelcome excess, bewitching theatricality and befuddling foolishness. If it reined itself in, it might be one of the most thrilling dining experiences in the city. It occupies a colossal space in TriBeCa that used to be the restaurant Obeca Li and received a magnificent, roughly $8 million, makeover. Its chef, Koji Imai, making his American debut, puts top-tier ingredients to often sumptuous use. Those ''Crown Gems,'' for example, are three tartarelike treatments of a subspecies of blackfin tuna with ruby-colored flesh so bright that it really does glitter, so meltingly tender that it seems to evaporate on your tongue. My favorite of the three dishes inserts cubes of the tuna between thick, silky slices of avocado that uncannily echo the fish's texture and richness. The Kobe beef, which comes from Texas, is so deeply flavorful that it almost makes you swoon, and if the $180 price tag on a seven-ounce fillet makes you stagger, you can order, instead, paper-thin ribbons of rib meat, which are $30. You cook the ribbons yourself, on a hot rock that a server brings to you. Then you dip them in a sesame sauce, a soy sauce or sea salt (the best choice), each of which fills a separate chamber of a series of gorgeous condiment plates. Megu contrives a nonstop carnival of sensations, but it also makes you pay dearly for the adventure, showing as little inhibition with prices as it does with everything -- except portions. You can easily spend $100 a person on food alone and find yourself hungry again three hours later. That $30 serving of Kobe is not much larger than an appetizer. A sushi combination platter runs $60 a person and is not enough for a full meal. ''Most of the fish is flown in daily from Japan,'' a waiter proudly explained. ''It couldn't travel coach?'' one of my guests quietly grumbled. Nine medium-size asparagus spears cost $21; they are planted vertically in an enormous bowl of glowing ice, which is illuminated from below by a blue light. Dinner at Megu, in other words, is likely to be more expensive than dinner at Nobu, which is about four blocks away and terrific. But Megu can claim some advantages. With nearly 300 seats over two floors, it offers much greater hope for a reservation. It has an ice Buddha, remade daily, that shimmers in the center of the main dining room beneath a gargantuan temple bell. It also has crickets, or at least the faint, teasing sound of them, piped into the restrooms to evoke a summer night in the country. There is no end to Megu's nifty inventions and cloying gimmicks, and significant overlap between the two. Instead of using the green-tinged horseradish that many restaurants use, Megu sends servers out with real wasabi roots, to be grated at diners' tables. What results is a milder, more pleasant paste -- and maybe a self-conscious performance. ''It actually takes five years for this root to grow,'' said a philosophically inclined server. ''Then I grate it in one night. This makes me think about time.'' That server was no wordier than the sake list, 10 pages of fairly ornate prose. I veered instead toward the special cocktails and especially liked the Blessing, whose name is the translation of megu. A vodka-based cousin to the cosmopolitan, it features pomegranate juice and comes with purple, blue or yellow flower petals on the surface. I also liked, or loved, more than three-quarters of the food I ate at Megu. Among the dozens of sushi and sashimi options, I came across creamy sea urchin that had the pitch-perfect degree of brininess. Among the meats that Megu grills over bincho tan, a Japanese charcoal, I relished four Kobe beef skewers, each with a different paste: wasabi, miso, sesame and garlic. Sautéed shrimp in a cream sauce of kanzuri, a combination of citrus and chili peppers, were a spicy, lightly crunchy knockout. So was an unconscionably (but rapturously) gooey amalgam of foie gras, sea eel, black truffles and egg custard that appears frequently on the menu, depending on the availability of fresh eel. There is ample good within Megu's plenty, even on the (separate) dessert menu, where a crème brûlée and the ice creams are standouts. But one of a restaurant's main purposes is to bring order to a vast culinary universe -- to weed and prune it, if you will. Megu does not bother. So you stumble through an enchanting and maddening forest, distracted by the toro untried, the roe not taken. Megu ** [Rating: Two Stars] 62 Thomas Street (West Broadway), TriBeCa; (212) 964-7777.

WINE LIST -- A respectable array from around the world, but the emphasis is on 50 Japanese sakes, all available by the glass or bottle. PRICE RANGE -- Sushi, $5 to $20 apiece; soups and salads, $6 to $21; other dishes, $15 to $180; desserts, $7 to $15.

       "  'review': \"EVERY diner I know who has been to Balthazar has a story about being snubbed by the maître d'hôtel, hung up on by the reservationist, or ignored by a waiter tending to a more important guest. Yet everyone who has a grievance (myself included) returns again and again. Something draws us back. After seven years in business, Balthazar has reached that stage in the life of a restaurant when diners' eyes soften as they call to mind memories of meals past, memories of Lillet and oysters and crisp, peaked croissants and the evenings of carefree youth. A married friend recently gave me a sentimental tour of the many tables at which she had had dates. Balthazar is no longer hip, but it's still bustling. At 8:30 on a recent Wednesday night, groups of waiting diners chatted outside, customers streamed out of the bakery attached to the restaurant, and the predictable cluster of beggars were at the reservation desk, being snubbed by the maître d'hôtel. It is never easy getting in, but once you are at your table, your cocoon, the charms of Balthazar take over. The low-backed banquettes allow diners to see almost every other table through the room's hazy yellow glow. The space is loud, yet within your cocoon, you can hear your companions. And the wait staff has a machine-tooled finesse -- particularly the busboys, who zip by your table, pouring water and gliding on to the next table in continuous motion. After the main course, they change the paper on your table in a flutter of origami folds. The menu is much the same as always. Most of the best dishes are still there, and so are the less successful items. The beet salad still does not coalesce. Large beet cubes, walnut halves and a wedge of blue cheese rest under a tuft of mâche. It has the potential to be a great combination, just as a pile of lumber has the potential to be a great house. And steer clear of the garganelli pasta with tomatoes and the sautéed skate. But the Balthazar salad, romaine, frisée, asparagus, ricotta salata and truffle oil all mashed together, is as good as ever in its slick and wilted way. The escargots drew my companions' attention, large brown coils filled with juicy snails with plenty of the most important part -- the butter, garlic and parsley at the bottom of the baking dish. I adore the brandade, which is coarse and rustic, a mound of potatoes and salt cod marked with rivulets of olive oil, and topped with thin shards of toast. You spread a patch of brandade on the toast, and the delicate toast shatters in your mouth. And the crisp, salty French fries, which are served with the steak and a few other dishes, are still the best in the city. The menu maintains a backbone of classics throughout the year, as well as an ample infusion of seasonal dishes. Right now, for instance, there is navarin d'agneau with baby turnips and carrots, and asparagus spears, which are warm and come blanketed with a tangy hollandaise and small fragrant morels. One reason the food has held up so well is that Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson, the co-chefs who started when the restaurant opened, are still here. Lately, they have put more energy into the desserts. None of them will win awards for creativity, but almost all are excellent versions of the familiar. The apples on the tarte Tatin are cooked down so that they are chewy and candied on the edges. The tart of the day, when it is the cherry and almond, should not be missed. It is chewy, sharp and permeated with the essence of almonds. The profiteroles are as cold and sloppy as you could wish, and the Pavlova, a crisp meringue filled with ricotta whipped cream, is soaked with juicy blueberries and strawberries. In 1997, when Keith McNally opened Balthazar, it seemed to be merely a simulacrum of a turn-of-the-century French brasserie, notable for its museum-quality distressed tiles, faded mirrors and dented and worn zinc bar. But because Balthazar is animated from early in the morning to late at night by diners who treat it like a brasserie, rather than a sanctified restaurant (it is closed about six hours a day), the place now feels authentically worn, and it is difficult to distinguish between the real faded and the fake faded. The stairs leading down to the bathroom dip in the center and are worn down to raw wood. The restroom feels as if it has been there for 100 years, with clean but creaky stalls. A friendly woman is there to hand you a towel, and when you don't have money, she waves you off warmly. ''Next time,'' she says. ''Next time.'' Lunch is a good hour at Balthazar. You can tuck into a platter of oysters and a glass of wine; the lamb sandwich spread with harissa mayonnaise is also excellent. But my favorite hour at Balthazar is breakfast. Then the light is pure, the sound of forks and glass on tabletops is crisp. You can have Nutella spread on a baguette with a latte served in a large bowl, and a soft-boiled egg with toast ''soldiers.'' People are tapping away at their computers, sitting up straight for business meetings or nodding sleepily in their chairs. The atmosphere -- fake French, authentic New York -- buoys the room. Keith McNally, Balthazar's owner, was right all along -- a dining institution needs more than just great food. Balthazar ** [rating: two stars] 80 Spring Street (Crosby Street), SoHo; (212) 965-1414. ATMOSPHERE -- Faux Parisian brasserie with faded mirrors, bright lighting and red banquettes. SOUND LEVEL -- Loud. RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Brandade; goat cheese tart; escargots; seafood platter; Balthazar salad; steak frites; chicken paprikash; Pavlova; tarte Tatin; profiteroles. SERVICE -- Brisk and efficient, not always friendly. WINE LIST -- Respectable French wines, with plenty around $40. Good selection of aperitifs, wines by the glass, ciders and digestifs. HOURS -- Monday to Thursday, 7:30 a.m. to 1 a.m.; Friday, 7:30 a.m. to 2 a.m.; Saturday, 8 a.m. to 2 a.m.; Sunday, 8 a.m. to midnight.

       "  'review': \"WHEN Wallsé, an Austrian restaurant on West 11th Street, opened in 2000, it presented itself as a brave outpost on a residential frontier far from pedestrians' reach. It seemed an appropriate station for Kurt Gutenbrunner, Wallsé's chef and owner, who is outspoken and gruff, a rebel in a city full of media-groomed chefs. Rather than gliding through his dining room with a hand out to welcome customers, Mr. Gutenbrunner tends to march through, jerking his head as he inspects the scene, and abruptly approaching tables with a stern, ''Hello,'' followed by silence. If you have not eaten enough, he will tell you. If you argue with him, he is likely to puff up like an angry cat. With Mr. Gutenbrunner, what you see is what you get, and that carries over to his candid menu. And that, among other reasons, is why the restaurant continues to thrive, despite a wealth of competitors creeping into the neighborhood. Mr. Gutenbrunner opened Wallsé after working for four years as the executive chef at Bouley. David Bouley's influence, coupled with Mr. Gutenbrunner's Austrian background -- he is from Wallsee -- made for a stimulating blend of elegance and brawn. Delicately poached lobster and light asparagus soup coexisted happily with venison and lingonberries, goulash and potato pancakes. When the restaurant opened, it had a cool Scandinavian feel with polished floors, white walls and bleak black-and-white photographs of Austrian castles by Alexander Vethers. Vases overflowing with peonies or forsythia gave the room a soft touch, and enormous windows beginning on West 11th Street and wrapping around the Washington Street side flooded the place with light. Not much has changed. A black carpet now covers the floors, making the room quieter and warmer, and in place of the photographs an assortment of paintings, including a few by Julian Schnabel, a regular at the restaurant, have been hung. The cool and sleek has an overlay of idiosyncratic homeyness. Mr. Gutenbrunner has also remained loyal to his menu. It may be a bore for his cooks, but it was a delight to return and find kavalierspitz, a boiled beef shoulder, still among the entrees and spaetzle with braised rabbit as an appetizer. Mr. Gutenbrunner has a fondness for vegetables and herbs and uses them wisely to offset the heft of some of the Austrian dishes. If you are not tempted by goulash with spaetzle (a perfect dish), you can have wild striped bass, topped with a tuft of freshly grated horseradish. A buttery disk of foie gras terrine conceals a salad of green beans, wax beans, shallots, pistachios and thyme. A potato rösti, or pancake, is layered with lobster, horseradish crème fraîche, herbs and fennel, creating a wonderful spectrum of textures. His lengthy menu of daily specials often engages seasonal produce, and right now on the main menu is a frothy pea soup that is as green as moss and animated with an infusion of pineapple mint. Giant spears of white asparagus are prepared classically, with folds of baked ham and creamy slices of potato, all resting in a swirl of béarnaise. One dish that is partly out of season but still delicious is a terrine of tomato, artichokes and goat cheese. The tomato has been roasted and skinned so that it is sweet and pulpy. The artichokes are also sweet, and both coalesce with the help of the fluffy and tangy goat cheese. Mr. Gutenbrunner, once seen as a pioneer among chefs, has not been fazed by contemporaries like Ferran Adrià and Thomas Keller. He continues to be a great cook without foam, without powdered kumquat. It is a pleasure to order Wiener schnitzel and know you are going to get a breaded and fried piece of veal, and that the roasted venison does not involve roasted venison essence infused into potatoes formed in the shape of a venison chop. The venison chop here is big and hearty, and is surrounded by leaves of Brussels sprouts, slack and toothsome. In a dish of Maine lobster, warm pieces of claw and tail, poached in beurre blanc, are tangled with slices of fennel, peas and yellow raisins and glazed with a saffron sauce. It is as French and as classic as a Citroën. A rare hint of playfulness comes in a dish called ''skate salad,'' which is not a fish salad, but fish with salad. Menu semantics often raise the blood pressure of diners, but I must side with Mr. Gutenbrunner. Skate salad caught my eye, and the dish did not disappoint. Sautéed skate is served on top of a cluster of sautéed morels (they never raise my ire), and all around it is a tart cucumber vinaigrette and crisp cubes of cucumber. The salad, a sweet pile of bibb lettuce and dill, rises off to the side. Despite Wallsé's liberal use of lobster and foie gras, it has maintained a neighborhood demeanor. On most nights there is enough room at the bar for you to walk in and have dinner. It has a compact wine list that manages to excite you about selections with names like Bründlfangen and Smaragd, without assaulting your wallet. There is an excellent, but not overreaching cheese menu (try the Valençay). And Wallsé is not too pretentious to serve bottled water from green plastic bottles. (The brand is Römerquelle, Austrian, of course.) For diners who have grown accustomed to a culture full of restaurants that shock and awe and then fall apart, it is a treat to find a restaurant that continues to sail along, assured and unfettered. There are some things, like honey glazed duck and passion fruit crepes, that I would pass on next time. Not because they are bad, but because there are better things on the menu. If you don't end your meal with cheese, you might try the Salzburger nockerl, which is a kind of low-lying, sturdy soufflé on top of a bed of huckleberries. Or perhaps the Topfenknödel, a dessert which, after many tries, I am still not sure about, although I am intrigued. It is served in a deep bowl covered with sweetened rice paper. You peel back the paper to find a rhubarb compote and one (sometimes two) sweet bread-crumb-covered dumplings. On another plate you are given a glass of strawberry water and strawberry and rhubarb sorbet. A guest at my table described it as ''all sound and not enough fury.'' I would call it an amusing detour on an otherwise very steady voyage. Wallsé ** [Rating: two stars] 344 West 11th Street (Washington Street), Greenwich Village; (212) 352-2300. ATMOSPHERE -- Subdued black and white rooms distinguished by gloomy Julian Schnabel paintings. SOUND LEVEL -- Low enough to hear your neighbors' conversation.

       "  'review': \"Correction Appended APERITIFS and amuse-bouches, pleasurable rituals though they may be, are also handy barometers of a restaurant's quality. They forecast its sensibilities, attitude and attention to detail. That's why, when the 1874 manhattan, made with Woodford Reserve bourbon, arrived at our table at BLT Steak, my mood lightened. The martini glass was accessorized with bourbon- and kirsch-soaked cherries impaled on a stick, and the cocktail itself, sweet and oaky and stiffened with a dash of bitters, eased across my palate. We were in capable hands, and if the size of the drink was any indication, we were not going to leave hungry. The manhattan also helped bring into focus the restaurant's rather blurry image. Though there is an obligatory photo of Arturo DeModica's sculpture ''Charging Bull'' in Bowling Green Park, BLT Steak feels like anything but a steakhouse. On the communal table at BLT Steak, which stands for ''Bistro Laurent Tourondel'' -- the name of the chef, not ''Bacon Lettuce and Tomato'' -- square vases are packed with trimmed leeks. Banquettes are covered in buttery suede and the tables, made of striated Makassar ebony, are glazed with a thick layer of baked resin. It's Peter Luger after a heavy session with the crew from ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.'' It takes chutzpah to launch a new entry in a category as storied as the New York steakhouse. And a strategy to redefine expectations; otherwise you end up like the colossally bland Michael Jordan's the Steak House NYC. Diners need a reason to shift alliances, and BLT Steak succeeds in this. In addition to well-seared meats and a serious wine list, there is a soft touch in the cooking, a sensitivity to acute flavors and seasonal ingredients. After the aperitif, the positive indicators continued to accumulate. Menus were delivered with a selection of antipasti -- marinated mushrooms, infused with coriander, a tiny bowl filled with duck liver mousse and a platter of cured meats. Serrano ham was carved into slices as delicate as tissue paper. The bresaola, delicious on its own, was tangibly improved with a sprinkle of lemon juice, olive oil and cracked black peppercorns. And just as these delicacies were cleared, a plate of popovers arrived. Each was the size of a ham hock and had a cap of melted Gruyère and a warm, eggy interior. In rethinking the steakhouse, Mr. Tourondel is renovating his own image. Previously, he was chef at Cello, a restaurant on the Upper East Side where his skill with fish earned him three stars from William Grimes of The New York Times in 1999. Indeed, two of the best dishes on BLT Steak's menu are the seafood platter and Dover sole sautéed on the bone. Here Mr. Tourondel's focus is on dry-aged meats in primal cuts. Of these, the hanger is by far the most flavorful. It is a homely cut, served with a dark crust, and a gamy interior that is dense with an iodine tang. But oddly, the beef was the most underwhelming part of the menu, not because of the way it was cooked but because the beef itself -- which comes from DeBragga & Spitler, where it is dry-aged for 28 days -- lacked the depth of flavor normally associated with aged beef. Luckily, the various accompanying sauces are excellent. The horseradish is amply hot and light; the three mustards include a beguiling red wine mustard that has a fruity and lasting heat; and the peppercorn is a beautifully executed classic sauce. The servers encourage you to try several at a time, which only serves to distract your palate. Avoid this. While veal chop and rack of lamb often seem like tame choices, here they are stunning. The veal is roasted with a moist crust made of bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and a wallop of rosemary. With each sweet bite of veal, there is a flash of the potent crust. The lamb is spread with a layer of ground parsley, garlic, chives and pine nuts. Where Mr. Tourondel really excels, and where he manages to take the steakhouse idea forward and distinguish himself from the merely excellent, is on the periphery -- in the soups, salads and side dishes. His white mushroom soup with truffle oil is poured into a bowl through a mound of foamy truffle sabayon. It is supple yet not subtle. (And if you can say that 10 times fast after having the 1874 manhattan, you should get your dinner free.) The crab cake is constructed of large lumps of crab, invisibly bound, and served on a crunchy, tangy celery mayonnaise. Like many touches here, the onion rings are cartoonishly proportioned, stacked like doughnuts in a round iron pan. Inside each crisp, salty shell is a thick softened ring of sweet onion. Fat asparagus spears are grilled and left firm. In the potato gratin, 10 thick slices of potato are laid like fish scales in a square modern dish and doused in a delicious cream. It is difficult to save room for dessert, but you should. It would be a shame to miss the best chocolate tart in New York City. It is sliced into a thick wedge of darkness, and looms over a small quenelle of almond milk ice cream. The crepe soufflé is a welcome remnant of Mr. Tourondel's past days of elegance. The fluffy, moon-shaped crepe is encased by a thin shell of caramel; below it is a puddle of tangy citrus sauce, flecked with passion fruit seeds. Most unusual is a steamed banana pudding, which is served warm in a terrine. A scoop of rum raisin ice cream loosens and spreads over its surface. As you settle in to dessert, the last extra arrives, a tiny chocolate chip cookie from Johnny Léon, BLT's pastry chef. It is cut into a small circle -- crunchy on the top and soft with lumps of melted chocolate in the center -- a period in form and function to punctuate a fine meal.

Occasionally, though, a restaurant seems to have no one at the helm -- and La Bottega, in the Maritime Hotel, is such a place. When you dine there, the busboys pour tap water into glasses half full of the $7 sparkling water you just bought. A margherita pizza you ordered as a middle course is served and, just as you are about to bite into a slice, your main courses are plunked down next to it. When you ask where the bathrooms are, the waiter doesn't know, and the hostess merely swings her arm in the general direction. And so down to the basement you go, cursing as you seek out the bathroom yourself. But when you do find it, you pause for a moment, because it's a pretty nice bathroom, after all. Tiny azure blue tiles cover its walls, and the heavy swinging door is constructed of lacquered walnut with a frosted porthole. Down the hall is an old phone booth, perfectly restored. In design, La Bottega is an unusual collision of Italian trattoria and 1950's American high school, with an overlay of Keith McNally -- a stage set of crackle tile, distressed fabrics and soft yellow light. Booths made of the same lacquered wood as the bathroom door are cushioned in burnt-orange leather. The terrazzo flooring is inlaid with circular threads of steel. Waitresses wear dark blue outfits that resemble early women's basketball uniforms, and the waiters are in bright orange bowling shirts. In the corner, near the bar, is a wood oven. And while not all of the food coming out of it is good, the scent of wood smoke, herbs and blistering pizza dough it gives off is addictive. From the moment you walk into La Bottega you are hungry. The trattoria-style menu is long (20 appetizers and 20 main courses) and is populated with dishes that focus, in Italian style, on one or two ingredients. Fried artichokes with truffle oil. Fennel with blood orange. Prawns with sea salt. The choices are appealing, yet numbing. It is a menu everyone has read before. Ravioli filled with butternut squash? It's on there. Braised lamb with polenta? Check. Panna cotta? Of course. There is something to be said for food that is simple and familiar. But not when an appetizer costs $15. Surely John DeLucie, the chef, has better ideas than tricolor salad with young Gorgonzola cheese. And he does -- sometimes. A salad of escarole with fava beans, mint and pecorino is delicious. The escarole is chopped so that when mixed with the favas and cheese, it clings together in a dense tuft that is bitter, salty and herbal. Salmon is grilled over wood and gas, skin side down, so the skin gets dark and crisp and serves as a smoky condiment for the rich fish. In a warm calamari salad, the calamari is chopped into small bits and blended with soft wedges of avocado and tomato. As you eat it, a dash of chili oil warms your palate. Mr. DeLucie's real specialty is pizza. His crust is flavorful and thin, and the toppings are added with restraint, so that each bite is an intense taste, not just filler. Some desserts are well conceived, too. The ricotta cheesecake is cut into a wedge, low and wide, and unlike New York cheesecake, it is dense, scented with vanilla and not too sweet. It's amusing to find gelato affogato on the menu -- so simple a child could prepare it. At the table, a shot of hot espresso is poured over a scoop of vanilla gelato, making a sauce of fluffy, creamy espresso. (It's $8, like the other desserts.) If I had to choose a single dessert, however, I would order the tiramisù, a dish long in disrepute. Here, it is flopped onto a plate so it resembles a deflated balloon. The mascarpone cream is light, almost foamy; the ladyfingers are soaked on the edges but still chewy; on top is a fresh dusting of cocoa powder. But these few delights cannot make up for the slough of irksome duds. Why, when Mr. DeLucie has 19 other appetizers, must he include tomato, basil and buffalo mozzarella as the 20th? In March. Countless restaurants make the same mistake, serving this seasonal dish year round. The dish was designed to flatter good mozzarella with an herb and a little sweet acid, but tomatoes are never good this time of year. Why not pair the mozzarella with a pickled vegetable, or none at all? Great mozzarella can stand alone. Octopus carpaccio was like a mouthful of bland rubber bands. And the butternut squash ravioli was like pumpkin candy stuck between flavorless leaves of pasta. At night La Bottega fills up, mysteriously, and the din can make it seem like a party in an empty swimming pool. But at lunch, it is serene. Then, you can appreciate the lush details and flag down a waiter when you need one. Be sure to have the tuna tramezzini. A mash of tuna, capers and olives is spread in a thin layer between two slices of white bread -- bread that is soft but a little dry on the edges, as if it has been sitting in a case like the ones at bars in Italy. Still, a restaurant cannot survive on a good little sandwich. Even 'ino would not be 'ino if were not for Joe Denton, who is there night after night, tending to his handful of regulars. At the moment, La Bottega feels more like a restaurant on automatic pilot -- one built simply to fill a space in a hotel -- than an inspired place to dine. Iceberg dead ahead.

       "  'review': \"DINING at Asiate begins with a whoosh! as the elevator shoots up 35 floors to the restaurant's glassed-in perch. On the way up, it's hard not to feel camaraderie in the air. There is the thrill of having secured one of the most elusive reservations in town, the excitement of dining in the new Time Warner Center as it transforms itself into a luxury food court and the simple anticipation of a fine meal. But most of all, perhaps, is the joy at the prospect of dining among the clouds. Two of New York's best skytop restaurants, Windows on the World and Wild Blue, which were on the 106th and 107th floors of the north tower of the World Trade Center, vanished on 9/11. This left the Rainbow Room, which has long thrived on its exhilarating views: getting to watch the sun set over Hoboken has a kind of romance unique to New York City. And for a few minutes at Asiate, you get just that. A cityscape that makes your heart race and a restaurant that is designed to amplify the thrill. Tables are arranged so that most diners can overlook Central Park, and the lighting is arranged to offer a nighttime trompe l'oeil. When you look out at the skyscrapers, you also see a reflection of the lights outlining the restaurant's glass wine-storage towers -- they, too, look like skyscrapers, doubling the brilliance of the city before you. No extravagance was spared in the design, which might be described as tundra luxe -- as if Philippe Starck and Mr. Cold Miser had collaborated. A sculpture affixed to the ceiling looks like a tangle of icicles, and the bread plates resemble chips of pale blue ice. Booths in the upper dining room are swaddled in toffee-colored leather and topped with feather-plumed pillows. Menus are delivered on hefty steel plates. Do pause for an aperitif. The list, which includes sakes (the Hanahato Densho Junmai Ginjo is delicious), good sherries and an unusual selection of Scotches (some of which have been aged in Sauternes barrels), is rich in surprises. And it may be the last moment of clarity, because then, alas, the food begins to arrive, and your senses, so far stimulated, slowly become conflicted. Nori Sugie, Asiate's chef, who worked with Tetsuya Wakuda in Sydney, Australia, joins a wave of New York chefs fixated on Asian and French influences. The best present a synthesis of cuisines. His cooking, however, seems to have gotten muddled in the rarefied air. First a dish of gougères, or Gruyère-filled choux pastry, is slipped onto the table. They are tiny as buttons -- crisp little poufs, spiced with a whiff of cayenne. The flaky pastry collapses on your tongue. From here, the ride gets a little bumpy. Prawns and linguine arrive in a parchment paper pouch that is twisted closed like an enormous candy wrapper and snipped open at the table by a waiter wielding garden shears. It's a good use of culinary drama. But you know what? Steaming pasta in a paper pouch makes for gummy pasta and soggy seafood. The prawns are not nearly so worrisome as the benign-sounding vegetable appetizer, which looks like a circus parading across the plate. Flaglike sticks made of kuzukiri (a fried rice noodle), fried parsley leaves, wedges of roasted beet and miniature pattypan squash soar above dabs of potato purée. In the center a mountain potato slouches forlornly in a thick truffle sauce. There are reasons nouvelle cuisine went away, and this dish is one. It also epitomizes the flaws in the cooking at Asiate. Mr. Sugie should not be serving pattypan squash in February. And he should not feel the need to load every dish with his entire culinary arsenal. When Mr. Sugie does pull off the acrobatics, it can be marvelous. Pan-roasted branzino rests on a spoonful of brandade sweetened with caramelized fennel. Nearby, a pristine sautéed scallop sits, unfettered. Verjus and a seaweed sauce stream around the plate. Suckling pig is pressed, its cheek confited and its trotters fried into a croquette. It's salty, chewy, earthy and rich. But with many dishes, editing would help. The foie gras pâté is buttery, nutty, lovely to spread on the thick wedge of sweet toast -- yet the venison and foie gras terrine on the other side of the plate does nothing but disrupt the pleasure. The desserts are particularly prone to overcrowding. An Earl Grey crème brûlée is served with a side of litchi sorbet in a cool broth of tapioca, shaved fresh coconut, sliced litchi and coconut milk. I would happily skip the crème brûlée and have seconds of the sorbet. The same goes for raspberry granita with herbal sumac, which outshines a chocolate soufflé served alongside it. And Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate (a classic euphemism for dumbed down) has three components, which would be better off as three desserts -- or, really, off the menu entirely. But a quince tart possesses all the right magic. Delicate leaves of quince and a knob of almond purée are nestled in a crisp pastry shell. Chestnut ice cream is spooned into a tiny dish on the side. When the waiters remembered to serve the petit four, it was also lovely: a pink and white die poised on a Japanese soupspoon. It was cool, a touch of fruit and coconut. Ah, yes, you think: ambrosia from the 1970's, brought up to 2004. There are other things to admire about Asiate. The waiters are deft and have a sense of humor. When one of my dining companions demanded that the waiter stand closer so he could hear his suggestions, the waiter, Brian, promptly obliged. Later when my guest bellowed something to Brian from outside the established range, Brian smiled and held his hand to his ear. ''What's that?'' he said. ''I can't hear you.'' There is also the view. You sit atop an urban canyon, as the sheer cliffs of Midtown drop off into the park. From this height, the traffic below seems to glide and swirl without an ounce of contention. The pressures of city life ease a little. And for that alone, I might order a glass of sake, stay for the gougères, then feign illness and steal across Columbus Circle to Jean Georges for a meal that never disappoints.

       "  'review': \"CRISP and angry lobster. ''Bronx style'' filet mignon of veal. A cheesecake lollipop tree with bubble-gum whipped cream. New York culinistas will know immediately that those off-the-wall menu items can be the work of only one man, David Burke, the chef who first gave us swordfish chops and pastrami salmon. Mr. Burke, recently unleashed from the constraints of corporate chefdom, is now performing his high-wire act twice daily not far from his old stomping grounds at the Park Avenue Cafe. In December he opened David Burke & Donatella with Donatella Arpaia, a lawyer turned restaurateur who owns Bellini. While she keeps things calm and happy in the dining room, he whizzes around the kitchen preparing complex dishes of immense fussiness that really shouldn't work, but do. There are some definite misses -- and let me quickly say that bubble-gum whipped cream is one of them. But overall, diners here are in for terrific savories, a reasonable and unusual wine list and excellent people-watching. The restaurant itself, in an Upper East Side town house, is done to a turn. In fact, the all-white front room, its tables filled on the nights of my visits with high-testosterone patrons, would be quite at home in Palm Beach. The main dining room, a few steps down, is fancy and formal, yet stylish. Admiring the crimson hue of the place, one of my guests declared red the new black. All sorts of red, at that: paprika banquettes, Chinese red Roman shades, a spectacular Dale Chihuly-like sculpture over the fireplace made of red glass rods that look like licorice. It is all quite grand. This is a restaurant where you would expect to see perfectly coiffed, bejeweled women of a certain age with men in double-breasted sports jackets and striped shirts with white collars. Not to mention an astonishing number of paunchy men of a certain age who appeared to be dining with their nieces. And you do. But the Upper East Side is not what it used to be and so the dining room also supports a good number of men in cashmere Kiton sweaters and groups of young women with Prada bags at their feet. They are the new moneyed class. Still, the attentive staff is better dressed than many of the guests. And each dish, like the décor and the staff, makes a statement. David Burke can't help himself. The restaurant does not simply serve bread; it presents bread, a cross between a parkerhouse roll and a brioche, baked in a copper casserole, its sourdough top studded with thyme and sprinkled with coarse salt and zatar, a Middle Eastern spice blend. It's delicious. The butter, of course, must be decorated, so it comes sprinkled with coarse red salt. The amuse-bouche, an icy cold Kumamoto oyster with Mr. Burke's tarted-up mignonette sauce of soy, orange and lemon grass, is a perfect prelude. It takes an entire paragraph to describe one of his dishes, but unlike other chefs who play with their food, Mr. Burke seems to know what he's doing and when his complex combinations work, the depth of flavor in the dish is a joy. A lobster flan, made with Sauternes, is topped with miniature home fries and lobster meat ragù. This accompanies a shiitake dumpling and a boned leg of quail with a shiitake filling, the quail wrapped in pasta, the drumstick bone serving as a handle. Next to it sits a quail breast, coated in Asian spices with a dusting of dried orange peel. And that's just one dish. The day-boat sea scallops ''Benedict'' bring out Mr. Burke's whimsical side. The scallops sit on potato pancakes -- stand-ins for English muffins -- topped with sunny-side-up quail eggs, slices of chorizo replacing the ham, with olive tapenade sauce and a little chorizo oil. There's foam, too, a weird last-year touch, this one made with lobster broth. Foie gras is superbly combined with candied kumquats and grapes that have been poached in Armagnac and port wine and then rolled in cornflakes and fried, the poaching liquid becoming the sauce. Point counterpoint. A dish of salmon tartare and tuna tartare, which Mr. Burke first made at the River Cafe in Brooklyn, came with caviar and crème fraîche and was unctuously good. As was the salmon mousse, and the pastrami salmon with rye blini, and the tuna sashimi with a panna cotta of sea urchin. Even a simple market salad had a dash of extra flavor -- crisp potato and bacon. It is all very appealing. Blue crab ravioli with basil aioli in crab consommé may be one of the chef's simplest dishes but it is suffused with flavor. And all of the pasta dishes show a sure hand, including the cavatelli with wild mushrooms and the ravioli with spinach, though the generous gratings of black truffles really add little to the dishes. The roast chicken, which has been brined in seaweed water, is moist and tender. The Dover sole is gently cooked, preserving its delicate flavor. And the highly seasoned barbecued squab comes with a corn torte with foie gras. Just right. When Mr. Burke cooks like this he can play with his food all he wants. But some of his whimsy needs rethinking. Angry lobster has reason to be angry: it's dry and overcooked. The Bronx-style filet mignon of veal looks like a bootjack and is boring. Suckling pig stuffed with pork sausage and cornbread has far too much going on. And shrimp cooked at the table with a pouring of hot oil have no flavor for all that effort. The desserts are acceptable if you don't include the cheesecake lollipops with bubble-gum whipped cream or the fruit carpaccio, designed for carb-counters who really don't want dessert. These dishes aside, Mr. Burke and Ms. Arpaia make you want to come back for more. And they think of everything. On frigid nights smokers are invited to the ''smoking room,'' a stretched stretch limo -- white, of course -- with the motor running and the heater on, parked right outside the front door.

       "  'review': \"Correction Appended I AM more than willing to forgive Bread Tribeca for its bland soups, its charming but not always focused serving staff and the lack of spoons for its saltcellars -- I hate to think how many fingers have taken a pinch or two -- because most of the food is a pleasure. Every neighborhood would be lucky to have a place like it, where the dress code is immaterial for patrons and waiters alike, and people who linger over a cup of coffee and the paper in the middle of the afternoon are not shooed out. With its soaring windows, white brick walls, open fireplace and stripped-down look it is quintessential TriBeCa. Good breads may be the foundation of the restaurant -- Luigi Comandatore, the co-owner of the restaurant with Bob Giraldi, also owns Bread, a paninoteca on Spring Street. This more ambitious spot has moved way beyond panini, though. Still, if you fancy something between two slices you will be amazed at how good sardines taste with pepperoncini and tomatoes on a baguette. Taking its cue from Liguria, the restaurant offers food that is simply prepared and delicious. In fact, its fritto misto may be one of the best in the city. Tender, crisp, and lightly breaded, the assorted seafood and vegetables are fried to perfection and served on white paper. There are no architectural renderings on the plates here; no froufrou decorations, just straightforward cooking. If you, like me, think the only kind of pizza crust worthy of the name is rolled as thin as possible and baked in a brick oven, then you would do well to make this restaurant a pizza hangout even though there are only two choices -- pizza margherita and pizza with prosciutto and arugula. If you live in the neighborhood, so much the better: they'll deliver. Baking it in an impressive iron and brick wood-burning oven (handmade, custom built) does make a difference. Not just to the pizzas and breads, but also to the grilled vegetables and roasted meats. (It's not often that people marvel over the flavor of a plate of grilled vegetables. They usually leave them to the veggie eaters at the table.) The chef showed a very sure hand with fish: it was never overcooked. A savory tomato-shrimp flavored broth perfumed the zuppa de pesce filled with tender seafood that was sautéed before being added to the broth. Fried sardines were perfectly cooked, light and greaseless and balanced by the slight bitterness of arugula and lemon zest. Grilled shrimp, which are almost always cooked too long, were sweet and tender. Branzino, sea bass on a bed of braised radicchio, was moist and simply flavored with rosemary, lemon and salt and showed off to its best advantage on a slab of black slate. Pesto, perhaps the most famous export of Liguria, generally overpowers whatever it is meant to complement. Here just the right amount is used with taglierini, haricots verts and potatoes. The tagliatelle with braised lamb and tomatoes was also a treat but the star of the pasta department is the pansotti with walnut sauce, plump supersized tortellini filled with minced herbs and topped with a irresistible cream sauce of ground walnuts, cheese, milk and garlic. Fat green-lipped mussels from New Zealand in a peppery tomato broth fortunately come with thick slices of crusty bread, the best method for conveying the last drop of liquid from the bottom of the bowl to your mouth. But maybe the biggest surprise of the day was the moist whole roasted Cornish hen, a bird neither known for its flavor nor its tenderness but rather for its frequent appearance at large catered events. The chef, Iacopo Falai, formerly the pastry chef at Osterio del Circo, has brought his considerable dessert skills with him. The freshly fried orange pastry cream-stuffed fritelle, about the size of doughnut holes, come with a chocolate sauce, reputedly infused with basil. I didn't get a whiff of the basil but the fritelle didn't need chocolate sauce. Strawberries, sautéed and glazed, are served with vanilla gelato, wonderfully scented and flavored with the sweet Italian wine, moscato. The simple plate of cookies, including tiny muffins flavored with coffee and lemon, lemon cookies and excellent biscotti, was remarkable. The pumpkin crème brûlée is a mistake. Bread Tribeca has other faults that are curious because they are so inconsistent with most of the food. The mashed potatoes had no flavor, not even any salt. The huge plate of prosciutto was nice but it needed something more than a couple of Parmesan breadsticks, which didn't have much cheese flavor, to set it off. The gnocchi were singularly disappointing, not especially flavorful and a trifle doughy. There is a short, reasonable wine list, emphasizing Italian bottles and the usual cocktails that have nothing to do with the food. Although I am not necessarily a fan of communal tables -- there are also tables for four or more -- one night my party was seated at one and perhaps because it was not full, the other guests did not seem intrusive. We admired their shrimp before we got ours; they admired our desserts. I'm glad I was not facing the 50-inch television screen that runs constantly though without sound. I don't know what to say about the black sink in the bathroom, so trendy, so deep, so square, so filled with pebbles -- and large enough to bathe a toddler in.

PAST REVIEWS from The Times, with additional capsule reviews by Times critics: nytimes.com/dining Correction: January 15, 2004, Thursday  The Restaurants column in the Dining section yesterday, reviewing Bread Tribeca, at 301 Church Street in Manhattan, carried an erroneous star rating.

       "  'review': \"SOME restaurants take a while to find their footing. Others hit the ground running. 'Cesca belongs to the second group. Like Ouest, the other joint venture of Godfrey Polistina and Tom Valenti, his chef and partner, 'Cesca knew what it was and where it was the moment it opened its doors. Diners did, too. Never before have I been forced to accept so many 5:30 reservations. Ouest is French; 'Cesca is Italian. But the similarities are striking, right down to the circular booths upholstered in velvet. Both strike the same pitch-perfect tone, a little more stylish than a common neighborhood restaurant, but not formal enough that a jacket might be required. The cuisine fits the tone, and the décor, precisely. Mr. Valenti, a very assured chef, sets his sights on the high-middle range in this urban trattoria, emphasizing honest, uncomplicated food with strong, clearly defined flavors. Any number of dishes illustrate the approach, but small veal meatballs in broth, an appetizer, makes a good test case. It is a simple dish, but the moist, chewy meatballs are delicately seasoned, the meat broth is limpid, and the chard leaves floating in the broth with little specks of pastina retain their color and just a hint of crunch. The result is an enormously satisfying dish with nothing remarkable about it. The menu abounds in small victories like this. A scattering of celery leaves, for freshness and aroma, and first-rate capers from the island of Salina, near Sicily, make Mr. Valenti's vitello tonnato a revelation. Breaded sardines, roasted and served with a poached egg, are rich, meaty and almost defiantly simple. By comparison, roasted oysters, topped with a piquant tomato zabaglione and crispy pancetta, seem almost rococo, but wonderful. Potato gnocchi with a sauce of braised duck and garlic slices cooked crisp, like little potato chips, does not quite hit the mark. The gnocchi tend to be a little gummy, and the sauce includes a lot of dried bits of duck. It is a disappointment on an otherwise solid list of pastas and risottos with a decidedly rustic bent, like vialone nano rice with skate, tomato and cabbage, and outstanding raviolini stuffed with shrimp and served in a sneakily spicy tomato sauce with herbed bread crumbs. The big-hearted entrees can bring down a weak-kneed diner at 50 yards. Tripe with red wine and pancetta, a steaming heap of innards in a heady sauce, had me mopping my brow after the third bite. Tripe in the wrong hands can be a slippery, unchewable mess. Mr. Valenti, like a great coach, brings out every bit of its admittedly modest potential. Swordfish, although slightly overcooked, is a gratifyingly thick slab with a piercing, vinegary sweet-and-sour caponata that can also be ordered as a side dish. Grilled lamb chops, dark and gamy, are served as a kind of mixed grill, with dense, nearly black lamb sausages on the side, an intensely flavored cauliflower stew and mint. Pork shanks are no joke either, slow-cooked until they fall off the bone, and arranged with roasted calf's liver cut into plugs and wrapped with pancetta. A tart agrodolce sauce mercifully cuts into the richness of the dish. There is relief, too, in a terrific list of amari, or flavored bitters. For diners who have encountered only the fiercely astringent Fernet Branca, 'Cesca's amari offer a pleasant voyage of discovery, including fresh, myrtle-based Tremontis Mirto and the vaguely root-beer-tasting Cio Ciaro. 'Cesca's sommelier, Patrick Bickford, has an obsession with these underappreciated liqueurs. Indulge him. A three-bitters tasting, at $14, helps smooth the road toward dessert, a goal that might seem unrealistic midway through the tripe. Taken after the meal, they can do some valuable damage control. The attention-getting dessert is two layers of wafflelike chocolate pizzelle sandwiching a hefty frozen slice of pistachio gelato. It is ungainly and crude. It should take as its role model the chaste, impeccable ricotta and mascarpone cheesecake, white as marble and situated, ideally, midway between creamy and fluffy. Bits of bitter orange and fennel-orange brittle, like little exclamation points, emphasize the sourly sweet quality of the cheese. Buttermilk panna cotta with blood orange sauce is simple and straightforward, just the kind of dessert you want in a trattoria, but there's a more intriguing choice in the same vein, a smooth scoop of honey and goat cheese gelato, with anise cookies. It is easy to see why 'Cesca has found a following. Mr. Polistina, who named the restaurant after his daughter, Francesca, seems to have a knack for organizing a dining room so that patrons feel a pleasant sense of bustle and activity around them, while the tables themselves are islands of repose. Energy radiates from the antipasto station by the front-room bar and an open kitchen overlooking the main dining room, but diners at the well-spaced tables and wraparound booths eat in tranquillity. A semidetached wine room, with one long table, feels a little like a wayside shrine. Like everything else about 'Cesca, it is shrewdly conceived and perfectly placed, just one more ingenious touch in a restaurant that rarely puts a foot wrong.

       "  'review': \"FATE has dealt Azalea a couple of tough cards. The restaurant sits right next to a parking garage, so patrons on the west side of the dining room, if they peek out the window, can watch an endless parade of S.U.V.'s roll by as curtain time approaches on Broadway. The dining room itself is an awkward L shape, so narrow along the tall part of the letter that dinner is a nonstop game of bump-the-waiter if you sit with your back exposed to the traffic lane. Close quarters feel even closer because the room is overdecorated, with complicated blond-wood paneling and many, many Georgia O'Keeffe flower prints. That's a lot to overcome, but the kitchen does its best. The Italian cuisine is a not-especially-coherent mixture of dishes from the Amalfi Coast in the south and Brescia in the north, with diversions. This north-south alliance comes about because Giovanni Apicella, one of Azalea's two owners, is from Tramonti, on the Amalfi coast, and his chef, Umberto Bonometti, is from Brescia, in Lombardy. (The restaurant's name is pronounced ah-zuh-LAY-uh.) Sometimes local pride works out in the diner's favor, sometimes not. Guinea hen, plumped out with an aromatic herb stuffing, then baked with sage, butter and rosemary, comes straight from Mr. Bonometti's childhood kitchen, obviously a good place to start. From Amalfi comes the kind of dessert best described as interesting, thin layers of eggplant drenched in brandy and coated in dark, bitter chocolate. It could work. Eggplant, more a texture than a taste, does a brilliant job standing in for cake layers, but half the Cognac in the recipe would still be too much. Mr. Bonometti, to his credit, resists cliché. He feels free to invent and modernize along the way, and he has flair. A simple appetizer of sweet baby shrimp, arranged on a tangled heap of shaved fennel, sits in an oversize Parmesan shell with jagged edges that looks like an avant-garde settee. The shrimp are sweet and succulent, the fennel cool and crisp. A light dressing of lemon and excellent olive oil does the rest. His Gorgonzola and pear sformato, a dense, almost gooey soufflé, is an ingenious showcase for one of Italy's greatest flavor combinations. With the right dessert wine, it could be dessert and a cheese course rolled into one. Garlic-accented beef carpaccio with chestnuts sounds better than it is. The chestnuts have no flavor, which leaves the roasted garlic stranded. A better bet is dense, dark duck sausage, served in slices with a rustic accompaniment of barlotti beans in a tomato and onion sauce. The kitchen really hits its stride with pastas, which are convincing across the board. Wild boar braised in Barolo wine may be the richest, most deeply flavored meat sauce I've come across at an Italian restaurant. It's served with broad, flat pappardelle, and cherry tomatoes have been deployed strategically to give off intense bursts of fruity acidity. Stubby rigatoni stuffed with seasoned ground veal, topped with crushed roasted walnuts and covered with an oozy white-truffle cream are downright dangerous. Each sublime bite gives rise to uneasy thoughts about the entree to follow. Most appetites will stop dead in their tracks with this one. A somewhat lighter alternative, equally appealing, is ravioli stuffed with veal and red cabbage in a concentrated veal sauce, but even the fish pastas tend to be rich, especially the ravioli stuffed with lobster and buffalo ricotta in a Prosecco and lobster broth. The pastas can make the main courses seem anticlimactic, satisfying for the most part but not nearly as impassioned, or as complex. Jumbo shrimp sautéed with fresh herbs is what it says it is, and no more. A sizable tuna fillet, rolled in sesame seeds, is plain, served in a light tomato sauce with cannellini beans and fried onions. It was ordered medium-rare and came out on the far side of medium, but under no circumstances was it ever going to be an exciting dish. Pork fillet sautéed with apple purée sounds dull but isn't, thanks in part to tender, flavorful pork, and a nice-sized potato cake on the side. Baby lamb chops get the royal treatment. They're cooked in a potent reduction sauce of Amarone wine, then served with a heap of spinach sprinkled with pine nuts and raisins. The forbidding chocolate eggplant casts a giant shadow over the dessert list. It does have its own mystique, though, which puts it ahead of the baci di Modena, a chewy, astoundingly sweet cake made from crushed amaretto cookies with mascarpone cream. This is candy, not dessert. It takes a triple espresso to right the balance. The best desserts on the menu are a warm chocolate and banana cake, covered in caramel sauce, sweet without being cloying, and a chaste, beautifully realized fruit tart, nothing more than a few fresh berries in pastry cream on a crisp, buttery crust. The waiters are a colorful bunch. They seem to be working from a playbook not yet available in English-speaking countries, in which diners are regarded as hopeful applicants rather than customers with the power of the dollar behind them. One evening, luck of the draw delivered a waiter who all but snapped his fingers impatiently when the table did not order fast enough, and took it as a personal affront when I looked at the label on the wine bottle, as though I were accusing him of a double-cross. Needless to say, his favorite dessert was the eggplant. Azalea * [rating: one star] 224 West 51st Street; (212) 262-0105.

       "  'review': \"INDIA is a big country, but Amma manages to cover most of it. Its menu is a whirlwind tour that extends geographically from the northwestern frontier to Goa, and stylistically from refined Mogul cooking to lunchbox fare and street snacks. Suvir Saran, one of Amma's owners as well as one of its two chefs, is the travel agent for this culinary adventure, and he has a not-so-secret educational agenda. For years he has taught a popular course on Indian cooking at New York University. Amma is his opportunity to reach a different kind of audience, in a different way, and he has jumped for it. His able assistant is Hemant Mathur, who caught the attention of New York diners when he worked the tandoori at Tamarind before moving along to Diwan. At Amma, Mr. Mathur continues to tend the tandoor, which is the source of some of Amma's most seductive entrees, like juicy, basil-scented chicken with tomato chutney and lemon rice, and grilled lamb chops served with a sweet and sour pear chutney and potatoes spiced with curry leaf. But Amma gives him much more freedom to roam. Amma does away with the redundant curries, vindaloos and pilafs that crowd the menus of so many Indian restaurants, replacing them with a wide variety of homey dishes, like idli upma, or steamed cakes made from rice flour and urad dhal, a relative of the mung bean. Idli, a Southern Indian specialty, have a slightly chewy texture and a bland flavor that makes them ideal for spicing. At Amma, they are sprinkled with mustard seeds, topped with a few sautéed curry leaves and served with a dollop of creamy coconut chutney on one side and hot tomato chutney on the other. Bombay bhel puri, another humble appetizer, also shows off the kitchen's clean, precise way with spices and aggressive flavors. The dish is a gaudily colored, interwoven stack of crispy rice puffs and chickpea flour noodles, arranged for maximum crunch, with a tart, aromatic onslaught from tamarind and cilantro chutneys. Potatoes, tomatoes and red onion bring it back down to earth. Amma makes a point of doing honor to India's rich vegetarian cuisine. Tasting menus come in both vegetarian and nonvegetarian formats, and the meatless dishes on the à la carte menu are among the best. Americans with a taste for fried okra can rediscover it in a very different guise, dusted with chickpea flour and fried to a crisp, then served in a complex dressing of lemon juice and sour spices, like ground mango peel and dried, powdered pomegranate seeds. Amma must surely be the only restaurant in New York serving Gobi lahsuni, a potent, richly flavored Manchurian-style dish. Cauliflower florets are marinated in garlic and lemon juice, then tossed in a garlicky tomato sauce seasoned with scallions and chilies. Kararee bhindi are feather-light vegetarian meatballs made from Indian summer squash. Served in a creamless tomato sauce, they have a delicate flavor that makes them an ideal complement to the spicier, more robust meat dishes, like lamb fillets stuffed with apricots and served with a sweet and sour pear chutney. The fillets are a little tough, but with a strong lamb flavor that marries perfectly with the pungent chutney and potatoes flavored with curry leaf. Southern India, with its vast repertory of spices, also adds punch to the menu. Goan shrimp, sautéed in butter, are folded into the vibrant, smoky tomato sauce called balchao, spiced with fried red chilies. It is a faithfully rendered classic. More intriguing is Malabar salmon, a hefty slab of fish marinated in balchao and steamed in a banana leaf before being finished in the tandoor. Once unwrapped, the fish gives off a tantalizing aroma of vinegar and chilies, which permeate the salmon, right down to the juices. Curry-leaf potatoes and crispy okra fill out the plate. Side dishes, when not treated as an afterthought, always fill more than a minor role in Indian cooking. Mr. Mathur devotes a great deal of attention to his condiments and breads, which include the standard parathas and nans, but also a sweetly chewy kulcha stuffed with crab meat and a paratha stuffed with spinach, peas and fenugreek. His raita, a garlic-infused yogurt condiment, comes with a sprinkling of crunchy fried okra on top. As an alternative to the usual Basmati rice, Amma has three Southern Indian rices, flavored with tomato, mint and lemon, that come to the table arranged like red, green and yellow Hostess cupcakes. A word of caution about the lassis. These mildly sour, extraordinarily refreshing yogurt drinks can become a meal in themselves. Once you start, it's hard to stop. And a couple of mango lassis can do real damage. The worst effect is to dull the appetite for Amma's satiny mango cheesecake, a light, almost mousselike creation that leads a short list of desserts that seem suspiciously modern, especially the tasting of three creams, a three-act production consisting of banana flan, chai pot de crème and rose panna cotta. It's a bit sneaky. The flavors are traditional, as familiar to Indians as peanut butter and chocolate are to Americans. It's the setting that makes them seem new. The same goes for Amma. By taking the back roads, and steering clear of the tired tourist sites, it shows diners a different India, so old that it seems fresh.

       "  'review': \"PLÁCIDO DOMINGO likes to eat. He just can't decide what he wants to order. Domingo, his pet project in Manhattan, opened in 1996 as a Spanish restaurant of no particular distinction. When that failed, he abandoned Spain and hired the cookbook author Patricia Quintana to devise a Mexican menu. When that did not please, he turned to Richard Sandoval, the chef and owner of Maya, to work some magic on a restaurant that seemed to have only one thing going for it, Mr. Domingo's name. Mr. Sandoval rose to the challenge. Wiping the slate clean, he created a Mexican seafood menu, fresh and contemporary, that brings spice, color and excitement to a formerly listless dining room that has been redecorated in a startling white-on-white beach style. White plaster shells hug the walls, and a cool canvas shade covers the ceiling, with paddle fans sending a permanent breeze across the tables. A school of abstract metal fish, rendered in bright Miró colors, hover over the outdoor terrace, like an aquarium suspended in space. You can almost hear the waves breaking over 49th Street. Against this clean backdrop, Mr. Sandoval and his chef de cuisine, Josefina Santacruz, deliver inventive, sharply executed seafood dishes that keep the taste buds busy. Bright squiggles, specks and blobs put a lot of drama on the plate, and the cast of characters tends to be extensive. Every dish seems to have at least eight or nine ingredients. Somehow all the actors find their places, and the chilies, in particular, perform brilliantly. Mr. Sandoval uses all of them, from anchos, anaheims and chipotles to the fiery habaneros and jalapeños. They italicize flavors, infiltrate them, sway them this way and that, without ever making the primary impression. A smoky chipotle and lobster sauce, for example, brings out the sweetness of sautéed shrimp in a rich, mouth-filling tamale stuffed with steamed cornmeal, mushrooms and zucchini blossoms. Chiles de árbol apply mild heat to an understated salsa that blends effortlessly with black-bean purée and buttery slices of avocado in what may be Pampano's signature dish, an appetizer of three miniature lobster tacos on soft tortillas. Big anaheim chilies, mild and slightly sweet, make the ideal wrapper for sharp goat cheese and a welcome accompaniment to huge grilled shrimp in a spicy bell pepper and tomato sauce. Fruity ancho chilies, with their overtones of licorice, make a complex, beguiling glaze for baby octopus, served with roasted corn and crunchy chayote dice. The menu could probably be pared down. It can be exhausting to navigate, and one place to start might be the very average guacamole, one of two dips pressed on customers the moment they sit down. The other one is the winner, a swordfish hash flavored with bits of tomato, onion and cilantro. The fish is beautifully smoked. It's a toss-up whether to spread it on thick tortilla chips or to leave it in the center of the table and simply inhale the aroma. It makes the guacamole seem a little pointless, really. Raw bar appetizers like cherrystone clams with a spicy vinaigrette deflect attention, unwisely, from ceviches like shrimp in a spicy chipotle sauce with avocado and jicama, or a well-balanced ceviche of tuna with tart tomatillos, poblano chilies and mango. Mr. Sandoval brings the same virtues to his ceviches that he does to the rest of the menu, a clear sense of how competing flavors and textures can be orchestrated to create exciting results. A tomato and cactus salad, stuffed right in the center of a pan-fried snapper like the filling in a sandwich, deploys sherry vinegar and roasted garlic expertly to enhance the qualities of the fish. Strips of toasted tortilla add welcome crunch to a smooth black-bean soup with slices of spicy seafood sausage. Crema fresca and small bits of buttery avocado bring down the heat. The menu does include a few meat dishes, notably a flavorful if messy rib-eye steak heaped with yellow-tomato salsa, guacamole and a long list of adornments that somehow manages to include cracklings. It contrasts sharply with the simple but arresting lamb marinated in a guajillo pepper purée and braised in a banana-leaf wrapper. Plain roasted vegetables complete the package. The dessert list is short. Natilla de cajeta, a sort of Mexican crème brûlée topped with a lid of tough caramelized bananas, is dense, grainy and, to my taste, painfully sweet. The antidote can be found in pastel de elote, slices of warm, pudding-like corn cake served with rich coconut ice cream and hibiscus sauce. Next to the formidable natilla, even the chocolate tacos seem austere. They're Mexican cannoli, delicate vanilla tuiles filled with light hazelnut-chocolate mousse, with a tart fruit salsa as a shrewd complement. Pampano cannot resist the urge to push a lot of very expensive tequilas on the after-dinner menu, including a presumptuous Herradura Selección Suprema priced at $64 a glass, and there are some baroque coffees, the strangest one, by a long chalk, being the Cappuccino Maya, a lethal sugar assault that combines Kahlúa, Bailey's Irish Cream and whipped cream to devastating effect. On the plus side, Pampano offers a nice selection of Spanish brandies like Cardenal Mendoza and Gran Duque de Alba, a treat for those who venture beyond Cognac and Armagnac. Mr. Sandoval and his singing partner, Mr. Domingo, have pulled off a rare feat. When restaurants begin revising their formulas and rewriting their menus, the end is usually near. Pampano, against the odds, has finally found a way to get started. Pampano ** [rating: two stars] 209 East 49th Street; (212) 751-4545.

       "  'review': \"FIRST Marseille, now Nice. Can Antibes, Montpellier and Perpignan be far behind? Two years ago, Simon Oren tapped into a rich vein of fantasy when he opened Marseille in the theater district. Pink wine, black olives and an exotic touch of North Africa made for a very appealing package tour. Not surprisingly, Mr. Oren, who also owns L'Express and Sushi Samba, began extending the itinerary. Nice Matin, named after the largest daily newspaper in the South of France, gives the Upper West Side a splash of Provençal sunshine and a heady introduction to the cuisine of Nice, home of the pissaladière, pan bagnat and, if we are to believe the menu, a whopping big burger topped with comté cheese, smeared with aioli and served with a heap of rosemary-flecked fries. It's the best thing to happen to a hamburger since Daniel Boulud worked foie gras and short ribs into an all-beef patty. Andy D'Amico, formerly at Sign of the Dove and Little Dove, interprets Nice with respect. He showcases simple classics like grilled leg of lamb rubbed with rosemary, refusing to fuss. He anchors his menu in the potent flavors, bright colors and fragrant herbs that define Niçoise cooking, adjusting here and innovating there, always in a way that feels true to the local idiom. That hamburger is his invention, but aioli and rosemary keep it in the same family as his shrewdly simplified one-fish bouillabaisse, with fennel purée and a creamy, hard-hitting rouille. As at Marseille, the menu starts with a long list of small, bite-size appetizers priced at $4 and $5, or less than half the price of the average full-fledged appetizer. These are no-nonsense starters, ideal with a glass of rosé, like tender poached mussels dipped in rouille, or grilled sardines split in half and topped with bread crumbs, garlic and parsley. Less thyme would help the pissaladière, Nice's famous thin-crust pizza, topped with slow-cooked onions, anchovies and olives, but his trouchia, a Swiss chard and onion frittata flavored with Parmesan cheese, is a glorious thing. The chard, fresh and crunchy, dominates rather than being lost in the eggs and Parmesan. Fennel-cured mackerel, one of the full-priced appetizers, is pleasingly oily and chewy, a robust alternative to the often anemic tuna tartares all over the city. Fennel adds a fresh note, and the combination of bitter grapefruit segments and cracked white pepper cut the oil. Soupe à pistou, the Provençal minestrone, validates Mr. D'Amico's passport. It can be a horrible slush of overcooked vegetables with a vague hint of basil and garlic. At Nice Matin, the zucchini dice and fat fava beans retain their integrity, and the pistou enunciates clearly. This is the soupe à pistou for diners who had given up. Pan bagnat, I have to say, seems odd. The dish, Provençal for ''bathed bread,'' is a salade Niçoise stuffed between two halves of a roll and drenched in olive oil. The secret lies in weighing the sandwich down with a heavy plate for an hour or so until the oil soaks the bread. Nice Matin skips that part of the equation. The result is a tasty but not very distinctive salad sandwich. Bitter orange, one of the great Niçoise flavors, shows up in an impressive daube of beef short ribs, a glistening, black monolith of meat whose richness is nicely offset by orange and sage. A sharp note of orange also corrects the fattiness in ravioli stuffed with braised lamb. Mr. D'Amico also sneaks in a few Moroccan influences, notably in a spice-rubbed salmon with bulgur salad and harissa, but also in a crisp pastry tube stuffed with potatoes, onion and lamb. Do not attempt conversation. The brutal acoustics at Nice Matin preclude it. Diners can either scream at one another or study the décor, which flummoxed everyone I took to the restaurant. Victorian flocked wallpaper runs right up against a retro 70's pattern that looks like an unfurled spotted ribbon. Oversize black-leather booths clash with handsome dividers in polished blond wood. The huge light fixtures that dominate the room resemble white plastic carousels with bare, dangling bulbs. Was there a distress sale at a catering hall? The pleasure is all on the plate, and it carries right through to the desserts. I'm not sure about the so-called madeleine, surrounded by chopped strawberries in syrup. It looks an awful lot like a doughnut, and a lot like a country bumpkin side by side with the elegant chocolate ganache, a lighter-than-air mousse wrapped in a thin cylinder of dark chocolate and layered with passion fruit sauce. It's a Sacher torte with a French makeover. The little lemon tart is like a burst of sunshine, with a good, buttery crust and an intense lemon filling. The real lemon tour de force, though, is a milk chocolate pot de crème, topped with a lid of toasted meringue and enlivened with a subtle citric charge. One of the simplest desserts of all, a scoop of lavender-honey ice cream, is a lovely tribute to Provence. I can't think of a better way to end the meal, unless it's to order a muscat, the opulent fortified wine from Beaumes-de-Venise that seems to squeeze a bushel of apricots and melons into each glass. The French drink it before the meal. They're wrong. At Nice Matin, it's a way of snatching a last, honeyed drop of pleasure from a cuisine that exists only to please.

       "  'review': \"SWINGING BEEF sounded like just the thing, ''a brace of pan-tanned bullberrie crisps with a chipotle salsa,'' as the menu has it. The waitress gave me a stricken look. ''Um, do you know what that is?'' she asked. No, I said, but ''pan tanned'' sounded enticing. ''They're bull testicles,'' she said. ''And actually, they're going off the menu this week.'' Not a huge demand, apparently. But give Agave an A for effort. The cuisine at Agave is billed as New Southwestern, and it comes in handsome surroundings. The walls are smooth, cool adobe, lighted dimly by flickering white candles massed in fireplace-like niches. The ceiling is lined with rough-hewn spruce-fir branches arranged in a hatch-mark pattern, and tribal artifacts, distributed sparingly on the walls, add a tasteful commentary on the food. The prevailing mood of calm and restraint ends with the menu, a dizzy document with more thrills and spills than a condemned roller coaster. In the hands of Bill Lawlor, who designed the restaurant and devised the menu, and his chef de cuisine, Richard Pang, who is from Malaysia, New Southwestern becomes an impetuous, slightly mad adventure, a blur of spices, colors and textures that reminded me of those spinning plate paintings that used to be popular at fairs. You squeezed a few blobs of bright colors on a disk, flipped the switch and let 'er spin. Mr. Pang seems to be willing to try just about anything, up to and including pan-tanned bullberries, and more often than not, things work out in his favor. In other words, there is a lot more method than madness at Agave. The basket of blue corn tortilla chips that arrives as soon as you sit down provides badly needed reassurance. They are warm, feather-light, superlatively crunchy and sweet with blue-corn flavor. They come with a pleasant, mildly spiced bean dip and an unconvincing salsa, but they go best on their own. A second positive sign is Mr. Pang's ''roadhouse chili,'' a stewlike interpretation of the Tex-Mex classic, packed with butter-soft chunks of beer-braised beef and pork in a spicy sauce with intense tomato flavor. Mr. Pang understands spices. He doesn't use them to traumatize the tonsils or boost the beer sales. He treats them as valued supporting players, never allowing them to upstage the stars. Chilies, paprika and cumin, for example, bring out the sweetness of blue corn in a thick posole stew, while smoky, low-heat chipotles -- the animating principle in a creamy dipping sauce -- allow the mild flavor of squid to come through a layer of crisp breading. At the same time, who are we kidding? The cuisine at Agave, by design, has a large trash element to it. One of the best things on the menu is a sloppy bowl of three melted cheeses -- Monterey Jack, queso blanco and white cheddar -- poured over pieces of spicy chorizo. You can call it fondue, but to me it is tailgate cuisine. Of the highest order. Throwing strips of sugary jerked beef into the posole stew, a bad idea, fits right in with diner concepts like Southwestern shepherd's pie, a heaping helping of chili topped with macaroni and Jack cheese, or the go-for-broke short ribs, a mountain of rich, tender beef braised in mole colorado and fighting for space on the plate with barbecued onions and jalapeño gnocchi. There comes a time when the wisest course of action is to pile on, and Mr. Pang understands this. He knows how to deploy gobs of molten cheese. The flops at Agave are unmistakable. Jalapeño gnocchi, tremendously appealing on paper, have a gummy texture and scant evidence of jalapeño, a pepper that needs to be unleashed. Using jalapeño subtly is like casting Steven Seagal in ''Pride and Prejudice.'' Agave's guacamole is similarly noncommittal and oddly spiced, with an intrusive note of cumin. Most of the salsas seem tired, as does the ceviche of red snapper. Rather than the bull testicles, I would vote for dropping the daurade fillet cooked in a banana leaf with corn masa and mole sauce. It has the solidity of a brick. A close cousin on the menu, red snapper fillet cooked in rice paper, fares much better. The fish comes out moist and flaky, after an aromatic steam bath in cilantro and herba buena. Bits of chili-heated mango set the fish off nicely. Desserts fall short, although the mango napoleon does make a strong visual impression. It's a big, round ball of vanilla gelato poised between two oversize nests of phyllo pastry that look like Elizabethan collars. Search hard and you may find some tiny strips of caramelized mango in there somewhere. Pot au crème of Mexican chocolate is bland, and for some reason, the delicious-sounding fried plantain split, stuffed with dulce de leche, was always off the menu. A modest Key lime meringue tart turns out to be the winner of the bunch, with a buttery, flaky crust and pure lime flavor. The service at Agave is just a notch above the ''hi, guys'' level. The servers are young and sweet-natured and happy to oblige, but dishes do not always arrive. It can take forever for someone to pick up the check and another eternity for it to be processed. Perhaps it seems longer because the restaurant's Mission chairs, although beautiful to look at, are cruel, although not as diabolical as the backless banquettes, which will either straighten your spine or kill you in the course of an evening. Only a couple of ruby-red cactus-pear margaritas can dull the pain.

       "  'review': \"IT takes salesmanship and flair to sell the idea of lard on a pizza. But these are precisely the qualities that define Otto, an inspired collaboration of four partners, Mario Batali, Joseph Bastianich, Mark Ladner and Jason Denton. The first two are well known to New York diners as the creators of Esca, Babbo and Lupa. At Otto, their largest restaurant to date, they took on two extra hands, Mr. Ladner, Lupa's chef, and Mr. Denton, a partner in Lupa. The new venture has its front door on Eighth Street, hence Otto, Italian for ''eight.'' That's OH-toe, please, not Ah-toe. The restaurant is advertised as an enoteca and pizzeria, which is more and less than the truth. There is a serious all-Italian list, which includes a mouth-filling, very fruity white wine from Mr. Bastianich's vineyard in Friuli. There are also a lot of pizzas, some traditional, others unique to Otto, and all cooked on top of the griddle rather than in an oven. But Otto may be the only pizzeria in New York where it's possible to skip the pizza entirely. The menu is devised, ingeniously, to stave off boredom, with separate categories devoted to antipasti, bruschettas, pizzas, fried appetizers, cheeses and desserts. To add interest, one item in most categories changes daily, so there's a new bruschetta, fried appetizer, traditional pizza and new-wave pizza each day. Initially, it's a little bewildering, but the well-trained waiters start each meal by explaining the Otto system. My advice is not to overcommit to the pizza. Some are terrific, notably the pizza topped with lardo, or cured salt pork. Like the pizza bianca, which is flat bread brushed with oil and sprinkled with sea salt, the lardo harks back to what might be called the pre-Columbian or Roman pizza, which did not have any tomato. The lardo version is simply covered with paper-thin strips of glistening, translucent, heavenly pork fat (which has less cholesterol than butter and fewer calories than olive oil) and scattered with bits of pungent rosemary. The crust, which was chewy bordering on tough in the early days, improved greatly with time, becoming lighter and flakier. Otto has average pizzas, good pizzas, excellent pizzas and odd pizzas, like the one topped with ricotta, sliced potato and marinated anchovies. Not everyone will appreciate getting clams in the shell on the vongole pizza, but the combination of clams, chili and garlic makes for a zesty pie. The classic margherita, the famous tricolor combination of tomato sauce, buffalo mozzarella and basil leaves, makes a feeble impression. It's dull. It cannot compare to the Thursday special pizza, topped with tomato sauce, roasted golden tomatoes, two cheeses and nuggets of cured pork jowl, or the frizzy-looking pizza topped with tomato, raw fennel and shaved bottarga, or pressed mullet roe. After many meals at Otto, however, I found true happiness by grazing the margins of the menu. The appetizers, many served in mustard-colored ceramic ramekins, can make a full meal. Cauliflower florets tossed in garlic, lemon and bits of olive have the winning simplicity that defines Italian food at its best, as does a generous serving of eggplant caponata, its almost dangerous sweetness cut by slivers of sharp, pungent calamata olives. Mushrooms, on the other hand, are so fiercely marinated that they become slippery bits adrift in an acidic sea. The fritto category is rewarding. Small triangles of fried chickpea, served with a squeeze of lemon, are delicately breaded and sweetly creamy inside. Whitebait, fried to the crackling point, are tossed with fried sage and marjoram. They are perfection. The fish list offers a half dozen choices, but I kept returning to the marinated anchovies, served with sliced scallions and rough croutons soaked in good olive oil. The lardo can be ordered on its own. Like the rest of the meats, except for the prosciutto di Parma, it's made on the premises. Otto's menu categories take on a life and a personality of their own. Rather than abstractions, they become friendly territory to explore. There's something about the presentation, and the pleasing logic of the thing, that makes you want to work methodically through each and every dish in each category. Admirably, this clean, elegant concept carries right through to the dessert stage, when diners face two choices, cheese or gelato. Otto puts a spin on its small cheese list by pairing each cheese with fruit, in an unusual form, like the little sour cherries in syrup that accompany a slab of soft gorgonzola dolce, or the sweetly vinegary saba, or grape must, that makes a dipping pool for large chunks of Parmesan cheese. The dessert plan is simple. It's gelato, served in a steel coupe and eaten with a spade-shaped spoon. The quality is very high, so unadorned flavors like hazelnut, chocolate or caramel can shimmer in their own light. Like the pizzas, though, the gelati come plain and fancy, and a couple of the fancier ones are stunners, like an appealingly sour ricotta gelato with crunchy glazed walnuts and dried figs reconstituted in red wine and sugar syrup, and the brilliantly improbable olive-oil gelato sprinkled with grains of sea salt. Otto is a pleasure in almost every way. Mr. Batali and his partners somehow know exactly when an idea becomes a gimmick, and they stop just short of the line. Vintage Italian deli slicers and scales, in Ferrari red, add a bright touch to the front room, with its wine bar and stand-up tables with marble countertops. Even the check-in procedure has a bit of drama to it. Diners announce themselves, and if there's no table, they are issued a train ticket with a destination on it. The idea is to have a glass of wine at one of the marble tables and check a large blackboard. When Firenze or Lucca or Napoli shows up on the board, the table's ready. It's a little silly, but ingenious and irresistible. Just like Otto.

       "  'review': \"THE perennial appeal of the little Italian restaurant may not reside among life's deepest mysteries, but many adventurous eaters regard the thought of a meal at yet another trattoria with the yawns ordinarily reserved for a night of Chinese takeout and reruns of ''Cheers.'' For such naysayers, I recommend a helping of meatballs from Il Gattopardo, a tiny, understated Neapolitan restaurant that opened last year on West 54th Street across from the permanent home of the Museum of Modern Art. Il Gattopardo's meatballs are not precisely balls. They are, more accurately, patties of beef and veal flavored with white wine and thyme and served tightly wrapped in silky cabbage leaves, which not only keep the meat wonderfully juicy but add their own sweet fragrance. It is a simple dish, rustic even. Yet its uncomplicated elegance stirs the soul in a way that any number of drizzled, bedded, foie-gras-bedecked creations cannot. Similarly, though meatloaf may not merit much respect among card-carrying epicures, Il Gattopardo's loosely knit, terrifically savory meatloaf (really a larger-scale meatball) achieves a height of peasant refinement, blending not only ground veal, beef and pork, but salami, prosciutto, eggs, pine nuts and pecorino cheese. Suffice it to say there is nothing the least bit fussy about Il Gattopardo (The Leopard), where an emphasis on simplicity often translates into high satisfaction. Almost nothing detracts from the food in the slender, almost spartan dining room. Creamy white walls are adorned with only a narrow, smoky mirror, and white-jacketed waiters set the tone immediately, bringing bountiful baskets of bread and crisp, peppery breadsticks along with the small, straightforward menu. It's a sceneless departure for the owner, Gianfranco Sorrentino, who was a partner in Sette Moma and a longtime manager at Bice. But he and the chef, Vito Gnazzo, who both hail from Campania, seem freed to delight in their home cooking. One of the restaurant's plainest dishes, a special of cold zucchini soup, is also one of the most luxurious. It's no more than puréed zucchini flavored with mint, perhaps a bit of cream. But it is sumptuous and opulent, perfectly seasonal and so good you want to dredge up every last drop with a piece of bread. Among the appetizers, braised escarole, stuffed with olives, anchovies and pine nuts, has a sweet and salty appeal that is quintessentially Neapolitan. And I loved a mélange of tender baby artichokes with Parmesan and smoked mozzarella. Fried cakes of buffalo milk ricotta and eggplant are crisp and satisfying, served with a spicy tomato sauce. Strips of smoked veal enliven a salad of baby greens and asparagus tips. While the appetizer selection includes many of the menu's highlights, the pastas succeed as well. Genovese sauce, paradoxically another Neapolitan specialty, is unknown in Genoa or anywhere else in Italy, unless a Neapolitan chef has introduced it, as Arthur Schwartz points out in his book ''Naples at Table'' (HarperCollins, 1998). Il Gattopardo's is superb, a rich ragù of pork and onions cooked for hours down to their sweet essences without even a hint of tomato, served with fat tubes of paccheri pasta, which have just the right amount of give to them. For tomato, the spaghetti alla chitarra is supremely lively and delicious, with only a few herbs tossed in. Circular ravioli, stuffed with veal, ricotta and thyme, goes well with a mildly spicy tomato sauce, but tagliatelle with roasted peppers and sun-dried tomatoes is a perfect illustration of why the craze for sun-dried tomatoes died years ago: when used injudiciously, an uncharacteristic flaw at Il Gattopardo, they overpower all flavors in their path. With the exception of the meatloaf and the roasted lamb chops flavored with herbs, the main courses are several notches less enticing. Sautéed veal loin is rare and tender, yet without flavor; simplicity here is a drawback. Same with lightly breaded swordfish, which does not have much to recommend it outside of its side dish of garlicky broccoli rabe. Fat sea scallops are tasty enough, served in a sauce of garlic cooked slowly until it turns sweet. But fish and shellfish stew cannot overcome a lackluster broth, which does not inspire the sopping up with bread, by which such dishes are judged. Service is sweet and almost shy, with the exception of a host, Valentino Culla, who delights in reminding you of the dishes and wines you had on your last visit. Incidentally, Mr. Culla is passionate about the wine list, which is well chosen and offers some gems, like Il Bacialé, an unusual blend of barbera and pinot noir from Giacomo Bologna. If the mood strikes, at dessert he may favor a table with a glass of floral moscato d'Asti, which is like a fragrant meadow in a glass. Moscato d'Asti is the perfect dessert, although the granular ricotta cheese cake known as pastiera comes close, as does an excellent lemon tart topped with meringue. As with the best home cooking, Il Gattopardo does not challenge so much as embrace. In a city where likability is often taken for weakness, Il Gattopardo wears its with honor.

       "  'review': \"SUCCESS, it is sometimes said, is knowing what to imitate. If so, the MarkJoseph Steakhouse has had things right from the beginning. As its model, it took Peter Luger, the Brooklyn institution, which, though I haven't fully completed my research, may well serve the best steaks in the world. MarkJoseph opened only a year and a half ago, which puts it about a century behind. Still, with an owner, Charlie Blair, who used to be a general manager at Luger, it is betting on the burly appeal of the 19th-century steakhouse rather than offering a more refined 21st-century vision. The backward orientation is fitting. Situated in the South Street Seaport Historic District, MarkJoseph, named for a son of one of the owners, takes its place among cobblestone streets and 18th- and 19th-century structures. It's almost a surprise to happen upon the restaurant in those otherwise quiet walkways, practically under the Brooklyn Bridge, where the smell of the Fulton Fish Market lingers in the air. With a low ceiling and stout supporting pillars, the dining room feels small, and when the room fills up, it can barely contain the hearty roar of the off-duty traders, bankers and businesspeople who make up the bulk of the weeknight crowd. Without Luger's airy beer hall spaciousness to dissipate the noise, MarkJoseph must fall back on civilizing touches, like tablecloths, to absorb the sound. The dining room, I'm happy to say, has not adopted sepia photos, brass rails and other Olde New York imagery, but a sky-blue ceiling with painted clouds? It's like a vase of flowers in the middle of a rodeo. Like Peter Luger, MarkJoseph is a porterhouse specialist, offering huge steaks that serve two, three or four people each. You can hear the steaks sizzling and popping from across the room as a troop of white-aproned waiters ferries over an order, ceremoniously propping up one end of the oblong dish on your table -- just as at Luger -- so the juices run to the other, where they pool at the rim. The steak is presliced, and the waiters quickly distribute the meat, spooning the juices over the slices. Here is where the resemblance to Luger ends, for while the porterhouse is remarkably tender, with a well-charred, salty crust, it cannot match the firm, chewy texture of the Luger porterhouse or its funky mineral-laden flavor. It has a soft blandness that may thrill those who like their beef buttery but will leave lovers of dry-aged steaks unsatisfied. Fortunately, unlike Luger, MarkJoseph goes beyond the porterhouse. Its rib steak, served unsliced on the bone, has an excellent, subtle dry-aged flavor that makes it almost impossible not to pick up the bone to gnaw off the last few bits. Sirloin steak, already sliced, is likewise densely flavored and pleasingly chewy, while the filet mignon, like all good filets, will almost melt in the mouth, though its flavor comes more from the crisp crust than aging. One worthy alternative to steak is an order of the meaty double lamb chops, massive yet almost delicately tender and mild, served with a disarmingly small vessel of mint sauce. Yes, the menu offers seafood, but these selections are simply meant to pacify the nonsteak-eaters among us who must have their place at the table. The tuna, salmon and catfish are a nondescript bunch, and while the lobster tails are tasty enough, why lobster tails? If you're going to have lobster, you may as well have the whole bib-wearing, shell-cracking, butter-dripping-down-the-side-of-the-mouth experience. Well-textured mashed potatoes and crisp hash browns ace out the rather ordinary fries, while creamed spinach has its moments -- rich and flavorful one meal, overly slippery the next. Taking another page from the master, MarkJoseph offers as an appetizer a thick, sizzling slice of smoked bacon, which actually outdoes Luger's for its full-throttle hammy flavor. An order of bacon and a plate of the impeccable clams or oysters makes a perfect warm-up for the carnivorous pleasures to come. But don't bother with the mealy, granular shrimp cocktail or the less-than-crisp calamari. And if you simply must stay in the Luger mode, a pitcher of cloyingly sweet steakhouse sauce is on every table to adorn your tomato-and-onion salad. The waiters -- even the waitresses -- adhere to the tradition of gruff, affable service, complete with an inexhaustible supply of rimshot lines: ''Let me tell you about our specialty, chicken.'' Sometimes the past and present collide unexpectedly. MarkJoseph's waiters are a diverse lot -- nothing unusual there -- yet it's hard not to smile when a Mexican waiter, reciting the list of desserts in full accent, remarks that they all come ''mit schlag.'' Excellent schlag it is. Thick, rich and creamy, it's a fine accompaniment to a tart, supple Key lime pie, though it's hard to conceive of plowing through the entire mound after a full meal. Other desserts are predictably hefty, like a MarkJoseph special tart, which seems formed of equal parts cheesecake, chocolate mousse and truffles, and an enormous wedge of three-berry pie. MarkJoseph knows what it emulates. It is a likable addition to the steakhouse lineup, doing justice to its historic neighborhood with its respect for New York traditions. But its own personality is not yet fully formed. One goes to Luger for porterhouse, to Sparks for strip steaks and a great wine list in a quieter environment, to Smith & Wollensky for masculine rowdiness. MarkJoseph knows its role model, but it doesn't yet know its role. MarkJoseph Steakhouse * [rating: one star] 261 Water Street (Peck Slip), Manhattan; (212) 277-0020.

       "  'review': \"ON an unlovely commercial strip of East 57th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, Teodora stands out like a non sequitur. A restaurant this sweet and hospitable ought to throw open its door on a neighborly street with families on stoops, or at least on a piazza in Ravenna, since its specialties hail from Emilia-Romagna. The region is home to some well-known foods. It can claim perhaps the greatest cheese in the world, Parmigiano-Reggiano, from Reggio, and a remarkable collection of cured meats and sausages like prosciutto from Parma and mortadella from Bologna. It produces wondrously pure butter and exceptional durum wheat for pastas. Aged balsamic vinegar, potent enough to perfume a house and fine enough to sip, comes from the city of Modena. Yet when you put the ingredients together and try to conjure up the cuisine of the region, little comes to mind except maybe the famous Bolognese sauce, which, strange as it may seem, many people associate with Tuscany. Perhaps this is because dishes that for years have been passed off as ''Northern Italian,'' like tortellini and other stuffed pastas, are in fact from Emilia-Romagna. Teodora has been open for more than five years, quietly charming its diners without calling much attention to itself. With its beige walls, slightly dulled by the residue of nights of dining, and its worn terrazzo and wood floors that slope this way and that, Teodora feels as if it's been around forever. Roberta Ruggini, who owns the restaurant with Giancarlo Quadalti, its chef, has adorned almost every available surface with her collection of homey knickknacks. Carved wooden trays and scads of dishes lean against walls, rolling pins balance on Victorian sconces and big pots of flowers are wrapped in beribboned receiving blankets. Ms. Ruggini embraces customers as if they were guests in her home, making them feel like indispensable members of the restaurant's family. Mr. Quadalti's food, though occasionally rustic, is by no means simple. Lasagna, cooked ever so slowly until the béchamel and Bolognese sauces meld into a creamy whole, is a model of painstaking preparation, hearty and rich, yet far more elegant and concise than most lasagnas. His piadina, the traditional unleavened griddle bread that has nourished Romagnans for centuries, has a texture that is both firm and chewy, and a nutlike flavor that is superb, whether heaped with paper-thin slices of prosciutto, salami and sausage, or buttery stracchino cheese, a specialty of Lombardy to the north. Chicken livers, glazed in balsamic vinegar, are sweet and earthy with soft roasted onions, while Parmesan sformato, a kind of airy pudding, is surrounded by a field of chopped porcini mushrooms imbued with garlic, which perfectly complement the sformato's cheesy tang. Mr. Quadalti maintains a sense of delicacy even when straying beyond the regional borders. Delicate fried artichoke leaves, strewn with piquant fried parsley, are so tender they almost dissolve in the mouth. Slender fried zucchini blossoms, a special one night, were equally sheer and light, served with a handful of little shrimp cooked with garlic tossed over the top. A big bowl of clams and mussels, so tender they barely require chewing, are excellent sautéed in olive oil and garlic. Pastas break little new ground and are served American-style, heaped with sauce, but some are very good nonetheless. Strozzapreti, torn pasta strips with a name that translates provocatively as ''priest stranglers,'' are interlaced with shreds of sausage, herbs and roasted peppers, while tagliatelle comes in a Bolognese ragù layered with intense meat, chicken and vegetable flavors, both savory and sweet. I was less enamored with tagliatelle with lobster and artichoke, and tagliolini with shrimp, crab meat and lobster; the seafood was consistently overdone. But gnocchi, nuggets of potato and spinach flour the size of fingertips, came in a sumptuous cheese sauce. Risotto seemed perfect to me, flavored only with herbs and chicken stock, until I noticed an extraneous lump of goat cheese in the center. Vitello tonnato is a supreme summer dish, and Teodora's is uncommonly lively: the cool rare veal is sliced thin, smeared with tuna-flavored mayonnaise and topped with chopped asparagus. Filet mignon, also sliced thin, is fanned around a heap of bitter broccoli rape, the cooking juices of both mingling together to form a perfect Italian pot liquor. On the heavier end of the scale, meltingly tender osso buco, full of herbs, arrives with a tiny fork sticking up from the center of a shin bone, for digging out the deliciously gelatinous marrow. As with the pastas, though, seafood dishes were lackluster. Orata in a sauce of white wine, lemon and capers was clearly weary, while fritto misto, an impressive-looking serving of fried seafood in a crisp potato basket, was almost entirely composed of fried calamari, with a few shrimp, mullet fillets and zucchini thrown in. In the end, it's essentially a bowl o' squid. Desserts are a familiar lot, with some fine choices like a caramel-flavored panna cotta, substantial yet not heavy, and a warm apple tart encased in almond pastry. My absolute favorite, though, was an unexpected gift. ''Here, it's just out of the oven,'' Ms. Ruggini said, setting down a plate of ciambelle, a traditional cake of Emilia-Romagna. The crumbly slices were subtly flavored with lemon and barely sweet, just the thing with some fresh fruit and a glass of passito, a modest Italian dessert wine. It was typical of Teodora, the thoughtful gesture to welcome guests. Teodora * [rating: one star] 141 East 57th Street, Manhattan; (212) 826-7101.

       "  'review': \"FIVE years can be an eternity in the restaurant business. Some restaurants, built on the shaky bases of fashionable dishes and celebrity appeal, will have already been blown away. Others may have been too hyperactive to evolve gracefully or too sluggish to evolve at all. Landlords, the economy, partnership disputes and a fickle public are but a few of the problems any restaurant will face. Just as thousands of small fry are born so that a few might survive, only a small percentage of restaurants make it to robust adulthood. When Molyvos opened a little more than five years ago near Carnegie Hall, its food, solidly grounded in the traditions of Greek home cooking, earned hearty applause. Like most restaurants, though, Molyvos has not been immune to change. Rick Moonen, one of the founding partners and a consultant to the executive chef, Jim Botsacos, left recently to open his own restaurant, and the tourist economy, on which its business partly depends, has been slow. Yet Molyvos shows few signs of faltering in the kitchen. Mr. Botsacos, who has been at Molyvos from the beginning, has almost imperceptibly tweaked the menu. Relying on the eternal appeal of traditional cooking and excellent ingredients, his newer dishes feel like graceful additions to the canon, but never like departures. From the long bar in the front, with booths and a large wooden communal table, to the airy room in the rear, its walls cluttered with urns and vases, black-and-white photos and maps, Molyvos is pleasingly informal. In a city where restaurants typically treat dining rooms as rush-hour subway cars, cramming too many tables into too little space, Molyvos is spacious enough to cross your legs or freely throw your arm over the back of a booth without fear of catastrophe. While familiar Greek dishes dominate the menu, it's worth trying some of Mr. Botsacos's more recent additions, like one called Greek fava. In fact, this appetizer is not made with fava beans but with yellow split peas, mashed and whipped to a froth and served as an almost lighter-than-air flan. Mr. Botsacos has also added a fabulous roasted tomato soup with a tangy flavor that seems a mile deep, and a lovely salad of black-eyed peas woven through with tender pea shoots and slivers of oven-dried tomatoes. Of course, it's hard to resist the old standbys, like the outstanding melitzanes salata, a light eggplant dip that resounds with the flavor of lively olive oil, which, along with tzatziki, a thick, refreshing yogurt made from sheep's milk, and oceanic taramasalata, the whipped cod roe dip, form an almost platonic ideal of Greek mezedes. Meaty pastitsio, served in a small ramekin and deftly touched with cinnamon and nutmeg, may be the best I've ever had, while baby octopus, grilled to a withered dryness on one occasion, was at its moist, smoky best on another. I was not won over by astringent stuffed grape leaves, but I was by an unusual version of dolmades, cabbage leaves stuffed with savory ground meat, in which simple flavors of olive oil and lemon gave an unmistakably Greek treatment of these more typically Eastern European ingredients. The best main courses tend to be the most straightforward. The kitchen gives special care to the fresh fish grilled simply over wood, like a light, lemony branzino and the slightly richer, more strongly flavored dorade royale. Grilled grouper made an appealing combination with new potatoes, green beans and chickpeas, and baby lamb chops are perfect with no more than a sprinkling of salt and pepper. While lamb shanks, braised and baked in a clay pot, may seem like a hefty dish for summer, the meat is exceedingly juicy and tender, served with orzo and roasted tomatoes. But the rabbit in stifado, a slightly sweet stew made with red wine and pearl onions, was dried out, and a roasted leg of lamb, though flavorful enough, was also too dry. Service is efficient and friendly, yet there seemed to be puzzling gaps in knowledge. Simple questions about Greek dishes and traditions required trips back to the kitchen for answers, all done willingly enough, but not what I expected. Similarly, the extensive wine list includes many Greek bottles, and waiters, though eager to advise on choices, were hard-pressed to say more than, ''That one's dry, that's dry, too, and that one's really dry.'' Desserts include many of the standards, like tart yogurt flavored with honey and walnuts, or a cylinder of baklava dripping with syrup, yet they are executed exceptionally well and served in enormous portions. I counted nine fritters on one plate -- each the size of a small doughnut, freshly made and drizzled with honey -- where maybe two or three would have done. Best of all was a sensational new dessert, a rough-textured walnut cake, flavored with olive oil, yet pleasingly sweet. Molyvos retains its thoroughgoing Greek appeal, and despite the rough waters facing many restaurants these days as they chart their courses toward middle age, Mr. Botsacos has kept a steady hand on the tiller. His assurance about where Molyvos comes from imparts a sure confidence about where it is going. Molyvos ** [Rating: Two Stars] 871 Seventh Avenue, near 55th Street, Manhattan; (212) 582-7500.

       "  'review': \"WHEN Patroon opened in Midtown in 1996, it revived a style of luxurious clubbiness that had come to seem threadbare and outmoded. With uniformed doormen, a richly appointed dining room and a menu that was among the most expensive in town, not to forget a sedate cigar bar upstairs and a list of bejeweled old Cognacs, Patroon charmed expense-account diners, who indulged themselves in the straightforward yet exquisite American cuisine. Not settling for popularity, the owner, Ken Aretsky, brought in a well-known chef, Geoffrey Zakarian, who, while staying true to the essentially conservative spirit of Patroon, was able to innovate on the sly, offering modern renditions of old school favorites like duck à l'orange. The smart likability of his cooking and the energetic professionalism in the dining room won Patroon three stars when it was last reviewed in The Times, by Ruth Reichl in October 1998. Much in life has changed since then, of course, including Patroon. Mr. Zakarian left in 2000 to open his own restaurant, Town, and last summer, after the economic slowdown took some of the starch out of high-end dining, Mr. Aretsky closed Patroon for renovations, saying he was aiming for a more stripped-down steakhouse approach. His plan seemed all the more sound after Sept. 11, when the conventional wisdom suggested that costly luxuries were no longer in good taste. The doorman is gone, the cigar bar is history (though the smell of stale cigar smoke lingers), and the new Patroon, done up in contrasting shades of brown and beige, looks more like the dining room of an airport hotel than an up-to-date ''21'' Club. This is not to suggest that Patroon has become inexpensive. It's a steakhouse with steakhouse prices, but the menu has been pruned of almost all excess and, for that matter, individuality. As you might expect, simplicity now rules. Oysters on the half shell are superb, although the selection is slim. I prefer the more delicate, saline Malpeques over the meatier Blue Islands, the two available one evening, but both were served perfectly, needing nothing to enhance their purity. The same can't be said of utterly tasteless shrimp, which are barely more pleasing when doused with barbecue sauce and grilled than they are served cold with cocktail sauce. But a jumbo crab cake is practically all meat, a thoroughly satisfying mouthful of pure flavor, while a fried soft-shell crab, a special appetizer one day, was delicately crisp and delicious. Caesar salad is well rendered, though I like a more pronounced anchovy presence. And truffle oil mars potato-and-leek soup, giving it a sharp, almost artificial flavor. Patroon faces stiff competition in a city full of steakhouses. As far as beef goes, though, little things tend to go wrong. Steaks, for example, were consistently overcooked -- medium instead of medium rare, well instead of medium. This is a pity, because the meat itself is quite good. I love the mineral tang of aged beef, and it's right there in the thick, firm sirloin and in the porterhouse for two. Even filet mignon (when not overcooked) was full of flavor beneath its well-charred exterior. But the Delmonico steak was barely aged -- soft and almost mushy. Maybe some people prefer their steaks that way. Among the accouterments, a platter arrives practically overflowing with onion rings, the slender, precisely battered O's almost uncannily identical. Creamed spinach, though, needs to be wrung of cream before a forkful can safely be lifted to the mouth. Strangely enough, where the steaks are wanting, fish dishes are excellent. Branzino, roasted whole and presented to our table on a wooden platter before filleting, was moist and faintly oceanic, enhanced with no more than garlic, lemon and herbs, while grilled Dover sole was supremely elegant. I might not return to Patroon for the steaks, but I would go for the simple, elemental fish preparations. I would come back too for the smart, well-chosen wine list. While the selection of first-growth Bordeaux, running $1,000 and more a bottle, remains from the old days, there are many excellent selections in the mere two-figure range. Desserts are straightforward in the typical steakhouse way -- hefty wedges of creamy cheesecake, chocolate cake with an interior that has the consistency of chocolate pudding and hearty hot fudge sundaes. While waiters are friendly enough, there is a lackadaisical, laissez-faire quality to the service that may have you wondering whether you'll ever receive menus or water refills. It's as if the crack professionals moved on when Patroon closed for renovations. It may be tempting nowadays to think of Patroon as an anachronism, a dinosaur struggling to keep up with swiftly changing times, yet it won't be the fault of evolution if Patroon falls by the wayside. Luxury dining may be somewhat toned down, but it hasn't died. People are still crowding into steakhouses, buying fine wines, foie gras and other emblems of pleasure. They're just a little more picky about where they are doing it. Patroon * [rating: one star] 160 East 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 883-7373. ATMOSPHERE Institutional and somewhat weary, lacking the energy that makes steakhouses crackle. SOUND LEVEL Reasonable, unless you are sitting next to a business group on its third bottle of wine.

       "  'review': \"FROM the outside, it's difficult to fathom why Butter, which opened not long ago a few doors down from the Public Theater, requires a pair of grim hosts posted like sentries in a glass-walled vestibule, their arms mentally crossed. As with London beefeaters, I felt compelled on a recent visit to try to make them laugh, but I decided that they must have serious work to do, like fending off people who want to be seated before their full party has arrived. Everything changes once you get past the welcoming committee, though. A long hallway that resembles nothing so much as a sauna gives way to a slender bar and then to a vaulted dining room designed by Andrew Phillips that is done up in a cedar veneer with an illuminated photo mural of a birch forest filling the back wall. The waiters, in their checked shirts with ties tucked between the buttons military style, are eager to please, filling tiny goblets with free welcoming aperitifs and offering little treats to start. In many ways, Butter epitomizes the conflicted priorities of certain downtown restaurants that teeter between being dining rooms and clubs. From the velvet-rope vibe of the hosts to the fawning friendliness of the waiters, Butter tries to have it both ways. The chef, Keith Harry, once cooked at Chanterelle and has put together a serious contemporary American menu with all the requisite high-end ingredients and global touches. Yet Butter only half-promises the opportunity for an enjoyable meal. The dining room is serene enough, but a downstairs lounge with a ceiling made of saplings, two walls constructed of birch trunks and a third of wine bottles lighted in red and black, is loud and smoky, with the unappealing prospect of a D.J. booth that gets going later in the evening. Upstairs, appetizers in particular struggle to hold up the food end. For every success -- crisp sweetbreads surrounded by mustard greens, their nutlike flavor enhanced by a tangy mustard-caper sauce, or a mâche salad, the leaves as tender as baby cress, with sweet striped beets and little chunks of smoky sturgeon -- there is a miscue. Spanish mackerel was grilled to the point of mushiness, and a thin slice of raw hamachi in tamari and ginger juice was unfortunately withered around the ends. The fish was pristine in the tuna tartare, a well-conceived blend of clean ahi and smoky tuna ''bacon,'' but the sesame oil dressing overwhelmed the tuna flavors. Mr. Harry is more sure-footed with his main courses, especially fish dishes, in which he combines reticent and robust flavors without sacrificing balance. Roasted peppers, braised escarole and bits of Smithfield ham tease an almost Chinese cast from a fine piece of black sea bass. The delicate grilled turbot with snow peas and braised savoy cabbage also has an Asian character, perhaps because of the sake in the beurre blanc. A tapenade coating enlivened a rosy piece of tuna, though grilled swordfish was too dry. Roast chicken breast is not my idea of excitement, but Mr. Harry conceals morels and slivers of truffles underneath the meat, touches that seem wasted on the otherwise routine bird. A lamb chop and loin are juicy enough, and a beef fillet will do the job of placating beef lovers, but I don't see any reason other than novelty for ordering ostrich, a lean meat that, but for the faintest gamy aftertaste, falls into the lamb-beef spectrum with little to distinguish it. It would be easy to imagine Butter playing to the showoff crowd with a list of expensive wines. But the restaurant instead emphasizes good, moderately priced bottles, like a mineral-laden Austrian grüner veltliner from Bründlmayer and a full-bodied Crozes-Hermitage from Alain Graillot. The amiable list of desserts does not break new ground, though some offer appealing architecture. Dense and creamy chocolate-mocha cake comes with coffee gelato, the two linked by a spiral bridge of crisp cocoa pastry, while passion-fruit curd joins a pineapple tart and its accompanying coconut gelato. Soothing tapioca pudding needs no structural enhancement, nor does a bombe of fromage blanc sweetened with berry consommé. For those heading to the restaurant rather than to the lounge, Butter offers sound pleasures without much promise of excitement. Later in the evening, after 10:30 or so, a crowd indeed gathers out front, waiting to enter, many presumably en route to the lounge. The grim-faced sentries are still there, and regardless of what I've eaten for dinner, I know that I've had a better evening than they will.

       "  'review': \"FOR what seems like decades, the Carlyle Restaurant has occupied the back of the Carlyle Hotel like a rich widow who managed to wrest control of the premises and won't leave. On my rare visits to the place, I was always shocked to find that the food was not at all bad, which is to say, it was a lot better than the threadbare surroundings. Rosewood Hotel and Resorts, which took over the management of the hotel last year, invested heavily to renovate the hotel, as well as the restaurant and the famed Bemelmans Bar. The results are impressive. The restaurant now looks the way a first-class dining room in a fancy hotel should -- formal, sumptuous and soothing to the senses. Dark taupe walls and matching velvet banquettes strike a luxurious note. An intimate room within a room, hung with large botanical prints by P. J. Redouté, beckons from the back, and a small lounge, whose oddly appealing decorating scheme includes wholesome country American wallpaper, is a tempting pit stop along the way. The Carlyle Restaurant used to feel like one big frayed cuff. Now it takes its rightful place alongside the dining rooms in Manhattan's finest hotels. Rosewood did not stop with the décor. It also hired a new chef, Jean-Louis Dumonet, to remake the kitchen and put the restaurant back in circulation. Mr. Dumonet was one of the three Jeans who in 1992 created Trois Jean, a strikingly handsome bistro with very good food, at least in its early years. As the restaurant lost its luster, Mr. Dumonet departed, cooking briefly at Palladin and then Rhône. His intentions at the Carlyle are hard to fathom. The busy menu, with many subdivisions and special categories, wanders hither and yon. Old warhorses like grilled Dover sole, chateaubriand and steak with béarnaise sauce mingle with more modern French dishes, often with a Mediterranean accent, like cod with black-truffle brandade and roasted poussin with preserved lemon, calamata olives and a cumin-spiced vegetable tagine. There are a half-dozen side dishes that can be ordered separately, daily specials and a ''familial'' menu of homey dishes like country pâté and hanger steak with shallots. It's an erratic, unfocused menu that seems to have been designed by committee, and perhaps cooked by committee, too, because the quality fluctuates wildly from dish to dish. I would like to think that it's Mr. Dumonet who makes the stunning roasted langoustines with gently browned gnocchi made from fingerling potatoes in a rich Parmesan emulsion. For purity and depth of flavor, it would be very hard to find a dish to equal this seemingly simple appetizer. Mr. Dumonet's langoustines seemed to contain all the taste that's missing from the crustacean that goes under that name in other restaurants. Biting into one, I felt like a gambler who's come up three cherries on a slot machine, unleashing a cascade of coins. And surely it's Mr. Dumonet's hand behind the cod steak, seared to a crisp, and lowered onto a firm pillow of brandade speckled with black truffles and sharpened up with a condimentlike serving of tapenade. The dish is really bistro fare that's been given an upgrade, but it slips into its high-class surroundings without a false note. Someone other than Mr. Dumonet must be making the pleasant but fairly ordinary velouté of green peas with duck prosciutto, the thin and watery broccoli velouté and the utterly pedestrian New York strip steak with béarnaise sauce and French fries. There are many dishes of this ilk on the menu, like the fricassee of asparagus and morels, dominated by enormous but flavorless asparagus, or the bland lemon risotto with spring vegetables. The picture brightens with a very light, delicately handled salad of crab and hearts of palm in a mixed citrus reduction. Soft-shell crabs amandine pair nicely with soft polenta, but a harsh anchovy coulis creates an annoying dissonance. Veal cheeks braised with white and pink baby carrots, another bistro-based dish, has a foursquare, muscular quality that seems a little down market for the restaurant. It's like a bouncer in dark glasses outside Alice Tully Hall. But one evening I was in the mood for veal cheeks, and Mr. Dumonet's version satisfied the urge. The one great flaw in the campaign to transform the Carlyle into a truly fine restaurant is service. The rigid, old-fashioned and pretentious style of service at the Carlyle, a relic of olden days, is rendered laughable by the charmlessness and indifference of the tuxedoed time-servers who grudgingly take your order and clearly hope you will depart sooner rather than later. ''Tonight's special is rack of veal,'' one captain intoned. ''It's very nice, and it comes with'' -- a long pause here -- ''a very nice sauce that the chef has made.'' The little ritual of presenting soup with the garnishes and solid ingredients arranged in the center of the bowl, and then pouring the soup itself, loses a little class when the soup is thrown into the bowl in one fast splash, like hogwash. I worried, one evening, that the captain had a pressing engagement elsewhere, because he took a position by the table, pencil and pad in hand, approximately three minutes after delivering the menus. There he hovered, immovable, until the table ordered. When he deboned a Dover sole, he looked like a surgeon performing an experimental procedure for the first time. It wasn't at all clear that the fish was going to make it to the table. The Carlyle has the looks. It has a chef who, if he can find his way and settle on an approach, could do the place proud. Fixing the service problems may be mission impossible. But those captains really do know how to wear a tuxedo.

       "  'review': \"JO JO turns 11 this month. It seems only yesterday that a supercharged young chef named Jean-Georges Vongerichten left Restaurant Lafayette, having imprinted it with four stars, to open his own little bistro with a difference. It was casual, modestly priced and enormously influential, as Mr. Vongerichten continued to reinvigorate classic French dishes with vegetable-based sauces and Asian flavors. Mr. Vongerichten went on to create a restaurant empire that now stretches from New York to Tokyo. By rights, little Jo Jo should have settled into a comfortable rut, as most restaurants do after five or six years. Instead, after an extensive renovation, Jo Jo has shown, with extraordinary grace, how a restaurant can age without looking old. The face-lift helps. The cheeky bistro of yesteryear now has the taste, and the money, for velvet and expensive jewelry. The place looks sumptuous now, with plum banquettes in the tiny downstairs room and walls done in broad asparagus and celery stripes. Old-fashioned brass sconces make it feel like a Romanov railroad car. The upstairs dining room, overlooking 64th Street, is a genteel living room straight out of Vuillard. Jo Jo is the kind of restaurant that makes diners feel like members of an exclusive club. At the same time, it still has the heart of a bistro. The style of service is not overformal. The menu is a fairly short read, and the wine list, with perhaps 65 selections, makes a serious effort to please the $50 customer. There are a few heavy hitters for the kind of diner who simply must drink a $300 Bordeaux, but they are far outnumbered by wines like a $44 St.-Chinian Cuvée des Sigillaires from Moulinier, or even a $25 Chinon from Gasnier. Mr. Vongerichten has wisely retained a few signature dishes. The spring menu continues to offer an appetizer of shrimp dusted in orange powder, and the renowned roast chicken with chickpea fries is still an entree. Both dishes hold up very well, and they both exhibit, neatly, the ingenious weaving together of sweet, sour and bitter flavors that characterize Mr. Vongerichten's French-Asian style. The orange-shrimp combination, which teeters on the edge of sweetness, gets a quick correction from artichokes and arugula, just as green olives impose discipline on the flavors of ginger and coriander in the chicken dish. Jo Jo's chickpea fries, flattered by a thousand imitators, are still the ones to beat. Credit goes to Alex Powell, Jo Jo's chef de cuisine for the last six years. The food at Jo Jo never clamors for attention. Most dishes have a surprise or two in store, but they conquer by stealth, aided by a sure hand in the kitchen and a sane, clear-eyed view of how flavors work in combination, and which ones need to be framed and pushed to the fore. There's nothing fancy about grilled sardines topped with crushed pine nuts, lemon and parsley, but the sardines, plump and firm, come perfectly cooked, without a hint of dryness, like little Mediterranean seafood steaks. Soft-shell crab, done tempura style, holds its own against a wasabi-fired slaw of Napa cabbage and a sweet-hot honey-mustard sauce. A pristine pea soup sets itself a single goal, to express pea flavor with maximum clarity and presence, which it does. A couple of sticklike croutons for crunch, and a little constellation of chopped carrot, leek, celeriac and garlic supports the project, but the soup is an exercise in minimalism. The more adventurous goat cheese panna cotta, smooth as custard, takes a chance with candied ginger, but thin slices of cooked and pickled beets -- red, yellow and candy-cane -- head off the sweet tendencies of this dish before it turns into a dessert. A fenugreek and vegetable herb broth, like a nearly transparent veil of flavor, intensifies the natural richness of lobster served with Basmati rice. In a bold but entirely successful move, Mr. Vongerichten conjures up a light, bright and fruity sauce for black sea bass, with sweet shreds of carrot ''confit'' suspended in orange juice and olive oil accented with cumin. Slow-cooked salmon on a pillow of chive mashed potatoes seems, at first glance, like yet another dutiful salmon dish, but pickled ramps add a racy touch, set off brilliantly by an earthy chanterelle vinaigrette. On occasion, Jo Jo can send a merely good dish from the kitchen. The foie gras terrine, with a bitter lemon zest salad and a few haricots verts loitering on the plate, does not really make much of an impact, and lamb topped with finely chopped fava beans, artichokes, garlic and niçoise olives seems a little tame when set beside Jo Jo's duck, a rich red slab of meat with sweet and sour shallots and a Tunisian-style brek pastry stuffed with leg meat, foie gras and duck prosciutto. Desserts include one dull character, an unexceptional warm chocolate cake, with a molten center and a little scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. It is perfectly respectable, but I have the feeling I've eaten the same dessert at a couple of dozen other restaurants. Once past the cake, the picture brightens. Strawberries and rhubarb find shared bliss on clouds of mascarpone sandwiched between thin sheets of pastry, and the fattest, firmest blueberries on record lend tactical support to a cheesecake perfectly balanced between sweet and sour, with a pastry base that could almost be its own dessert. Kumquat sorbet seems unnecessary, but there it is. A dainty lemon meringue tart, with a filling that begs to be eaten in slow, drawn-out bites, pays a lemon dividend after the tart itself has disappeared. It comes with a scoop of tingling lemon-verbena ice cream, its flavor as clear as crystal. This little shock of pure citrus took me by surprise. In my mind, it's shorthand for the new Jo Jo, a restaurant I thought I knew. It's older now, but still new in all the ways that count.

       "  'review': \"AT first glance, the lines outside the Neue Galerie might suggest enthusiasm for the art of Oskar Kokoschka. His Expressionist portraits are on display at the museum, the city's newest, and critics have been enthusiastic. But the visitors clogging the lobby have something other than Viennese modernism on their minds. They're thinking of Viennese pastry. When Ronald S. Lauder decided to create a museum to house the collection of Austrian and German art assembled by Serge Sabarsky, he wanted a cafe to go with it. It would be a real Viennese cafe, with marble tabletops, chairs designed by Adolf Loos and an authentic Viennese menu created by an authentic Austrian chef, Kurt Gutenbrunner, the owner of Wallsé. It was a good idea. Maybe too good. I'm willing to bet that at least half the museum's visitors whiz through the special exhibitions and the permanent collection in half an hour or so and then race downstairs for the aesthetic experience that really counts, coffee and linzer torte. It's a New Yorker cover begging to be drawn: Manhattan culture vulture staring intently at a nude by Klimt, with overhead thought bubble showing coffee and whipped cream next to a fat slice of apple strudel. Cup of coffee, or Kokoschka? It's a close call. If you've had the coffee at Cafe Sabarsky, you'll understand. It comes from Meinl's in Vienna, and I'm prepared to state that it's the best coffee in the city: rich, robust and deep. Add a huge dollop of whipped cream, a slice of strudel or torte, and you're in Lehar's Land of Smiles, a megacalorie Viennese never-never land built almost entirely of chocolate and sugar. There are about a dozen ways to reach this small paradise at Cafe Sabarsky, one for each of the desserts lined up on the cafe's marble mantelpiece. The end of the meal is the beginning, really. The rest of the menu presents some tried and true Austro-Hungarian staples, like goulash and tafelspitz, and some newfangled dishes, like cod strudel, all prepared in a kitchen the size of a broom closet. There's a nice list of about two dozen Austrian wines, selected by Alexander Adlgasser, formerly the sommelier at Danube and now, bow tie intact, serving as maître d'hôtel at Cafe Sabarsky. But the goulash, herring sandwiches and boiled beef, a little like the Kokoschka portraits upstairs, are merely a warm-up to the desserts. Shockingly, they are made by a Frenchman, Serge Decrauzat, formerly the pastry chef at Le Cirque 2000. Perhaps that accounts for the light hand in desserts like a yogurt cheesecake with a chiffonlike filling. Each slice revealed a translucent section of pear within and a bright red layer of raspberry jam underneath, tart enough to make the dessert sweet but not cloying. A crunchy layer of crushed pistachios on the outside was an unexpected bonus. A sponge roll stuffed with strawberry mousse and served with sliced strawberries has a bright, upbeat quality to match the season. The house specialty is a Klimt torte, neatly stacked layers of hazelnut cake alternating with firm, bittersweet chocolate. It deserves classic status, along with the linzer torte and the Sacher torte, both flawless. Two other desserts deserve special mention. The first is a visually striking multilayer dobosch torte, thin layers of yellow cake alternating with mocha butter cream. On top, balanced at a rakish angle, the torte wears a triangle of thin crunchy caramel. The final pastry in the drop-dead category is the cafe's apple strudel, which, when it is good, somehow manages to rise above the rest, not easy for an apple strudel to do. My three samplings have convinced me that when Mr. Decrauzat uses very tart apples, the dessert reaches sublime heights. He achieves an ideal balance of tartness and sweetness, with just the right proportion of raisins and walnuts. Blander, sweeter apples bring the strudel down a notch. On all three tries, the pastry was perfect, flaky and crackling outside, just slightly gooey inside. The savory dishes can be ordinary. Open-face sandwiches on chewy, caky dark rye bread do not make a strong showing. The liverwurst needs more than a tiny, dime-size dot of onion confit, the best part of the sandwich. The egg sandwich, described on the menu as spicy, was not spicy in the least. Freshly grated horseradish adds a sweet kick to a simple cooked ham sandwich and to the somewhat dry tafelspitz. Viennese sausages, served with potato salad, do not compare well with their German brothers. They have a smooth, bland quality that reminded me too much of Yankee Stadium franks. The cheese plate, mostly French, is nothing to write home about, and goulash soup, like hamburger soup, seems to exist as a reminder that goulash does not really need to be a soup. The actual goulash is good. And the quark spätzle that comes with it, cheesy, buttery and chewy, is one of those side dishes that nearly runs away with the whole show. The wild card on the menu, cod strudel, may be the best thing going among the nondessert offerings. Cod and sauerkraut are gently braised in riesling, flavored with a little tarragon and purple basil, then wrapped in a flaky phyllo dough. There's a deft touch here that deserves applause. The cod, somehow, never disappears, although you might expect sauerkraut to bury it without a trace. The setting for this Viennese operetta is ornate, a 1914 Beaux-Arts mansion designed by Carrère & Hastings. It is old-fashioned, opulent and no doubt aswarm with genteel ghosts from Edith Wharton novels. Restless or not, they now have the kind of desserts they deserve, even if the art is shocking.

       "  'review': \"BLUE FIN is the sort of restaurant that encourages diners like me to set their sights low. It's in Times Square, for one thing. It greets the street with a glass-enclosed bar that looks like an advertisement for the latest youth-oriented liqueur. The restaurant itself can feed multitudes -- 400 diners on two floors -- and the waiters and waitresses look like cast members for next year's slate of young-adult sitcoms. A quick tabulation generated the following memo addressed to the culinary department of my frontal lobe: too big, too good-looking (both the interior and the personnel). Inform pleasure centers of brain that they can take the night off. Well, life is full of surprises. Blue Fin, a full-blast production from Stephen Hanson's B. R. Guest restaurant group, the very successful operation that runs Blue Water Grill, Isabella's and Ruby Foo's, delivers much more than it promises. In fact, it may be the most virtuous restaurant in Manhattan. I strongly suspect that it could get away with some fairly mediocre food and hitch a free ride on the look of the place and its presold cachet as part of the W hotel chain. But somewhere along the line, someone decided that they preferred to create a very good restaurant. The theme is fish, and anyone confused on this point gets a quick reminder on the floating terrazzo staircase. It looks out over a school of black fish suspended from the ceiling by fishing line, and a bright white plaster wall whose raised swirls seem as though they were shaped by moving water on the ocean floor. It makes a dreamy, very seductive transition to the water world of Blue Fin. The menu divides this world into two parts. Half of it is joined to a sushi counter, where Masaki Sasaki, formerly the head sushi chef at Kantaro Sushi in San Francisco, turns out sushi, sashimi and special sushi rolls. The raw-fish part of the menu  includes towering shellfish platters, labeled, by size, as a maison, castle or palace. The menu proper is in the hands of Paul Sale, a quietly talented British chef who did quality work as the executive chef at Icon, also in a W hotel, and who filleted a fish or two at Le Bernardin before that. Both Mr. Sasaki and Mr. Sale have very raw material to work with. The B. R. Guest empire is big. It buys a lot of fish. And because it buys a lot of fish it gets first dibs. The quality is unmistakable. Some of the freshest, most pristine fish I've eaten in many months has been at Blue Fin, where the oysters almost seem to twinkle and the tuna is pure velvet. One way to test the waters is simply to order sushi or sashimi by the piece, from a list of 20 varieties. I'm not usually enticed by fanciful sushi rolls, but Blue Fin's -- clever but restrained -- changed my mind. One of the simplest rolls, combining scallion and silky toro, or fatty tuna, is the best introduction to a list that includes shrimp coated in a crackling skin of tiny puffed rice and daubed with green curry ginger mayonnaise, and a tempura oyster, so lightly fried it still quivers inside, with a bright soy-ginger mignonette. The shellfish platters are undeniably impressive, but they have their ups and downs. The ups start on the ground floor, where the oysters await. They are superb specimens, three varieties that change with the market, and there are, in addition to a classic vinegar-pepper mignonette, three flavor enhancers, including a zippy tomato-horseradish granitè. Ascending the palace, a five-level Trump Tower priced at $100, I encountered lots of rubbery mussels, Jonah crab claws that seemed more trouble than they were worth, sweet and tasty crawfish, mammoth but very flavorful shrimp, a good but not exceptional two-pound lobster and a terrific scallop ceviche. The main menu, where the fin fish swim, is where Blue Fin impresses the most. Mr. Sale creates distinctive dishes that do honor to his ingredients. He does not overload the plate or step on the fish. Bigeye tuna, as succulent a piece of fish as you could hope to eat, is lightly dusted with cumin and charred on the outside. That's it. The fish is served with puréed butternut squash, broccolini and baby shiitake mushrooms in a  ginger-shallot vinaigrette. Wild salmon, with its meaty texture and strong flavor, is seared with aromatic sprigs of thyme and scattered with black trumpet mushrooms. A bed of French lentils makes this a red-wine fish dish par excellence. The most impressive entree, for my money, is a crisply sautéed fillet of Atlantic black bass served on a creamy shrimp and asparagus risotto. The genius touch is a shallow pool of chive nage. Nage, which so often translates as ''murky puddle of indeterminate color and no particular flavor,'' here reclaims its birthright. The color is the green of a crisp large-denomination bill. The flavor is etched sharply, a fresh, oniony note that brings the risotto, and the fish, to vibrant life. I have been revisiting this dish mentally since I encountered it on my first visit. Joseph Murphy, a former pastry chef at Gotham Bar and Grill, makes first-class desserts. His coconut-milk panna cotta is feather light but just rich enough to take on a bright, snappy soup of pineapple and passion fruit freshed up with a whiff of mint. Sour-cherry toasted almond cake, a bouncy Americanized financier, is perfectly crunchy on the edges and chewy inside, with a tart pool of red wine and sour cherry juice that slowly soaks into the cake. On top there's a scoop of morello cherry sorbet, as red and round as a clown's nose. Mr. Murphy even makes crème brûlée seem worthwhile. He served three in a neat row: Tahitian vanilla, milk chocolate and Sicilian pistachio. Eat them in that order. The pistachio, for one shining moment, makes all other nut flavors seem trivial. By the way, there is meat at Blue Fin. It's good. But why on earth would anyone bother?\",\n",

       "  'review': \"IT'S hard to think of a restaurant that works harder at fun than Osteria del Circo. It opened, nearly six years ago, with a trumpet blast and a big shower of confetti, and if the owners, Mario, Marco and Mauro Maccioni, did not actually send out clowns on tiny tricycles, it's only because they could not quite figure out how. The restaurant, like the owners, is a younger, more casual offshoot of the very grand Le Cirque 2000, a kind of one-ring circus to Sirio Maccioni's three-ring, Monte Carlo version. The two restaurants share the same designer, Adam Tihany, who somehow managed to make Osteria del Circo even more carnival-like after it closed last year for renovation. The freshened Osteria del Circo has new harlequin-pattern fabric on the chairs, circus-theme midnight-blue banquettes, lots of trapezes hung from the ceiling, and a big metal lion draped over the coat-check concession. Tail wagging, it joins the rest of the junk-sculpture crew -- the chorus line of rotating circus performers balanced over the window to the open kitchen, and, high on a wall, the sinister-looking metal monkey holding a martini glass. The restaurant has lots of visual pizazz, and enough Italian warmth to fire the ovens. It's easy enough to settle in, enjoy the show and not worry too much about the undeniable fact that the food is nothing special. Those who do worry about such things, like me, can wind up feeling, by the end of the evening, that the monkey is having the last laugh. Simple is best. Appetizers and pastas, on balance, outperform the entrees. And there is light at the end of the tunnel, because Stephane Weber, the pastry chef, comes through with very pleasing desserts. The revised menu is much more Tuscan than it used to be, and waiters seem to enjoy underlining the fact, offering mini-travelogues about less familiar dishes, with footnotes about their origins and the way they are enjoyed in Italy. Occasionally they get carried away. My pasta turned cold one night by the time my waiter got through explaining it. As a greeter at the doorway to Tuscany, the fritto misto makes a poor impression. Slimy and tasteless, it satisfies only one requirement of the dish: it comes in an abundant heap. Scallops wrapped in crispy pancetta have the usual scallop problem, lack of flavor. The picture brightens with an excellent tartare of branzino, or Mediterranean sea bass, cut into small translucent dice, firm and meaty, and freshened with fennel, lemon and capers. Chilled lobster, removed from the shell and arranged stylishly over a bed of lentils, artichokes and arugula, makes an unusual match of rich seafood with dark, earthy flavors and the bright acidity of baby tomatoes. A special cold appetizer of braised beef tongue with puntarelle, a bitter green, and sliced porcini mushrooms in a light lemon-caper vinaigrette was fresh and simple, the hallmarks of Italian cuisine at its best. Spaghetti alla chitarra comes in a murky tomato sauce with rather mealy langoustines. It is easily outclassed by a superior risotto packed with button-size bay scallops, the rice firm to the bite but dissolving into creaminess at the edges. The slender sticks of battered and fried zucchini that came with it were a model of delicacy. Tortelli stuffed with pumpkin came with a small ball of braised goose meat, a tangle of small shreds steeped in a rich, citrus-accented liquid. It made an ideal middle course on a chilly night. And it raised an interesting question: whatever happened to goose? Main courses fall apart. Osso buco, a Wednesday special, is a slick, glutinous mass, with surprisingly untender meat concealed within. Grilled St. Pietro, or John Dory, was the centerpiece of a dish that would have been first rate, minus the fish, which was so tough it might have been an espadrille. It rested malevolently on a dark green bed of wilted kale, lightly sautéed with garlic. On the side was a tort of roasted vegetables in a flaky, buttery casing, a bit player worthy of a starring role. Roasted rabbit loin stuffed with fennel sausage acquits itself with honor, but rack of lamb and osso buco of lamb had all the appeal of a gnarled tree stump. The lamb was flavorless, gristly and tough. Cacciucco del Circo, a rustic fish stew, helps redeem the fish category. It's a bowl heaped with clams, mussels, octopus, cuttlefish, monkfish and prawns, in a burly tomato sauce so thick it can barely be called a liquid. The dessert menu delivers color, excitement and a badly needed touch of elegance. A simple, pristine cake made with goat cheese, mildly tangy and fluffy, meets its perfect match in a deeply concentrated cassis sorbet, echoed in a small puddle of cassis compote on top of the cheesecake, contained in a little pastry nest. Bomboloncini, little Tuscan doughnuts filled with vanilla cream, chocolate cream and raspberry marmalade, are fragrant and chewy. Mr. Weber manages to dazzle without being flashy. Even his chocolate desserts, which could easily go for the cheap thrill, remain models of decorum. The chocolate tart runs the risk of being upstaged by its scoop of caffè latte gelato, something that should be sold by the pint to take home. The zuccotto al cioccolato looks fearsome -- a dark, glistening dome that seems like a piece of expensive candy inflated to giant size. It is a suave, velvety dessert, intensely chocolaty without being cloying. Eat one of these after quaffing a major Barolo or Brunello, and you may wind up seeing eye to eye with that monkey.

       "  'review': \"IN Paris, the Hôtel Plaza Athénée has Alain Ducasse and three Michelin stars. In New York, the hotel has struggled to make a serious impact on the dining scene in recent years. In the 1980's, its restaurant, then called Le Régence, briefly had Daniel Boulud in the kitchen. When he departed for Le Cirque, the hotel imported the Rostang clan from France to keep the restaurant in the top rank. But with their departure, Le Régence slipped into overstuffed, overdecorated mediocrity. Now the Plaza Athénée is giving it another try. Le Régence is no more. In its place, after a $2 million renovation, is Arabelle, with a new chef, Raymond Saja, and a more contemporary, global French menu. On looks, Arabelle is a vast improvement over Le Régence. It has a subtly luxurious feel, with pale pink wall panels, wispy gold curtains and a gold-domed ceiling. Even the horrendous abstract paintings, chosen purely for their color schemes, do not break the spell, although once your eye settles on one, it's hard to tune it out. The moodily lighted lounge and bar just outside the restaurant's entrance, with tiger-print chairs and Orientalist knickknacks, should be on everyone's list of romantic meeting spots. The food is another matter. Mr. Saja, who worked at Le Régence before taking over the kitchen at Arabelle, proves that the restaurant world, too, has its fashion victims. In a clear case of overcompensation, he has avoided the fusty dishes and gold-plated war horses normally associated with fancy French restaurants in even fancier hotels. Instead, he has made a point of showing that he knows what foam is, that he can turn traditional terms like ''gratin'' or ''sorbet'' inside out and upside down, and that East and West can be made to embrace whether they like it or not. It's hard to tell what Mr. Saja's natural inclinations might be, but a dish like veal chop crusted in vegetable ''flour'' (Mr. Saja's quotation marks), accompanied by a crepe stuffed with wild mushroom ''daube'' (my quotation marks), tells me that he buried them fairly deep in devising his attention-getting menu. There's a little too much of everything here. As a result, ingredients often wage war on one another, or sit superfluously on a far corner of the plate, awaiting instructions. The most extreme example is the ultratrendy ''heirloom tomatoes, levels 1-8.'' The intent is to express tomato flavor eight ways, from tomato water to tomato oil to sun-dried tomato. It is all much ado about very little. There are wonderful appetizers, however, that should make all eight tomatoes blush with shame. Bits of citrus-cured salmon, clean-tasting and plushly textured, nestle in a shapely nest of microgreens and tiny, crunchy dice of jicama and malanga. Mr. Saja does justice to his seared foie gras, with an appropriately sumptuous accompaniment of figs, almonds and sharp, rich oloroso vinegar. The Spanish touch here is dignified, elegant and original, but the red snapper escabeche is bad. The fish, cut in thick slabs, is tough, and the vinegar marinade is overpowering. Ahi tuna served sashimi-style is simply buried under the multicultural flavors of Chinese broccoli, rock shrimp and wood-ear mushrooms in a sharp blood-orange sauce. The dish has a severe overpopulation problem. Overcrowding also afflicts the very flavorful loin of lamb with arugula, artichokes, Ligurian olives, tomato confit and roasted eggplant in a cumin broth. Mr. Saja makes a much better, more organized impression with his pan-roasted halibut with a golden crust, bathed in a well-judged truffled chicken jus, just the right level of richness to complement the fish, which is placed on a simple potato purée surrounded by chanterelles and topped with a paper-thin slice of salty roasted pancetta. Foam or no foam, I found the roasted poussin equally impressive. An emulsion of Vidalia onion and Madeira brought a sweetly earthy quality that suited the chicken meat perfectly. Lobster, sliced into neat scallop-like circles, looks lovely on the plate, arranged in overlapping rounds over a neat mound of sweet corn, truffles, julienne green apple and baby fennel. But the dish is too sweet. The wine list, it must be said, is skimpy, unimaginative and in every way unworthy of a restaurant bidding for respect. Kristen D. Murray's desserts at least have the virtue of being consistent with the rest of the menu. They use lots of herbs and even sneak in a little tomato. The rhubarb in white chocolate pain perdu is expressed three ways. Champagne gelée with vanilla fromage blanc and blood-orange sorbet is dense and heavy. Coconut tapioca, very weak on coconut flavor, features a salad of yellow tomato and mango with mango sorbet. The dessert reminded me of the old ''What's wrong with this picture?'' newspaper cartoons. Anyone guessing yellow tomato would be correct. The cheesecake is closer to a sideways napoleon, with paper-thin rounds of roasted pineapple sandwiching dollops of cheese filling that brilliantly evokes Philadelphia cream cheese. I mean this as a compliment. A scattering of cracked black pepper adds spice and cuts the sweetness just a degree or two. Arabelle has all the charm in the world. I can't think of a dining room more pleasing to look at, or to spend an evening in. But for a truly great meal at the Plaza Athénée, I'm afraid you'll have to fly to Paris.

Like a Detroit prototype car, the $27 DB burger has been through many redesigns and modifications, picking up and dropping ingredients along the way, and only gradually working its way onto the main menu after serving an apprenticeship as a weekly special. It is now the chief ornament of Daniel Boulud's newest venture, a lively, even raucous restaurant that tries to pass for a bistro but can't quite disguise its high-class leanings. Which brings us back to the burger. It stands high on the plate, a thick circle of ground sirloin stuffed with short rib meat braised in red wine and stuffed, in turn, with foie gras and truffles. Slices of tomato confit, like red splats from a paint gun, adhere to the meat, and spidery tendrils of frisée lettuce make a crunchy nest under a lid of soft Parmesan and onion bun. Mustard, onion and mayonnaise are presented in very French-looking crocks, along with soufflé potatoes in a silver julep cup. It is quite a production. Impressive, absolutely delicious and, for me, a little pointless. Mr. Boulud has proved that an American hamburger can be made to speak French. Bravo, and so what? DB Bistro Moderne, to give the full name, has a couple of inside jokes on the menu. The other is vitello tonnato dismantled and reassembled, so the dish comes out as tuna tartare with a crisp breaded sweetbread. The two actors in this little drama barely look at each other, and in fact, the second time I ordered vitello tonnato, Mr. Vitello did not show up for the performance at all, and was not missed, until an apologetic waiter came rushing over with a late plate. The tuna tartare is sublime, by the way, anointed with an unctuous, rich hazelnut-oil dressing whose identity is cleverly tipped off with a few hazelnuts strategically dotting the plate. Mr. Boulud is entitled to have a little fun. But it's when he rolls up his sleeves and gets serious that DB, the most casual of his three restaurants, really takes off. The cooking, although simplified to suit the bistro concept and even countrified on occasion, plays to Mr. Boulud's strength, his refined rusticity. Nothing seems to invigorate him more than a traditional, low-rent dish that he can work a little magic on, and at DB the entire menu presents him and his chef de cuisine, Jean-François Bruel, with just that opportunity. They grab for it with both hands. At times, it seems as if Mr. Boulud wants to show just how much he can do with a mere half-turn. Lovage oil, for example, sends a fresh, transforming whiff of celery wafting over marinated salmon, accompanied by a dollop of smoky eggplant caviar. At other times, he simply shows that rock-solid technique, good ingredients and a sound idea translate into gustatory bliss. There's nothing fancy about Mr. Boulud's tarte Tatin heaped with roasted tomatoes, goat cheese, basil and black olives, but a perfect buttery crust and tomatoes brought to peak concentration of flavor make a little miracle out of this humble tart. Gazpacho, tingling and vibrant, sticks to basics. It is clean, crisp and clear, with tender shrimp and small chunks of buttery avocado. Roasted duck breast, although a little chewy, has great depth of flavor, and Bing cherry sauce brings an innocent sweetness to the dish, offset by bitter Swiss chard. Confit de canard, the Tuesday plat du jour, looks like meat in a bowl. It is potently flavored, with garlicky roast potatoes and mushrooms reeking of the earth. The bowl is a good idea. You can lean over it and simply inhale the fragrance, like a burnt offering. One of Mr. Boulud's more convoluted efforts, boeuf en gelée with horseradish cream, served in a martini glass, seems a little forced at first glance, and a little formidable for an appetizer, but it turns out to be a winner -- cool, light and refreshing. The prices, by the way, put Mr. Boulud's new plaything into deluxe territory. Entrees dance around the $30 frontier and occasionally step over it. Cristina Aliberti's desserts are excellent. Years of catering to an Upper East Side clientele have given Mr. Boulud a supernatural hand with salads and spa fare. Ms. Aliberti, too, manages the trick of making very light desserts, like melon carpaccio with ginger sorbet as appealing as, say, her clafoutis tout chocolat, a small round chocolate cake, runny in the center, that looks like no clafoutis on earth. No one will object. Rich without being gooey, the clafoutis impersonator strikes me as the kind of chocolate dessert that can win over the most hardened chocolate skeptic. They do exist. I'm one of them. The service at DB is puzzling. It is disorganized. And the layout of the restaurant seems to accentuate the sense that things are only tenuously under control. The restaurant is divided in half, with a street level dining room that seems like a brasserie attached to the more formal room a few steps up and past a strikingly illuminated wine wall. Bottlenecks can develop at the hostess station atop the stairs. When both rooms fill, the kitchen can take quite a while to get the food out. And the waiters, although obliging and friendly, need to polish the rough edges. They sometimes disappear. One diner at my table was studying his wine list intently, only to have it whisked away from him. When the wine arrived, the waiter simply filled everyone's glasses without pouring out a trial taste to see whether the bottle was good. Well, this is DB, not Daniel. It's a rollicking, jolly place, and there's a very good reason why the mood is upbeat. Mr. Boulud, in a casual vein, is turning out some of the most appealing, accessible food in town. Even the Versailles-burger can't spoil the fun. DB Bistro Moderne ** [Rating: two stars] 55 West 44th Street; (212) 391-2400. ATMOSPHERE: Refined bistro cooking served in a lively, casual setting.

       "  'review': \"THE concrete floor and the brushed-aluminum chairs send off warning signals. Is Peasant, despite the name, going to be an exercise in deprivation chic? The whitewashed brick walls and bare wood tables don't offer much hope. But closer inspection suggests that all is not as it seems. At the far end of the room, a brick pizza oven radiates heat. On a counter in front of the open kitchen, apricots, tomatoes and grapes have been massed in abundant display. Even the forbidding industrial chairs spring a surprise. They are form-fitting and inexplicably comfortable. The black-clad waiters turn out to be Jimmy Olsens in disguise, full of gee-whiz enthusiasm and can-do optimism. Peasant may be cool, but it's not cold. In the 15 months since it opened, Peasant has built a following by sticking to some very simple premises. Keep the food simple, rustic and Italian. Cook it over a wood fire. Serve abundant portions. Be nice. That's about it. When the formula works, Peasant sends out highly satisfying food, fresh and flavorful, with the rich tanginess that wood smoke imparts. Four big Mediterranean sardines, done to a crisp and drizzled with a little lemon and oil, manage to stay perfectly moist inside their crackling skins. They are flawless. This may not sound like much of an achievement, but after chewing my way through several schools of desiccated, flavorless grilled sardines all over the city, I knew that these prize specimens were heaven-sent. Panzanella is a warm-weather addition to the menu, a traditional bread salad that's a plumped-out, heartier cousin of Spain's gazpacho. Too much vinegar, and the wrong kind, can turn it into a palate scorcher. Peasant's is just right, a generous plate of chewy bread cubes, red onion and cerignola olives, with a subtle application of balsamic vinegar for roundness and sweetness. The buffalo mozzarella at Peasant could be better. It lacks the properly frappéed texture and fresh sourness that can make buffalo mozzarella seem, for a brief moment at least, the best cheese on earth. The good news is that it comes with strips of wood-roasted red pepper oozing thick, smoky juices. The small mozzarella balls known as bocconcini become Italian canapés after being wrapped in prosciutto, dusted in bread crumbs and baked. Somehow, cooking bleeds every bit of salt and savor from the prosciutto. You're left with a bland white cheese ball in a tasteless brown wrapper. Burning wood can be a force for good or evil. It adds a sublime crunch to the excellent crust of Peasant's little pizzas. (The most appealing of the three versions, topped with pepe roncini and soppressata, is fiery enough to require a stern warning from the waiter.) Bushy sprigs of rosemary release a thick, heady perfume that mingles with wood smoke and permeates the firm flesh of orata, or sea bream, so that each bite seems to release a small cloud of fragrant steam. Skate does not fare as well. Its delicate scalloplike flavor dissipates, and a too-robust caper sauce buries the fish entirely. Cuttlefish, cooked in small terra-cotta vessels, might as well be pressed tofu. Meat is another story. Leg of lamb, slow-cooked on the rotisserie, is sliced off in neat rounds, served on top of creamy polenta and garnished, if that's the word, with an enormous head of bitter radicchio di Treviso grilled to a state of juicy limpness. If this be peasant fare, don't tell the royals. The flavors here are potent and lingering. The pasta at Peasant, like the mozzarella, is good, not great. Properly firm risotto, dotted with peas, shrimp bits and cherry tomatoes, pleases well enough, but the impression is marred by the mealy Sicilian shrimp, split in half and grilled, that surrounds it like a dragon guarding a treasure hoard. Gnocchi with morels is more like it: earthy, rich and -- there's no other way to put it -- peasantlike. The untranslated menu encourages much back-and-forth with the waiters, who, like ''A'' students, seem happiest explaining what you get when you order, say, insalata acciuga e fagiolini. The all-Italian wine list, although not terribly long, seems to pose more of a puzzle. I had questions about this Sardinian and that Sicilian. They remained unanswered. If you take the trouble to put together a list of regional wines, several of them off the beaten track, it helps if the waiters can say something a little more enlightening than, ''That's my favorite.'' The desserts include a few surprises, some of them unpleasant. An enormous bowl of fresh fruit and sorbets, enough for an entire table, turns out to be a cruel joke. The fruit looks spectacular, but someone made off with the flavor. The low point one evening was a mushy apricot that could be identified only by color. The ricotta cheesecake is respectable, although not as good as the pistachio gelato by its side. Vanilla-soaked bread pudding, an imposing cube of unctuousity accompanied by a caramel-swathed scoop of white chocolate gelato, relegates the cheesecake to also-ran status. Best of all is a heroically proportioned peach pie with a rough lattice crust, its opulent fruit flavor coaxed out by the magic heat of burning wood. The espresso at Peasant cannot pass without comment. Both weak and bitter at the same time, it may be the worst I've ever tasted. In a city awash in bad espresso, this is no mean feat. Try making it over a wood fire. It couldn't hurt. Peasant * [Rating: one star] 194 Elizabeth Street (between Prince and Spring Streets); (212) 965-9511.

       "  'review': \"SIGN of the Dove no longer exists, but it continues to exert a quiet influence on the dining scene. The chefs who spent their formative years there have fanned out across the city to restaurants like Little Dove, Five Points and Cibo, bringing a restrained stylishness along with them. The latest in this crop is Steven Zobel, who spent four years at Sign of the Dove before taking over the stove at one of its sister restaurants, Contrapunto. Now he has his own showcase, Triomphe, in the remodeled Iroquois Hotel in Midtown. It's a tiny stage. The front room is dominated by a curved bar that can accommodate perhaps a half-dozen customers. A wall-size mirror on one side of the main dining room tries to trick the eye into doubling the size of the space. It works. For an instant, you think the room is merely small. In fact, it is minute, barely large enough to accommodate the chocolate and pale-lemon banquette and 11 tables, each adorned with a spare, elegant calla lily or miniature amaryllis. The setting is subdued and adult, with pristine white walls, dark walnut floors and a dome ceiling with precise, crenelated moldings. It is an awkward room, windowless and narrow, but clever decorating has smoothed out the worst of the problems. Mr. Zobel's food, simple and understated, matches the room. He has devised a small menu that abounds in small pleasures supported by big flavors, like the chewy brioche croutons that shore up his rich, vermouth-scented stew of Malpeque oysters, packed with potatoes and leeks, or the brisk, lightly applied lemon emulsion that makes his cured salmon snap to attention. A straightforward rabbit stew, in a viscous Burgundy sauce with pearl onions and cremini mushrooms, turns up an unexpected ingredient: soft buttered crepes that do the work of pasta but in a lighter vein. Mr. Zobel has the talent, even the wit, to put chicken livers in the appetizer slot normally reserved for seared foie gras. Like professional party crashers, the upstart livers pull it off with a certain panache, accessorized with fried leeks and onions, and perfumed with the heady aroma of sherry braising liquid. Again and again, Mr. Zobel quietly strikes the right note. A subtle herb broth nicely underlines the natural sweetness of acorn-squash wontons covered in shavings of Parmesan cheese. Long, wide strips of pancetta, wiggly at the edges, make a natural foil for white beans and Swiss chard, but their salty astringent quality also plays well against the richness of New Zealand lamb chops. Atlantic halibut, although dry on one occasion, comes with some ingenious packaging. Resisting the temptation to overload this meaty fish with a big-gauge sauce, Mr. Zobel pulls back, applying a delicate ginger-chili marinade, then posing the snow-white meat on jasmine rice and surrounding it with grilled leeks. Green curry and lemon grass give a deft Asian spin to tuna, surrounded by potatoes, tofu and haricots verts. When the main ingredient calls for more, Mr. Zobel opens up the flavors. A hefty rib-eye steak comes with fat grilled cepes and a muscular brandy demi-glace, and a thick slab of salmon gets the works: a caviar-dotted beurre blanc, a scattering of grilled shrimp and parsnip whipped potatoes. The very short dessert list stumbles once. The tarte Tatin is achingly sweet, its thin apple slices just a minute away from becoming candied fruit. A much better bet is the poached Bosc pear, primarily because of what comes with it, a deceptively labeled chestnut poundcake that turns out to be a tiny bun split in half, filled with chestnut jam and espresso anglaise and topped with whipped cream. Diners should get the option of skipping the pear and super-sizing the poundcake. It's fortunate that Mr. Zobel consistently hits the mark, because the surroundings impose a certain austerity on the dining experience. The room feels pinched, and the acoustics are surprisingly poor. As Triomphe fills up -- and it takes only a handful of diners to do the job -- the volume rises, and suddenly the place sounds like Les Halles, despite the raised-pinky decor. The wine list does not do justice to the food. It abounds in choices under $40, but at 50 bottles, it makes for quick and not terribly exciting reading. For a bistro, the list is fine. But the food at Triomphe is pitched a little higher than that. It's smart, stylish and a little shy. In a city with flash to spare, Triomphe has a rare commodity: charm. Triomphe ** [Rating: Two Stars] Iroquois Hotel, 49 West 44th Street; (212) 453-4233 ATMOSPHERE: French-American cuisine with global accents, served in an intimate hotel dining room.

       "  'review': \"EVERY Mexican restaurant above the taco-stand level must answer a fundamental question at the outset. Will it take the pledge and swear to serve fine food, with a respect for regional differences and prime ingredients, or will it saunter down the cash-strewn path to Margaritaville? Rosa Mexicano, the Lincoln Center offshoot of Rosa Mexicano on First Avenue, tries to be virtuous. ''As Rosa Mexicano presents classic Mexican cuisine,'' the menu warns, ''some of the popularized Americanized dishes often associated with Mexican food are not included on our menu.'' No burritos here, in other words. No combination platters. Dishes are listed in Spanish first, English second. It all sounds admirably high-minded, but then you hear the slurping sound of a thousand slushy cocktails going down the hatch, the din of euphoric young voices lubricated with premium tequila, and there you are: cruising in an aqua convertible with Jimmy Buffett. But there are worse ways to pass the time. Overall, the cooking at Rosa Mexicano is pallid and dull. It lacks the snap and the vibrancy that make Mexican cuisine approachable and popular. The kitchen seems incapable of getting food to the table hot. The use of spices is timid, and it's hard not to feel that the menu has been smoothed out to avoid giving offense. It's Latin without passion or flair, but with enough bright spots along the way to offer hope. The best comes first. When a guacamole cart comes rolling by, hail it. Specify the degree of hotness you want. Then watch as the cart superintendent constructs a superlative avocado experience, layer by layer, mashing ingredients in the traditional lava-stone molcajete, and achieving the perfect creamy-lumpy balance. It would be tempting, but a mistake, to order ceviche next. There are two varieties, red snapper in a citrus, tomato and jalapeno marinade, and a sweeter mixed seafood ceviche of scallops, baby shrimp and squid marinated in lemon juice, mango, honeydew and red peppers. There is very little margin for error in ceviche. Seafood can wind up either too tough or mushy, and at Rosa Mexicano it usually does. Among other appetizers, flabby ravioli filled with chicken, tomato and onion float serenely in a peculiar sauce made with poblano chilies and Champagne, dotted here and there with islands of melted manchego cheese. For whatever reason, the kitchen seems most successful with deep, earthy flavors. A small appetizer casserole of sauteed mushrooms, tomatoes and onions is flavored with garlic, serrano chilies and the pungent herb epazote. The entire savory mess lies on a moist bed of cornmeal, a neutral layer with just the right counterbalancing sweetness. Huitlacoche (here spelled cuitlacoche), Mexico's renowned corn fungus, shows its dark, smoky splendor after being sauteed with onions, garlic,  chilies and epazote and simply placed on a crisp tortilla chip. The one fish success story among the appetizers is the tacos de pescado, small tortillas filled with crisp pieces of pan-fried lenguado, or rex sole, topped with a tangy lemon-jalapeno dressing. The menu makes a fuss over its main courses from the grill. They are unexceptional. Hefty skewered shrimp, marinated in garlic vinaigrette and served over rice with onions, tomatoes and serrano chilies, are slightly dry but otherwise inoffensive. Tuna makes a better showing. It comes in thick steaklike chunks marinated in achiote and bitter orange and then topped with pickled onions. The nongrilled entrees make, at most, a mildly pleasing impression, except for an appalling lamb shank coated in pasilla, ancho and guajillo chilies and then steamed in a parchment bag. It looks like an oversize, stew-filled beggar's purse. Steaming, strangely enough, does not take the toughness out of the lamb. Red snapper Veracruz style, baked in a tomato sauce flavored with capers, poblanos and green olives, has almost enough personality to linger in the memory, and huitlacoche comes to the rescue once again, this time in the stuffing of a chicken roulade covered in poblano chili sauce. The budin azteca, a layered tortilla pie filled with shredded chicken and cacciota cheese, has a sort of fascinating blandness, like Charles Grodin, that makes it stand out from the featureless landscape of chicken with mole sauce, enchiladas with mole sauce, and shrimp crepes topped with mild chili sauce and melted cheese. Desserts are very sweet and very forgettable, except for the delicia de chocolate, a tall column of velvety mousse resting on a crunchy chocolate and peanut butter disk. The coffee flan, on my first visit, was also an exception: it was the worst I have ever eaten in my life. I ordered it a second time, and it had made a giant leap to mediocrity. David Rockwell's design for the restaurant has a splashy exuberance that's missing from the food. The colors tingle and vibrate, and he outdoes himself in the restaurant's most memorable feature, a glittering blue tile wall with a thin sheet of water running over its two-story surface. Up and down the wall, hundreds of little white plaster divers are deployed in precise ranks, ready to spring outward. Maybe they're trying to jump ship. Rosa Mexicano Satisfactory 61 Columbus Avenue (62nd Street); (212) 977-7700 ATMOSPHERE: Crowd-pleasing Mexican food in a bright, informal atmosphere.

       "  'review': \"MY vote for the hardest-working banana split in town goes to Brasserie 8 1/2. It's a strenuously conceptual dessert, a plateful of allusions, feints and inside jokes, the main one being the almost total absence of banana. From right to left, one encounters a small dome of caramelized banana on a quarter-size sable pastry disk, a medium-size puck of strawberry ice cream topped with strawberry slices and a large stack that begins with caramelized pineapple and ascends, in many chapters, through vanilla ice cream, almond sable, chocolate ice cream and chocolate syrup, with fascinating asides. If a split could sweat, this would be a three-towel production. Signs of overachievement are everywhere on the menu, and it is easy to understand why. The food has to go a long, long way to take anyone's mind off the design. Visually, Brasserie 8 1/2 is a knockout, a double surprise after the design assault unleashed this year at the Brasserie, the other below-ground restaurant operated by Restaurant Associates. If New York thought the last word in descending-staircase glamour had been uttered, it thought wrong. The downward swoosh at Brasserie 8 1/2 is a circular staircase in thick salmon carpeting. Taking a half turn, it winds down through an enormous hole in the floor to a low-slung illuminated onyx bar and an open-plan lounge, where deeply cushioned black leather chairs cluster. The anteroom feels like the departure lounge for the space shuttle. The dining room could be a galactic mess hall, with a white terrazzo tile floor, black leather booths and walls covered in a gray-green silk that looks like brushed steel. At the far end of the room, a stained-glass mural by Leger makes almost no impression. There's too much competition. Julian Alonzo, formerly the executive chef at Cafe Centro, obviously took one look at the playing field and decided that it would take audacity to win the day. The name of the restaurant -- which sounds Felliniesque but actually refers to the building that surrounds it, 9 West 57th Street -- demanded a brasserie menu, but Mr. Alonzo has taken liberties, some inspired, others puzzling and still others downright annoying. A frequently served amuse-bouche manages to be all three at once. Packaged in a V-shaped aperitif glass, it is a hearty, heady oxtail jus thick enough to hold tiny cheese ravioli in suspension. A thick layer of garlicky potato foam sits on top like the head on a pint of Guinness. It is a ravishing dish, in its way, but far too substantial in flavor, texture and portion to qualify as a palate-tickler. Finish it, and you're ready for a scoop of sorbet and the check. The traditional brasserie menu can be seen in a mostly standard raw bar selection (oysters, shrimp, clams), an iced seafood platter and a weekly rotation of specials like bouillabaisse on Fridays and confit of suckling pig on Thursdays. Wednesday deserves a check on the calendar. The plat du jour is a thick slab of Muscovy duck breast, coyly listed as a ''steak,'' with a crisp, golden skin outside, pink, oozing meat inside and a sweet, sticky fig compote on the side. A perfectly fine steak au poivre, mussels mariniere and a wonderfully gamy hanger steak round out the week. Familiar dishes incorporate inventive touches, like poached quail eggs,  which come with a frisee-lardons salad. A side dish of haricots verts, bright green and crunchy, comes with a luxurious coating of macadamia butter, simple but brilliant. A bristling sea urchin shell, balanced on a bed of salt and filled with a hefty chowder of urchin, clams, potatoes, peas and bacon bits, catches the eye and rewards the palate with its interplay of brine and earth. The flourishes can be beside the point, like dried shards of prosciutto, which come with duck steak, or an oxtail marmalade that partners the hanger steak, like a mini-portion of sweet barbecue that wandered over from another recipe. Tempura-fried squash blossoms do not need goat-cheese stuffing. The tempura batter is a mere wisp, the squash blossoms are fresh and flavorful -- what more could anyone ask for? A little less would add up to a little more. As part of the all-out effort, Brasserie 8 1/2 prepares the way for dessert with pre-dessert and punctuates the experience with a post-dessert. Pre-dessert, even at a high-tone French restaurant, often strikes me as overkill. At a brasserie, it seems utterly out of character, but I have to say, the little slice of apple strudel that came my way one evening made me abandon my principles. Topped with shavings of a smoky, nutty, slightly butterscotch aged Gouda, it made a nice little interlude before the tangled mysteries of the banana split. Or the superior sorbets, luscious fig tart, ''reverse'' chocolate souffle (a kind of molten chocolate cake) or the arresting milk-chocolate creme brulee, iced with a rose marmalade and surrounded by candied rose petals like Mena Suvari in ''American Beauty.'' There is a design flaw. The booths in the center of the room are so deep that most waitresses cannot reach the diners on the inside. This fact has produced interesting socioeconomic results. It has placed a premium on male waiters with long arms, who are constantly called on to help. It makes ''pardon my reach'' the mantra for the evening. And it encourages diners to help clear the table rather than watch their waitress suffer. This in turn promotes a feeling of camaraderie and in the end, I suspect, bigger tips. The communal table has probably peaked. The double-wide booth looks like the coming thing. Brasserie 8 1/2 * [Rating: one star] 9 West 57th Street; (212) 829-0812.

       "  'review': \"IN the race to unearth the world's least reclaimable dish, Roc may have scored an upset victory. Meatloaf has gained classic status. Macaroni and cheese can be found in fine Parisian restaurants. Mashed potatoes have been through so many conceptual contortions that they qualify as haute cuisine. It's getting harder to shock. But Roc has succeeded. ''Every Thursday we have spaghetti and meatballs,'' a waiter told me with a sly smile one evening. ''It's a Roc tradition.'' You had to admire the cheek. For many Americans, this is a dish that comes in a can. And how, exactly, does a brand-new restaurant have a tradition? Still, if any restaurant could put the meatballs over, Roc is probably the place. It's a traditional Italian restaurant with a modern sense of style and some lunatic impulses that keep it interesting. It is also maddeningly inconsistent. At its best it delivers very fine food, with that Italian respect for ingredients and strong, clearly expressed flavors that can make simplicity seem like the only virtue worth having in the kitchen. There's an imagination at work, too. The desserts, in particular, roam adventurously beyond tiramisu and cheesecake territory (although both show up on the menu). But then you run into clunkers like the desiccated veal Milanese, a grim piece of meat pounded out to the size of a Ping-Pong paddle, or the appetizer of thin-sliced salmon, swordfish and white anchovies, so harshly marinated that the swordfish takes on the texture of shirt cardboard. Perseverance pays off, however. An appetizer special one night, eggplant Parmesan with breaded buffalo ricotta, sounded foolish and looked it, too: a sloppy slab of eggplant in thick sauce attended by two fat cheese balls. But the eggplant was firm to the bite, the tomato sauce was concentrated and intense, and those cheese balls, with a fine golden crust, were as light as whipped cream. Fried calamari showed the same light touch, coated in the thinnest possible fried batter, entirely oil-free, and surrounded by long tendrils of batter-fried zucchini that melted in the mouth. A pile of frisee lettuce topped with perfectly cooked shrimp and thin-sliced asparagus sounded plain but stood out as one of the most satisfying appetizers on the menu. Main courses waver. There are more than a few old-fashioned dishes done with no particular distinction, like veal scaloppine with mozzarella and prosciutto, or chicken with roasted pepper, herbs and sausage. The grilled rib-eye steak is large, and that's about all you can say about it. But the hefty lamb chop, encased in a crunchy potato crust fragrant with rosemary, stands out from the pack. Braised veal shank in a syrupy veal demi-glace, so tender it slid right off the bone, needed no more than a few slivers of olive to make a memorable main course. I never did penetrate the mysteries of one fish special, fillet of John Dory in a strange, Asian-influenced environment that included snow peas, green beans and squares of steamed pumpkin. The pasta is reliable, whether it's the rich, creamy oxtail ravioli with  butter and sage, the minimal taglierini with chunks of lobster, or a very robust special offered one night, linguine with nuggets of pancetta, sliced fava beans and scallions. It's worth listening to the specials, even though they tend to be numerous and contain twice as many ingredients as any of the other dishes, or so it seems when the waiters reel them off at top speed. In this time of labor shortages, Roc has managed to find that special breed of waiter who can take the order for a table of eight without putting pencil to pad or making eye contact with the diners. The performance becomes truly impressive on a busy night, as diners from the neighborhood drift in and pack the restaurant. The tables are placed close together. The tall ceilings turn clamor into din, and as parties come and go, you can see waiters rolling round table tops back and forth the length of the dining room, barely squeezing by the crowd at the bar. It looks like a sporting event with medieval roots, like the Palio. The waiter who takes your order may or may not reappear in a significant role. It doesn't matter. The food gets there, the wine makes its way to the table, and somehow order emerges out of chaos. The noise level and surging crowds make it tempting to cut and run before dessert. That would be a mistake. The list includes two winning chocolate desserts, a chocolate terrine, just slightly gooey, with espresso sauce and toasted almonds, and a chocolate almond cake, not too sweet, with a texture poised between fluffy and firm. A timely shipment of figs yielded a light cake split in half, filled with fig-mascarpone cream, and surrounded by a sticky pool of fig sauce and ripe plums. (The dessert has been reorganized around red currants, black currants and strawberries.) Roc is as breezy and offhand as its name, an allusion to Rocco Cadolini, who opened the restaurant with Elio Guaitolini of Elio's and other uptown neighborhood spots. Roc wanders heedlessly from one region of Italy to the other, and occasionally walks right off the map. The decor is idiosyncratic, with clean, elegant white walls and gauzy white curtains making a minimalist statement, only to be overruled by the peculiar ceramic knickknacks arranged on shelves around the dining room. It's a funny sort of place, but funny in the right way, with an eccentric side that's hard to resist. Roc * [Rating: One Star] 190A Duane Street (at Greenwich Street); (212) 625-3333. ATMOSPHERE: Pan-Italian with antic touches in a stylish high-ceilinged room that attracts a lively neighborhood crowd. SOUND LEVEL: Very loud. RECOMMENDED DISHES: Shrimp and asparagus salad, fried calamari with crispy zucchini, beef carpaccio with arugula, oxtail ravioli with butter and sage, lamb chop in potato rosemary crust, chocolate almond cake with pear gratin, chocolate terrine with espresso sauce. SERVICE: Surprisingly efficient and responsive, given the rather chaotic atmosphere. WINE LIST: A fairly ordinary list of about 100 mostly Italian and  American wines, with a dozen half bottles. PRICE RANGE: Dinner, appetizers, $7 to $13; entrees, $15 to $30; desserts, $6 to $9. HOURS: Lunch, Monday through Friday, noon to 4 p.m. Dinner, Sunday through Thursday, 4 p.m. to midnight; Friday and Saturday, 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. CREDIT CARDS: All major cards.

       "  'review': \"AT Avra, the fish tour starts just after the aperitifs. It makes for a highly entertaining and educational five minutes, and throughout the evening, you can see Avra's enthusiastic waiters bringing one group after another up to the seafood counter for a brief, meaningful encounter with handsome daurades, soot-colored red porgies, sullen-looking Dover sole and a school of chipper little rougets. The tour combines the best of the Discovery Channel with the pleasure of picking out a pet at Bide-a-Wee. There's no question about it: meeting your fish and picking it out somehow doubles the fun in dinner. They don't worry the fish too much at Avra. Back in the open kitchen, a ball of fire blasts each side of a sea bass or red snapper imprisoned in a grilling basket, and that's about it. The fish gets a squirt of lemon, a drizzling of olive oil and a sprinkling of herbs, then heads to the table. Fresh fish, barely touched, is the selling point here. It's an appealing formula, to which Avra brings its own brand of charm. The restaurant, divided into two large dining rooms on either side of the seafood counter and kitchen, has a spacious, easy feeling to it, and just enough decorative pieces -- Oriental  rugs on the wall, oversize rustic urns on the floor -- to suggest a country taverna without belaboring the point. The waiters, upbeat and friendly, pull off the very neat trick of making each table feel as though inside Avra's protective walls, all worldly cares have ended, all problems can be solved. It is a soothing place. Greek cuisine is a modest thing, a fairly limited catalog of simple pleasures, and Avra gives it honest, honorable representation. It is not a cuisine that rises to great heights, and Avra, wisely, does not try to push it farther than it's meant to go. After suffering through dozens of soggy, tasteless spinach pies all over my beloved neighborhood, Astoria, Queens, I thrilled to the taste of Avra's spanakopita, a flawless layering of good feta cheese, firm spinach and leeks, with crackling-fresh leaves of phyllo dough. The grilled octopus, served simply with onions and red wine vinegar, was thick, firm and meaty. Kolokithi, a big pile of thin, batter-fried zucchini and eggplant slices, came out of the fryer without a drop of oil, ready for dipping in a gutsy, garlicky tzatziki sauce. One surprise on the appetizer list is omos dolmas, pieces of raw tuna, salmon and cucumber enrobed in rice and wrapped in a grape leaf. Sliced on the diagonal, they look like oversize sushi, making them perhaps the world's first triumph of Greek-Japanese fusion. The pieces are dipped in a mayonnaise made from yogurt, garlic and dill. I regarded this experiment with deep skepticism, but it worked. The seafood counter, an eye-pleasing panorama, offers about a dozen fish listed on the menu and perhaps an extra two picked up at the market unexpectedly. The standard species include Dover sole, red snapper, pompano and John Dory, but Avra makes an effort to sell more unusual Mediterranean species, like white bream, blue-spotted bream and pandora. All fish at the counter are priced by the pound. Generally speaking, the smaller fish weigh about a pound and make a good entree-size portion. Larger fish need to be shared by two or three people. The seafood is not limited to the fresh-fish display. Kakavia, the Greek version of bouillabaisse, comes in a large earthenware pot filled to the brim with scorpionfish, clams, mussels and vegetables, in a saffron-scented fish stock. The menu also includes youvetsi, a shellfish stew of clams, mussels and shrimp in a tomato-shellfish broth that's baked with orzo and feta. The broth has a good, acidic bite to it, but the orzo is squishy. There is meat. Not a lot, but it's there. Lamb loin chops, served with lemon potatoes and okra, are tender and flavorful. Chicken is simply grilled and served with fasolakia, or string beans, in a zesty stewed tomato sauce. No one orders dessert in a Greek restaurant expecting anything less than a serious wrestling match with the sugar molecule, which the coffee, thick and sweet, only intensifies. Karidopita, an enormous hunk of spongy walnut cake, seems like the last word in sweetness until you tangle with the baklava. Baklava tends to come in two styles. One is rather dry and light, emphasizing cinnamon and nuts. Avra serves the other -- a heavy phyllo sponge soaked with syrup and served with a side of chocolate ice cream. It makes the yogurt with honey and nuts seem austere. A better bet is galaktoboureko, a thick slab of yellow semolina custard between layers of phyllo dough. ''I'm not a big fan of Greek food,'' an Italian dining partner told me one night at Avra, ''but I'd come back here in a minute.'' Heads around the table nodded assent, for very Italian reasons. They were not eating the most imaginative cuisine in New York, but they were eating well enough, and luxuriating in the happy sensation of total well-being. The fish tour had been a treat, the waiter was by now the table's best friend and if you overlooked that chocolate ice cream with the baklava, all was right with the world. You don't get that every night of the week. Avra * [Rating: one star] 141 East 48th Street; (212) 759-8550. ATMOSPHERE: Simple Greek food, with the focus on fish, in lively, friendly surroundings. SOUND LEVEL: Never too loud to carry on a conversation. RECOMMENDED DISHES: Grilled fish from the seafood counter, spinach pie, grilled octopus, stuffed grape leaves, zucchini and eggplant chips, Greek bouillabaisse, walnut cake, semolina custard.

       "  'review': \"That character caught on an overhead monitor is you, the diner, looking like a videotaped A.T.M. bandit. It snares you as you enter, and throws your image up on the first in a long string of television sets over the bar. As each new diner enters, you get moved on down the line. The video display is just one tip-off that the new Brasserie in the Seagram Building is very different from the original, which opened in 1959 and closed in 1995 after a fire. There's also the bar. The old place did not have one, and if it did, the bar stools would not have looked like space-age saddles. The entry into the sunken dining area is now an event, a Norma Desmond descent on an illuminated glass staircase, and the interior, by Diller & Scofidio, is a two-lapel grabber. Some elements suggest a stripped-down airplane fuselage, others a futuristic diner. The hours have changed too. Nightowls loved the old place because it was open at all hours. The new Brasserie opens at 6:30 A.M. and closes at 1 A.M. The menu does not shock. Luc Dimnet, formerly of Les Celebrites, has kept some of the old standbys, like onion soup, steamed mussels, crepes and omelets. He sticks to the simplicity of the brasserie format with dishes like frisee salad with lardons, Provencal fish soup, and ideally crispy goujonettes of sole, France's contribution to the fish-stick concept. The main courses have a little offbeat touch here and there, like the dried figs and fennel ragout that comes with the roasted monkfish, or the horseradish beurre blanc and salsify meuniere that liven up the salmon, but for the most part Mr. Dimnet plays it straight, with four-square bistro dishes like cassoulet, bouillabaisse, steak frites, rabbit stew and roast chicken with truffled mashed potatoes. The desserts follow the same script, with a mango and banana tarte Tatin sharing the page with chocolate beignets, lemon profiteroles and nougat glace. There's a secret payoff to those overhead video monitors. If you get a parking space out front, you can watch your car while eating. The Brasserie, 100 East 53rd Street, Manhattan; (212) 751-4840.

       "  'review': \"A  GENERATION ago, America was infatuated with the idea of gracious living. It was the Eisenhower-era  consumer-culture equivalent of shibui, a Japanese concept that suggests refinement, visual harmony and an all-over feeling of well-being. It has been superseded, in New York at least, by ''edge.'' Scalini Fedeli has no edge. What it has, instead, is old-fashioned grace. Open the door, and fresh fruit aromas pour out in a fragrant wave. It's a startling welcome, and the source is not hard to find. In the little entryway, strawberries, peaches and pears have been piled high in wooden baskets and copper pans, surrounded by lavish floral displays straight out of House Beautiful. Philippe Collon, the maitre d'hotel, has the looks, the accent and the courtly manner that all maitres d'hotel aspire to, but few achieve. The dining room, with its well-spaced tables and conservative country-Italian decor, is as soothing as massage. Against the front window, tastefully draped with diaphanous white curtains, the ventilating system sends gentle breezes over a small forest of green plants, which sway endlessly throughout the meal. Waiters speak in soft tones. Ordering a zesty aperitif becomes a survival strategy. Without stimulation, you could sink into a doze before the menus arrive. There's plenty of tension behind the scenes, however. Scalini Fedeli means steps of faith, and in this case, it's a leap. The original Scalini Fedeli is one of New Jersey's most highly regarded and popular dining spots, a perennial winner in reader surveys. Michael Cetrulo, its chef and owner, has decided to test that reputation on a more ambitious circuit. It's a doubly audacious move, because, of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, he had to walk into the former Bouley, a four-star dazzler. In this new theater, Mr. Cetrulo puts on a competent but hardly inspired performance. The food is pleasing, for the most part, but it rarely takes flight, and when it does, the dish is likely to be disarmingly simple. A pumpkin risotto, flavored with sage and pancetta and sprinkled with toasted pumpkin seeds and crispy shallots, did not pass what I think of as the firm-handshake test. It was thin and soupy, and the rice, instead of offering resistance to the bite, surrendered unconditionally. Broad lasagnette noodles, colored with squid ink, made a strong visual impression, but they were limp, and the sauce of champagne and porcini mushrooms was overly polite. Mr. Cetrulo does a lovely job, however, with a warm carpaccio of red snapper coated in a lemon-chive oil and scattered with fresh slivers of celery, and it's no wonder why, one evening, he sent out little samples of his pappardelle with a sauce of Scottish hare and venison. It's a cold-weather marvel, a small feast of gloriously rich, dark meats finished off with cream and truffles. The main courses are satisfying, decorous and rather unassuming. A good-size fillet of roasted Patagonian toothfish (Chilean sea bass), for example, found an ideal matchup in a sauce of sun-dried tomatoes and Sicilian and Greek olives, just the right combination of fruit, acidic twang and earthiness for this sweet, fat fish. Saddle of rabbit, swaddled in pancetta and served with a black olive sauce, made a simple, pleasing entree, and the thick, brick-red venison chop, coated with a jet-black pepper crust and served with a potent red-wine reduction, was just the ticket for some of the more serious Barolos, brunellos and amarones on the wine list. The dabs of Gorgonzola that come with it, however, are so pungent that they overpower everything else on the plate. Is it possible for a dessert to flunk the firm-handshake test? Yes. The panna cotta, which comes with a roasted pear and a drizzling of honey, looks solid enough but betrays a deplorable weakness of character at first bite. It takes a back seat to the dense chocolate tart, accented with shavings of sweet-bitter caramelized orange peel, and to the clever miniature cannoli, tubes of crackling phyllo dough that have been painted with chocolate and filled with espresso-flavored mascarpone cream. Food isn't everything. That may sound dismissive, but it isn't. There are dozens of intangibles that go into a meal and contribute to a diner's sense of satisfaction. Scalini Fedeli rates very high on most of these. One evening, when the chef was sending out pre-appetizers of seared scallop, he thoughtfully substituted shrimp for a diner who had ordered a scallop appetizer. Touches like that, added up, create a rosy glow that can color an entire evening. Mr. Cetrulo needs to work on the menu. Everything else feels just about right.

       "  'review': \"THE young couple stood uncertainly in the doorway at I Coppi, an eight-month-old Tuscan restaurant on East Ninth Street near Avenue A. He held a toddler by the hand, she was pushing an infant in a stroller. They had no reservation and the place was full. To the couple, the crowd probably looked like just a lively bunch from the neighborhood. Wrong. Word was out about I Coppi. This was a discerning, well-heeled crowd from all over the city that had come to check out this newcomer. The young couple left, having learned that in New York, casual-looking little restaurants are not always what they seem. I Coppi is already something of a hit, and after three visits, I'd have to say deservedly so. The decor is Italian rustic, with exposed brick walls, low ceilings and lots of wood and terra cotta, including several coppi, the big jars in which olive oil was once stored. That is, coppi is the word used by the folks in Pistoia, Italy, where Lorella Innocenti, an owner of the restaurant, was born. The other owner is her husband, John Brennan, who designed and built most of the restaurant himself. This is Ms. Innocenti's first restaurant, but she has worked in New York for almost 15 years, at such places as Barolo, I Tre Merli, Le Madri and Osteria al Doge. ''But my real mentor is Joe Allen,'' she said. ''Anything that works around here, I learned from him.'' She must have been a good student, having worked her way up to manager of Orso, one of the restaurants Mr. Allen owns on West 46th Street. I Coppi's first chef was Ms. Innocenti's mother, Alberta, who created many of the specials before deciding to live in Italy. Running the kitchen now is Sara Jenkins, who grew up in Tuscany and formerly worked in a restaurant in Florence. Among the best appetizers are a Swiss chard and ricotta flan served with mixed greens, and two cheeses -- sweet Gorgonzola and robiola -- with sliced pears. Ricotta turns up again in an intriguing homemade ravioli with herbs in a butter-sage sauce. And one of Alberta Innocenti's enticing creations is eggplant with besciamella, a lighter version of bechamel, which is served with tomato sauce and is sprinkled with that sublimely full-flavored cheese grana Padano. Another is her soft polenta served between two layers of sauteed wild mushrooms and flavored with ground pork. The best main courses are a revelation. They are robust but subtly different from almost anything on other Italian menus around town. Among them is grilled wild striped bass, with just the right crispness imparted by a wood-burning oven. A grilled pork chop served with mustard greens, and a grilled sirloin steak served rare with arugula and shavings of grana Padano, should keep the steakhouses on their mettle. I particularly liked the lemony veal stew served with sauteed Swiss chard and the rabbit, also stewed, with tomato, herbs and black olives and served with polenta. Polenta is ubiquitous at I Coppi, and that is a good thing. Diners tired of heavy, chewy polenta will find this to be delicate and altogether delightful. I Coppi is also a destination for thin-crust pizzas. There are the classic versions, with tomato, mozzarella and fresh basil; tomato, anchovies and capers, and tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto and arugula. And there are several versions of cofaccini, which is called white pizza and resembles a slightly soft matzoh. Sections of it are served in a basket, with olive oil and garlic, or artichokes or grana Padano cheese and rosemary. No surprises among the desserts, but they do include an intensely rich chocolate almond cake served with thick whipped cream, and a panna cotta that resembles a creme caramel with blood oranges. The nutty, crunchy biscotti come directly from Alberta Innocenti's kitchen in Italy. Mr. Brennan, who owns a woodworking business in midtown, is proud of the bar he built at I Coppi and of the restrooms and wine cellar he installed in the basement. The antique bathroom fittings are worth the trip down the handsome curved staircase, which he has illuminated with candles on every other step. Currently, he is turning the restaurant's minuscule backyard into an outdoor dining area, which should be ready in mid-May, about the same time I Coppi will start serving lunch. Mr. Brennan also has a passion for Tuscan wines, and has put together an interesting list. There are Chianti classicos ranging from $28 to $38, and what he calls ''young, simple, Tuscan table wines,'' which are $18 to $38. On the higher end are some sangioveses and sangiovese blends costing $42 to $110, and so-called Super-Tuscans like Sassicaia and Ornellaia, most of them in five or six different vintages, and ranging from $85 up to $1,000 for a 1985 Sassicaia. I Coppi ** [Rating: Two Stars] 432 East Ninth Street; (212) 254-2263. ATMOSPHERE: Lively, informal, friendly. Lovely country-style room with an open kitchen in the rear. Beautiful bathrooms.

       "  'review': \"ONE has ''a delicate lilac bouquet and pale yellow liquor.'' Another offers ''a hint of smoke among notes of honey and sherry.'' A third is ''brilliant with chocolate.'' Is it port? Perfume, perhaps? No, the flowery eloquence is a small selection from the tea menu at Heartbeat. Is there anything else you need to know about the restaurant? Heartbeat, in the newly renovated W Hotel (it was once the Doral Inn), is part spa, part power-lunch place, part hip new restaurant. The result is a very interesting experiment. Entering the restaurant you walk through a cheerful lounge, which looks something like an urban ski lodge. Early in the evening, when hopeful singles are sprawled in front of the fireplace sipping drinks, reading newspapers or just waiting for something interesting to happen, this is one of Manhattan's liveliest spots. So it is somewhat shocking to walk in and discover a retro dining room with tile-encrusted columns that look like they belong in a 1950's motel. But just as you are registering this you notice something else: The room may be strange, but it is also strangely cozy. With its comfortable seats, civilized sound level and solicitous service, Heartbeat soon wins you over. Then the bread arrives, and with it second thoughts. The rolls are truly horrid, heavy whole-grain lumps that are the edible equivalent of Earth Shoes. The accompanying dip is even worse, a sweet-potato puree with boiled garlic and thyme that is a very poor substitute for butter. Suspecting a trick, you wonder: What can this mean? Indeed, although the menu never gets around to mentioning it, Heartbeat has a gimmick. This is not quite spa food, but the kitchen does not believe in added fats. This approach works best when the food is simply left alone. Chilled oysters with caviar, for instance, need nothing but good ingredients to shine. A dish like sliced raw tuna is also dependent upon the quality of the ingredients, but it is greatly enhanced by the beauty of the presentation. The deep red slices of fish are set on pink and white slices of radish and served on clear plates that look like sheets of ice. Drizzled with a pale green wasabi-yuzu sauce, it looks absolutely lovely. So does mackerel ceviche with a lemon-chervil sauce. Whole roasted quail with a mushroom-and-fig hash is another savory way to start a meal. But the more contrived concoctions just don't work. Wild mushroom ravioli are gummy and dense, and one day they were gritty as well. A salad of roasted root vegetables turns out to be an odd combination of heavy roots like squash, sweet potatoes and carrots around a silly little fluff of salad sprouts. The arborio rice with squash and wild mushrooms is mush to me, and both the lobster with corn milk succotash and the lobster salad with truffles and purple potatoes seem extremely sweet. Fortunately, Heartbeat makes no attempt to be vegetarian. A surprising amount of meat is served, and it is surprisingly fine. The fillet of naturally fed beef tenderloin is particularly good, the meat so tender and flavorful that even the baked potato on the side seems special. Pork tenderloin is also excellent, and roasted baby chicken is tender, moist and served with a delicate pear, apple and goat cheese galette. The kitchen also serves a group of dishes that are called ''Simply Plain,'' which turn out to be exactly as advertised. There is something undeniably striking about a piece of beautifully cooked salmon when it is served, unembellished, on a huge black plate. Should you want to continue to be sensible you can choose bowls of berries for dessert, served with nothing but a little pot of honey-topped yogurt. Or you can shock your system by indulging in a chocolate dome filled with chocolate mousse. Embellished with a scoop of cherry sorbet, it is both rich and pretty. And after a spartan meal, it is also very welcome. The tea sommelier arrives right behind dessert. As he stands by your table with a tray of dried leaves, he lovingly describes the attributes of each. How can you resist him when he shows you jasmine pearl, pale green tips of tea that have been dried among fresh jasmine blossoms and that have traveled all the way from China? Especially when it says, right there on the menu, that the tea sommelier's purpose in life is to help you enhance your own well-being. Heartbeat ** [Rating: two stars] In the W Hotel, 149 East 49th Street, near Lexington Avenue; (212) 407-2900. ATMOSPHERE: New York's hippest spa food brings models to mingle with moguls. SERVICE: Knowledgeable, professional. SOUND LEVEL: Very comfortable. RECOMMENDED DISHES: Sliced raw tuna with radish salad; chilled oysters with caviar; mackerel ceviche with lemon-chervil sauce; whole roasted quail with fig-and-wild mushroom hash; fillet of natural beef tenderloin; mustard roasted pork tenderloin; roasted baby chicken with pear, apple and goat cheese galette; pan-seared skate; grilled paillard of salmon with caramelized cauliflower; simply plain meat, chicken and fish; chocolate dome; bowls of berries; pineapple with passion fruit mousse.

       "  'review': \"''WHY doesn't he go away?'' my friend said crossly one day at lunch. She looked at the captain standing at attention near the table and added, ''I can't stand being watched while I eat.'' If being hovered over is not your thing, Mr. K's is not your restaurant. The fancy new Chinese restaurant is an import from Washington, where people apparently love having waiters dance attendance upon them. For 15 years, Mr. K's captains have cosseted their patrons with old-fashioned amenities like orchid corsages (for the women), specially printed menus (in my experience, offered only to men) and endless hot towels and finger bowls (for everyone). Whether this will prove popular in New York is not entirely certain. It is equally hard to predict whether Mr. K's not-quite-Chinese food, created by the owner, Johnny Kao, will find an appreciative audience here. There are undoubtedly people who love the idea of sitting in palatial pink splendor while waiters in white gloves serve them hot-and-sour soup. Some people will probably eat Peking duck garnished with red cabbage and plum tomatoes with great joy. There must surely be those who applaud the notion of individually plated Chinese food that is not intended to be shared. Others, I am certain, will be charmed when lemon sorbet in tiny silver goblets shows up between courses. But it's been 20 years since sorbet struck me as a mid-meal thrill. And much as I admire the comfort of those big padded chairs, the spaciousness of the banquettes and the graciousness of the service, it all feels slightly silly to me, as if the clock has been turned back. This would not necessarily be a bad thing, if the food did not share that quality. Unfortunately, Mr. K's is serving Chinese food from another American era, a time when people had not yet experienced the real thing. There are a few dishes I appreciate. The Shanghai-style spring rolls, for instance, are extremely crisp, absolutely greaseless and filled with a pale mixture of chicken and shrimp. If only the dumplings were as good. Alas, Lover's Dumplings, filled with pork, ginger and scallions and colorfully topped with ham on one side, smashed peas on the other, turn out to be rather tough. Crisp bits of veal in a soy and chili sauce have the texture of fried cardboard. And Peking duck, which is good at dinner, turns lackluster at lunch; once, the skin was barely crisp. During the daytime, the Peking duck is not even carved at the table, but simply assembled by a white-gloved group of attendants who spread crepes with hoisin sauce, add a few scallions and spoon in the pre-sliced meat and skin of the bird. It is strange to see a restaurant so dedicated to service pass up such a fine opportunity to show off. But it certainly does not miss a trick with the soups, which are good and served boiling hot in little footed tureens. Afterward, the sorbet appears, icy cold and not too sweet. And then the parade of entrees begins. On the menu, the dishes all sound wonderful, and I suppose if you confined yourself to your own individual plate, as Mr. K intended, you might not notice how similar the sauces are. Whether you are eating Firecracker Fish -- fillets in a sauce of onions, sun-dried tomatoes and just the faintest edge of chilies -- or veal Mimosa in an orange and Cointreau sauce, or eggplant in garlic sauce, the sauces are irritatingly sweet. The best dishes are Mongolian lamb, made with very good meat, and tender pork in black pepper sauce. The worst is macadamia chicken, where whole nuts go bobbing through the sauce like tiny white tennis balls ricocheting between tough pieces of chicken. Bland prawns wrapped around asparagus in a plain egg-white sake sauce have all the appeal of spa cuisine. No matter what you order, it will be served with an array of mostly non-Chinese (but organic) vegetables. Some days there are baby carrots, sweet potato puree, tomatoes and haricots verts. Other days there may be a slice or two of lotus root and a few wrinkly long beans. And always there is rice, served in adorable little silver contraptions with roll-back tops and a charmingly old-fashioned air. Desserts, which are not at all Chinese, are served with more showmanship. The captain appears bearing a plate covered with cakes and urges you to try the Louvre, a dome of chocolate with mousse inside, or some other pastry named for a French edifice. The cakes are all good, but to my mind the raspberry-passion fruit tart is the best of the lot. Now it is time for tea and coffee -- and another show. Tea is served in silver pots set atop candles to keep it warm. Coffee is brewed right at the table. Little chocolate mints appear as a finale. As we waited for our coats one afternoon, our captain stood chatting with one of my guests. ''If you come back for a business lunch,'' he told him, ''call ahead and we will print special menus with your name on them.'' The gentleman mused, ''This would be a great place for a business lunch.'' I guess it would be. If you don't mind having an audience. Mr. K's * [rating: one star] 570 Lexington Avenue, at 51st Street; (212) 583-1668. ATMOSPHERE: With its plush, pink Art Deco decor, this is surely the most luxurious Chinese restaurant around.

       "  'review': \"INDIA is a country without a serious restaurant tradition. New York, on the other hand, has evolved its own tradition for Indian restaurants, one that divides them into two basic styles. Some are cheap and cheerful, serving a standard repertory of similar dishes cooked with a standard repertory of similar spices. The others are proud and pompous places where costumed waiters glide across acres of marble to serve food decorated with edible gold. A few stellar establishments, however, stand outside this tradition. The new Chola, I am happy to report, is among them. You know this almost instantly. When you walk in the door, you are assaulted by a blizzard of scents. Sniffing carefully, you can make out the friendly aroma of cardamom, the nervous tang of turmeric and the warmth of ginger. Sniff again and you get onions, garlic and the high note of cumin. Citrus is lurking in there, too, along with a faint, exotic edge of tamarind. Hovering above it all is the delicious perfume of roasting nuts. It smells wonderful. You walk a few steps into the dim room, expecting the usual marble palace. Instead, you find a modest restaurant, a little too dark, perhaps, and a little too crowded. Chola's aroma may be encouraging, but its looks are not. On top of that, it can be uncomfortably warm. Should you have any doubts about staying to eat, order immediately. I suggest starting with Mysore masala dosa, a thin, crisp, lacy crepe stuffed with a hot and fragrant potato mixture and served with two sauces: fresh coconut chutney and a dish of sambar, the spicy, soupy sauce of southern India. You might also consider one of the region's other great inventions, idli. These bland, spongy little steamed cakes, made from a fermented rice and lentil batter, come to life when dipped into sambar and chutney. Uthappam is another appealing starter, a scallion-laced vegetable pancake that is among the great pancakes of the world. Having started in southern India, you might want to continue with a fine dish from Kerala, konju pappas. Shrimp arrive in a chili-laden sauce that is more sweet and tart than hot. You taste tamarind, followed by a whole range of spices; at the very end, your tongue finds coconut. Surprisingly, the crisp, tender little shrimp stand up to this treatment. I like to eat konju pappas with lemon rice, a mixture flavored with mustard seeds and citrus. To my mind, sarson ka sag makes an ideal side dish. The menu says these ''pan fried mustard greens'' are cooked with fresh corn, but although I have ordered the dish three times, I have never been able to detect corn in the savory green puree. Rich with butter, ginger and aromatic spices, it is a delicious dish, clearly not intended for anyone on a diet. Sarson ka sag is a recipe from the northern Punjab region. One of the most appealing aspects of Chola is the sheer breadth of the menu, which allows you to take an edible tour of India. The tandoor, a clay oven that cooks food very quickly at searingly hot temperatures, is another hallmark of the Punjab. Chola offers a full complement of tandoori dishes: chicken, lamb, seekh kebab (lamb sausages) and various breads. The breads, like onion nan, are crisp, light and puffy, but in general the tandoori dishes do not display the kitchen at its best. The whole fish cooked in the tandoor, for instance, tends to be dry and bony, and the tandoori chicken is sometimes over-marinated, making the texture unpleasantly soft. There are, however, some very interesting recipes culled from the Jewish community in Calcutta. These tend to be both sweet and sour, like bamia koota, lamb and okra, which make an intriguing pair, or chicken makmura, cubes of white meat bathed in a rich sweet sauce of nuts and raisins. The vindaloo dishes are a perfect antidote to the sweetness. The menu promises that phall, a legacy of the English, is lamb cooked with fresh green chilies in an extremely hot sauce. They are not exaggerating, and if you like hot food you will be ecstatic. Desserts include the usual Indian restaurant offerings. My favorites are kulfi, a grainy frozen dessert flavored with nuts and saffron, and rasmalai, an addictive, sweet sort of homemade cheese. Best of all, however, is the extraordinary Indian coffee in the style of southern India: strong, milky and sweet. India is a vast nation with a diverse population that practices a number of religions and eats distinctly regional fare. The food is far more varied than that provided by New York's standard Indian restaurants. Chola, happily, joins the few that are trying to offer a glimpse into the complexity of this extremely appealing cuisine. Chola ** [rating: two stars] 232 East 58th Street, near Third Avenue: (212) 688-4619. ATMOSPHERE: Modest and crowded, the restaurant seduces with its aroma rather than its visual appeal.

       "  'review': \"KURT VONNEGUT JR. does not seem happy. The author has been hanging around the entryway of Sparks with the actor Albert Finney and about 20 other hopeful diners. The maitre d'hotel does not seem in the least concerned that we are squashed into an uncomfortable crowd, and he is brusque with those of us who ask when our tables will be ready. After about 20 minutes, Mr. Vonnegut's party leaves, and as I watch the men walk through the door, I find myself wondering if there is another restaurant in America where people of such stature would be kept cooling their heels. In the end, we wait 40 minutes for our reservation, but it is some consolation to know that Sparks does not play favorites. The problem is that it does not play favorites with the steaks either. I have had terrific steaks at Sparks. I have had mediocre ones, too. Sometimes on the same evening. And although lobster is usually excellent, there have been nights when it was a disaster. Late last year, Sparks expanded into the space next door, once occupied by Arcimboldo, and the kitchen seems to be struggling. Hash browns are not always crisp, meat is often overcooked, and almost everything is oversalted. But there are two things of which you can be absolutely certain when you are finally seated: the service will be cheerful, and the wine list will make up for almost everything else. It is, however, possible to improve your odds of getting a great meal at Sparks. I hereby offer these guidelines. * Dine on Saturday night. At Sparks, unlike other restaurants, Saturdays seem slow. You are more likely to be seated immediately, and you are unlikely to be seated next to a group of 13 drunken stockbrokers celebrating their bonuses, as I was one Wednesday night. ''How much did they spend?'' I asked our waiter when the table terrorizing us finally departed. ''Oh, not much,'' he said, flipping open his order pad. ''They only had four double magnums and a bottle of port. Just a couple grand.'' * Don't bring a crowd. Maybe it is just coincidence, but the best meal I had at Sparks was the night I took only one guest. Everything came out piping hot, and both the steak and the lobster were superb. * Watch what others eat. You don't see anyone around you eating hot seafood appetizers, and there is a reason for that. The baked clams are very bready and not very baked. You don't see anyone eating melon either. The appetizers of choice are shrimp cocktail (served butterflied and flat on the plate), lump crabmeat, and a sliced tomato and onion salad. The cognoscenti, you will note, ask to have their tomato salads chopped and topped with Roquefort dressing, which makes a very American and curiously delicious treat. You will also find that many around you are eating asparagus vinaigrette. It is not on the menu, but it is very good. * Stick to plain steak and chops. The menu is filled with froufrou food like medallions of beef in bordelaise sauce, steak fromage (topped with Roquefort cheese) and beef scallopine (sliced fillet with peppers and mushrooms). The kitchen seems to have utter contempt for someone wanting anything so effete, and neither the meat nor the sauce is on the same level as the straightforward dishes. Incidentally, the most reliable dish I have found is lamb chops, which are always delicious. * If you want seafood, have lobster. Lobster at Sparks is usually reliable, although once it was so tough I wish I had sent it back. Fish are treated as if they were silly intruders, and those who order chunks of lobster meat and broiled shrimp in lemon butter sauce are going to get what they deserve. This is, after all, a steakhouse. * Don't be embarrassed to send it back. The steaks are prime and aged in a combination of wet and dry aging. The quality varies, and you can only pray you will get one of the great ones. But you don't have to pray about the cooking; if it is not as you like it, ask the waiter to take it back to the kitchen. If you ordered rare meat, you shouldn't have to eat it well done. * Don't expect much from the hash browns. Unfortunately, I have never had a great plate of hash browns at Sparks. They should be crisp on the outside, soft within and very hot. I wonder if the kitchen even knows how to make them? Buttered spinach, on the other hand, is bright green and delicious. * Drink your dessert (unless you're having cheesecake). Skip the tartuffo, the berries and the ice cream, and note that there are terrific ports, Sauternes and late-harvest wines that would make a very sweet ending to the meal. * Confirm your reservation. Sparks can be very casual when you call. I once made a reservation for Sunday night only to show up and discover that the restaurant was closed. Sparks, it turns out, is never open on Sunday. Sparks Steak House * [rating: one star] 210 East 46th Street, near Third Avenue, (212) 687-4855. ATMOSPHERE: Even though the rooms are filled with big pieces of antique furniture and the walls are lined with gilt-frame paintings of the Hudson River School, it still feels like a casual, two-fisted, down-to-earth place. SERVICE: Brusque at the door, very solicitous at the tables. SOUND LEVEL: Loud. RECOMMENDED DISHES: Shrimp cocktail, crabmeat cocktail, chopped tomato and onion salad, asparagus vinaigrette, lamb chops, prime sirloin steak, steamed lobster, cheesecake. WINE LIST: Large, impressive, extremely reasonable. PRICE RANGE: Appetizers, $6.50 to $15.50; main courses, $19.95 to $89.95 (for a five-and-a-half-pound lobster).

       "  'review': \"THE soft white custard has the texture of overwhipped cream. It gives, gently, when you dip your spoon into the bowl, allowing a bit of fragrant steam to escape. In the mouth it is warm and savory, not sweet, with the comforting character of chicken soup. It is the most lovable food you can imagine. At least until you hear its name: ''bean curd dregs'' hardly conveys the utter deliciousness of this amiable fare. And ''bean curd restaurant'' cannot adequately express how exciting the eight-month-old Cho Dang Gol can be. On the one hand, it is just another small Korean restaurant among the many huddled together in the West 30's. On the other, it serves uniquely rustic food that is very different from what is available in the surrounding blocks. This is not your typical Korean barbecue restaurant, nor does it have the encyclopedic menu of the fancier establishments. The specialty here is fresh soybean curd, made daily at the restaurant. ''Oh,'' one Korean-born friend said, closing her eyes after the first bite, ''I haven't had this taste in my mouth since my family left our village.'' Cho Dang Gol seems to understand that it is offering Proustian epiphanies to many of its guests; the kitchen makes each dish with extreme care. Even the panchan, the little saladlike appetizers that Korean restaurants bestow upon their customers, are of remarkably high quality. They change with each meal, but they are always fresh-tasting, with a distinct range of flavors. There may be pickled turnips, leaves and all, red with chili peppers, or sliced marinated broccoli stems that snap appealingly when you bite into the bits. Shredded daikon is crisp and bland, especially against the tiny, silvery, pungent fish in the adjacent dish. The colors are vivid, from bright green to deep maroon, and the flavors so clear that a few bites make you very, very hungry. For the uninitiated, searching out the best dishes is not easy. The menu has a back page offering the most familiar Korean dishes. They include soi-kal-bi and bul-go-gi, the marinated, grilled beef dishes. The meat is tender and tasty, but if Korean barbecue is what you are after, you would be better off eating in a restaurant equipped with table grills. You can find hae-mool pa-jun, the appealing seafood-filled pancake, in every Korean restaurant in town; some places even call it pizza. The point of eating at Cho Dang Gol is to order the dishes that are uniquely the restaurant's. To do this, search the menu for the term ''doo-boo'' -- Korean for ''bean curd,'' and the restaurant's name. Some dishes are not listed in English. On the far left side of the menu, you will find appetizers like doo-boo dong-ki-rang-deng, puffy little rounds the size of silver dollars made of tofu and filled with shredded vegetables and bits of beef. They are so soft and light that they seem to vanish as your mouth closes around them. Doo-boo kam-ja-jun, a sort of potato pancake, is also very appealing, floppy little circles folded over a filling of tofu and vegetables. My favorite dish is at the top of the middle column, cho-dang-gol jung-sik. It arrives in three bowls: one filled with rice dotted with beans, another with those comforting bean-curd dregs and the third with a pungent soup-stew containing pork, seafood, onions and copious amounts of chilies. Together they make an absolutely satisfying meal. I love chung-kook-jang, too, soybean-paste stew with an elemental flavor. ''Pure peasant food,'' another Korean-born friend said, ladeling the bean mixture over rice, ''our version of rice and beans.'' She took a bite and added, ''Doesn't this make you feel healthy?'' Yes, it did. In fact, the only dish I have found at Cho Dang Gol that did not have that effect was boo-dae-jun-gol, one of the hot pots listed on the right side of the menu. The waiter recommended it highly, but when it arrived it was filled with what seemed to be sliced hot dogs and Spam. These highly prized foods joined the Korean table in the 1950's, courtesy of the American Army, and I suspect the taste has to be acquired. I would far rather eat doo-boo doo-roo-chi-gi, a combination of pork, pan-fried kimchi, clear vermicelli and big triangles of bean curd whose edges crisp as they sit on the hot platter. Or mo-doo-boo oh-jing-uh bok-um, squid and bean curd on a similar sizzling platter. I never tire of cho-dang-gol jae-yook bo-ssam, the restaurant's finger food. A plate piled high with leaves of lettuce is accompanied by thin strips of grilled, marinated pork and kochujang, the soy, garlic and chili paste that is one of the essential Korean seasonings. You spread the kochujang on a leaf, add pork and roll it all up to make an irresistible sort of Korean taco. To me it makes a perfect final flavor. Cho Dang Gol is not a fancy restaurant. But if you are like me, you will find that it takes only one visit to make you start waking up in the middle of the night, yearning for bean-curd dregs. Cho Dang Gol ** [rating: two stars] Cho Dang Gol, 55 West 35th Street, (212) 695-8222. ATMOSPHERE: In the very back of the long, spare room you can see cooks in the open kitchen making fresh soybean curd. SERVICE: Very helpful. SOUND LEVEL: Good.

       "  'review': \"WHAT do you suppose a plate of spaghetti with olive oil, garlic and peppers costs a restaurant? Let's give the place the benefit of the doubt and assume the kitchen is using the very best olive oil, organic garlic lovingly coaxed from the earth, the finest imported pepper flakes and handmade pasta. Even at that, it is hard to imagine how the ingredients could possibly cost more than a dollar or two. So any restaurant charging $17 had better deliver an extraordinary experience. And that is the problem with Il Cantinori: it rarely does. When the restaurant opened, it was one of the first to serve authentically spare Tuscan fare. I remember the thrill of sitting down to a meal that mirrored what Tuscans call the sincerity and serenity of their food: a dish of white bean soup, a plate of roast pork, a few potatoes cooked with garlic, rosemary and fragrant olive oil. In a world of red sauce, it was a revelation. But that was 15 years ago. Since then Tuscany, like Provence, has become a place whose name evokes romantic fantasies in the American diner. Unfortunately, Il Cantinori has become just another restaurant trading on the image. It certainly looks like the real thing, a charming rustic room with terra-cotta floor tiles, white walls and big, striking sprays of flowers.  There are exposed beams, white table cloths, a fine antipasto display in the front. Yes, this could be Italy. The antipasto's not bad, either. Most nights there are perfectly grilled vegetables and a fine assortment of mushrooms and well-cooked beans. Maybe the mozzarella is not as good as it might be, but still, it is an attractive plate. At least until the bill comes; one night when I asked our waiter to assemble a plate of assorted antipasto for the table, the bill came to $13 a person. I was, truly, shocked. Other appetizers can be equally shocking: calamari, for instance. At a recent dinner, the squid was grilled into toughness and topped with chopped tomatoes that did not have much flavor. The same night, tuna carpaccio swathed in a pesto vinaigrette was equally unsuccessful. The balance was off; too much pesto and not enough vinaigrette muddied the taste of the fish. Pasta e fagioli, a bowl of bean soup, cost an astonishing $9.50. It was adequate, but not more than that. But pasta, on the right night, can be superb at Il Cantinori. A few months ago, I was served pappardelle with a sauce made from Tuscan pot roast and its cooking liquid; it was rich, deeply flavorful, satisfying. Tagliolini with zucchini was beautifully done. And yet at the same meal a plate of pasta al pesto with beans was swimming in an oddly creamy sauce. Main courses display the same disconcerting inconsistency. Meat tends to be handled with incredible care. I was recently served the best piece of calf's liver I can remember having in a restaurant, the meat sliced paper thin and carefully cooked in brown butter and sage. Tender and extraordinarily flavorful, without a hint of the bitterness so often found in liver, it was a perfect example of Tuscan cooking: good ingredients cooked simply and with care. Scaloppine of veal was impressive, too, the veal so gently cooked it needed no knife, nestled against bright green leaves of spinach. And one night filet mignon in a three peppercorn and cream sauce was a reminder of everything that is wonderful about beef. Osso buco can also be a delight, although the risotto served with it (unattractively called ''rice stew'') is often soggy. But fish can be a problem. I have had red snapper, simply served with olive oil and lemon, which was a delight to eat. But a few weeks ago, I was served an unattractive plate of scallops in lemon and butter. On the same night, sea bass in tomato sauce had so little flavor it might have been any random protein. But whenever I am tempted to write the restaurant off, I remember that superlative pappardelle with pot roast sauce. I sit at other restaurants eating tough, bitter calf's liver, and the memory of Il Cantinori's ethereal liver floats into my mind. I recall the taste of biscotti, especially the chocolate ones with just the faintest hint of pepper in the aftertaste. And I go back, hoping that the kitchen will have triumphed over it troubles, hoping for a meal that is spare, simple and satisfying. Because the truth is that I am perfectly happy to pay $17 for a plate of spaghetti with olive oil and garlic if it reminds me of eating in a Tuscan hill town. And I know that Il Cantinori, at its best, is capable of transporting me to Italy. If only it would. Il Cantinori * [rating: one star] 32 East 10th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-6044.

       "  'review': \"''PLEASE don't embarrass me. Promise that you'll eat everything, even if it seems weird. Don't forget to buy the sushi chef a drink. And if he offers you the salmon skin, be sure to express your undying gratitude.'' My first encounter with sushi, 30 years ago, made me feel as if I were being inducted into a secret society. The man who took me to that first meal had spent many years cultivating a sushi chef, and he was worried that I would ruin the relationship. As we drove to the restaurant, he briefed me on the ritual. By the time he was done, I was terrified: there were so many rules! I was to eat the sashimi with chopsticks. When I put them down between bites, I was to lay them directly in front of me on the chopstick rest, parallel to the edge of the counter. It was permissible to eat sushi with my fingers, but only if I picked up each piece by the far end, so I could flip the fish into the soy sauce. Under no circumstances should the rice touch the soy sauce; my friend repeated this injunction several times. I was to avoid asking for a single piece of sushi. (One slice, my friend informed me, is a pun on the words ''to kill a man'' and is considered bad luck.) And afterward, I was supposed to ask the waitress, not the chef, for the bill. I was nervous all through the meal. But I avoided making any egregious mistakes, and at the end of the meal the itamae-san bestowed the broiled salmon skin upon me. I was properly grateful. All that came back to me the first time I ate at Blue Ribbon Sushi. The experience was so utterly different from my first sushi adventure that it gave me pause. As Americans adopted sushi, we adapted it as well, discarding those parts of the traditional rituals that made us uncomfortable. Blue Ribbon Sushi has good fish and an awesome list of sakes, but beyond that it has very little in common with a classic Japanese sushi bar. If you have ever felt like a clumsy foreigner and worried about doing the wrong thing in a sushi bar, this is the place for you. The major change is in the relationship between the sushi chef and the customer. In a traditional sushi restaurant the best seats are at the counter, right in front of the senior sushi chef. But it doesn't matter where you sit at Blue Ribbon Sushi. The three busy chefs behind the counter might just as well be in the kitchen. They do not talk to the customers. They do not even look at them. Even those who are seated at the sushi bar place their orders with a waiter. You are better off at a table, which has the comfort advantage. You will have to wait for a table, but you'll have to wait for any sort of a seat at Blue Ribbon Sushi, which takes no reservations. As a result, the one person you will develop a relationship with is the maitre d'hotel, an amiable man who handles one of New York's most difficult jobs with extraordinary grace. He seems truly apologetic to keep you standing in the cramped front of the restaurant for an hour, awkwardly balancing a cedar box of cold sake. And he seems delighted when he is finally able to hand you a menu. The menu is enormous, and I have liked almost everything I've tried, from a pretty seaweed salad to broiled yellowtail collar. But the high point of the meal is always sushi and sashimi. You find them listed on the second page, priced by the piece (no superstition here), helpfully divided between fish from the Atlantic and fish from the Pacific. These categories are not entirely accurate, but that's a minor point. For although the quality is not so high as that in the best traditional sushi bars, the sheer variety is enormous. That makes Blue Ribbon Sushi an excellent place to try new sorts of sushi. If you have been curious about the difference between freshwater eel (unagi) and sea eel (anago), why not try it here? You might also taste the difference between hamachi (farmed yellowtail) and kanpachi (the wild sort). The chefs do interesting things with aji (horse mackerel), serving the flesh as sashimi and then taking the bones away to be fried until they crunch deliciously beneath your teeth. Wonderful little sea scallops, oysters and spiny sea urchins are all served in their shells. The sushi chefs are at their best when inventing interesting specials like an appealing roll filled with fried oysters. And unfettered by tradition, they create unusual special platters filled with whatever happens to be best that day. Just name the price you want to pay and let them amaze you. The restaurant also has vegetable rolls for vegetarians and meat rolls (filet mignon, lamb, even pigeon) for carnivores. And should you be in the mood for salmon skin, you don't have to impress anyone to get it. All you have to do is order it.

       "  'review': \"IN my family the holidays meant two things: We went to see ''The Nutcracker.'' And we had the annual argument about steak. ''Where should we eat afterward?'' Mom always began. ''The Palm,'' my brother would shout. It was, and is, his favorite restaurant in the world, and his idea of a perfect place to celebrate. My mother, however, hated it. ''They throw the food at you,'' she always complained. She did not have any fonder feelings for my favorite, Peter Luger. As I praised the quality of the steak she said very little. But when I had finally wound down she would say, ''But everything else is awful,'' in a voice that broached no argument. Then my father weighed in with a vote for Gallagher's because he loved the rich history of the place. ''You can't eat atmosphere,'' Mom would sniff. In the end we always forgot about steak and went out for something else instead. Too bad Smith & Wollensky was not around. It is only 20 years old, but it has become the most consistent of New York's steakhouses, and the only one that could possibly have pleased everyone in my family. Although I still prefer the steak at Peter Luger I have to admit that the meat at Smith & Wollensky is dry aged and very, very good. When you order the sirloin rare, it arrives gorgeously cooked, cool in the middle, charred and slightly grainy on the outside. The sirloins are aged for around two weeks to concentrate and intensify the flavor and give the meat a dry edge, but if you like your meat with the funky, mineral tang of more age you are in luck. The special rib-eye steak, which is aged for a third week, is not on the menu, but the kitchen almost always has a few on hand. It can be had grilled or blackened, although I have a hard time understanding why anyone would want to cover up the taste of meat this good. My brother, who goes to steakhouses primarily to eat lobster, would have to admit that the ones at Smith & Wollensky are perfect specimens. And unlike so many other New York steakhouses, the waiter does not arrive at the table announcing that lobsters are $16.50 a pound and, by the way, the smallest one in the house weighs 22 pounds. As for atmosphere, Smith & Wollensky may not have the eccentric ugliness of Palm or the Damon Runyon airs of Gallagher's, but it has a no-nonsense down-to-earth plainness. This is a place for two-fisted eating. The maitre d'hotel is pleasant, even under the pressure of a holiday crowd, and the waiters are pros who do not think they have to be rude to earn their keep. They won't tell you their names or entertain you with jokes, and they fawn over no man (or woman). Dad would have liked that. But the real reason to rejoice about Smith & Wollensky is that almost all the food is good. My mother, in other words, would have found much to make her happy. I imagine Mom would have started her meal with an order of raw clams. They have a fine, bracing quality. Oysters are excellent, too. In fact, all the seafood cocktails are impressive, from the unadorned pile of crab meat to the tender shrimp, which arrive horizontal and not chilled into flavorlessness. I hope my mother would have avoided the rather silly salad, which is embellished with chunks of bacon and pieces of potato. It is certainly not the thing for a real lover of greens. The crab cakes are another disappointment, thin, expensive and almost entirely devoid of crab flavor. But grilled fish is another matter. When you order fish in most steakhouses you know that the person who cooked it considered it a hated chore. ''Miserable sea creature,'' you imagine him mumbling as he flips your fillet. But someone at Smith & Wollensky must like fish; you can order a piece of swordfish knowing that it will actually be edible. Chicken is treated with equal respect, grilled and served with sauteed pepper, and the kitchen does very well with liver, cooking it to perfection and embellishing it with bacon and onions. I can't say the same for veal Milanese; it is just a big flat, thoroughly breaded thing that might as well be cardboard for all the taste it has. Side dishes are impressive. I love the creamed spinach; it is rich and delicious and, best of all, seems entirely lacking in nutmeg. Onion rings are cooked in clean oil, and the hash browns, while they rarely achieve perfection, are very good. Desserts, unfortunately, leave a great deal to be desired. The lemon tart is topped with a meringue containing so much sugar that it is positively gritty. The profiteroles are a little tough. Carrot cake seems like an anachronism best left in the past. As in most steakhouses, cheesecake turns out to be the best bet. But the worst part of the meal is still ahead: collecting your coat. This time of year the restaurant is so packed that getting to the coat room is a trial. Clearly my family is not the only one that thinks the holidays are a fine time for steak. Most people, I guess, skip the argument. Smith & Wollensky ** [rating: two stars] 797 Third Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 753-1530.

       "  'review': \"SOME restaurants fit so perfectly into their neighborhoods that it is almost impossible to imagine a time when they were not there. Payard Patisserie and Bistro, to take one recent example, is only a couple of months old, but it is already hard to remember where the Upper East Side ladies lunched before it opened. Nick & Toni's Cafe is its mirror image: although it has a completely different atmosphere, the five-month-old restaurant fits so seamlessly into the low-key streets of the Upper West Side that it seems to have been there forever. Which is surprising: Who would have expected that an offshoot of the hottest place in the Hamptons would  play so well just off Columbus Avenue? But the owners, Jeff Salway and Toni Ross, have used the slight scruffiness of their small West 67th Street outpost to good advantage. It is resolutely not hip, not chic, not terribly trendy. It seems more a place to drop into for a bite than a reservation restaurant, and only a very discerning eye will notice that the details are impeccable: the copper-topped bar, bucolic murals and wood-burning oven near the door give the room a cozy air. Everything plays against pretension, from the bread sticks casually served in water glasses to the simple printed sheet of paper that serves as the menu. Sometimes the casualness goes too far: the service is so relaxed it can seem nonexistent. The one thing that is not haphazard, however, is the food: it is glorious, simple, delicious. Nick & Toni's starts with good ingredients and leaves them alone. One of my favorite dishes of the year is the restaurant's mussels ''brule-doigts,'' a classic French bistro dish of mussels roasted in the wood oven until the shells become papery and so hot they burn the fingers. It is painful to part the blue-black shells to get at the plump mussels bursting with juice. It is worth it. The menu changes constantly, but there are a few perennials, like the impeccable Caesar salad -- crisp, lightly dressed, perfectly pungent. Often, there is a fine pasta with just the right number of baby clams. Most times, too, there is a baby chicken roasted in the wood oven until the skin crackles and the flesh is moist and silken. The bacon-garlic potatoes on the side are an irresistible bonus. There is usually a grilled rib-eye steak as well, with home-made potato chips. It is not the best steak you have ever eaten, but it is chewy, flavorful, very satisfying. Looking around the small room, you see people hunched over their food, really enjoying it. Mothers come early in the evening, children in tow, to order pastas and potatoes. That is the time when you find single men drinking wine by the glass (the selection is appealing), alternately engrossed in their books and their plates. The groups arrive later, fresh from the movie theater around the corner, arguing passionately about what they have just seen. This is so clearly not a see-and-be-seen sort of place that when the movie stars arrive (and they do), everyone politely ignores them by studiously looking in the other direction. This New York nonchalance leaves you free to spill the sauce from the rich and cheesy penne rigate with ragu all over your shirt. You can drown in the delicious Ligurian fish stew (cooked with tomatoes and oregano) and eat the frito misto di mare with your fingers. Should you choose a pizzetta, an individual pizza that may be topped with clabbered cream and salmon or with late tomatoes and shrimp, you can eat that with your fingers, too. Desserts tend to be simple and seasonal. Spring saw bowls of berries served with nothing more than clabbered cream. Late in the summer, a trifle made with huckleberries, raspberries and strawberries was swathed in billows of whipped cream. This time of year there is almost always an apple crisp (it's good for sharing) and creme brulee. Nick & Toni's is a lot like the neighborhood it serves: casual, crowded and noisy. But there is one thing that sets it apart from most of the neighborhood's restaurants: The food is really delicious. Nick & Toni's Cafe ** [rating: two stars] 100 West 67th Street, (212) 496-4000. ATMOSPHERE: Small, casual and crowded, the room is warmed by the fire in the wood-burning oven. SERVICE: Often distracted. SOUND LEVEL: Very noisy when full.

       "  'review': \"EVERY time I eat caviar I think of M. F. K. Fisher. The second time I visited America's most famous food writer in Sonoma, Calif., where she was living in the early 1970's, I scraped together enough money to buy a small tin of caviar. It was a very small tin, but it was caviar, and I imagined that with sufficient creme fraiche and toast and chopped eggs and onion, it would feed a roomful of people. When I presented this opulent offering, Ms. Fisher stared at it for a moment and said, ''Oh, lovely, a couple of spoonfuls.'' Since then, whenever I can, I request my caviar that way, too, unadorned and by the spoonful. If you like that idea, you will appreciate the tiny, moderately priced spoons at Caviar Russe, a luxurious caviar parlor, which opened on Madison Avenue in June, brimming with adorable mother-of-pearl spoons and antique silver caviar dispensers. There is something otherworldly about these two deliberately old-fashioned rooms tucked away at the top of the stairs. Ornately carved, white moldings, glittering chandeliers and a robin's-egg-blue ceiling combine with murals from a Russian fairy tale to give the room a look somewhere between the splendor of Versailles and the cozy sweetness of Mary Poppins. Most nights the people sitting in the commodious booths are couples intent on celebration. The service is murmuringly solicitous, which makes this a fine place for that sort of thing. But there is another side of Caviar Russe: it is one of New York's nicest places to eat alone. There is usually a woman or two sitting at the counter, chatting with the chef and treating herself to caviar. Most afternoons a couple of lone lunchers can be found in the dining room, intent on their own pleasure. One day, a man from the South, who had become a regular during his week in New York, was there. As he drank his vodka (the list offers an awesome global tour of clear potent liquors), he needled the waiter with friendly familiarity. ''I love this place,'' he said expansively. The woman a few tables down smiled softly to herself. The sun poured in the window, illuminating her thick dark hair as she sipped a glass of good Champagne and ordered a tiny taste of five sorts of caviar. They arrived on a long rectangular tray, miniature mother-of-pearl spoons holding a glistening mound of roe. She tried the sevruga first, and then the osetra, golden osetra, kaluga and beluga. She considered for a moment and summoned the waiter to order a serious portion. ''Osetra,'' she said, finally, ''I'll have 50 grams of osetra.'' And she did, eating happily, as if not quite trusting her own good luck. The osetra at Caviar Russe is especially fine, mild, a bit fruity, very low in salt. She went on to beef tartare, a great lump of ground steak topped with a smaller lump of caviar. ''Ah,'' she said, as she took her first taste. I could understand her happiness; the steak tartare is extraordinarily good, well-marbled, aged beef, perched on a snappy salad of beets, parsley and marinated mushrooms. The woman looked content. Ms. Fisher, I am sure, would have approved: the woman was treating herself like a guest. Caviar Russe encourages that sort of behavior. And although caviar is the main point, you need not indulge in the straight stuff. The chef, Scott Skey, who worked with Wayne Nish at March, has created an entire menu of small delicate dishes in which caviar plays only a supporting role. These include delicate chilled oysters topped with beluga caviar, and little shot glasses filled with cold potato soup and topped with caviar. The lobster roll, a perfectly cooked lobster claw set into a piece of cream-puff dough with caviar on top, is also an irresistible little morsel. The menu is small; even the $75 prix fixe meal pretty much concentrates on caviar. But there are a couple of impressive dishes that eschew fish eggs altogether. The best of them is a crayfish, sweetbread and artichoke stew, a blend of subtle flavors that work especially well together. The chowder is also rich and delicious, a luxurious mixture of crab meat, corn and oysters that is edged with lime juice and embellished with sage. Desserts, I am sorry to report, are a disappointment. They are ornate, expensive and after the caviar, something of a letdown. So, I might add, are the blinis, thin, listless crepes with very little character. All the more reason, of course, to eat your caviar with a spoon. Caviar Russe ** [rating: two stars] 538 Madison Avenue, near 54th Street, (212) 980-5908. ATMOSPHERE: The dining room is as cozy and elegant as a jewel box, and the smoking room across the way, with its fireplace and plush sofas, is utter luxury. SERVICE: As solicitous as it should be in a place as expensive as this. SOUND LEVEL: Extremely pleasant. Recommended dishes: Caviar by the spoon and the gram; chilled potato soup; chilled oysters with beluga; lobster and caviar profiterole; caviar coulibiac; steak tartare with caviar; oyster and crab chowder; seafood extravaganza; crayfish, sweetbread and artichoke stew. WINE LIST: Concentrates on Champagne and vodka, with a few expensive big-name wines thrown in. No bargains. PRICE RANGE: Appetizers, $7; caviar tastes by the small spoonful, $4 to $7; main courses, $16 to $47; desserts, $12. Prix fixe dinners, $55 and $75; afternoon tea, $20.

       "  'review': \"FOR his first trick, your waiter will ignore your wine request and urge you to have the 1993 Chianti Classico Riserva from Antinori. ''It is,'' he will assure you, ''the best wine on our list.'' Presenting the bottle with a flourish, he will decant it into an enormous stenciled glass pitcher. Later, if you are lucky, he may even confide that he has already sold 30 bottles tonight (at $50 each). For his next trick, he will appear at the table with a hunk of Parmesan cheese and hack off a few pieces. With a wave of his hand, he will then cover the table with small offerings: plates of salami, bowls of garlicky, oil-drenched zucchini and bruschetta with tomatoes. If he is in a good mood, he may also produce baskets of warm garlic bread. The show continues with a soulful recitation of specials. Later, there will be a marvelous change of tablecloth, a feat your waiter accomplishes without disturbing a single dish. For his final act of the evening, he will carefully carve oranges and strawberries to make them look like flowers. At Il Giglio, each meal is a performance. Once upon a time New York City was filled with Italian restaurants, just like this one. Fast-talking waiters in fancy clothes held court in nondescript rooms, terrifying their customers with long lists of specials, entertaining them with tricks and interrupting endlessly to ask about the food. It wasn't very good, but nobody noticed. At Il Giglio, the food is still not very good. But judging by the restaurant's popularity, nobody seems to mind. There are two reasons for this. The first is that the experience of being in this nine-year-old restaurant is such an old-fashioned thrill that the food is easy to overlook. More importantly, by the time most people have eaten all those delicious little nibbles at the beginning of the meal, dinner has become entirely irrelevant. The chunks of Parmesan are grainy and good. The zucchini is satisfyingly swollen with garlic, oil and vinegar. The garlicky tomato bruschetta is very refreshing, and the salami really gives you something to chew on. It is wonderfully welcoming to sit down at the end of a hard day and find so much good food before being obliged to look at a menu. And the menu is not, truth be told, much to look at. You've seen it all before: the prosciutto and melon, the clams oreganato, the veal scaloppine in a thousand different guises. And so you listen carefully when the waiter comes to recite the specials of the day. These do not turn out to be significantly more exciting. On my last visit, there was pappardelle with mushrooms, onions and little sausages in the shape of meatballs. The pasta, swimming in tomato sauce, was overcooked to the point of mushiness. Still, it was better than the equally overcooked rotelle with capers, tomatoes and shrimp. The best pastas I have tried at Il Giglio were a deliciously simple spaghettini carbonara and some achingly rich mushroom and truffle ravioli adrift in an ocean of cream. While it is possible to get decent pasta at Il Giglio, the farther the menu strays from Italy, the better the food. The veal scaloppine dishes are adequate (my favorite is the one with artichokes), but the veal chop, its bone swathed in ribbons of aluminum foil, is a far better bet. The rack of lamb is better still, eight tiny, tasty chops arranged like the spokes of a wheel around a centerpiece of potatoes. Vegetables are also best when they are not Italian. The salads are lovely. Spinach and asparagus are fine. But the broccoli rape is absolutely dreadful, a mouthful of greens so harsh and bitter that swallowing becomes a trial. If this were 40 years ago, the waiters would walk around the restaurant whipping up zabaglione in copper bowls. But that particular piece of theater is no more; at Il Giglio the zabaglione is served cold over berries. Other dessert choices include tartuffo (a silly extravaganza of ice cream, fruit and chocolate), slices of Italian cheesecake and extremely sweet sorbets. They all pale compared to the great fruit performance. ''Some fruit, perhaps?'' the waiter will inquire. Nod your head, and he will come to the table bearing peeled oranges, berries and the largest kiwi ever grown. Rolling up his sleeves, he picks up a knife and sets to work. First he laboriously slices the orange into golden sections. Then he peels the kiwi. He carves the strawberry into a lily. Finally, with the concentration of a true artist, he arranges the fruit on the plate, adds strips of marinated orange peel and anoints his creation with Grand Marnier.  ''Arte,'' he says proudly, presenting the plate. You think for a moment that you really have gone back in time. At least until the bill arrives. Il Giglio * [rating: one star] 81 Warren Street, near Greenwich Street, TriBeCa, (212) 571-5555. ATMOSPHERE: Small and nondescript, Il Giglio is notable for excess: There is too much food on the table and too many people in the room. SERVICE: Every meal is a piece of theater: the waiters never stop performing. SOUND LEVEL: Despite the crowds, the noise is never annoying.

       "  'review': \"The huitlacoche craze swept across Southern California 15 years ago. It was a time when people liked to brag about eating things others had never heard of, and this corn fungus, which is an honored Mexican ingredient, was considered a coup. It was spoken of in reverent tones, as if a great new American truffle had just been discovered. Never mind that it wasn't very tasty. Maybe it was too hard to find. Perhaps the name was too difficult to pronounce (wheat-la-COACH-hay). Its other appellation, night smut, certainly didn't win it any friends. Whatever the reason, the gray-black fungus, which grows on corn kernels, disappeared as quickly as it came. So imagine my surprise to open the menu at the two-and-a-half-month-old Maya restaurant and discover that the roasted corn soup was being served with a huitlacoche dumpling. It is not the only unusual dish on the menu. In fact, the food at Maya is unlike just about anything else being served in New York City. Salads have grilled cactus leaves, a quesadilla is stuffed with zucchini blossoms, and pork comes in a pumpkinseed sauce. The chef uses many chilies, and I would guess that no other restaurant in the city offers corn in so many guises. Richard Sandoval, the chef and owner, left his family's upscale restaurants in Acapulco to open a pair of restaurants in Manhattan. Savann and Savann Est have been successful because they offer sophisticated, French-inflected cooking at reasonable prices; now Mr. Sandoval hopes to showcase the food of his native Mexico. He seems to have put his heart into the venture. Maya is certainly the most attractive of his restaurants. The setting is colorful with rosy walls and an inlaid wood floor. Most of the bowls, glassware and serving pieces seem handmade. And aside from insisting on telling you their names (sometimes three or four times in an evening), the waiters are efficient. But it is the food that really wakes you up. After a single breathtaking bite of rock shrimp ceviche, you understand that the chef is on a mission. You first taste chilies, then lime. Right behind them comes the sneaky, bright green taste of cilantro. Then, just before you swallow, the sweetness of onions kicks in. By the time you are ready for a second bite your mouth seems alive with flavor. The seafood salad is another surprise. The greens, an unusual blend of watercress, cilantro and diced grilled cactus leaves, are tossed with a chile-Serrano-and-apple vinaigrette and topped with grilled shrimp, scallops and calamari rings. I found myself eating one bite after another, trying to deconstruct the tastes. I finally gave up and admitted that it was simply delicious. Even the chile relleno is unusual. The roasted pepper is stuffed with seafood and cheese and served with a black bean puree and cilantro oil. It is quite rich and sneakily sweet: is there honey in there? After these appetizers the tamale, with its shredded chicken, crema fresca and bright red chipotle sauce, is a bore. The quesadillas are dull, too. But I like the chunky guacamole, and I love the tacos al pastor, two little tortillas served with marinated pork, grilled onions and a fresh salsa. I could easily eat five or six servings. The most impressive main course is chicken mole. The chicken is just a boned, grilled breast, but the dark sauce is truly complex. Tasting it I found myself trying to define which chilies were in it and chasing down hints of coriander, cumin, chocolate and cinnamon. The fried plantains on the plate added an entirely different note. Pipian de puerco, grilled pork marinated in tamarind and served on a bed of pureed, roasted corn in a pumpkinseed sauce, is another satisfying dish. So is Mr. Sandoval's fancy chilaquiles, which began as a poor-people's dish to use up leftover tortillas. Moist slices of chicken are topped with fried tortillas, crema fresca and a fine tomatillo salsa. Even something as simple as grilled shrimp and lobster on a bed of rice and beans becomes, in Mr. Sandoval's hands, more than the sum of its parts. There are some missteps. The piramide de res, grilled hanger steak piled on grilled onions, tomatoes and black beans, is made with such terrible meat that even the powerful chile de arbol puree cannot save it. And putting guacamole on top seems absurd. Desserts are not impressive, either. The flan is flat, the sorbets too sweet. Cajeta, caramel made with goat milk, arrives on soggy crepes. The fireworks in platanos flameados, bananas flamed with tequila, have gone out long before they reach the table. But you could always have the roasted corn soup for dessert. Rich and creamy, it derives a pleasantly funky flavor from the huitlacoche dumpling. And if that doesn't appeal to you, I suggest a margarita made with hibiscus flowers. Sweet and slightly sour, it is the perfect final flavor for this food. Maya ** $(rating: two stars$) 1191 First Avenue, near 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 585-1818.

       "  'review': \"In the beginning it is hard to resist the charm of Il Postino. The entrance to the five-month-old restaurant, with its enticing display of prosciutto, porcini and portobello mushrooms, is warm and appealing. You pass more food -- small fragrant melons and strawberries the size of artichokes -- as the jocular maitre d'hotel leads you to your table. Then a busboy arrives with a few free offerings: a pale mixture of seafood on endive; a plate of garlicky, chili-laden marinated zucchini, and an oversize basket of bread. He juggles plates to find room for it all on the small table, and this seems somehow charming, too, as if this restaurant just off Sutton Place were a struggling shoestring operation. It is all so engaging that when the wine list is small and many of the wines turn out to be unavailable, it seems no more than quaint. Then the menu appears, and it, too, is small. No matter; the prices seem fair, the dishes appealing. But just as you are about to tell the waiter what you want, he opens his mouth, takes a deep breath and starts talking as fast as an auctioneer. ''Tonight for appetizers,'' he begins, the words running together as they race into the air above you, ''we have zucchini blossoms stuffed with cheese, smoked swordfish carpaccio, grilled octopus, oysters topped with caviar or baked with bechamel, baby clams oreganata, fresh mozzarella with grilled, marinated peppers and tomatoes, artichokes fried with garlic, grilled porcini, portobello mushrooms . . .'' the list goes on and on. There seem to be a dozen appetizers, followed by half a dozen pasta dishes and as many kinds of meat and seafood, each cooked in some impossibly inventive manner. ''Who can remember all this?'' you wonder. ''Why don't they write it down?'' Then one answer becomes obvious: This is theater. Watching the waiter go through this performance is part of the charm of Il Postino. Not until the very end of the evening do you discover the other reason behind this oral recitation. ''If you want something else,'' the waiter says, coming to the end at last, ''please ask. The kitchen can do anything you'd like.'' It cannot, however, do it consistently well. Baby clams oreganata are excellent, the tiny clams sweet beneath their bread-crumb coating. But zucchini blossoms stuffed with cheese are dipped in an eggy batter and fried to a dreary sogginess. Grilled octopus is fine, but those artichokes are extremely unpleasant; they are not crisp, and with each bite you get a mouthful of fiber. Smoked swordfish carpaccio, dotted with onions and capers, is accompanied by a soup bowl of olive oil, rosemary and garlic. Its presence is never explained, but it takes up so much room on the already overladen table that the busboy is forced to remove the unattractive flower arrangement. The main courses are much more successful. Lobster fra diavolo (''in the shell or we'll take it out, on top of pasta or by itself'') turns out to be a whole small lobster in a deep bowl; it is drenched in a very garlicky tomato sauce and accompanied by a few strands of pasta. The beast arrives with a bib, which is a good thing because eating it is extremely messy fun. Sushi grade tuna with balsamic vinegar is excellent, too, the fish fresh and sweet in contrast to the assertive vinegar. The veal chop Milanese hangs off the edge of the plate and seems to be breaded in pulverized breadsticks, but it tastes just fine. The waiter has forgotten the side dish of broccoli rape, but no matter; there's no room on the table for it anyway. The cheesecake sounds irresistible (''We make it here''), and it is in fact delicious. Then the waiter mentions that there are some French melons in the kitchen. ''A little plate, perhaps?'' he urges. Well, why not? There's a very good reason why not, which we discover with the bill. The fruit plate costs $19. (On another occasion a plate of fruit for three set me back $22.50.) The mystery of the oral specials is solved: would any sane person order a bowl of pasta, even one topped with lobster, knowing that it cost $58.50? Apparently. The restaurant seems to be full of regular customers who do not wince when the bill is presented. I went back a few times, if only to find out why. Much of the food is good. The prosciutto, served with chunks of Parmesan and slivers of marinated mushrooms, is truly delicious. Pasta y fagioli is full of flavor. The mozzarella is excellent. Dover sole is nicely cooked, and steak in mushroom or Gorgonzola sauce is a treat. I like the seafood pasta, too, topped with green-lipped mussels, shrimp, squid, clams and lobster, but I think $42.50 is an absolutely outrageous price. This is not, after all, an elegant establishment. The front room is noisy, and if you are seated in the upstairs dining room you often find yourself surrounded by people who casually light cigarettes. And up there the kitchen door bangs against the wall with such force and regularity it feels like an earthquake. The service can be slow and forgetful. And one night I watched two busboys spend so long arguing over who was going to bone the fish for the people at the next table it took 10 minutes to get the job done. Some people find all of this charming. But even though the food was mostly fine, for me the allure of Il Postino wore off when the bill came. It's hard to smile when you feel like a sucker. Il Postino Satisfactory $(rating: satisfactory$) 337 East 49th Street, Manhattan, (212) 688-0033.

       "  'review': \"''There are no restaurants like this in Rio,'' say my Brazilian friends, seating themselves in the warm and festive room that is Circus. ''Nobody wants to go out to eat the food they cook at home.'' The recent spate of churrascarias, where meat in copious quantities is the main thing, is giving us a very odd idea of Brazilian cooking. An entire generation now thinks the people of South America's largest nation sit down to vast amounts of steak and potatoes every night. But while places like Churrascaria Plataforma faithfully reproduce a form of restaurant popular in Brazil, Circus serves the food your mother might cook if you were raised in Sao Paulo or Bahia. Picadinho and muqueca de camarao might not have many takers in an upscale Rio restaurant, but New York is a different story: Circus is usually packed with Brazilians eager for a taste of home. They jump up to embrace each time the door opens, gorgeous women in impossibly tight clothes and elegant men with a nonchalant air. The charming circus drawings on the wall -- acrobats, prancing horses and adorable tigers -- add to the festive feeling. This increases with the hour; Brazilians eat late, and as the night gets older, the restaurant takes on the air of a party. Brazilians speak Portuguese with a soft accent, erasing the edges. Their food has the same quality; it is easy to like. The dominant ingredients (other than beef) are seafood, coconut, rice and beans, often combined in fascinating ways. My favorite dish on the current menu is camarao na moranga, a heap of tiny, tender rock shrimp sauteed with fresh corn, hearts of palm, shallots, peas and coconut milk, mixed with cheese and baked in an acorn squash. The squash becomes soft enough to eat with a spoon, adding its own note to the rich, elusive flavors, which change with each bite. Served with a side dish of rice, it is completely appealing. I like picadinho, too, beef sauteed with wine and thyme, topped with a poached egg and accompanied by rice, beans and cooked bananas. It tastes like earthy home cooking, and if it were only a little spicier it would be fabulous. ''Oh,'' say my friends shrugging, ''Brazilians think Americans don't like salt and spice, so they tend to leave them out when they cook for you.'' I certainly wish they wouldn't. Another particularly satisfying dish on the menu is an appetizer, bolo de milho e rabada, little polenta cakes baked with Manchego cheese and served with a robust oxtail sauce. A single large and meaty oxtail shares the plate. The textures are soft, the flavors gentle; this is just the sort of food that would be good to find on the table after a hard day at the office. I like casquinha de siri, too, sauteed crab meat baked in a shell and topped with cheese and toasted farofa, the manioc flour that is found in almost every Brazilian recipe. And feijoada, Brazil's famously meaty black bean stew, is worth a weekend trip; Circus serves it only on Saturdays and Sundays. But Circus has a tendency to prettify the food, making it fancier than it would normally be. Muqueca de camarao, a stew from the northeast of the country, is a delightful mush in its natural form, but here it becomes too elegant. Shrimp are grilled, fanned out around a mound of rice, embellished with a tomato, red pepper and coconut milk sauce, decorated with shreds of coconut and topped with a mere sprinkle of farofa. The flavors are muted and the dish loses its authenticity. Salmon is another nouvelle creation. The menu promises a sauce of shrimp and dende, the highly concentrated palm oil that is the true taste of the country. I liked the fish fillet, neatly folded into a crust of shredded potatoes and set on a bed of cabbage, but I could not make out the forceful punch of dende. By the time we got to frango com quiabo, chicken with okra and saffron sauce, I was starting to regret the kitchen's tendency to deconstruct plain food. What might have been a tasty stew on a bed of mashed potatoes had turned into a finicky dish of chicken with a side dish of okra. It was a disappointment. Another disappointment was that the caipirinhas, the national drink of Brazil, are made with vodka instead of the more powerful cachaca, which makes them wimpy. On the other hand, the unusual wine list concentrates on Spain, Portugal and Argentina. Prices tend to be high for the less expensive wines, but there are some bargains among the older, big-ticket bottles. Brazilian desserts are sweet and tropical. Circus executes them faithfully. The passion fruit mousse is too sweet for me, but I love the caramelized bananas with ice cream. And I like the soft coconut mousse with fresh coconut called Maria mole, a classic children's dessert. You finish, of course, with cafezinho, the potent little cups of coffee that fuel the country. It reminds your mouth that you have just spent some time in Brazil.

       "  'review': \"Where did the people who flock to Redeye Grill go before this handsome new place opened? Although the room is huge, it is usually so packed that I have watched eager eaters struggle through the throngs to beg the hostess for a table. Even the cloakroom is crowded: it's as big as a Chinatown store but the coats still spill out onto a nearby rack. Boisterous and lively, Redeye Grill fits so naturally into the neighborhood that in its sixth month it is already hard to remember the area without it. This is undoubtedly due to the proprietor, Sheldon Fireman, who owns Trattoria del Arte next door and Brooklyn Diner around the corner. Mr. Fireman knows exactly what people want: almost everything. To accommodate them, Redeye Grill stays open every day from before noon to almost midnight. Still, it is not enough; next month, the restaurant is to start serving until 4 A.M. Mr. Fireman also offers a choice of ambiance: if the big, bustling space with its tall ceilings and earthy murals is too intimidating, you can ask for the more intimate rear dining room. Lower ceilings and a fireplace give it a friendly, rustic air. Appetite is no impediment either: if you are not very hungry, you can sit beneath the pair of six-foot rotating bronze shrimp that guard the bar, snacking on seafood and smoked fish. Should you be in the mood for a major meal, the extensive menu will almost certainly have something to please you. There is, of course, a downside to all these choices: when you try to please everybody, something gets slighted. In this case, it is the food. It is always perfectly fine. Occasionally, it is better than that. But not often. Consider, for example, the dancing shrimp, the restaurant's signature dish. A dozen shrimp arrive jiggling on the ends of skewers stuck into the top of a pineapple. Half have been dipped in a slightly spicy Cajun marinade and grilled, the other half wrapped in filaments of phyllo and fried so that they have a fat and furry look. The grilled shrimp are good, but the fried ones are more fun to watch than to eat. The shrimp cocktail looks impressive, too, but it can be remarkably, almost magically, tasteless. Of the many shrimp dishes on the menu, I much prefer the popped rock shrimp, cute little fried balls that do have some flavor. The menu also has a fine array of smoked fish. Salmon comes plain, smoked and peppered like pastrami, cured in tequila, with jalapenos and even with orange. Sturgeon comes topped with truffle oil. Trout, sable, chub . . . there is enough variety to please the most ardent deli maven; the kitchen even makes sushi out of it. The lobster section of the menu offers all sorts of preparations: grilled, in salad, with pasta and even in a pot pie. The pastas are never stellar, and the rich pot pie tastes more of tarragon than any creature of the sea. But the small grilled lobster, served with a little potato cake and pristine haricots verts, is lovely. Grilled fish tend to be nicely cooked, and the kitchen also does a good job with more complex preparations. I especially like Asian-style sea bass served with noodles and black beans. Cioppino, the tomato-based San Francisco fish and shellfish stew, is very respectable. And those who eat fish out of duty rather than desire will probably be pleased by mushroom-crusted mahi-mahi, which has a very meaty character. Personally, I'd rather eat a steak. The steak of choice here would be the hanger steak, tender slices piled onto a biscuit. The hamburger is good, too, if you overlook the presentation. It arrives on a messy plate, surrounded by big, dark rounds of fried potatoes, a pickle and a mushy tomato salad. It is hard to imagine that the same person who created this also invented the lovely Cobb salad with its colorful alternating bands of ingredients. The waiter presents the pretty platter before tossing the tomato, lettuce, avocado, blue cheese, egg, bacon and turkey into a very satisfying salad. Desserts are presented in the same flamboyant manner. The waiter appears with a tray and leans across the table, showing off a comically tall chocolate mousse cake, a gooey nut and chocolate concoction and a bunch of bananas, which stands in for banana cream pie. In this company, the plain Jane cream-cheese bundt cake looks so modest you know it has to be the best of the lot. Usually it is. Still, the waiters will all assure you that what you really want is banana cream pie. With its caramelized graham-cracker crust and its mounds of whipped cream, it is certainly a showy creature, but the custard often has a disconcertingly starchy consistency. I tried it four times and only once was it ideal, a sweet dream, an all-American triumph that fit perfectly into that big, bold room.

       "  'review': \"On Saturday night, when restaurants all over New York City were cursing the Yankees, Maloney & Porcelli was full. Clearly the restaurant is giving people what they want. Big portions of manly food. Fine service. A warm, attractive room filled with comforting Americana. Why then, do I have so many reservations about Maloney & Porcelli? Because the food is just too cute. This is theme eating for grown-ups, a place where the food is more fun to discuss than consume. ''Look at the size of that thing!'' people exclaim as their meal rolls up on a cart. ''Isn't that clever?'' they say, nudging one another when onion rings arrive in giant paper coffee filters and applesauce appears in an oversize Mason jar. If you need something to keep the conversation flowing, Maloney & Porcelli is happy to provide it. On Saturday, for instance, the special appetizer was Amazon fish ribs. All over the dining room, waiters could be heard explaining that they come from a 150-pound Brazilian fish skulking at the bottom of the Amazon River. Their resemblance to spareribs was so remarkable that I was halfway through my second rib before I realized I would rather be eating the ordinary sort. I had a similar experience with pizza topped with Robiolo cheese, portobello mushrooms and truffle oil. It was artfully nestled into a basket, looking so gorgeous and smelling so good that it took me awhile to realize the crust was crackerlike, the topping dull. Spicy tuna dumplings were another adorable idea, an American version of dim sum. But the filling was fishy and the wrapping so undercooked that it was tough and doughy. Occasionally the gimmicks work. Crackling pork shank, for instance, is an original and delicious dish, a great ball of meat (it weighs two and a half pounds before cooking), deep fried until the skin turns into cracklings, then slowly roasted. The result is an enormous mound of tender pork,  wrapped in its own crisp skin and served on an aromatic bed of poppy-seed-sprinkled sauerkraut. It is far more meat than most people can eat at one sitting, but it is every bit as appealing consumed cold the next day. Too bad the firecracker applesauce (in the Mason jar, with a whole chili pepper on top) has the disconcerting texture of baby food. As you might expect from a restaurant owned by Alan Stillman's New York Restaurant Group (which also owns Smith & Wollensky, the Post House, Cite, Park Avenue Cafe and Manhattan Ocean Club), the meat is good. A hefty grilled rib eye comes with the bone sticking over the edge of the plate, and sirloin steaks are crusty and flavorful. Side dishes, however, are less successful. Sweet onion rings are coated in an admirably light batter flavored with cumin and chili powder, but they are sometimes cold and are often stuck together. Creamed spinach, which arrives in a sweet little Calphalon saucepan, has been at various times salty, watery or both. The whipped potatoes, which the chef and partner, David Burke, made famous at Park Avenue Cafe, taste more of olive oil than potatoes, and the hashed browns are dry and overcooked. Grilled vegetables have been soggy. If you want a wonderful meal here, start by ordering one of the good wines from the large and fairly priced list. Then have a Caesar salad as a first course; tossed with a finely tuned dressing and pleasantly crisp croutons, it is served in a large wooden bowl. Crab cakes are good, too, as is Mr. Burke's trademarked Park Avenue Cafe Salmon Pastrami. Avoid the awkward specialty vegetable salad and the flabby gray ''minute steak'' of foie gras. Avoid, too, the glass of Chateau d'Yquem that is served with the foie gras: it costs $22 extra. Next have the pork shank. Or the swordfish London broil. Or a simple sirloin. The entrees to avoid are the silly monkfish Wellington, a piece of nearly tasteless fish topped with mushrooms and wrapped in soggy pastry, and the ''angry'' lobster. Half a five-pound lobster dusted with peppery flour and sauteed with sliced garlic is a lot to wrestle with. Unlike the similar sauteed lobster at F.illi Ponte in TriBeCa, this one is so tough it made me wonder if the beast had been cooked twice. If you want lobster here, it's much better to have it steamed. End the meal with drunken doughnuts. It's another gimmick, but it's charming. The waiter arrives shaking a pristine white paper bag. He opens it at the table, pours warm twists of sugar-dusted dough onto a plate and sets down three pots of liquor-laced jam. The combination is irresistible. The ''store-bought cheesecake'' tastes like S&S to me, which means it is terrific. And profiteroles come filled with good caramel ice cream and topped with a fine hot fudge sauce. But many of the desserts, like many of the entrees, look better than they taste: the giant slice of airy lemon meringue pie with the word lemon scrawled across every piece; the dry, fluffy mountain of coconut cake surrounded by a sea of apricot puree; the soggy, airy cherry-cheese strudel. Each has the overblown beauty of supermarket fruit: big and beautiful, they ultimately leave you unsatisfied. Maloney & Porcelli * 37 East 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 750-2233 Ambiance: The former Gloucester has been stripped down to a comfortable, wood-toned, masculine room decorated with eagles and filled with lawyers. Service: Very smooth and professional (although there are few large tables and parties of more than four often have to wait). Recommended dishes: Crab cakes, shellfish, Caesar salad, salmon pastrami, crackling pork shank with firecracker applesauce, swordfish London broil, grilled rib eye, sirloin steak, steamed lobster, drunken doughnuts, cheesecake, profiteroles with caramel ice cream and hot fudge. Wine list: Good and fairly priced, with an innovative list of 40 wines under $40. Hours: 11:30 A.M. to 11:30 P.M. Mondays through Fridays; 5 to 11:30 P.M. Saturdays and Sundays. Price range: Lunch: appetizers $5 to $17, main courses $18.50 to $26, side dishes $5.75; dinner: appetizers $5 to $17, main courses $18.50 to $33, side dishes $6.75. Desserts are $7.50.

       "  'review': \"If George Rector, the author of the well-regarded ''Dining in New York'' in 1939, were to stroll through the restaurants of modern Manhattan, he would find very little to surprise him. Even then, the city had a lot to offer an adventurous appetite. The most glaring exception was Japanese food, which Mr. Rector dismissed as ''derivative of the Chinese.'' The only Japanese dish he seemed to like was sukiyaki; if he knew anything about sushi, he certainly kept it to himself. What would Mr. Rector make of the city today, a place with such a passion for things Japanese that sushi is sold in supermarkets? It is hard to say. But if he returned to New York, I would certainly want to introduce him to sushi and sashimi. And I would want to do it at Hatsuhana. Sushi bars can be extremely unwelcoming; many of the best make you feel that you have entered a club with incomprehensible rules that no one is willing to explain. Americanized sushi bars, on the other hand, often have showoff chefs who favor quantity over quality and do not know what they are doing. Hatsuhana is different: of all the city's sushi bars, it is the one that best bridges the gap between East and West. Hatsuhana is a comfortable and welcoming restaurant where you can depend on being served high-quality sushi whether you speak Japanese or not. But it can be more than that. Hatsuhana can surprise you. One day I walked in expecting the usual competent sushi. I sat down, ordered some sake and ate the tsukidashi, the little side dish of bean sprouts marinated in sesame oil that so often appears as a surprise first course. I was examining the fish in the case, considering what to order, when a woman sat down two seats away. She smiled but said nothing; without a word the shokunin, the sushi chef, began to give her food. She began with geoduck. Fresh giant clam is one of my favorite ways to begin a sushi meal, too. This was crisp and slightly crunchy beneath the teeth with that sweet, fresh oceanic flavor that characterizes the best. A good beginning. I was considering what to have next when I noticed that a waiter had brought something to the sushi chef. He tilted the bowl so the woman could see what was inside: live shrimp. Dispatching them with a quick twist of the wrist, he pulled them from their shells and placed the translucent bodies before her. I motioned that I would like shrimp, too, and within moments I was eating the delicate, almost perfumed flesh. Then the chef broiled the heads and gave me those. I ate every bit, crunching the shells like nuts. They were delicious. ''Just give me whatever she is having,'' I said now, convinced that I was in the presence of a pro. And I sat back as a feast appeared. We went on to baby abalone, a shellfish that seems overrated until you eat it raw. It was followed by extraordinary chu toro, the tuna that is richer than maguro but less rich than toro, which has the highest fat content (and the highest price). This was as soft as butter. Now the sushi chef cut yellowtail and placed the pale slices before me; it was as smooth as whipped cream. Next came something to sink our teeth into, kanpachi, the delicate wild yellowtail imported from Japan. I was happy to eat anything that my neighbor was eating. Now it was ika uni, pure white squid cut into long strips as thin as spaghetti and tumbled with golden sea urchin roe and a few thin slices of deep green toasted seaweed. It was like the most extraordinary pasta, a cool and refreshing dish for a summer evening. As a finale, the chef handed us each a single hand roll, a cone of seaweed filled with rice dabbed with neri ume, the tart plum paste, a stick of yama imo, the crisp mountain yam of Japan, and a couple of leaves of shiso. The combination was perfect, the tartness of the deep purple paste rubbing against the sharpness of the minty leaves and the bland crispness of the yam. The textures felt good against my teeth and the flavors lingered in my mouth better than any dessert would. That single meal was so exciting that it made me reconsider Hatsuhana. The sushi and sashimi are not always this extraordinary, but they are always very good. On subsequent visits, I have noticed that the quality of the cooked food is excellent, too; chawan mushi, the seafood and vegetable custard, is particularly good, and the broiled yellowtail collar is very satisfying. And although I would be happier if the restaurant did not serve tempura at the sushi bar (the smell of fried food is disconcerting when you are indulging in something as delicate as sashimi), the dish itself is nicely executed. What would Mr. Rector say after a meal at Hatsuhana? I can't be sure, of course, but I like to think that he would take a sip of sake, lean back and say, ''Things have certainly improved in the last 60 years.'' Hatsuhana ** 17 East 48th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-3345. Atmosphere: The clean lines and typical blond wood decor offer no clue that this is among the most welcoming sushi bars in Manhattan. Service: So pleasant that even the chefs who do not speak very good English try to make themselves understood. Recommended dishes: Giant clam, live shrimp, abalone, tuna sashimi, yellowtail, mackerel, ume-shiso hand roll, kanpachi, scallop, squid with sea urchin, chawan mushi, green tea ice cream. Wine list: The long list of sake offers a few unusual bottles that are excellent. Hours: Lunch: 11:45 A.M. to 2:45 P.M. Mondays through Fridays; dinner: 5:30 to 10 P.M. Mondays through Fridays, 5 to 10 P.M. Saturdays. Closed Sundays. Price range: Sushi and sashimi starts at $2.50 a piece; set sushi meals are $17 to $35. Credit cards: All major cards. Wheelchair accessibility: Downstairs dining room and sushi bar are at street level, and there is a street-level restroom.\",\n",

       "  'review': \"What could a restaurant possibly offer that would be worth $150 a person? In the case of Nadaman Hakubai, the answer is serenity and the extraordinary sense of experiencing another culture. A visit to one of this restaurant's tatami rooms is like a quick trip to Japan; if you are not prepared to leave New York City at the door with your shoes, it is hardly worth the voyage. Your arrival will be timed to insure that you meet no other diners; the point is to make you feel you have the entire restaurant to yourself. In my visits to Nadaman Hakubai, I have never heard the voice of another guest or seen any indication that the other tatami rooms were occupied. The beautiful woman who met us at the entrance had carefully hidden all the other coats and shoes. Kneeling in her kimono, she welcomed us, took our shoes and slid open the door to our room. Coming from the street the intensity of the quiet was startling. The room was elegant in its simplicity, carpeted with mats and decorated with a scroll and a single vase of flowers. Beneath the low table was a recessed pit in which to swing our legs, and the legless chairs had backrests. The bright fluorescent lighting was the only jarring note. The restaurant is a branch of an Osaka restaurant known for its interpretation of kaiseki, the cuisine associated with the tea ceremony. This is food for the soul as well as the body, meant to feed the eye with its beauty and the spirit with its meaning. The key to kaiseki is anticipation: the courses follow a strict order and each is intended  to introduce the coming season. That is why one course of the summer meal I had was an autumnal wild duck and why a spring meal featured a tomato aspic. The way to enjoy this is to abandon yourself to the experience, appreciating the peace, the subtlety of the flavors and the sense that you are being pampered as never before. The waitresses knock softly before entering the room, moving with amazing grace as they introduce each beautiful new dish. The last meal I had at Nadaman Hakubai began with sake served in an ice blue glass bottle snuggled into a bowl of ice next to a single orchid blossom. Next, the waitress poured delicate plum wine into seemingly weightless red lacquer cups and left us alone. When she returned, she was bearing long, covered bamboo dishes divided into three compartments. One held soft, seductive sea urchins suspended in clear aspic. Another presented small, salt-roasted sweet fish topped with fresh soybeans. In the middle were tiny roasted Japanese yams, still in the skin, as soft and sweet as  custard. Unless you are an extremely adventurous eater, you will probably not like every dish you are served, but most of the food is disarmingly subtle.  The course after the appetizer is always a light soup. In this case, the covered black lacquer bowl contained a single shrimp and a section of a corn  cob, hollowed out and filled with homemade tofu. Then there was sashimi served in two ice-covered bowls. One held translucent slices of fluke on a leaf of shiso, chunks of lobster on slices of lemon and a round of cucumber filled with freshly grated wasabi. The other bowl was a  disappointment: the toro (fatty tuna) was sinewy and tough, not buttery and delicate as it should have been. The waitress returned to see if we would like some more sake. Tucking her long sleeves into her obi in a graceful flowing motion, she poured the rice wine and left. When she returned, she was carrying covered ceramic dishes cradling slices of duck simmered with eggplant and ginger. The flavor was wild and forceful and, in the middle of summer, surprisingly refreshing. Traditionally, there is a fried dish at this point of the meal. In the spring, we were offered small, whole soft-shell crabs wrapped in a crisp tempura batter. But the chef changes the menu each night, and on this summer evening the waitress appeared with ceramic plates, each holding a sizzlingly hot rock set in salt. She set one in front of each of us, along with platters of thinly sliced raw wagyu beef, mushroom caps and spears of asparagus. Tucking her sleeves into her obi again, she showed us how to cook our food on the rock; the scent of the butter-soft meat spiraled up into the air. At other times, my meal at Nadaman Hakubai  ended with a plate of tidbits (in the spring, smoked salmon and tomato aspic), followed by rice with bits of lotus root, pickles and a small dish of vinegared clams. But now the waitress appeared with what looked like large candy apples. Opening the pretty bowls, we found a bed of ice covered with pale, delicate noodles topped with the deep purple Japanese salted fruit called  umaboshi, and pale green shiso leaves. It was perfectly refreshing. The finale was served on sparkling glass plates, each the color of a different jewel. Each  held a single fresh litchi, slices of crisp Asian pears and a scattering of blueberries. Then the waitress served tea, put her hands together, bowed and indicated a button on the wall. ''If you need me again,'' she said, ''please ring the call button.'' And she disappeared, silently sliding the door closed behind her. Once again the quiet was intense. I sat there in that peaceful room, contemplating the quality of the food. I have to admit that it was often disappointing. The tempura could have been hotter, the sashimi was not extraordinary and the fruit, which is never less than amazing in the kaiseki restaurants of Japan, was distressingly average. In Japan, the best food is said to have umami,  to be everything it can possibly be. It is a term that transcends perfection because it involves not only all the senses, but understanding as well; umami cannot exist unless it is recognized. I think I would recognize it. And I don't think the food at Nadaman Hakubai has umami. On the other hand, in spite of the occasional disappointment, each evening at the restaurant has been an immensely rewarding experience. Worth $150? Think of it this way: A trip to Japan would cost considerably more. Nadaman Hakubai ** In the Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212) 885-7111. Atmosphere: The regular restaurant is quite ordinary, but the tatami rooms are like a mini-trip to Japan. Service: The kimono-clad waitresses pamper you in every way. Recommended dishes: Kaiseki dinners, which change nightly. Wine list: There is a wine list, but the waitresses tend to be baffled by it. It is best to stick to sake and beer. Price range: Kaiseki dinners in the private tatami rooms are $150 a person, for a minimum of 4. Traditional Japanese breakfast in the dining room is $24; prix fixe lunch is $45, and kaiseki meals in the main restaurant begin at $80 (and are not particularly recommended). Hours: Breakfast: 7 to 9:30 A.M. daily; lunch: 11:45 A.M. to 2:30 P.M. daily; dinner: 6 to 9:30 P.M. Credit cards: All major cards. Wheelchair accessibility: The restaurant is below street level but there is an elevator.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The woman at the next table keeps getting up. Each time she stands, the entire dining room takes notice, our eyes on the leopard skin shorts and the legs that unfold endlessly from beneath the table. The dining room watches, too, as the woman at the table opposite mine unbuttons yet another inch of lime green Chanel jacket. She is not wearing anything under it, and she laughs and swishes  her shiny black hair as she toys with the collar. Everybody seems to be smoking avidly, unabashedly, as if it were not illegal. Clearly nobody goes to Downtown to eat. They go to the newest Cipriani restaurant to smoke, to look swell, to see and be seen. That is a very good thing, because the food served beneath that ornate glass chandelier is astonishingly uneven. Consider two evenings a few weeks apart. Night One: It is 7:30, an unfashionable hour at Downtown, which tends to fill up as the night grows older. We have obviously been allotted two hours for dinner, and the busboy is intent on holding us to it. He keeps trying to clear our plates. Meanwhile, the people at the next table bathe us in a steady stream of smoke. When I mention this to the maitre d\\'hotel, he replies graciously, \"Ninety percent of our customers smoke, but if people ask us to ask them to stop, we do.\" He moves off to incline apologetically over their table. They glare at us and put out their cigarettes. For five minutes. Then three people at the table light up again. The waiter brings them an ashtray. We throw up our hands. Our appetizers include the world\\'s most expensive bowl of bean soup and a mushy tuna tartar. Soft polenta with veal ragu is bland. The only dish I like is an artichoke and avocado salad topped with thin sheets of Parmesan cheese. Veal milanese, which was extremely good in the restaurant\\'s first week, now tastes oily. Gnocchi in tomato sauce are leaden. And kidneys in cognac sauce are tough and overcooked. The side order of risotto is dense and slightly gummy. Across the dining room, I notice a waiter approaching Oscar de la Renta\\'s table  with a plate of risotto that looks fluffy, pale and quite perfect. I am jealous. Is there anything worth eating? Well, mussels and clams veneziana is a nice dish, although it seems overpriced at $19.50. And the thin slices of carpaccio a la cipriani are cut from a gorgeous piece of meat. I suppose most of these people don\\'t mind that it costs $18.50. We eat our fluffy white desserts, zabaglione cake and lemon meringue tart, and flee. Night Two: The tables are too small, the restaurant is too crowded and the people at the next table keep smoking, even though we ask them to stop. I am feeling very mean. But then my first course arrives. I take one bite of the light semolina gnocchi in an even lighter tomato sauce, and my mood changes. It tastes like Italy. The fried calamari are excellent (as they ought to be at $15 a plate). Mussel and clam soup is a treat. And the baked tagliolini, made famous by the original Harry\\'s Bar in Venice, is a sort of grown-up version of macaroni and cheese with ham. Rich and creamy, it is elegant comfort food. The main courses are even better. They include pasta with a fine, flavorful ragu. Chicken is simple, beautifully grilled, and served with nothing but a bit  of zucchini and tomatoes on the side. Grouper comes topped with grilled radicchio and just a hint of cream whose sweetness plays against the bitterness  of the radicchio. Calf\\'s liver is slivered, tossed with an equal amount of sweet onions and cooked so rapidly that the meat retains its softness. I have never had a better version of fegato alla veneziana. It is all so delicious I find myself liking even those airy desserts that I found so sweet on my last go-round. Return visits have proved that neither night was typical: The food at Downtown is rarely all bad or all good. The one sure thing is the prix fixe meal, which includes a good salad, fine pasta, dessert and coffee. At $28, it is a fair deal. Order the other dishes and you take your chances. You take your chances with the wine as well. It is hard to order from a list  that neglects to list vintage years, harder still when the restaurant is out of  half the wines. This time of year you might want to stick with the Bellini, a delicious mixture of peach puree and sparkling wine invented by Harry\\'s Bar in Venice. But there is nothing chancy about the service, which is always gracious and accommodating. And there is nothing chancy about the scene either; as far as I\\'m concerned, it is, all by itself, worth the voyage. Downtown  * 376 West Broadway, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0999. Atmosphere: Uptown has invaded downtown in this restaurant where most men wear suits and all the women are gorgeous. Service: The tables are too small and the aisles are too crowded, but the waiters are very kind and do their best. Recommended dishes: Artichoke and avocado salad, fried calamari, pastas, tagliolini with ham and cream, carpaccio, semolina gnocchi, grilled chicken, grouper with cream and radicchio, calf\\'s liver with onions. Wine list: The vintages are not listed, the choices are unimaginative and many of the wines are sold out.  Prices, however, are average. Hours: Noon to midnight daily. Price range: Appetizers $8 to $18.50, dinner entrees $15 to $26, desserts $7  to $8. Three-course prix fixe menu at $28. Credit cards: All major cards.

       "  'review': 'In New York City, home of the fabulous, the chic, the loud and the exotic, a  nice restaurant is a rare thing. So rare that when I encountered the pleasant staff at Aquagrill I was acutely uncomfortable. Don\\'t those people ever stop smiling? No, it seems, they don\\'t; the service was as nice on my last visit as it was  on my first, and despite the increasing crowd in the dining room, it was never loud or rushed or edgy. Aquagrill has the comfortable air of a neighborhood place. But while it may feel like the sort of restaurant that ought to be serving burgers and beer, the menu is refreshingly original. Devoted almost entirely to  fish, it offers unusual dishes like \"snail snaps\" (bite-size popovers holding a  single snail) and salmon in a falafel crust. For those who want something simpler, the kitchen will happily poach, grill or roast any of the offerings. \"I can\\'t eat any dairy products,\" the man behind me said one day, \"and I\\'m allergic to fish. I don\\'t want any wine in a sauce and I stay away from wheat products.\" He seemed to have eliminated most of the dishes on the lunch menu, but the waitress was not fazed. She pointed to the dinner menu and said, \"Just tell me what you\\'d like to eat, and the chef will gladly make it for you.\" He ordered grilled scallops and sniffed suspiciously at them when his meal came. He took a tiny bite. \"There\\'s butter on this, I know there is,\" he said accusingly. \"It tastes too good.\" \"I\\'ll ask the chef,\" the waitress said pleasantly. She returned with a detailed recipe that did not include butter. \"Well,\" said the man grudgingly, \"your chef is very good.\" The chef (and co-owner) is Jeremy Marshall, who has big ambitions. He bakes his own breads and serves them warm. He sends out a little amuse-gueule before each dinner, a thoughtful touch in a moderately priced restaurant. He has devoted one end of the room to a raw bar, and he and his wife, Jennifer, who runs the dining room, are passionate about bivalves. They offer a two-for-one deal on Pine Island oysters from 5 to 7 P.M. on weekdays. It\\'s very convivial: people crowd around the bar, talking, eating oysters and drinking beer and wine. But although the iced clams and oysters are seductive, it is Mr. Marshall\\'s menu that is most appealing. I like all the appetizers. The warm octopus salad is so well executed it is hard to believe this tender morsel could ever be tough. A mixture of mussels and snails comes with a fine potato hash; topped with fried leeks, it makes a very pretty dish. Tuna carpaccio is lovely, too, the fish with its peppered edges arrayed across avocados and onions. But of all  the dishes, I like the snail snaps best. A handful of the small, warm popovers are scattered around a leafy little salad, and even though I know they are there, each time I take a bite the garlicky snail in the center is a chewy surprise. Soups are also satisfying. The billi bi is classic, rich with cream, filled with mussels and sparked with saffron. Lobster and corn chowder is hearty and filled with flavor. My favorite main course is the salmon with the falafel crust. Triangles of peeled tomato and cucumber decorate the plate, and the fillet is perched on a bed of hummus. A lemony coriander vinaigrette adds the perfect bit of punch; it  is a wonderful dish. Many of the other fish are prepared with equal imagination. Halibut is paired with asparagus, and red snapper is surrounded by sesame-scented Asian vegetables. Grilled swordfish comes with sauteed broccoli rape, bacon and squares of polenta, a fishy riff on a B.L.T. Roasted cod is cooked with wilted spinach and tiny artichokes in a pungent caper butter. I like the original dishes that Mr. Marshall dreams up, but he also has a way with plain fish. One night I had slices of simply roasted tuna that were perfectly cooked. Paired with a fine side of spinach and a delicious yellow potato hash, it made a substantial meal. The potato hash is so good, in fact, that I have ordered it each time I have eaten at Aquagrill. I am impressed with the wine list, too. It was clearly chosen with a thought  for the food and an eye to the price. I especially like the appealingly crisp Menetou-Salon from the Loire Valley and the interesting array of pinot noirs that go well with fish. Desserts are homey and occasionally too sweet. My favorite is the all-American apple tart with cinnamon ice cream and caramel sauce. I am also   fond of the pineapple skillet cake with coconut milk sorbet. And for something simply refreshing, it is hard to do better than roasted grapefruit with pink grapefruit sorbet. But even if you don\\'t order dessert, a little plate of cookies arrives with the coffee. Another nice touch. Aquagrill  ** 210 Spring Street, at Avenue of the Americas, SoHo, (212) 274-0505.

       "  'review': 'Did you notice the woman with the cigarette? Many people did. And they were outraged. In a photograph that appeared with my restaurant review here on April 5, a cigarette was clearly visible. The letters poured in. \"I would rather,\" one reader wrote, \"cope with a surly waiter than with a cigarette at the next table.\" I sympathize. On the other hand, I also understand why many restaurateurs would rather overlook a cigarette than have a confrontation. They are in an awkward situation. When a guest lights up in the dining room, most waiters close their eyes and hope nobody notices. Which brings us to Onieal\\'s Grand Street. Smokers who are tired of being asked to put out their cigarettes flock to the restaurant, which is small enough for smoking to be legal. I\\'ve been there on nights when it seemed people were smoking with both hands, trying to make up for all those cigarette-free meals. Normally the smoke would keep me away. But Onieal\\'s is such a beautiful restaurant that I keep being drawn back. I love the light in the place, and the  cozy feeling of the room. I love the warm wood on the walls and the fabric-covered banquettes. I love the elegant simplicity of the handmade lamps.  But most of all, I love the ceiling. Anyone would. It\\'s a 19th-century wonder of carved mahogany and oak. Look up  and you see a big oval with devils dancing at the edges. And you do look up because the entire restaurant has been designed around that ceiling. My first meal at Onieal\\'s was a quiet lunch last fall when the restaurant was so new it had not yet been discovered by smokers. Or for that matter, by anybody. We were the only customers. The chef was roasting beef and the smell drifted out from the kitchen, so maddeningly delicious that we ordered hamburgers and pork sandwiches and sat there, thinking that we had found a swell neighborhood restaurant. What a shock to return a week later and find the place filled with smoke and  noise and young investment bankers puffing cigars as they spooned beluga from a  gorgeous Art Deco server. At one table, \\'ll the women were dressed in black leather with shoelaces around their necks; at another sat four serious-looking men in suits. But no matter what they wore, everyone was eating serious-looking  food. The dinner menu is a mixture of the straightforward and the inventive. You can have a meal as simple as oysters and a mixed green salad followed by a grilled pork chop with apple and onion dressing. Or you can throw caution to the winds and start with tropical-fruit-braised-rabbit risotto and continue with crab cakes in a habanera lime emulsion. When the chef is at his best, both the simple and the complex foods are very  appealing. Although the risotto is mushy and muddy-tasting, many of the adventurous dishes are excellent: the crab cakes, for instance, are delightfully crisp and pleasantly peppery. And some of the seemingly simple dishes are more interesting than they sound. Roast chicken with mashed potatoes comes with a fine pasilla sauce that is bright and bracingly sharp. The chef, Gavin Citron, is an alumnus of Arizona 206, and he does wonderful things with peppers. A barbecued venison pot pie, for instance, is served in a little copper pot and topped with chili-spiced corn bread. Or try lobster fricassee in a sort of Thai coconut-curry sauce. But not everything is hot; his  \"noodles\" are made of beets that have been cooked and cut into long strips before being tossed with arugula and goat cheese. They\\'re wonderful. So is the juniper-cured salmon with scrambled egg, capers and red onion. Occasionally the food seems too worked over. Grilled calamari, for instance,  comes stuffed with a sweet eggplant caponata and pine nuts in a charred tomato sauce with little fried tentacles on the side. The more restrained dishes are very appealing. Striped bass is light and pretty in a saffron broth with a potato-and-tomato gratin on the side. Breast of duck on a mixed-grain pilaf is straightforward and pleasant. Salmon in a slightly watery mushroom sauce is good, but it would be better if the sauce was  more concentrated. The food can be uneven. One night we had to send a strip steak back twice before it was cooked correctly, and another night the grilled pork chop was painfully dry. The cured salmon can be an exercise in saltiness. And onion rings were soggy and missing half their batter. But none of that kept me away. The smoking did. One night I returned from dinner smelling like an ashtray and decided I did not want to go back to Onieal\\'s until the management did something about the atmosphere. Now it has. The owner, Chris Onieal, has installed a special, very expensive  filter system. I am happy to report that it seems to be effective. Still, if you\\'re the sort of person who would rather not watch people smoke,  Onieal\\'s is definitely not for you. \"I don\\'t feel the least bit sorry for the people who feel forced out,\" said one of my favorite smokers as she settled onto a banquette and considered the fate of the nonsmokers. She lighted a cigarette,  exhaled a stream of smoke and added plaintively, \"There are so few places left for us.\" Onieal\\'s Grand Street  * 174 Grand Street, Little Italy, (212) 941-9119. Ambiance: Warm wood, carved ceiling and lots of smoke; this cozy restaurant has only 34 seats, making cigarettes legal. Service: Charming, helpful and occasionally slow. Recommended dishes: Beet noodle and arugula salad; lobster fricassee; barbecued venison pot pie; juniper-cured salmon; crab cakes with vegetable slaw; roast chicken with mashed potatoes and pasilla sauce; grilled pork chop with apple and onion dressing; striped sea bass in saffron shellfish broth; four devils cake; espresso float. Wine list: Not nearly so inventive as the menu; prices are fair. Hours: Lunch: 11:30 A.M. to 3 P.M. Tuesdays through Saturdays; dinner: 5:30 to 11:30 P.M. Mondays through Saturdays, until 10:30 P.M. Sundays; late-night menu: 11:30 P.M. to 1 A.M. Mondays through Saturdays. Price range: Lunch: appetizers $6 to $12, entrees $6 to $14; dinner: appetizers $6 to $13, entrees, $15 to $26. Desserts: $7. Credit cards: All major cards. Wheelchair accessibility: One step up to dining room; restrooms are down a flight of stairs.',\n",

       "  'review': 'If you close one eye to the nearby television station as you approach L\\'Absinthe, it is easy to believe that you are in Paris. The specialties of the house are scrawled in white script on the outside walls and the doors are folded back to allow the tables to spill onto the sidewalk. Inside, the etched glass, mirrors, polished brass and ancient clocks give the restaurant the familiar warmth of a typical bistro. But there is a difference: the prices are lower than those at most modern Paris bistros. And the food is better. This is not as impressive as it sounds; the sad truth is that the great Paris bistro is an endangered species. Finding one requires research, advice and careful planning, and even then the results are often deeply disappointing. In that respect, L\\'Absinthe is very French; while the food is better than that of the average bistro along the banks of the Seine, the restaurant serves up its own set of disappointments. This is especially surprising because the chef is Jean-Michel Bergougnoux, the talented man whose American career has encompassed Le Regence, Lutece, Le Cygne and most recently Raphael. In May, he joined Jean Denoyer as a partner in Le Comptoir, and the two renamed the restaurant and changed the menu. Mr. Bergougnoux is working in a homier style than he used to; this is not a man from whom we have come to expect roast chicken. Sometimes this works. His saucisson chaud, generous slices of poached sausage paired with potatoes and lentils, is perfect French bistro food, the sort of dish that rosy-cheeked men sit down to eat in old French movies. And while I have never seen any of the Chanel-clad women who patronize the place eating the dish, they do seem to enjoy the plateau de fruits de mer. Who can blame them? The astonishing assortment of crabs, lobsters, crayfish, langoustines, oysters and clams is enough food to keep six people happily cracking shells for quite some time. At $8 a person, it is also a bargain. And for dessert, there is not a crisper, more buttery or better warm apple tart in all of New York. But why are the mussels, steamed with white wine, curry and chives, sometimes overcooked? Does the roast chicken need to be quite so forceful a reminder that American chickens don\\'t have much flavor? And does the veal risotto really need to be quite so soggy? There have been nights when I imagined Mr. Bergougnoux, a chef I admire, back at the stove and bored to tears. The service has its moments, too. Le Comptoir had a devoted following, which seems thrilled with its successor. One night in May, our waiter was so busy greeting his old and valued customers that he barely had time for us. Between gushing \"You look wonderful, Mrs. So-and-So!\" and gushing \"How nice to see you, Mr. D!\" he managed to shout the specials at us and disappear. As the wait stretched on, he passed by occasionally to squeeze my shoulder and murmur soothingly, \"You\\'re next.\" The ultimate moment of the meal came when he delivered the final course with these unforgettable words: \"Yummy, yummy, yummy, this is good. Here comes dessert.\" These nights, however, the service is impeccable. It is summer in the city, much of the Upper East Side has gone to the country and L\\'Absinthe has the leisure to be nice to us. Finger bowls arrive right behind the cold seafood, bread is endlessly passed, wine is punctiliously poured. And if you order just right, a meal here can be a true pleasure. Meals begin with tiny gougeres, peppery little cheese puffs that are absolutely irresistible when they arrive warm. As a first course, the saucisson chaud is unbeatable, and the salad of endive, Roquefort and smoked duck breast is very good. One night there was also a fine tomato tartar surrounded by sauteed chicken livers that tasted like France on a plate. But I have serious reservations about the terrine of foie gras, which is layered with portobello mushrooms. It looks very pretty but the mushrooms have an almost chalky quality that interferes with the smooth richness of the liver. The best of the main courses is the Moroccan-style salmon, the spicy, crusty fish served with couscous and preserved lemons. Loin of lamb is set on a rustic gratin of eggplant and zucchini that is deeply satisfying. The hanger steak with garlicky sauteed potatoes and a red-wine sauce is delicious. And if the roasted free-range chicken is something of a letdown, the accompanying potatoes mashed with chives and perfumed with hazelnut oil are not. Steak tartare, on the other hand, a fine mound of raw chopped meat, would be better without the pedestrian french fries and the too-fried greens on the plate. The potatoes were identifiable, but the oil-drenched leaves were not. Desserts, however, are always impeccable. The warm chocolate cake with the melting center may be a standard New York dessert, but it is well executed. The lemon tart is just as sour as it should be. Creme caramel is perfumed with fennel and lime, and the sorbets are truly fruity. None of them, however, can hold a candle to that apple tart. There are other pleasures here. A pleasant wine list. Good espresso. And the illusion of Paris, which you can hold onto until you get at least halfway down the block. L\\'Absinthe  * 227 East 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 794-4950. Ambiance: The former Le Comptoir has not changed; it is still a perfect re-creation of a French bistro. Service: Although generally very professional, the waiters tend to take care of longtime customers to the detriment of newer ones. Recommended dishes: Saucisson chaud with potatoes and lentils, cold seafood platter, Moroccan-style salmon with couscous, pan-seared loin of lamb with gratin of eggplant and zucchini, hanger steak with red-wine sauce, thin crusty apple tart, warm chocolate cake, lemon tart, creme caramel with fennel and lime. Wine list: The French and American list is short but beautifully chosen for this food, and it is fairly priced. Hours: Dinner only, from 6 to 11 P.M. Mondays through Saturdays; after Labor Day, dinner will be served on Sundays also. Price range: Appetizers $7.50 to $13, entrees $19 to $25.50, desserts $7.50 to $9. Credit cards: All major cards. Wheelchair accessibility: There is one small step up to the dining room.

       "  'review': 'Surrounded by the murmuring Italian waiters, it is easy to get lost in this elegantly spare room. With my eyes on the muted yellow walls and my arms cooled  by the breeze, I imagine that Florence is just outside the long windows. Then a  woman goes to the pay phone near the kitchen and ruins the illusion. Her voice rises, becoming increasingly strident until the sound of her anger has invaded the serenity of Savore and booted me firmly into reality. The woman at the next  table adjusts the silver bracelets on her wrist, looks at the menu and asks: \"Wild boar? Have you ever eaten wild boar?\" The architect of this new restaurant in SoHo has eloquently captured the essence of an Italian trattoria. And the chef is trying to capture the essence of Tuscan Renaissance cooking, offering exotic dishes rarely found on New York menus. But here\\'s the question: Is that possible? The cooking of Renaissance Florence was unlike anything we now think of as Italian food. Tomatoes were unknown in Europe until Columbus landed in the New World, and while the Florentines immediately took to beans (another New World import), it was more than 200 years before they developed a taste for tomatoes.  So it is unlikely that pappa al pomodoro, the first dish on Savore\\'s menu, had a big following in Renaissance Tuscany. The version here isn\\'t likely to gain much of a following either; pappa al pomodoro, a wonderful mush of bread, tomatoes and olive oil, is a great dish when made with first-rate, in-season tomatoes. At Savore, it is a pleasant but slightly dull dish. Tuscan cooking is characterized by quality and austerity. The cuisine is based upon excellent ingredients simply cooked. That is what makes Tuscan food so appealing and so hard to duplicate on foreign soil. Many of the dishes at Savore require ingredients that simply cannot be found in New York City. Consider the many boar-based dishes. Truly wild boar has a robust, gamy flavor that tends to dominate every dish it is in. But the boar that is available in New York is a tame creature with none of those characteristics. So  cinghiale alla maremmana (the marshlands of Maremma are famous for game animals  like wild boar) is not as exciting as its name, but merely a stew made of olives and what tastes like particularly tough beef. Budino di granturco in salsa cinghiale, a sort of timbale of polenta topped with boar sauce, turns into a pleasant but delicate little dish. And the ragu of wild boar is more notable for the lightness of the wide pappardelle noodles on which it is served than for the flavor of the sauce. No matter how they are topped, most of the pasta dishes are excellent. And reasonable; the most expensive is $12.50, a dish of silky spaghetti with half a  small lobster and some simple tomato sauce. Would people in 15th-century Florence have eaten this? No, but it is their loss. They did eat spaghetti alla  chitarra, dense strands of hand-cut pasta, although probably not tossed with basil and roasted tomatoes but with grated cheese, sugar and cinnamon. Still, this dish is good enough to make anyone, from any era, happy. A couple of the pastas are authentic Renaissance recipes. One is tagliolini,  delicate strands of pasta tossed with lots of butter and lemon, a rich and flavorful dish. Another is ravioli filled with ricotta, thinly sliced lemons and a bit of sugar. And if the tomato sauce atop the raviloi is a modern addition, so be it. I like many of the antipasti too. Rotolo di radicchio, leaves of grilled radicchio rolled around a filling of mozzarella, capers and anchovies, is strong and exciting. Alternating bitterness and brininess with the smoke from the grill, it is easy to imagine that this is an ancient taste. Monkfish with artichoke hearts is equally unusual. A pale green still life of artichoke hearts mounded with diced squares of fish and topped with olive oil, it is complex and compelling. Calamari is stuffed with a vegetable mixture, sliced into rounds and served rising from a sea of tomato sauce (again), looking like some great medieval creature. But many of the main courses are disappointing. Pigeon is boned and rolled, mixed with truffles, sliced and served in a wine sauce. A Renaissance dish in both texture and presentation, it would be great made with tasty pigeons and smoky truffles. But since none of the ingredients taste like much, it doesn\\'t quite come off. Boneless pieces of chicken mixed with olives and rosemary also seem authentic, but the forceful flavors leave the poor city chicken in the dust. And cacciucco, like most of the fish soups served in New York Italian restaurants, is a bowl of red broth filled with mussels, mealy shrimp and bits of overcooked fish and perfumed more with garlic than with seafood. Pastry came late to Florence, but given the Tuscan taste for sugar, it was immediately popular. The desserts at Savore pay homage to the tradition; each is a fine sweet. My favorites were a fluffy lemon tart and a densely delicious bittersweet chocolate cake. When did chocolate arrive in Tuscany? I was wondering about that when the woman at the next table got up and started working the room. Listening to her loud, local voice, I realized that no matter how authentic the ambiance, it is impossible to bring a real Italian trattoria to New York City. And even more impossible to import one serving food from the 15th century. Savore  * 200 Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 431-1212.

       "  'review': \"For at least some of this season, San Pietro, a wildly popular, two-and-a-half-year-old midtown sibling of Sistina on the Upper East Side, was decorated with baskets of eggplants and cauliflower and plates piled high with tomatoes. But something was wrong with the picture. Those tomatoes were plump and pale, and come to think of it, who wants to eat tomatoes in the middle of January? And wouldn't you think somebody might have remembered to take the cellophane off the cauliflower? Even though it was not straight from the farm, the illusion of freshness is always welcome. San Pietro, it turns out, is not in the illusion business. Nobody bothers to pretend that new customers are favored patrons, and the service is often perfunctory. After a few meals at the restaurant, I was not surprised to be kept waiting one afternoon while the coat-check woman had an argument on the pay phone. In exasperation I finally went in and grabbed my own coat; she didn't even deign to look up. It was pretty much what I had come to expect from the people who work at San Pietro. Consider my most recent dinner. We had asked for seats in the no-smoking section, which turned out to be a mixed blessing. On this particular evening, each of the tables in the more attractive front dining room seemed to be occupied by gentlemen smoking enormous cigars. Wreaths of smoke spiraled lazily into the air. It wasn't particularly appealing but the bare, crowded room behind the bar where we were seated had its own drawbacks. Too many diners were being served by far too few waiters. The servers went dashing busily about but they neglected to bring water, forgot to pour the wine, removed our first courses before we were finished, brought us food destined for other tables and finally delivered coffee we hadn't ordered. I have rarely felt less cared for. Still, I knew it wasn't personal; none of the other people in the crush around us were faring any better. The menu, which features dishes from the Amalfi coast near Naples, looked unusual and appealing. The endless list of specials -- much too long to remember -- sounded great too. So despite the lackluster service, I was hopeful. Especially after the arrival of bruschetta, crisply toasted slices of bread brushed with olive oil and topped with a good, garlicky mixture of tomatoes. Right behind them came skinny strips of fried zucchini, which turned out to be undercooked and faintly greasy. After that, it was pretty much downhill. Grilled porcini were soggy and limp and topped with shavings of tired truffles. Cauliflower salad, a dull blend of marinated cauliflower, onions and sun-dried tomatoes, tasted like a recipe that might have been printed in the Ladies' Home Journal in the 1950's. Grilled eggplant was not quite grilled enough, which gave it a rubbery character. And the pasta we tried was not much of an improvement. Tegole alla San Pietro, an unusual offering, turned out to be long, wide strips of fresh pasta tossed with carrots, artichokes, garlic and olive oil. It was tasty enough, but slightly greasy and unattractively gray. There was one shiningly delicious dish, a perfectly cooked grilled sea bass served with roasted potatoes and a huge heap of spinach. I liked the braised black sea bass, too, cooked with fennel and pungent red wine. Grilled John Dory was simple and enjoyable. But then the rabbit arrived, and it was awful; the poor animal had been cooked with sun-dried tomatoes, peppers and herbs until it was a tough, hard, unappetizing mess. And although a grilled chicken alla diavola was perfectly fine, we had turned cranky: the sheer effort of attempting conversation in the din had worn us out. Lunch a week later was a rather different experience. Arriving at 1:30, we were seated in the front room where, we were assured, the smoke would not bother us. It didn't. The waiter was charmingly solicitous as he recited an entire list of specials. They sounded good. They weren't. The low point was the risotto of the day, seafood. Its aroma preceded it, growing stronger as it approached. And then there it was, a mushy plate of rice filled with hard bits of octopus and squid, a few scallops and some unidentifiable fish. It was decorated with small, overcooked Manila clams, a couple of tiny green-lipped mussels and smack in the middle of the plate, a single wedge of one of those anemic tomatoes. The other special smelled better but tasted every bit as unpleasant. Doughy ravioli filled with a puree of broccoli rape were covered with a bland tomato sauce. The sauce wasn't wonderful, but the ravioli were so gummy that with your eyes closed you could not have said which was the pasta, which the filling. This spectacular repast was crowned by a dreary lemon pie and something advertised as a raspberry-filled vanilla pudding. There were raspberries; the pudding, however, was lemon. San Pietro clearly can produce good food: the many regular customers seem to know how to navigate the menu and each time I've been at the restaurant the food on all the other tables has looked better than mine. In the course of five visits, I had a few wonderful dishes. Fresh sardines, grilled and served with a small salad. Many fine pastas, including handmade fusilli with a lamb ragout and malloreddus, little multi-colored cones that are a specialty of Sardinia. Carpaccio was admirable, and once I had the best roast suckling pig I've had in New York City. And with the exception of a few undercooked vegetables, every dish I ordered from the grill was beautifully executed. The staff can also provide good service when so inclined. Unfortunately, it often isn't, especially in the back room. Maybe I've just had bad luck. Even so, the prices are high and the details sloppy. On my last visit, the cauliflower had disappeared: in its place was a bunch of broccoli rape still wearing a bright pink brand label. San Pietro   Satisfactory   18 East 54th Street, Manhattan, (212) 753-9015. Atmosphere: The room in the front is festive, smoke-filled and crowded; the no-smoking area in the back is simply crowded. Service: Depending on the time of the day and the luck of the draw, it can be charming and helpful or gruff, harried and forgetful. Recommended dishes: Bruschetta, carpaccio, grilled seafood, black sea bass braised with fennel and red wine, grilled John Dory, grilled chicken alla diavola, grilled veal chop. Wine list: The Italian and American wines include many excellent bottles at fair prices, but the waiters are not particularly helpful in selecting them. Price range: Lunch: appetizers $7 to $13, pastas $16 to $17, entrees $17 to $25, desserts $7 to $8; dinner: appetizers $9 to $14, pastas $16 to $18, entrees $17 to $25, desserts $7 to $8.

       "  'review': 'Each time an Italian restaurant opens in New York City, the owners have to come up with a compelling reason for customers to patronize their establishment instead of the 2,200 other Italian restaurants in town. I don\\'t think chocolate-covered eggplant quite works. When the owners of Positano decided to move their restaurant from the Flatiron district to TriBeCa, they kept the chef, Luigi Celentano, but changed the name to Gigino (pronounced jee-JEE-noh). They also changed the menu; one can only think that the inclusion of a dish like risotto with squid ink and raspberry juice is an attempt to convince potential customers that this is more than just another Italian restaurant. It certainly brought me through the door: I find it impossible to resist a dish like linguine with jellyfish. Having ordered the dish, however, I was doubly disappointed to discover that the jellyfish was little more than an interesting textural note in an otherwise unexceptional plate of pasta. And when the risotto with squid ink and raspberry juice did not turn out to be some fabulous culinary invention but even more horrible than I imagined it would be, I felt cheated. And so I settled into the cozy room, trying to enjoy the frank fakery that makes it look like a set for a play about happy peasants in a rustic Tuscan hall, and ordered the ordinary dishes. Unlike the place on Park Avenue South, Gigino has very reasonable prices and lovely service. \"How are you tonight?\" asked our waiter at my last dinner at Gigino. His accent was so rich and intriguing I began to ask inane questions about the food just to hear him speak. \"Ah, yes,\" he said, \"spaghetti del padrino is one of our finest dishes. The spaghetti is mixed with beets, escarole, garlic, olive oil and just a touch of anchovy. You must try it.\" He went on to recommend the grouper sauteed with scallions, tomato and black beans in a voice so delicious that I ordered the dish, even though I knew it would be a mistake. It was; who ever heard of black beans on an Italian fish? He talked me into a pizza too, despite the fact that the last time I tried it the crust was flabby, almost soggy, and the cheese rubbery. It was this time, too. My guest and I consoled ourselves with a bottle of Jermann Vintage Tunina, a good wine and, at $40, a very good buy. As he set the appetizers before us, our waiter had the proprietary air of a cook. \"Look what I have made for you!\" his face seemed to say. \"You will be so happy!\" And I would have been had the grilled baby calamari, which was topped with bits of lemongrass, been cleaned just a little bit better and not arrived astride a mushy mound of couscous. I would have been more appreciative of the fried calamari if there had been a few tentacles mixed in with the rings of squid. And had the grilled vegetables been as flavorful as they were colorful, they would have made me happier. On the other hand, nothing I can think of could have made the cold, dull meats and cheeses on the antipasto plate appealing. The next course was an improvement: on the whole, Gigino\\'s pastas are impressive. Spaghetti del padrino turned out to be as good as the waiter promised: a beautiful mix of colors and textures that tasted absolutely terrific. I\\'d go back for that. I would go back for the spaghetti with clams, too, an occasional special that is a lovely tangle of pasta, cockles, sliced garlic and parsley. And the bucatini all\\'amatriciana is an old-fashioned mix of tomatoes, pancetta, onions and cheese that has not lost its charm. But every entree I have tried has been disappointing. A veal chop, ordered on the rare side, was very cooked. Roasted free-range chicken was so sad and dry that even the valiant efforts of the onions, carrots and white wine with which it was cooked could not revive it. A special lamb roasted with red wine, agnello alla romana, was pleasantly flavored with anchovy, but the meat was stringy. The artichokes on the plate were very undercooked, not necessarily a bad thing except that their crisp greenness made them seem as if they belonged in a different dish. And chicken \"osso buco\" had only one redeeming feature: the little chicken \"shanks\" with their naked bones cost only $12. When Gigino is busy, the room can be so clamorous it is impossible to hear what your companions are saying, but as it begins to empty, the buzz dies down. In the calm, the pleasant service can be very relaxing. \"Do try the melanzane al cioccolata,\" urged the waiter with the interesting accent, admitting that he had learned English by listening to Shakespeare. Before I knew it, I had ordered the eggplant. I am fascinated by unusual desserts. I have eaten sweet spinach pies and liked them. I love goat cheese mashed with sugar, too. Still, even I would not normally order caramelized eggplant stuffed with mascarpone cheese and coated with chocolate. I took one bite. Then I took another. This is what I thought: This is not the worst thing I have ever eaten. The other desserts were less exotic and more appealing. Torta bebe was a sort of sweet custard cake with cherries. Tiramisu, never my favorite dessert, was about as good as it ever is. As for the pastiera, an Italian cheesecake, wouldn\\'t you know that Gigino\\'s version was dotted with barley and flavored with orange flower water? The cheesecake isn\\'t bad. But like the other unusual dishes on the menu, it is not reason enough to choose Gigino over the other Italian restaurants in town. But then, the sweet service and reasonable pasta prices might be. Gigino * 323 Greenwich Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-1112. Atmosphere: The former Tommy Tang\\'s has been stripped down to the bare walls and given the air of a hokey, rustic Italian room. Service: Casual and pleasant. Recommended dishes: Spaghetti del padrino, spaghetti with clams, bucatini all\\'amatriciana, tiramisu. Wine list: The mostly Italian list has some big names, interesting selections and reasonable prices but it would be much more appealing if it included vintage years.

       "  'review': 'The woman at the next table is wearing a hat. A black one that makes her look as if she left her horse at the door and strolled in after a ride around the plantation. She slides into her seat, takes a sip from her friend\\'s glass and looks down at the menu. She smiles and says, \"Oh, I adore this!\" She says it in French. This does not distinguish her from the other people in the room, half of whom are speaking French. On an ordinary afternoon, Le Colonial looks like a lazy tropical restaurant and sounds like the Champs-Elysees. But it smells like something else: mingled with all that expensive perfume is the scent of lemongrass and coconut and crushed peanuts. On a good day, you can even detect the racy aroma of fried chilies. This oddly American combination of Eurochic and Indochina could be awful. It isn\\'t. Somehow these overdressed women in this overheated atmosphere, these potted palms in this darkly shuttered room, create an ambiance that is very appealing. Le Colonial is fun. \"We have found our new place!\" cries a women at the next table, waving to her friends and calling for the hostess. They want to book the table for the next day and the next. \"We will come every day,\" she gushes. \"The food is delicious! And it has no calories!\" Is that why they are here? Perhaps; it is entirely possible to order a meal at Le Colonial that sparkles with flavor and has almost no fat. Vietnamese cuisine, as interpreted here, is sedate Asian fare that is more delicate than Chinese food, less spicy than Thai and notable mostly for its abundance of vegetables and its absence of grease. Goi cuon is a perfect example, salad that has been transformed into finger food. Lettuce, shrimp, bean sprouts, skinny slivers of rice noodle and herbs are wrapped up in sheets of rice paper. The compact little bundles are served with an aromatic peanut sauce on the side; you simply pick up a roll of salad and dip it into the sauce. I have had livelier versions of this dish, but I found this one very appealing. Spring rolls at Le Colonial are so delicate you tend to forget that they are fried. Once you have wrapped the crisp cylinders in leaves of lettuce, garnished them with sprigs of mint and cilantro and added a few slivers of carrot, each one seems more like a crunchy bite of salad than something doused with oil. The classic Vietnamese nuoc cham, a dipping sauce made of sugar, vinegar, lime juice, fish sauce, chilies and garlic, adds a bit of punch. It is no surprise to look over at the next table and find that the women have rolled up their silk sleeves and are dipping with gusto. When the banh cuon arrive they exclaim with delight. \"How pretty!\" they chorus, looking down at translucent little dumplings glistening beneath a scattering of chilies and cilantro. The menu translation, Vietnamese ravioli, does not do justice to these clear packets filled with bright flavors. They may be hard to snare with chopsticks, but the effort is rewarded: the dumplings, filled with chicken, shrimp and mushrooms, have a fresh, clean, mildly exotic taste. The waiter has steered my neighbors away from goi bo, which was, I think wise. The beef salad is the only really spicy dish I\\'ve had here. Rare slices of meat are sparked with lemongrass, basil and enough chili to make those who do not like hot food unhappy. I loved the dish, and I loved the fact that this salad is served with such a generous hand that it would make a substantial meal. A sweet, rich smell goes wafting past the table. I look up to see a plate of grilled spareribs passing by. The scents of lemongrass, garlic, chilies and pork linger in the air long after the plate is gone. The next table has suddenly become so quiet that I order some ribs for myself. They are good enough to stop conversation: fragrant, chewy and just lightly herbal. Steamed fish is also a conversation stopper. The preparation is simple, but the fish has been cooked with so many herbs, vegetables and spices that the flesh has absorbed a pleasantly savory taste. The flesh near the bone is especially sweet. But there are disappointments too. Goi du du, a classic salad made of green papaya, is soggy and dull. The best versions of this dish offer really crisp shreds of papaya mingled with coriander, roast peanuts and either pork or dried beef. Here the papaya is limp and the meat has been replaced by even limper shreds of chicken breast. I did not much like Le Colonial salad either, an odd combination of mesclun, daikon and pineapple. It is especially unappealing when you think about the other vegetables you could be eating: grilled eggplant in a spicy basil lime sauce, or bright, long pods of steamed okra that crunch slightly when you take a bite and could change forever your image of this often unappealing vegetable. At the next table, they end the meal with mangos and cups of Vietnamese coffee. At our table, we sip the last of the wine, a tart pink Domaines Ott rose that goes perfectly with this food and is extremely well priced. I know my neighbors will be coming back tomorrow, and for a moment I contemplate doing the same. I\\'d love to see what they\\'ll be wearing. Le Colonial ** 149 East 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 752-0808. Atmosphere: It could be \"Casablanca,\" the movie, with all these ceiling fans, potted palms and talk about Paris.

       "  'review': 'Why are there so many bad Chinese restaurants in New York? Blame it on the politicians. The first wave of immigrants from Southern China came to this country from the Pearl River Delta in 1848. The earliest to arrive were men who went to work in the gold mines, on the railroads and on farms, intending to send for their families once their fortunes were made. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 changed all that. Because subsequent immigration was all but prohibited, the first Chinatowns were largely bachelor societies. The men knew very little about cooking, but they yearned for the food of the villages they had left behind. They did their best to recreate it, and this clumsy cooking is what Americans came to know as Chinese food: sticky sweet-and-sour pork, leaden egg rolls, greasy chow mein. The first large group of women did not arrive until 1945, after the repeal of the Exclusion Act and passage of the War Brides Act. But the big change in Chinese cooking in America came in 1965 when the Hart-Celler Act changed the quotas, increasing Asian immigration and bringing an influx of Chinese chefs. In the meantime, several generations of Americans had grown up on a bad parody of a great cuisine. Americans have welcomed each new style of Chinese cooking, falling for the spiciness of Sichuan in the early 70\\'s and the simplicity of Hong Kong cooking in recent years (courtesy of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which greatly increased the colony\\'s quotas). Still, Americans remain lamentably wedded to old ideas. Most Chinese restaurants are so wary of American customers they don\\'t even bother to offer them their best regional specialties. Which brings me to Tang Pavilion. Chinese friends kept insisting that this calm and lovely midtown restaurant served wonderful food. And yet the menu was filled with pedestrian dishes. There I sat, eating dreary Seafood Delight and Big Apple Chicken, watching elegant Chinese men eating what looked like elegant Chinese dishes. What was I doing wrong? I was not, it turns out, asking for the Shanghai menu. The cooking of Eastern China -- from cities like Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou -- is still relatively hard to find in the United States. It is a complex cuisine, much prized in China and quite different from the more familiar southern food. As soon as I found out that there was a special menu of Shanghai specialties, printed in English, Tang Pavilion was transformed for me. I discovered all the rich dishes I had seen on other tables. I immediately ordered a plate of drunken chicken and sat back to savor its deep, musky flavor. The chicken had been steeped in the local shao hsing wine until the flesh was silky and aromatic. It was a cool, simple but extremely satisfying dish. Next we had \"vegetable pie,\" a terrine made of many thin layers of dried bean curd. It was subtle, delicate, deeply delicious. Shanghai, which is famous for its vegetarian dishes, has devised hundreds of interesting ways to use bean curd. One of my favorite dishes at Tang Pavilion is green bean and tofu sheet: long white bands of almost translucent dried bean curd tossed with small bright green beans. The combination was fresh and light, like some delightful new take on pasta. Looking through the menu I spied baby eel, a famous Eastern Chinese dish. It must be eaten with great speed; as soon as the dish loses its heat it loses its appeal. Tang Pavilion\\'s version was fabulous, a mixture of sweet, slender strips of eel, yellow chives and ginger. We followed it with hearts of Chinese cabbage steamed with velvety black mushrooms, a perfect end to the meal. There were even more interesting dishes on the menu, but they required advance notice. So a week later I gathered a group and returned for a feast. We began by nibbling on pickles: triangles of turnip marinated in sesame oil, chewy pieces of pressed bean curd, salty preserved greens. Peanuts sprinkled with shards of dried seaweed were impossible to resist. A beautiful plate of cold hors d\\'oeuvres contained more of that wonderful drunken poached chicken, long golden strands of jellyfish slicked with sesame oil and crisp curly strips of baby eel, a sort of elegant jerky. Soup was so potent and so fragrant that the scent preceded the tureen to the table. The aroma was chicken, but what you tasted was the salty-sweet flavor of shredded ham and the earthiness of black mushrooms. Nestled in the bottom of each bowl was a single delicate crescent of egg dumpling. The centerpiece of the dinner was braised duck stuffed with sweet rice, a masterpiece the color of mahogany. Soft enough to eat with chopsticks, this dish would make any meal into a banquet. It was so rich it was almost impossible to eat more than a couple of bites, so delicious it was hard to stop yourself from having more. Next there were fillets of yellow fish wrapped in sheets of bean curd and deep-fried. They crackled invitingly each time you took a bite. The crisp puffs of fish had a clean, fresh flavor that filled your mouth and then quickly vanished. One of the most famous Eastern dishes is named for a poet and statesman of the 11th century, Su Tung-po, who wrote the recipe in the form of a poem: Over a slow fire, with a little water, Simmer till soft A very good taste. The recipe has changed very little since then. The pork is braised in soy sauce, rice wine, sugar and ginger, then steamed until the flesh has the texture of butter. At Tang Pavilion the sweet, soft chunks of meat were stuffed into chewy white buns and turned into seductive little sandwiches. If this had been a Western meal, it would have been followed by salad. Being Chinese, there was the simplicity of bright green, quickly cooked pea shoots (dou miao) and small bowls of rice. As we sat sipping tea and eating fruit we wondered why all these dishes had been segregated on a separate menu. Was it because the waiters got tired of telling people, \"you won\\'t like that\" when they tried to order sea cucumber (another wonderful Shanghai specialty that has the consistency of hard Jell-O)? Were they weary of warning diners about all the bones in stewed fish tail? Or does Tang Pavilion simply fear that its best dishes will not be appreciated by an American audience? Whatever the answer, the very fact that the Shanghai menu is printed in English is a hopeful sign. A few years ago, the menu would have been written entirely in Chinese characters. Times do change. Tang Pavilion ** 65 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 956-6888. Atmosphere: Spare, elegant and comfortable. Service: Professional and helpful; ask for advice.

All around the restaurant, people are huddled over grills, drinking and talking and gesturing wildly as great gusts of fragrant steam go billowing toward the ceiling. Men scurry about with buckets of blazing coals, replenishing the fires at each table, and waitresses walk past bearing trays laden with vegetables as bright as jewels. The air smells of smoke and sugar and chilies and garlic, and the whole atmosphere is so inviting that you are irresistibly drawn into the center of the room. Why hasn't Korean food become more popular in New York City? This is a puzzle because of all the Asian cuisines, Korean is most accessible to the American palate. Long ago we rose above our distrust of garlic and began our continuing romance with Chinese cooking. Then we overcame our fear of raw fish and learned to love Japanese. When Thai food came along, it seduced half the country. But most of us have yet to discover Korean cooking, which offers a great many things we already love (beef, barbecue, the opportunity to graze) and presents very few obstacles. (Well, you do have to love garlic and chilies.) This may be because Koreans are perfectly content to keep their food to themselves. Walk along 32d Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas and you find a self-contained little neighborhood of shops, supermarkets and restaurants catering to a mostly Korean clientele. Even Kang Suh, which I have found to be the friendliest restaurant on the street, has a menu that is hard to navigate. Some of the dishes are translated; many are not. If you assume that you won't like the latter, you'll be wrong. Gul pajun is not translated on this menu, but I've never met anyone who didn't like the large floppy pancake full of oysters and scallions, which is one of Korea's most famous specialties. (At Kang Suh you'll find it on the fifth page of the menu, listed with the pan-fried dishes.) Among the world's most seductive dishes, gul pajun is as large as a pizza and comes cut into wedges, which you pick up in your fingers and dip into a piquant soy-vinegar sauce. If you don't like oysters, try the plain scallion pancake, pajun, or the seafood pancake, haemul pajun. In Korea, diners graze their way through every meal, moving across a landscape laden with bowls. Each meal begins with a multitude of side dishes; soon the table is covered with little bowls of kimchi (pickled vegetables) and namul (salad). At Kang Suh you never know what each day will bring, but there is always cabbage kimchi, the fiery chili-laden pickle that most people think of as the only kimchi. Actually, kimchi can be made of many vegetables; you might find kimchis made of cubed radish, cucumbers or turnips, and you might find that they include dried squid, little dried fish or even rich, chewy chunks of raw crab. Then there will be a few salads: almost always minarinamul, which is a refreshing watercress salad, and sometimes potato salad, startling in its familiarity. Usually there is some sort of shredded turnip, drenched in sesame oil and sprinkled with sesame seeds. These flavors -- some hot, some mild, some sour, some sweet -- offer a balance made of contrasts. Balance is the goal in a Korean meal. Kang Suh makes ordering easy by separating its large menu into categories. If you choose dishes from the different parts of the menu, you will end up with a meal of typical Korean variety. The barbecue is the most fun. First the coal man arrives and lifts your glowing fuel into the pit at the center of the table. Then the waitress appears with your meat: bul goki and kal bi (steak and short ribs) are the best known, but the adventurous might want to experiment with tripe, tongue or squid. She will also have platters of lettuce, dipping sauce and little pots of kochujang, a sweet red pepper paste that is one of the staple foods of Korea. The waitress puts the meat on the griddle with long tongs, but after that you're on your own. When the meat is cooked, you put a piece on a leaf of lettuce, spread it with a bit of kochujang, add a little rice and roll the whole thing into a neat bundle. It is entirely satisfying food. In Korea, nobody would make an entire meal of meat. They might alternate bites of barbecue with one of the so-called pan-broiled dishes. These are actually stir-fries; I particularly like o-jing ae bokum, or spicy squid, and duk bokum, an odd juxtaposition of sliced rice cake as bland as baby food with a sauce that is pure pepper. To temper these dishes, slurp a little bowl of naeng myon, long slippery buckwheat noodles in icy broth. Jap chae is also good as a fire-chaser; the clear noodles are stir-fried with little bits of beef and vegetables. Jap chae is listed in the section of the menu called side dishes. This is the most puzzling part of the menu because most dishes are not translated.  Here you'll find kalbi zim, the wonderful Korean beef stew, ribs braised in soy and sesame and ginger and spices until the meat falls from the bone. And mandu, the ravioli of Korea, which makes perfect little pauses between bites of spice. For the final dish, look at the section of the menu called chef's specialties. The list is long and varied, but virtually everything here is a soup. Korean chefs have more interesting ways with tofu than almost anybody else; try doo boo jigae, bean curd floating in an aromatic and very spicy broth. Or soon doo boo jigae, which is made from soft tofu, each curd as tender and enticing as a just-poached egg. And I almost always order a bowl of jo gae tang, a simple soup made of large steamed clams that has a clean and refreshing character. By now the fire is out, the last crunchy bits of meat have been eaten, and you are left with just a few sultry bites of kimchee. Wash it down with soju, the refreshingly sweet vodka made from sweet potatoes, and a bite of orange. Then go out into the raucous streets, the sweet smell of garlic and sugar and chilies still clinging to your hair, grateful that this restaurant is always open.

       "  'review': 'Like a long-running Broadway show, Orso has remained vital and fresh despite many cast changes over the years. This offshoot of the Joe Allen empire opened in 1985 when Restaurant Row on West 46th Street seemed headed toward gastronomic senescence. Almost single-handedly, Orso brought back the Broadway movers and shakers, instilling new life into the block. Orso\\'s step-down main dining room is dominated by a high arching skylight that creates a cheerful, sunny setting at lunch; in the evening it creates a sense of spaciousness. Soft ocher tones and wood trim contribute to a casual, contemporary setting. Walls are covered with publicity photographs of sports and entertainment celebrities. In the back an open tile-and-steel kitchen churns out pizzas, pastas and appealing grilled fare. Orso\\'s service style can be off-putting. If you order wine, a waiter or waitress brings it, removes the cork, plops the bottle on the table and leaves. Self service, they say. A waiter explained that management feels this adds an easygoing \"trattoria feeling\" to the dining room. This laid back attitude extends to servers not knowing who gets what dishes at the table, neglecting to refill water glasses and starting housecleaning while some customers are still in the room. Notwithstanding these lapses, the staff more often than not is good natured, helpful and hard working. The changing menu carries nearly a dozen starters, a selection of small pizzas and a blend of North Italian pastas and entrees. The pizzas are still winners, thin-crusted, crisp and fresh. Among the better ones are those topped with Italian sausage, onions, mozzarella, Parmesan and tomato sauce; and eggplant, spinach and provolone. Fried calamari is hardly worth leaving \"Guys and Dolls\" early for: more spongy than crisp, they get lost in a big green salad. Lentil and spinach soup is better, thick, herby and nicely textured, as is the wonderful smoky potato and cabbage soup. A Neapolitan-style starter of baked eggplant was soothing and tasty, too, essentially a sandwich of sliced eggplant, molten ricotta and sliced tomatoes. Pastas are still a big draw. A lusty Mediterranean composite of shell pasta with black olives, tomatoes, green beans and garlic was tantalizing. So, too, were fusilli with eggplant, pancetta, onions, tomato, mozzarella and onions. Taglierini is a summer winner, tossed with garlic, olive oil, broccoli rape, fava beans, olives and pecorino. One of the best pastas sampled lately was a homey blend of tagliatelle in a veal stew sauce along with Italian sausage, asparagus and Parmesan. Orso has a sensible wine list that matches the food well. Whites begin at $16 and gradually ascend to $38; reds start at $15 and reach $43. Plenty of good selections are available for under $25. Main courses are not so steady as starters. Sauteed sweetbreads with artichokes were as bland as white bread and had a similar texture. An overcooked halibut steak could not be rescued by summery tomato-and-black-olive sauce, and roast pheasant one evening was paper dry. Snapper, on the other hand, arrived perfectly cooked and enlivened with sun-dried tomatoes, garlic and white beans. Garlicky sauteed spinach has an invigorating douse of fresh lemon. One of the best seafood dishes is charred jumbo shrimp, sweet and smoky at the same time, with white beans and garlic. Grilled chicken with eggplant and broccoli rape makes for a light, satisfying lunch, as does grilled swordfish with orzo-and-vegetable salad. When the menu offers spicy sausages it means it: the lean, pepper-laced sausages are accompanied by fire-dousing polenta, olives and roasted sweet peppers. A dessert that is making the rounds in Italian restaurants these days is risotto rice pudding, often made with Arborio rice. The effort was in vain, however, for the texture was glutinous and the flavor nondescript. Better choices are the fresh figs mired in vanilla custard, Amaretto cake with brandy-laced mascarpone and mixed berries, or well-made zabaglione with sliced bananas. Orso is hardly a flawless restaurant. But what it lacks in consistency it makes up for in verve and lack of pretension. After eight celebrity-packed years, that is nice to see. Orso ** 322 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 489-7212. Atmosphere: Sunny and casual setting with open kitchen and skylight. Service: Staff is good-natured and generally hard working. Recommended dishes: Individual pizzas; lentil and spinach soup; potato and cabbage soup; baked eggplant and ricotta; shell pasta with black olives, tomatoes and green beans; tagliatelle with veal stew sauce; snapper with sun-dried tomatoes, garlic and white beans; charred jumbo shrimp with white beans and garlic; spicy sausages with polenta, olives and roasted sweet peppers; zabaglione with sliced bananas. Wine: Limited but well-chosen (mostly Italian) selection with fair prices. Price range: Appetizers $5 to $9, pastas $13, individual pizzas $11 to $12, entrees $17 to $21. Credit cards: Mastercard, Visa. Hours: All-day menu, noon to midnight Sundays, Mondays, Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays; 11:30 A.M. to midnight. Wednesdays and Saturdays. Reservations: Necessary.

       "  'review': 'Let the rakish trattorias around town get all the fashion plates and media mentions. Night after night, Il Mulino is packed more tightly than the box seats at Shea Stadium. And what is this unassuming 11-year-old place\\'s enduring appeal? Certainly not the decor. Il Mulino is a nondescript place with crepuscular lighting, a small bar up front and tables close together in its small wallpapered dining room. The last time Il Mulino was reviewed, in 1988, management had an arrogant habit of making nearly everyone wait 15 minutes or more for a table, even with confirmed reservations. Happily, that seems to have stopped. Il Mulino is not for the itinerant trend-chaser. It attracts conservatively dressed, solid citizens with substantial appetites and incomes to match. While the food is always gratifying, there is another irresistible appeal here. The staff ingratiates itself with customers by serving awesome quantities of food that could make an Italian grandmother look stingy. Before you have a chance to unfold your napkin, waiters charge over with platters of delicious peppery fried zucchini and slabs of toasted Italian bread smothered with minced garlic, chopped basil and tomatoes. Then come slices of richly marbled salami and a plate of zesty marinated mussels. Just as you are contemplating making a meal out of the freebies and calling it a night, a straining waiter hauls over a block of Parmesan the size of an air-conditioner and gouges out a big chunk. \"Now,\" says a beaming captain, \"are you ready to hear the dinner specials?\" The most impressive aspect of the specials is the captain\\'s ability to remember them all, and with such gesticulating drama. My eyes glazed over after 18 dishes. Add to that nearly 60 items on the regular menu, and you need a lap-top computer to keep track of it all. \"Oh, yes,\" the captain adds as an afterthought. \"If there is any other dish you would like, just tell me and we\\'ll make it for you.\" Il Mulino is not a spot for cutting-edge cuisine, but many of the old standards are performed with zeal. Baked clams oreganato, for example, that war horse of the cocktail party circuit, are light, fresh and aromatic with herbs. A special of shrimp sauteed with garlic is equally well turned out, as is the lean, semi-dry bresaola set over salad greens in vinaigrette. Pastas may be the best way to start, although what Il Mulino calls half-portions is called family style elsewhere. Capellini all\\'arrabbiata is a paragon: al dente pasta with a spicy but not fiery sauce and a perfect balance of tomato and garlic. Also good is pappardelle with a pure, bright sauce of ripe tomatoes and basil. The only letdown was a bowl of angel hair pasta in a flat-tasting chicken broth. Risotto here is as refined as you\\'ll find in town; particularly pleasing is the wonderfully textured rendition with porcini and Parmesan. Plenty of gutsy wines are available to go with this lusty food. But it would be nice to see a broader selection under $25. A house favorite entree is osso buco, which must come from a calf of staggering proportions. The shank meat, lean but remarkably tender, is paired with a creamy risotto redolent of saffron. A monstrous veal chop is of unassailable quality, but it could use salt or other seasonings to complement the fresh sage leaves over it. Veal medallions with artichoke hearts and mushrooms were terribly dry on a first sampling, near perfect a week later. One can get a good crusty sirloin steak here or tender fillets of beef in a muscular red wine sauce with shallots and sage. The best poultry dish combines chicken pieces on the bone with artichokes, garlic, sausage and white wine. Among seafood main courses, a worthy special of salmon is reminiscent of a popular dish at Harry Cipriani in midtown. The fillet is seasoned, covered with zucchini \"scales\" and roasted. Declining dessert at Il Mulino is about as easy as persuading a Marine drill sergeant to let you doze an hour later in the morning. The sweets arrive whether you ask for them or not. \"The chef wants you to taste this,\" our waiter offered. Mascarpone and ricotta cheesecake is sublime, minimally sweet and crumbly. Tiramisu is drenched in Kahlua, and hence just sweet. Lemon sorbet served in a hollowed-out lemon and velvety chocolate mousse cake are much better. Then there is the histrionic citrus dessert in which a captain spends 15 minutes surgically dissecting an orange, then dousing it with Grand Marnier. Il Mulino is an alimentary orgy of classical proportions. To some the portions may seem profligate, even offensive. Yet it is obvious that beneath this gesturing is a quality establishment, and a most genial one at that. More risotto, anyone? Il Mulino ** 86 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-3783. Atmosphere: Dim, crowded, unprepossessing dining room. Service: Congenial, helpful, professional. Recommended dishes: Baked clams oreganato, shrimp sauteed with garlic, capellini all\\'arrabbiata, pappardelle with tomatoes and basil, risotto with porcini and Parmesan, osso buco, sirloin steak, beef fillet with red wine and sage, chicken with sausage and artichokes, salmon with zucchini \"scales,\" lemon sorbet, mascarpone and ricotta cheesecake, chocolate mousse cake. Wine: Well-rounded list that could use more depth at the lower prices. Price range: Appetizers, $7 to $14; main courses, $14.75 to $29. Credit cards: American Express. Hours: Lunch, noon to 2:30 P.M.

       "  'review': 'From the outside, Ristorante da Umberto, hidden on an inconspicuous block off the Avenue of the Americas, has all the charm of a plumbing supply outlet. As you pass through the two glass doors, though, you encounter one of the most animated dining scenes to be found in this languorous summer. Da Umberto is the kind of low profile place that is fueled by steadfast repeat clientele. My four visits revealed why. Da Umberto has two spare but attractive dining rooms with soft gold-yellow walls, indirect lighting and a wall covered with wine racks. The front room, with a long bar, is noisier than the back room, which faces the glass-fronted kitchen. Much of the noise seems to float up to the high ceiling, however, resulting in a tolerable background hum. With its sharp, congenial waiters and stylish crowd, da Umberto exudes a bustling elan that is fun to experience. The menu, I should say the written menu, is merely a token, something for you to hold as the waiter plunges into his 10-minute dissertation on the nightly specials. If our waiter on a recent visit had not been so earnest (\"Tonight we have wild duck in red wine, roast pheasant. . . .), his performance would have been a great parody. The specials went on forever (\"pappardelle sauce Bolognese, tagliatelle. . . .) and then some. I enjoyed watching my dinner guests\\' eyes glaze over (\"the fish specials are. . . .) and their heads bow in resignation as he droned on (\"If you like veal, we have. . . .). This practice, which is annoying and a supreme waste of time, prevails in a number of restaurants, despite objections from customers. A simple printout would be so much easier. Good bresaola with sliced artichokes, crostini and salads are available as starters, although pastas are so good and ample you should go with half portions of those. Pansotti, little half-moon ravioli stuffed with radicchio and in a grainy walnut sauce, was extraordinary. Penne came with a lusty and well- seasoned Bolognese sauce, but the pasta was undercooked. Rigatoni all\\'amatriciana was exemplary, perfectly balanced with tomato, pancetta, garlic and onion; so, too, was the simple but explosively fresh orecchiette with radicchio and tomato. A special starter one evening was described as eggplant stuffed with ground Italian sausage, ground sweetbreads and herbs. What arrived was an elegant eggplant canoe filled with mostly sausage; not bad, but not what I had expected. The copious antipasto selection on display in the dining room is worth exploring: roasted peppers, marinated artichokes, marinated mushrooms, grilled radicchio, cauliflower, chick pea salad, grilled eggplant, fried zucchini and more. Da Umberto has a well-conceived and adequately sized wine selection, with good options starting in the high teens and low 20\\'s. One clean and refreshing white wine bargain that goes well with this food is the Ruffino Libaio for $20; another is the elegant Voellenzer Sauvignon Blanc ($26). Among reds, good deals are the Ceretto Barbaresco Asij ($30) and the Voerzio Dolcetto ($24). There is something for every taste among the main courses. Among my favorites are the nicely charred, firm and fresh grilled sweetbreads flavored with vodka and rosemary. I don\\'t know what role the vodka plays, but they are delicious.  Grilled, zestily spiced Cornish hen is a sure bet, as is remarkably tender osso buco with a strained vegetable sauce and triangles of moist polenta. Wild Muscovy duck is rich and assertive. It deserves a better sauce, though, than the port, white wine and tomato it comes with. A quality breaded veal chop under a salad and balsamic vinegar is a pleasing seasonal dish. Skate, the sinewy firm fish that has finally earned the respect of American chefs, is lustrous in an herb broth with black olives and herbs, while salmon is splendid with a delicate mustard sauce.  One of the most popular dishes, judging from nearby tables one evening, is half a steamed lobster with a claw the size of a wall phone, flanked by scallops, shrimp and clams, all in a garlicky tomato sauce. The pastry chef evidently never heard of cholesterol. His cart sags under a strawberry studded napoleon that packs enough cream to support a couple of upstate New York dairy farmers. The lemony ricotta cheesecake is moist and crumbly, while the chocolate mousse cake is outrageously rich but just ordinary tasting. Chocolate fiends should aim for the chocolate bombe, and brace themselves for a nuclear sugar rush. Actually, there is one mixed fruit tart that, to my taste, was excessively sweet. Cheese aficionados will find a small but well-maintained selection. To finish off the meal, there is serious espresso, something that is not easy to come by these days. Da Umberto has been gaining speed and strength since it opened four years ago. For its rakish scene and restorative cuisine, it can be strongly recommended. Ristorante da Umberto  ** 107 West 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 989-0303. Atmosphere: Bustling, animated dining rooms; moderately noisy. Service: Sharp, professional and congenial.

       "  'review': 'Raoul\\'s For all those nouveau bistros striving to stay above water for more than three American Express statements, Raoul\\'s is a paradigm -- 15 successful years of cassoulet, Cotes-du-Rhone and cigarette smoke. What makes Raoul\\'s thrive while so many others tremble? After three recent visits, the answer seems to be a genuine feeling of neighborhood, an affable staff and better-than-average food. Raoul\\'s is owned by Serge and Guy Raoul, who also own the recently opened Raoul\\'s Brasserie and Grill on Varick Street. The original restaurant, tucked away on cluttered Prince Street, looks as if it could have been there since Tammany Hall days. The barroom up front has a black stamped-tin ceiling, an Art Deco wooden bar and a row of candlelit cafe tables in front of long black banquettes. The French garage-sale wall decorations include sundry mirrors, posters and even an antlered buck\\'s head. To reach the dining room, you go past a fish tank with a submerged Statue of Liberty. To reach the nonsmoking skylighted back room, you traverse the steamy kitchen, nodding good evening to the toiling cooks. The traditional bistro menu is scrawled on a little chalkboard that should come with little flashlights. Fresh asparagus is sprinkled with a good vinaigrette and garnished with confetti of red peppers; leeks vinaigrette are pleasing, too, served with tomatoes and black olives. Another salad combined chilled sweetbreads with tomatoes and greens in a mayonnaise dressing. This drew a split decision at my table -- cold sweetbreads are not my idea of a delicacy, although several others at my table liked them. Wellfleet and Belon oysters were fresh but served indifferently on a metal tray with no ice, allowing them to get warm quickly. Two of the better starters were a casserole of chanterelles, pleurotes, cepes and oyster mushrooms sauteed with white wine and a touch of cream, and buttery, Armagnac-tinged goose foie gras ringed by a full-flavored gelatin. The wine list carries ample quality selections at good prices to go with any of these starters. Servers, who know both the food and wine well, are not as keen on cleaning tables between courses or removing empty bottles. For main courses, cruise in the bistro mainstream and chances are you will do well. Broiled salmon with a good bearnaise was faultless, as was thick tuna steak stippled with black pepper and cooked perfectly rare in the center. The steak au poivre I had was not the most tender piece of meat ever to hit a pan, but it had plenty of flavor, a good sturdy pepper sauce and crispy french fries. Rack of lamb au jus was buttery and delicious with little potato fritters and julienne of zucchini and carrots. While most seafood dishes were recommendable, the same cannot be said for the dryish swordfish crowned with a tart disk of goat cheese, a combination that escapes me. More harmonious are the firm-fleshed cobia (also known as ling) from gulf waters or sauteed cabillaud (fresh cod) garnished with citrus slices and basil butter. Veal chop forestiere replete with morels was flat tasting for lack of salt. Don\\'t bother with the sour rhubarb puree, the bland apple tart or the flossy raspberry mousse in a chocolate shell. The thin lemon tart is citric and fresh, and chocolate Bavarian cake is unremittingly rich. Raoul\\'s may not be the most refined bistro in town, but its elan is palpable. Anyone feels right at home there, which is partly the definition of a good bistro. Cafe Un Deux Trois New York City, with its frenzied late-night scene, seems ideally suited for that casual French agora known as the brasserie, where food of all sorts can be had around the clock in a wide open, convivial setting. Aside from the 24-hour Brasserie on East 53d Street, though, no such prominent place exists. Cafe Un Deux Trois, the 14-year-old French restaurant in the Broadway theater district, resembles many timeworn brasseries in Paris, although it is not one in practice. It is a vast space with a faux antique look achieved through deliberately chipping mustard-colored paint, marbleized columns, crumbling walls and trompe l\\'oeil murals. Tables are draped in paper and come with glasses of crayons. This is not the best place to conduct business, for the din can be nettlesome -- but hundreds come daily to do just that. Servers, who are generally nimble and efficient, sometimes get distracted. For as long as I have been frequenting Cafe Un Deux Trois, I have found several dishes to be reliable. One of the better steak tartares in town is served here, the meat of impeccable quality and mildly piquant with Tabasco. Steak au poivre is always pleasing, too. The cream-tinted peppercorn sauce carries a good kick of pepper and a sweet blush of brandy. Coq au vin comes with a moist leg of chicken, breast meat, carrots and mushrooms in an herby broth. And fans of tripe will enjoy the version here with tomatoes, garlic, boiled potatoes and deep-fried parsley. Couscous on the current menu comes out in a wheelbarrow portion, but generosity is all it has going for it. The meats are dry and the grain is beyond rescue from the broth served on the side.  At lunch recently, penne with salmon, tomato and fried parsley was unpleasantly pinguid; better was a room-temperature chicken salad combining eggs, potatoes in vinaigrette and marinated cucumbers. Seafood is usually a 50-50 bet here.  Broiled salmon recently was inedibly dry, while fried calamari on the appetizer list was deliciously crisp and tender. Other good appetizers are the big meaty baked mussels swathed with bread crumbs, and the lean, delicately smoked salmon with capers and onions.  I have never seen the Thai specialty beef sate in a French restaurant, and now I know why. Rather than being a bite-sized morsel of grilled beef on a skewer, these monsters required a knife and fork to eat -- \"Texas sate,\" quipped a co-eater. They were tasty, though, especially with a sweet peanut sauce. Another Oriental inspiration, pork-stuffed dumplings redolent of fresh ginger, was tantalizing with its garlic-soy dipping sauce. Pre-made Caesar salad, though, was sodden and tasteless. Cafe Un Deux Trois has a small but wide-ranging wine list with plenty of selections in the 20\\'s. An upbeat way to end a meal here is with a walnut cookie basket holding cut-up strawberries and pineapples with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce. Profiteroles are run-of-the-mill.  The charlotte with strawberries, cream, chocolate mousse and creme anglaise can send you home with a smile. Cafe Un Deux Trois remains one of the more diverting, drop-in spots in the theater district. It\\'s good enough, and reasonably priced enough, to keep them coming back. And that\\'s what they have been doing for 14 years. Raoul\\'s (*) 180 Prince Street in SoHo, (212) 966-3518. Atmosphere: Agreeably timeworn ambiance, with black stamped-tin ceiling and cafe tables.

       "  'review': \"Les Halles Since leaving the struggling dining room in the Peninsula Hotel two years ago to go out on their own, Max Bernard and Jean-Michel Diot have had a golden touch. First they opened the unremittingly popular Park Bistro on Park Avenue near 28th Street with a third partner, Philippe Lajaunie; November saw the debut of Les Halles just across the street, a combination boucherie and casual restaurant specializing in gutsy French meat dishes. The owners spend much of their time loping across Park Avenue to check on their establishments. Without question, they are the most fervid jaywalkers in town. It is not easy to absorb all of the interior details at Les Halles, for every time I go there it is packed tighter than an Iowa holding pen. A little tiled butcher shop is up front, and just behind is the bar, where chances are you will spend 10 to 20 minutes waiting for a table -- the booking system needs work. The lofty space has a Parisian feel, elaborate wood molding, off-white walls, tulip sconces that cast soft light, tables draped in butcher paper, and the odd juxtaposition of charcuterie posters paired with black and white photos of the comedic French actor Fernandel. This is not a place for confidential business lunches, as tables are practically glued together and the noise can be nettlesome. Patrons come to Les Halles for the cooking not the comfort. You can start with a salad of duck confit -- not a buttery, falling-off-the-bone confit but flavorful nonetheless -- with chicory; a tangle of leeks in a good mustardy vinaigrette; lean pork sausage and deliciously vinegared green lentils, or any of the superior terrines, like duck with prunes. One Provencal dish that has become popular in New York City in recent years is brandade de morue, which traditionally is a puree of desalinated salt cod, milk, potatoes, garlic and olive oil. The version prepared by the Portuguese-born chef, Jose de Mereilles, contains hardly any milk, thus is lighter than most versions. It is no less appealing, though. The mostly French service staff has the snappy efficiency of Parisian brasserie waiters -- and they need it here. The wine list at Les Halles is a delight, not only for its sensible prices but also for delightful little-known country wines like Bourgueil ($16), Chateau Aiguilloux from Cahors ($14) and Vidal-Fleury from Vacqueyras ($20). Any of these reds would go splendidly with the earthy and well-seasoned boudin noir (blood sausage) with sauteed apples and soothing mashed potatoes, or the thin-sliced, well-seared bavette (flank steak), which is juicy and full of flavor. It came with superior french fries. One of the special French portions of meat served here is called onglet, or hanger steak, a sinewy cut from around the diaphragm. When onglet is aged well and cooked properly, as it is here, it can be wonderfully moist and toothsome. Any bistro like Les Halles has to serve cassoulet, and the one here -- made with garlic sausage, duck confit, pork and white beans -- is a bit on the dry side but rich in flavor. Rotisserie-cooked chicken is tasty and moist with its herb juices, although the french fries with it were soggy. An order of sauteed vegetables on the side was tasteless, too. Fans of tripe will swoon over the wonderful Portuguese-style preparation here, served in a cavernous crock along with cumin, chorizo, boudin noir and bacon. Desserts, appropriately, are reserved here. The delicate creme caramel is suitably light, and apricot-custard tart won't tilt the scales unduly. A semisweet chocolate mousse may be too fluffy for chocoholics, so they should opt instead for the denser chocolate tart. Heaping portions, consistent quality and a dynamic setting make Les Halles a happy eaters' place. It may not top the American Heart Association's dining-out list for convention week in New York City. Just as well -- there'll be more seats for us. Petrossian For much of its six years, Petrossian has been primarily a sumptuous caviar palace and only secondarily a restaurant -- and a tentative one at that, often lacking direction and consistency. All of that changed last year with the arrival of Marc Salonsky, a Brooklyn-born veteran of La Varenne in Paris, and in New York City, Le Regence and the Sign of the Dove. Now Petrossian can be recommended for more than just blinis and beluga -- although those are still nothing to scoff at. The dining room is an Art Deco fantasy, with its long marble bar facing mirrors engraved with Erte etchings, rose-tinted Italian marble floors, crystal chandeliers, a kid-leather-lined banquette and romantic lighting. At the entrance is a shop that sells Petrossian products like foie gras, caviar and smoked salmon. Those are for the way home, though. First you can sample the products on the menu. One good starter on the dinner menu is thin slices of glistening sea scallops nested on mixed greens and garnished with invigorating salmon roe. A similar dish on the lunch menu, made with sliced scallops, salmon roe and olive oil, had so much lemon juice on it that all else was nullified. All of the caviar can be recommended. Those on a budget might try blinis with pressed caviar, which is made from the damaged or softer sturgeon eggs. They are pressed together and salted to resemble a thick marmalade. Ratatouille-filled ravioli got a boost from fresh thyme and a heady lobster sauce, and all three soups on the menu are well seasoned and built upon sturdy stocks: borscht with pirogi, mussel with vegetables, and rosemary-infused shrimp soup.  The shrimp soup is astoundingly good, a velutinous shellfish-cream base perfumed with fresh rosemary and served with two skewers of perfectly broiled shrimp. Servers at Petrossian, wearing spiffy blazers with company logos and red ties, look like members of a college glee club. They go about their ministrations with grace and efficiency. As for the wine list, it is strictly for the beluga crowd, beginning in the high 20's and rising faster than a Patriot missile. Mr. Salonsky has a light, deft touch with seafood.  One of the best main courses is seared fillet of salmon, still rosy in the center, with a grainy mustard sauce and surrounded by smoked salmon ravioli. Halibut is another winner, moist and well seasoned, garnished with a slice of smoked salmon and adrift on a zesty fennel puree aromatic of tarragon oil. The technique of encasing fish in potatoes remains in vogue as evidenced from the lightly smoked salmon and salad greens between crispy potato pancakes -- a sprightly textural combination. The strategy does not work as well with lobster and leeks, however, for the pancakes were flaccid and the lobster chewy. Caviar finds its way into a dish of nicely roasted red snapper, presented with a warm potato salad and light cream sauce stippled with pressed caviar. And both pressed caviar and salmon roe elevate roasted monkfish with a lobster consomme and herb sauce. Another monkfish preparation, featuring a marjoram-caper sauce, came out unpleasantly acrid. On the other side of the menu, grilled quail with shiitake mushrooms over vermicelli was a harmonious combination, as were tender veal medallions with a carrot puree and marjoram sauce. Loin of lamb with a potato-turnip puree and brussels sprouts is a homey delight. And roast chicken with sun- dried tomatoes is moist and crisp-skinned, but it is spoiled by an avalanche of greasy fried onions. Desserts are fittingly regal here. If they have it, don't miss the extraordinary banana napoleon, a tower of puff pastry, banana slices and whipped cream in a pool of warm caramel. Chocolate macadamia torte with raspberry sauce is crunchy and irresistible, and creme brulee is as refined as you will find it anywhere. Another superb special is the apple-pear pithiviers with a warm, puffed crust and vanilla ice cream. The current regime has given Petrossian the depth and diversity that it lacked. Finally, this lavish spot is more than merely the city's most expensive snack bar. Les Halles ** 411 Park Avenue South, between 28th and 29th Streets in Manhattan, (212) 679-4111.

       "  'review': \"One-shtick restaurants, like one-shtick comedians, can be amusing for a while, but their routines soon wear thin. That was my impression after repeated visits to Trattoria dell'Arte, a restaurant designed by Milton Glaser with an anatomical theme that is about as subtle as Pee-wee Herman. At first the loud (aurally and visually) peach-toned main dining room adorned with giant renderings of everything from noses to derrieres was fun, even though the lighting was harsh. But on subsequent visits the art, like a bad comedian, just didn't let up. The oversize drawings do not adorn, they attack. And the colors - a smaller side dining room is sort of an eerie chlorophyll shade - seemed more suited to interrogation that dining. An upstairs dining room, which is comfortable except for its oppressively low ceiling, is a virtual nasal hall of fame, with sketches of famous proboscises, from Joe DiMaggio's to Mussolini's. It is the food, not art, though, that is of primary concern here, and some of it is worth highlighting. Shortly after being seated, you are presented with a big silver tray of savory-looking appetizers. This is the antipasto platter, which waiters promote with such zeal that I began to suspect they receive bonuses for each one sold. That aside, the $8.50 platter, which easily feeds two, carries some tasty morsels: a delicious white-bean-and-shrimp salad, baby artichokes with olive oil, well-seasoned grilled eggplant, sauteed broccoli rape, zesty caponata, sheets of prosciutto wrapped around thin breadsticks, and more. The Caesar salad is freshly prepared but so showered with Parmesan that you barely taste the anchovy or garlic. The thin-crusted pizzas sampled were light enough to enjoy without getting full. The version with fennel sausage, roasted peppers and garlic disappeared quickly at my table. I can't say the same for the pallid so-called Tuscan tomato stew, which tasted like a bowl of watered-down marinara sauce. White bean soup threaded with escarole was far better. The staff members at Trattoria dell'Arte could not be more pleasant or accommodating: they actually appear pleased that you came in, and they say so. Waiters are chatty but generally efficient and eager to please. Better yet, they leave little peppermills on the table rather than assault you with mechanized tree trunks. As for the wine, cone-shaped wine glasses may be pretty, but they are impractical: they hold little and you can't swirl the wine to aerate it. The wine list is appropriate for trattoria food, starting at $14, but unevenly stocked, with many vintages missing. Pastas, which can be ordered in half portions as starters, are among the best options here. On the lighter side are pinci, little handmade dumplings, tossed with al dente broccoli and zucchini along with roasted garlic cloves in a nice olive-oil-based sauce, and penne with salmon and radicchio. Two blood-warming seasonal specials are maccheroni alla chitarra, a thin hand-rolled spaghetti with a rich wine-based lamb ragu sauce, and pappardelle alle lepre, or flat, thick noodles with moist rabbit meat and a sweet-edged Barolo wine sauce. More puzzling than pleasing was a special of bucatini with a clashing combination of fennel, currants, Parmesan and anchovies. Among other main courses, odds are in your favor with three charcoal-grilled options: steak garnished with garlic and rosemary (along with a haystack of good french fries), lamb chops and the swordfish presented over sauteed radicchio with garlic. The mixed grill met with mixed respones: the rosemary-scented chicken and the spicy sausage were terrific; the lamb was nearly raw and what was advertised as venison looked and tasted like beef. Grilled sea bass, a special, was deftly cooked but our waiter's bumbling boning job left it looking as if it had collided with a boat's propeller. A tempting winter dish called clay-pot-roasted chicken was little more than a dry bird heaped with fresh rosemary (obviously the chef's favorite herb), with onions and roasted potatoes. Desserts are not worth the guilt. There is the obligatory tiramisu, which was merely a bland custard; undistinguished cherry-flavored chocolate tartuffo, and an equally boring chocolate-hazelnut square with vanilla sauce. A napoleon the size of a cornerstone looms on the dessert cart. This stratified monster of almond-flavored cream and burned flaky pastry is impressive only for its dimensions. It is difficult to predict how first-timers will react to Trattoria dell'Arte. The trattoria part has some engaging food going for it; it's the arte part that could be unappetizing to some.

       "  'review': \"IT is amazing what surprises pop up in this city if you snoop around long enough. Take, for example, the Ambassador Grill, a coolly urbane restaurant in the United Nations Plaza Hotel. Never terribly distinguished in matters gustatory, the Ambassador Grill has been pegged as a convenient spot for diplomatic types to take a breather from solving the world's woes by having a tall drink and grilled slab of all-American steak. It was quite a surprise, then, to find an ambitious new menu there, half of which is devoted to the foods of Gascony in the southwest of France, the glorious region of ducks, geese, foie gras, confit and truffles. The recipes were developed by three leading French chefs from that region during a weeklong Gascon festival at the restaurant early this year. They were Arnaud Daguin from Hotel de France in Auch, Maurice Coscuella of La Ripa Alta, a hotel-restaurant in Plaisance, and Roger Duffour, chef-owner of Relais de l'Armagnac in Luppe-Violles. Several of the Gascon dishes alone make a trip to the Ambassador Grill worthwhile - and with prix-fixe meals of $19 at lunch and $24 at dinner, you would have to have your own duck supply to find less expensive foie gras. The rest of the menu rolls through peaks and valleys, but by ordering wisely it is possible to have a more than satisfying meal. The subterranean dining room is striking with its interplay of dark walls, smoky glass panels and starry lighting. Overhead the illusion of a skylight is created by the angling of many glass trellises that seem to reflect lights out to infinity. In a small open kitchen three white-toqued cooks tend to the sizzling grills. Service can be proper and well informed or spirited but callow depending on the roll of the dice. Upon being seated you can begin excavating a ramekin of well-seasoned duck rillettes with toasted croutons. If you are in an experimental mood, try the special Gascon cocktail called a pousse rapiere - roughly translated as a thrust sword - a French sparkling wine tinted with a regional orange-flavored liqueur. The wine list also carries some moderately priced regional labels, such as the fresh and easy-drinking Colombard, an Andre Daguin label, a white ($17), and the young faintly tannic Madiran, Domaine Bouscasse, a red ($17). The unqualified best starter is the warm duck foie gras salad, which is on the Gascon side of the menu. It has strips of rare-grilled salmon paired with a meltingly rich slice of the foie gras, seared just enough to form a micro-thin crust, set over a bouquet of mixed greens in a mild wine vinegar dressing ($3 supplement). Soft nuggets of mellow garlic confit add a heady rustic accent. The cold terrine built upon successive layers of foie gras, vegetables and lobster arrived underseasoned and too cold from refrigeration. Two selections that need more consulting from the Gascon trio are the duck soup with truffle juice, a turbid and tasteless broth holding arid duck sausage, and the mixed seafood pasta, which had everything going for it except a final adjustment of seasonings. Recommended appetizers from the other side of the menu are the peppery rockfish chowder, which is actually more like a stew, made with an assertive shellfish stock, tomato and fillets of rockfish, and a lovely dish of lightly poached shrimp served in a buttery shellfish stock blushed with sweet Sauternes. A cold assorted seafood salad, a special one evening, was also delightful. Magret, the meaty breast of a fattened moulard duck that is raised to produce foie gras, is competently prepared - sliced, sauteed to rare and glossed with a red wine sauce ($3 supplement). The restaurant's cassoulet with duck meat may be less rich and complex than it could be, but it is flavorful nonetheless. A dish misleadingly called lobster cake with endives ($3 supplement) is really a cluster of glossy endive encasing tender morsels of lobster and mushroom in a stock sauce boozy with dry vermouth - aggressive but pleasing. On Fridays the kitchen turns out a generous and oceanic bouillabaisse spiked with a garlicky aioli ($4 supplement). The most interesting seafood selection on the regular menu is called grilled John Dory andouillette with mustard sauce. The fillet of John Dory, also called St. Pierre, having firm, flaky white flesh, is rolled around a stuffing of shrimp and scallop mousse, then cooked over a wood fire to impart a strong smoky flavor. The dish, however, needs more of a kick than the pallid mustard sauce provides. An unusual preparation that succeeds is lean Black Angus steak poached to medium rare in beef stock and an emulsion sauce melding egg yolks, mustard and just a hint of vanilla that comes through moments after you swallow. Bland veal with candied lime peel in its sauce is forgettable; try instead tarragon-perfumed lamb chops coated with minced vegetables. High spots of the dessert tray are lush plum tart with a cracker-thin crust, a first-rate creme brulee and a fabulous mille-feuille made with sugar-dusted puff pastry disks floating on layers of whipped cream with fresh raspberries. Apple tart on two occasions had a slightly soggy crust. Even if the Ambassador Grill's new menu is not 100 percent successful, the initiative and imagination demonstrated by this young team deserves recognition. It is yet another example of how top hotels in this country are taking food seriously once again - a long overdue phenomenon that will benefit us all.

       "  'review': \"On the Upper West Side, where a restaurant is born every minute, Amsterdam's Bar & Rotisserie is a standout. Since it opened two months ago, its simple fresh food, prepared with style, has attracted diners from far beyond the neighborhood. The fact that it is open until 4 A.M. is an added attraction. The core of the appealing menu is food cooked on a huge gas-fire rotisserie in an open kitchen, where all the preparation takes place. Rotisserie cooking, an excellent method for sealing in juices and heightening natural flavors, demands an attentive cook, who knows when to move the food away from the heat, when to baste it and when to take it off. The cooks at Amsterdam's are paying attention. Salmon basted with wine is moist and served at room temperature, with a light lemony mayonnaise flecked with chives. Though a half-chicken for just $6.95 may be falling off the bones, it retains its juiciness and is deliciously complemented by a richly flavored basil sauce. Cooking an entire shell steak on a rotisserie makes it impossible to get an individual serving to order, but one that was requested rare came fairly close, the slightly chewy meat pungent with garlic. A stuffing of seasonal fruits enhanced succulent slices of pork. For lighter fare, yellow and red pepper strips and sun- dried tomatoes are stylish additions to a chef's salad bathed in a balsamic vinaigrette. The same mellow dressing that is served with the salads accompanies the meats. At lunch, the roasted chicken may turn up in a sprightly salad, its sharp brown mustard-accented dressing sweetened with mint. The pork and beef become sandwiches, the semolina bread spread with a zesty mustard-mayonnaise dressing, spiked with capers. Several of the appetizers are available all day and, as with all dishes, the portions are generous. There is a richly satisfying peppery, smooth duck- liver mousse, garnished with tart lingonberries, for two. My only complaint about the gravlax and its sharp-sweet mustard dill sauce is the way it was cut - too close to the skin, so that the salmon-color flesh was marred by oily gray patches. Mildly smoked trout, prettily arranged with cherry tomatoes and red onion rings, and the unusual gazpacho, refreshingly redolent of basil (a special), are other good choices. And one evening there was an appealing assortment of vegetables, each cooked to enhance its essence, all glistening under a light coating of olive oil. Only mushy shrimp, served in their shells, were out of keeping with the rest of the food. When they were ordered, the waiter, anticipating a problem, offered to take them back if they were not satisfactory. His concern is typical of the young staff, which takes its work seriously. One other trouble spot is the french fries. Since the cooks can produce crisply fried new potatoes, they should be able to do the same with Idaho potatoes, which, though delicious, are limp. I suspect the fat is not hot enough. The deeply chocolate velvet mousse cake needs no tinkering. But the hazelnut torte tastes of stale hazelnuts, and a wonderful tart gooseberry filling has a thick, sadly underbaked crust. Berries and cassis, topped with whipped cream, are refreshing when sweet. But sometimes a judicious sprinkling of sugar would help, and a better quality whipped cream is needed, one with less air and more butterfat. A sparkling plate of fruits and cheeses, in the first-course column, would also make a splendid finale. The simplicity of the menu is carried through to the decor. The owners of Amsterdam's have created a casual cafe, using white paint on the plaster and bricks, black on the tin ceiling, the bar and the chairs. Red and white, and blue and white homespun tablecloths add an accent note. The lower level of the restaurant, with bar and jukebox, is noisy, but the noise disappears in the dining room a few steps up. For those who have always wondered what the Upper West Side is really about, Amsterdam's would be a good place to start exploring. New Yorkers like to tell visitors about a a favorite out-of-the-way restaurant that serves the best old-fashioned something - hamburgers, Italian food, steaks, whatever. For years, the establishment that has filled the bill for seekers after chicken cacciatore and beef braciola, for linguine with clam sauce and eggplant parmigiana, has been Gargiulo's in Coney Island. The happy, boisterous atmosphere combined with old-fashioned Italian service and hearty Neapolitan fare, so lovingly prepared, were New York treasures. But now only the contagious atmosphere and old-fashioned waiters remain. The food at Gargiulo's is no longer worth the trip, nor the three-star rating it received in The New York Times in 1977, stars it proudly hangs from its ceiling. The quality of the raw ingredients remains good, but they are being handled carelessly. It is as if the kitchen staff got tired of cooking and began to take shortcuts. Much of the food, like the fritto misto and mozzarella in carrozza, tastes as if it had been cooked early in the day and reheated. Zuppa di pesce was treated as if it were a beef stew and cooked for hours. Overcooking turned chicken scarpariello and chicken cacciatore bone dry. It toughened pork chops pizzaiuola, the braciola and veal parmigiana. The blandness quotient is high. Sauces that should be pungent and lusty are pale imitations. Normally spicy sausage and peppers tasted like hamburgers, and a mountainous veal rollatini was stuffed with a mixture that had no discernible flavor. Unseasoned tomatoes, passing as spicy fra diavolo sauce, marred an otherwise juicy lobster, while some pasta dishes had so much salt that they were inedible. Tartufo, spumoni and fresh fruit are recommended for dessert only because they are safe, not because they are wonderful. What should have been a wonderful zabaglione was overwhelmed by a crude alcoholic taste, while cannoli filling looked and tasted like library paste. Yet an occasional dish provided a hint of the glory that was once Gargiulo's. The pasta was cooked to order and, combined with a couple of the sauces, provided a good and inexpensive meal. Bits of prosciutto and mushrooms added an earthy note to a lovely light tomato sauce served over fettuccini Gargiulo and to a delicate cream sauce for cheese-filled tortellini Michelangelo. Risotto, deeply scented with mushrooms, was appropriately firm and chewy. Once you get past the unattractive appearance of overcooked stuffed green peppers, they can be enjoyed for their savory bread filling. A tender grilled veal chop and two items not on the menu, chicken paillard, with a zesty dressing of artichokes, mushrooms and red peppers, and pork chops with vinegar peppers, were the best of the entrees, in part because they were freshly cooked. Several vegetables also had the homey flavor that one expects in this kind of Italian restaurant: broccoli rape, escarole and spinach, pungent with garlic. While it may be a Herculean task for the city to restore Coney Island to its former charms, it would take only a competent and caring kitchen staff to perform that miracle at Gargiulo's.

       "  'review': \"IF ever a restaurant was perfectly suited to its location and to the season, it is Kodama, a trim, bright Japanese restaurant on 45th Street, just west of Eighth Avenue. The raw-fish specialties and small intricate dishes of dumplings, grilled eggplant and chilled bean curd, the light grilled-fish specialties and the cold-noodle combinations are just right for our hot, humid summer. By coincidence, these dishes are equally suitable for pretheater dining, when lightness before the curtain goes up can prevent drowsiness once it is up. Kodama provides competently prepared, simple dishes in an entertaining variety, and with just a little fine tuning it might well rate two stars. Sushi, the raw and cooked fish packed onto rice with or without seaweed bindings, is generally decent, although lacking in the extra measure of flavor to make them outstanding.  Crisper seaweed and a more generous dab of wasabi horseradish would be improvements. A few sushi varieties, however, are outstanding; among such are the futomaki (a wide seaweed roll filled with rice, sweet omelet, crab, grilled eel and pickled vegetables), the California roll with its crabmeat, cucumber and avocado filling and its outer coating of packed rice, and the hand-rolls or seaweed cones of sushi rice with tiny grilled fish, cucumber and sesame seeds. The cones are traditionally served at the end of a sushi meal. Sashimi (sliced raw fish), could not be better - either plain or in an assortment atop rice with pickled vegetables in a boxed selection known as chirashi. To the management's credit, fish that is not available fresh is simply not offered at Kodama, a policy other sushi restaurants would do well to follow. As at most such establishments, the raw-fish meals are more interesting when taken at the sushi bar, where you can order single pieces of whatever looks best, instead of taking a standard assortment at a table. Small dishes are among Kodama's strong points. Gyoza are tender, juicy, crescent-shape dumplings that are filled with meat and are greaselessly baked. The tatsuta-age, marinated strips of crisply fried chicken, is brightened by a dash of fresh lemon juice. A sweet and pungent miso sauce and toasted sesame seeds mellow the flavor of thick grilled eggplant slices; the yakitori, succulent tidbits of marinated chicken, is gently grilled on tiny skewers. Whether the clams at Kodama are actually broiled as stated or are steamed hardly matters because the big clams are so good, served puffed up and sizzling in their own saline liquor. For some reason, tempura frying is excellent on individual mushroom caps, served as an appetizer or side dish, but this method of cooking is less successful on the standard tempura array of shrimp, fish, vegetables and chicken. The batter on these dishes is heavy and limp and conveys an aftertaste of grease. Breaded deep-fried foods are far more skillfully prepared, to judge by the excellent fried pork cutlet (tonkatsu) and the fried pork on skewers. Donburi, lacquer boxes or casseroles that combine meats, vegetables and rice, are satisfying main courses, especially oya-don - bits of chicken, vegetables and scrambled egg nestled in rice. Simple butter- and salt-broiling of all kinds of fish (salmon, cod or trout) are well done. Teriyaki-broiled steak, fish and chicken are also savory and satisfying. Boiled or steamed hot-pot dishes, such as the fish and seafood specialties yosenabe and hamanabe, are delicate and blissfully dietetic, as is shabu-shabu, the caldron of broth in which meats or chicken with noodles, bean curd and vegetables are cooked at the table. An unpleasant sogginess mars such dishes as sukiyaki (prepared in the kitchen instead of at the table); negima-yaki (stringy braised beef rolled around scallions), and all dishes of meats or fish sauteed with vegetables. Another flaw is the addition of second-rate Western garnishes to flesh out the Japanese fare. Iceberg lettuce accompanies deep-fried dishes, and potato with two vegetables are added to several others. These garnishes are out of character and detract from the enjoyment of the food; Japanese pickles or oshtashi (cold spinach or watercress with bonito flakes and sesame seeds) would be preferable. Cold noodle soups with greens and cold buckwheat noodles (soba) served on ice with a dipping broth seasoned with green horseradish and minced scallions are among the most restorative choices for a hot summer day. Refreshing desserts include pineapple, honeydew melon or sliced oranges, or ice cream, the best of which is spiced with candied ginger. Prices are fairly moderate, and a satisfying meal can be obtained for $12 to $18 before tip and drinks. The staff is delightful - friendly and altogether accommodating. Kodama offers full bar service and is also open after the theater. A la carte ''Coffee and ... '' is a pleasant prospect at St. Honore, the patisserie-cafe that opened last March at 235 East 57th Street, between Second and Third Avenues (355-6478). Yeasty Danish pastries are the best of the offerings, especially the puffy cheese buns ($1.25), the almond-encrusted crescents filled with preserves ($1.15) and the pinwheel schnecken ($1.25). All these are better than the plain croissants and brioche. Anyone with a more demanding sweet tooth should opt for the individual St. Honore pastries - glazed cream puffs filled with whipped cream. All pastries may be taken out or eaten in the cafe, and there is a variety of coffees. Prices are a bit lower for takeouts. St. Honore is open Mondays through Fridays from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M. and Saturdays from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Greener Pastures, the stylish vegetarian restaurant at 117 East 60th Street, between Park and Lexington Avenues (355-3214), remains one of the better possibilities for simple summer salads. Egg, tuna and vegetarian-chopped-liver combination (smorgasbord salad, $5.50) are especially sprightly and crunchy with bean sprouts. And except for the inclusion of canned California black olives, the salade Ni,coise ($5.95) is several cuts above average. Good grainy breads accompany all salads. Lunch is served Mondays through Fridays from noon to 4:30 P.M., Saturdays and Sundays from noon to 4 P.M. Dinner is served from 4:30 to 9:30 P.M., Mondays through Thursdays and on Saturdays, and from 4 to 8:30 P.M. on Fridays and Sundays. In reviewing La Ripaille on July l, we related, as we had been informed, that Theresa and Nelly Laurent, the wives of the owners, Patrick and Alain Laurent, continue to do the cooking as they did when the restaurant opened three years ago. But Alain and Nelly Laurent were divorced eight months ago, and she is no longer connected with the restaurant. Alain Laurent manages the dining room. Menus are planned and recipes are created by Patrick Laurent and his wife, Theresa, who oversees the kitchen. Arnold Rossman is the chef who assists Mrs. Laurent and who takes over when she is away. Kodama Japanese Restaurant * 301 West 45th Street, between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, 582-8065.

They forecast its sensibilities, attitude and attention to detail.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"434\" data-total-count=\"641\">That's why, when the 1874 manhattan, made with Woodford Reserve bourbon, arrived at our table at BLT Steak, my mood lightened. The martini glass was accessorized with bourbon- and kirsch-soaked cherries impaled on a stick, and the cocktail itself, sweet and oaky and stiffened with a dash of bitters, eased across my palate. We were in capable hands, and if the size of the drink was any indication, we were not going to leave hungry.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"652\" data-total-count=\"1293\">The manhattan also helped bring into focus the restaurant's rather blurry image. Though there is an obligatory photo of Arturo DeModica's sculpture ''Charging Bull'' in Bowling Green Park, BLT Steak feels like anything but a steakhouse. On the communal table at BLT Steak, which stands for ''Bistro Laurent Tourondel'' -- the name of the chef, not ''Bacon Lettuce and Tomato'' -- square vases are packed with trimmed leeks. Banquettes are covered in buttery suede and the tables, made of striated Makassar ebony, are glazed with a thick layer of baked resin. It's Peter Luger after a heavy session with the crew from ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.''</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"218\" data-total-count=\"1511\">It takes chutzpah to launch a new entry in a category as storied as the New York steakhouse. And a strategy to redefine expectations; otherwise you end up like the colossally bland Michael Jordan's the Steak House NYC.</p><div class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent\" id=\"story-ad-1\">\n",

       "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"225\" data-total-count=\"1736\" id=\"story-continues-1\">Diners need a reason to shift alliances, and BLT Steak succeeds in this. In addition to well-seared meats and a serious wine list, there is a soft touch in the cooking, a sensitivity to acute flavors and seasonal ingredients.</p> <a class=\"visually-hidden skip-to-text-link\" href=\"#story-continues-2\">Continue reading the main story</a>\n",

       "<p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"434\" data-total-count=\"2170\" id=\"story-continues-3\">After the aperitif, the positive indicators continued to accumulate. Menus were delivered with a selection of antipasti -- marinated mushrooms, infused with coriander, a tiny bowl filled with duck liver mousse and a platter of cured meats. Serrano ham was carved into slices as delicate as tissue paper. The bresaola, delicious on its own, was tangibly improved with a sprinkle of lemon juice, olive oil and cracked black peppercorns.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"163\" data-total-count=\"2333\">And just as these delicacies were cleared, a plate of popovers arrived. Each was the size of a ham hock and had a cap of melted Gruyère and a warm, eggy interior.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"354\" data-total-count=\"2687\">In rethinking the steakhouse, Mr. Tourondel is renovating his own image. Previously, he was chef at Cello, a restaurant on the Upper East Side where his skill with fish earned him three stars from William Grimes of The New York Times in 1999. Indeed, two of the best dishes on BLT Steak's menu are the seafood platter and Dover sole sautéed on the bone.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"215\" data-total-count=\"2902\">Here Mr. Tourondel's focus is on dry-aged meats in primal cuts. Of these, the hanger is by far the most flavorful. It is a homely cut, served with a dark crust, and a gamy interior that is dense with an iodine tang.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"623\" data-total-count=\"3525\">But oddly, the beef was the most underwhelming part of the menu, not because of the way it was cooked but because the beef itself -- which comes from DeBragga &amp; Spitler, where it is dry-aged for 28 days -- lacked the depth of flavor normally associated with aged beef. Luckily, the various accompanying sauces are excellent. The horseradish is amply hot and light; the three mustards include a beguiling red wine mustard that has a fruity and lasting heat; and the peppercorn is a beautifully executed classic sauce. The servers encourage you to try several at a time, which only serves to distract your palate. Avoid this.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"338\" data-total-count=\"3863\">While veal chop and rack of lamb often seem like tame choices, here they are stunning. The veal is roasted with a moist crust made of bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and a wallop of rosemary. With each sweet bite of veal, there is a flash of the potent crust. The lamb is spread with a layer of ground parsley, garlic, chives and pine nuts.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"563\" data-total-count=\"4426\">Where Mr. Tourondel really excels, and where he manages to take the steakhouse idea forward and distinguish himself from the merely excellent, is on the periphery -- in the soups, salads and side dishes. His white mushroom soup with truffle oil is poured into a bowl through a mound of foamy truffle sabayon. It is supple yet not subtle. (And if you can say that 10 times fast after having the 1874 manhattan, you should get your dinner free.) The crab cake is constructed of large lumps of crab, invisibly bound, and served on a crunchy, tangy celery mayonnaise.</p><div aria-labeledby=\"newsletter-promo-heading\" class=\"newsletter-signup hidden auto-newsletter variant-1-hidden\" data-newsletter-productcode=\"\" data-newsletter-producttitle=\"\" id=\"newsletter-promo\">\n",

Inside each crisp, salty shell is a thick softened ring of sweet onion. Fat asparagus spears are grilled and left firm. In the potato gratin, 10 thick slices of potato are laid like fish scales in a square modern dish and doused in a delicious cream.</p><div class=\"story-ad ad ad-placeholder nocontent robots-nocontent\" id=\"story-ad-2\">\n",

It would be a shame to miss the best chocolate tart in New York City. It is sliced into a thick wedge of darkness, and looms over a small quenelle of almond milk ice cream. The crepe soufflé is a welcome remnant of Mr. Tourondel's past days of elegance. The fluffy, moon-shaped crepe is encased by a thin shell of caramel; below it is a puddle of tangy citrus sauce, flecked with passion fruit seeds. Most unusual is a steamed banana pudding, which is served warm in a terrine. A scoop of rum raisin ice cream loosens and spreads over its surface.</p><p class=\"story-body-text story-content\" data-para-count=\"284\" data-total-count=\"5681\">As you settle in to dessert, the last extra arrives, a tiny chocolate chip cookie from Johnny Léon, BLT's pastry chef.

       "'IF a restaurateur is going to enter the competitive downtown arena of pseudo-Asian pleasure domes, he might as well go for broke. He might as well blow out more than 15,000 square feet of space, fill it with bright colors and festoon it with jumbled visual allusions: an enormous fake European tapestry here, scores of artfully showcased Buddha pictures over there. He might as well set the ceiling of the central dining room as high as the Himalayas, hang a row of gargantuan chandeliers from it, and, ignoring the constraints of stiletto heels and the possible tipsiness of their wearers, make diners descend into this gaudy banquet hall — and the maze of moody chambers around it — via a vertiginous staircase. He might as well dim the lights, crank up the hypnotic music and flood the zone with dozens of servers. He might as well try to leave Megu and Matsuri in the dust and Spice Market gasping for air. That seems to be the philosophy that Stephen Starr brought to Buddakan, a restaurant as flashy as any this city has seen. Buddakan is the apotheosis, at least for the next 60 seconds, of a distinct genre: the post-millennial urban mess hall as supersize cocktail lounge with superstylized dishes, which chart a far-out trip to the Far East. The specific cuisine in its sights  is Chinese, and the real surprise is how good many of Buddakan\\'s alternately faithful and fanciful interpretations of it are. A restaurant this sexy doesn\\'t need to be smart. But its chef, Michael Schulson, breathes intelligence and creativity into it. His mao poe tofu may be the most crazily addictive thing I\\'ve tasted in months. Cubes of silky bean curd act as crucial moments of calm in a wet, fiery mix of garlic, Thai chili peppers and, well, minced pork. If you want tofu to bust loose like this, you have to give it meat as well as heat. There\\'s an appealing spin on tuna tartare that actually manages to taste somewhat novel, with the diced big-eye tuna layered atop bits of poached egg in scallion oil. It comes on an undulating white plate that looks like a snowdrift. There\\'s also a nifty take on beef tartare, which has tapioca, mint and fish sauce in the mix. Cantonese spring rolls were so plump with shrimp and chicken and so crunchy on the outside that a companion who shared them with me was still raving about them a month later. She wasn\\'t saying much about the Peking duck, which lacked sufficiently crisp skin and notably tender flesh. But that\\'s the thing about Buddakan — more than a few losers keep company with the many winners. Buddakan, which opened in early March, has an identically named forebear in Philadelphia, where Mr. Starr operates 12 restaurants. He\\'s not so much testing the waters of New York as doing a headlong dive into them, and his chosen point of entry is the fringes of the meatpacking district, where the crush of fabulousness is getting a little confusing. Buddakan, with 275 seats for dining and about 50 more for drinking,  should not be confused with the unrelated Buddha-Bar, which just opened a few blocks to the south and can squeeze in at least as many people. Nor should it be confused with Morimoto, another Starr newcomer, which serves quasi-Japanese food on a similarly glitzy stage no more than a few hundred yards away. Entering Buddakan, you encounter a host station nearly as large — and often as thronged — as an airline check-in counter. The journey to your table takes you past what look like the lacquered windows of a Chinese temple to a red room or a teal room or maybe a shimmering gold \"library,\" its walls lined with fake books. Make a bid for the library, which is fittingly quieter than other areas. Order a cocktail called \"heat.\" Made with tequila, Cointreau and cucumbers muddled with a chili paste, it\\'s like a margarita with martial arts training — and it\\'s the only specialty drink I didn\\'t find too sweet. Among appetizers, avoid anything in the shape of a ball — meaning dumplings and fritters, which tended to be dull — with the exception of the sui mei. Each of them had a rich amalgam of crab meat and shrimp mousse on the inside and, on the outside, a tiara of additional crab meat. Consider the tartares, spring rolls or boneless pork spare ribs, sauced sweetly but not cloyingly. In a restaurant this mammoth, you don\\'t expect fish to be as beautifully cooked as Buddakan\\'s steamed red snapper, a dish cribbed  from the short-lived restaurant Yumcha in Greenwich Village. It was served with black fungus mushrooms and lily bulb, which had a pleasant bitterness. An equally moist steamed sole wore a glistening coat of oil infused with ginger and scallions. The kitchen dutifully rounded out more than a half-dozen seafood entrees with glazed black cod because, ever since Nobu, a splashy Asian restaurant has to. Mr. Schulson told me on the telephone that he serves about 80 orders of that cod, which happens to be excellent, a night. He serves about five of the mao poe tofu. The world is unjust. Tea-smoked chicken with a scallion and ginger chutney was about as tender as chicken gets. While various red meat entrees — pork belly, short ribs, lamb chops — were prepared with obvious care, they felt too rote. Among solid noodle and rice dishes, the standout was fried rice with a creamy congee of scallops on top. Like Mr. Schulson, the pastry chef, Daniel Skurnick, does work distinctive enough to compete with the décor. A \"crying chocolate\" cake wept delectable tears of white chocolate ganache, while intensely flavored sorbets of blood orange and ginger lemon grass were bedecked with fried ginger chips. Buddakan won\\'t please diners of all ages equally. It\\'s better suited to the young, and its own youth is crucial to its appeal. Restaurants like this tend to look junky upon fifth or sixth inspection, and it\\'s hard to believe this kitchen, serving so many diners at such a fleet pace, won\\'t show signs of strain over time. But for now it\\'s keeping up with the crowds — and providing more reason than many patrons need to teeter down those scary steps into a labyrinth that Kubla Khan would undoubtedly have found appetizing.'"
