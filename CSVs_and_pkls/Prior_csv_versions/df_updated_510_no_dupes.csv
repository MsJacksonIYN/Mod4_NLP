0,Hanon,2 star,"May 21, 2019",Pete Wells,Williamsburg,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/dining/hanon-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/dining/hanon-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Hanon, a new udon shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was produced by the union of a Tokyo video-production company and a Japanese manufacturer of unusually thin condoms. The condoms became the subject of a series of advertisements on which the production company worked; in one of them, called “Acts of Love,” dancers in London re-enact, with surprising grace and dignity, the mating rituals of blue-footed boobies, fiddler crabs and other animals. Well, kids, when two companies like each other very much, sometimes they decide to create a new company together. That is what happened with the production firm and the prophylactics people when, for reasons that are perhaps best not to question, they hit upon the idea of expanding their product line from condoms into noodles. The restaurant lies across Union Avenue from Kellogg’s Diner. Its door is marked during business hours by the fluttering white noren curtains. It is the second Hanon location. The first is about 6,700 miles away, in the city of Kamakura, which lies south of Tokyo and is known for soba, not udon. This gave Hanon the advantage of not competing against any of Japan’s established udon styles, leaving its chef, Takahiro Yanagisawa, free to come up with his own. Mr. Yanagisawa, who had spent 25 years making sushi before turning to noodles, focused his innovative urges on the dough. He began by adding wheat germ and bran to the white flour that in udon is typically used alone. The resulting noodle is called zenryufun or whole wheat. The bran and germ are Mr. Yanagisawa’s attempts to make a more healthful udon, but they also add flavor, a mottled color and a slightly rough texture that holds on to the dashi-based broth. This dough is also made into a green noodle, called sasauchi, by mixing in powdered barley shoots and leaves of kuma-zasa, a bamboo variety that pandas dote on. To the human palate, or at least this human’s palate, sasa tastes something like green tea. Both the speckled zenryufun and the green sasauchi are flat noodles, resembling fettuccine that has been working out. Avoiding extremes, they are moderately chewy and reasonably springy. Either flavor, or both, can be ordered cold and spread on a bamboo mat for dunking into a sauce, either a peanut-buttery sesame sauce or the traditional dashi-based dipping sauce. For larger or more curious appetites, these dipping noodles, called seiro udon, can be dangled into a hot duck soup in which a few hunks of well-boiled duck meat swim. The cold noodles can also be accessorized with whipped mountain yam or tempura or both. If you had stumbled into Hanon under the impression that it was another generic Williamsburg noodle mill, the tempura would set you straight. The crust is engineered for udon, thick and substantial enough that it will not dissolve and float away in the soup, yet somehow not oily or clunky. The tempura is served with sea salt, which will not only season the fried blowfish tails, shrimp, mushroom and vegetables, but will also do very good things to any noodles it happens to meet. With the hot soups, there is no choice of noodles. All are made with zenryufun. The plain broth, a dashi augmented by white soy sauce, is not so salty or concentrated that I didn’t want to drink it all. It also performs well made into a thick-but-not-sludgy curry soup with thin pink slices of washugyu beef; a shaggy, mossy, salty-sour mass of ume and kombu; and a soup of shaved beef and onions that tastes like a deeper, stronger version of French dip jus and is blitzed by a little grated yuzu peel at the end. A few near-relatives of udon make it to the menu as well. The beef-and-onion combination can also be had over rice. Creamy, slightly spicy cod roe is tossed with zenryufun for an excellent mentaiko pasta that, for once, relies on the roe rather than Kewpie mayonnaise to make an impression. The eventual plan is to sell both colors of noodle to grocery stores and other restaurants — to become, in essence, the Sun Noodle of the udonisphere. This would be a gain for New York, but for the moment Hanon’s udon is found only at Hanon, where the noodles are made fresh each day. Any plan for world domination is not hinted at on the restaurant’s Facebook page, which seems to be its home base online, though nobody has bothered to post a menu there yet. Nor does the dining room suggest a budding global chain. Atmospheric and presumably expensive prints by the photographers Takashi Homma and Nobuyoshi Araki hang over the tables, and a signed Cy Twombly lithograph has been placed by the door to the backyard. The music — torch songs, jazz piano — seems to be coming from a radio tuned to another decade. A lot of this cocktail music will make more sense once the liquor license comes through. Hanon is getting set to offer sake, shochu and wines chosen by Jorge Riera, who built the list at Frenchette and has turned countless New Yorkers on to the fizzy, fuzzy and furry delights of natural wines. The idea of Hanon is not to slurp and slide out, but to stay for a meal: a chilled French red with the fried chicken and Japanese omelet, maybe, and something a bit brawnier with curry soup. Dessert could be a tofu blancmange, smooth and white and somewhat sweet, but there is more satisfaction in the grainy, earthy bricks of red bean paste. The meal might end with tea, to which the restaurant takes the same unhurried approach it applies to everything else. The iced oolong is slowly cold-brewed; a bamboo whisk and ceramic chawan are kept on the dining counter for painstakingly whipping up bowls of matcha; an appliance imported from Taiwan will transform freshly steeped hojicha and ice into a tan froth, a process that takes about five minutes. This foam tea is dairy-free, unlike Taiwan’s infamous cheese tea. It is served in a wine glass, and the experience of drinking it is similar to tackling a pint of Guinness before the head has settled down.

1,Del Posto,3 star,"May 14, 2019",Pete Wells,Chelsea,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/dining/del-posto-review-pete-wells.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/dining/del-posto-review-pete-wells.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"More than a year ago, I was on the verge of reviewing Del Posto when the news intervened. The restaurant had changed significantly since the last time it had been evaluated by a Times critic: Sam Sifton promoted it from three stars to four in 2010, when Mark Ladner was the executive chef and Brooks Headley was running the pastry kitchen. First, Mr. Headley had quit this stately, expensive Italian restaurant in Chelsea so he could sell fast, cheap vegetarian burgers. Next, Del Posto had spent about $1 million on crystal candle vases, white leather chairs and other luxurious fittings that made it even more stately and expensive. Finally, Mr. Ladner had left to sell fast, cheap pasta. A fresh review was clearly in order. Before I could write it, though, a number of women who had worked for Mario Batali, one of the owners, started talking about the sexual harassment and abuse that they say he had doled out. Suddenly there seemed to be more important questions than whether the braised-rabbit agnolotti were cooked al dente. Negotiations took more than a year, but Mr. Batali no longer profits from Del Posto, having sold his stake in March to a group led by his former partner, Joe Bastianich. Employees have said that Mr. Bastianich himself helped, at a minimum, to build the sexist and disrespectful environment in which Mr. Batali operated. Mr. Bastianich has apologized, saying that he had heard Mr. Batali speak inappropriately to employees, and that he should have done more to stop the sexual harassment. Some diners will stay away, feeling that Mr. Bastianich has not sufficiently atoned. I understand this, but I am also interested in the way employees may be treated at the restaurant now and in the future. Here, there is reason to hope. Among other human-resources reforms, employees can now report complaints about owners or corporate officers to an independent investigative firm with the power to refer cases to outside counsel. As part of the restructuring, Melissa Rodriguez, who has been the executive chef of Del Posto since 2017, was made a partner in the restaurant, along with Jeff Katz, now the managing partner. A new pastry chef, Georgia Wodder, was appointed last spring. Del Posto is, with the possible exception of Aquavit, the grandest and most expensive restaurant in New York where women are in charge of everything you eat, starting with the miniature saffron waffle rolled like a cannoli and stuffed at one tiny end with taleggio and at the other with fennel pesto, and ending with the prosecco marshmallow tucked into the wooden drawer of a custom-made cheese grater. The cooking is more subdued now. The kitchen is not seen as a beacon of innovation the way it used to be, perhaps because Ms. Rodriguez is less interested than Mr. Ladner was in feats of technical derring-do like 100-layer lasagnas. She gets her effects by following old Italian templates and putting them together so elegantly that they seem to light up from inside. There’s an honesty to her approach — she doesn’t try to shoot out all the lights by supercharging dishes with fat — but it’s not the kind of peasant simplicity people usually mean when they talk about honesty in Italian food. It’s a sophisticated honesty. You know chicken cacciatore, of course. Ms. Rodriguez’s version is made from guinea hen breast, roasted until the skin crackles like parchment. What would be the body of the stew is now a sauce; the tomato, celery and onion in it come through distinctly. Occupying a little sidecar is a pressed puck of braised leg meat under a single, Roman-style gnocco, a small featherbed of semolina held together by eggs, milk and cheese. One side has been broiled so hard it is nearly burned, which seems like a mistake at first, but turns out to supply the bit of campfire that this hunter’s stew needs. It has to be far more complicated to prepare than the cacciatore at your neighborhood Italian restaurant, but it seems simpler, pared to essentials, and wonderful in every bite. I’ve never seen anyone wring as much flavor out of salsify as Ms. Rodriguez does. Sliced transparently thin and fried, it makes crunchy brown chips about half the size of an M&M. These decorate the top of a grilled-salsify pudding that has the refreshing bittersweetness of one of those plant-based Italian aperitifs. If it were not garnished with streaky leaves of radicchio, it could pass for a dessert. The menu structure has not changed, although the prices have. Everything can be had à la carte. Lunch is still a relative bargain, though the price has shimmied up to $59 for three courses. For a blowout $194 dinner, the Captain’s Menu yields eight courses or so. Most people, however, go with the $164, five-course Menu del Posto. The primary argument in favor of this strategy is, to me, an overwhelming one: Two of those five courses are pasta. Del Posto’s pastas are worth doubling up on. They can come in many forms. Delicate conical tortellini have hidden pockets of nettles and spring peas; they are half-submerged in a light spring-vegetable brodo in which Parmigiano-Reggiano rinds once bobbed like bay leaves. This is the spring minestrone. A single, plate-spanning raviolo, called a fazzoletto, is topped with poached mussels and filled with spinach and fresh herbs — not a lawnmower-mulch of greenery but a layer of emulsion as thin and velvety as the dough that envelops it. The sauce of mussel juices, white wine, butter and saffron makes this the only convincing mussel pasta I’ve ever had. The range of flavors Ms. Wodder commands in her pastry kitchen seems unnecessarily limited to me, although I may be unfairly comparing her desserts with Mr. Headley’s, which roamed all over the place. Individually, her desserts are soothing, often showcasing the comforts of dairy. More emphasis, some extra acidity or bitterness, might have brought an assemblage of quince paste, brown-butter gelato and griddled brioche into relief. But I appreciated the way winter squash in the batter modified the sweetness of an olive oil-orange cake, and I enjoyed the moody sulkiness that amaro lent to a citrus salad served with the cake. Del Posto has in recent years picked up a reputation as a restaurant for one-percenters. It rarely gives that impression once you are inside, where servers solemnly accommodate just about anyone. There is a vegan menu at Del Posto. A vegetarian meal can be put together easily, and almost everything can be made without gluten, including the pasta. Yes, the stockpile of Champagnes includes some lock-and-key stuff, and should you require a Barolo costing between $2,000 and $4,000, one will quickly be added to your bill. But among the 3,100 or so Italian labels superintended by Evan Clagnaz, the wine director, are more marked from $60 to $75 than I can count. Piemonte is a place to hunt, and Friuli, and the Valle d’Aosta, for starters. Though the restaurant is not exclusively for rich people, it is explicitly for occasions. Once, when a reservationist called to confirm and asked whether I was celebrating anything special, I said no, and was gently laughed at: “Just a normal Tuesday night at Del Posto?” There is little danger that anyone will mistake a night at Del Posto for normal. If nothing else, the napkins and towels are a tip-off. First, there is a small hot linen napkin scented with tomato-vine oil, to wipe the dust of the outside world from your hands. Then a large white linen napkin, followed just before dessert by a small yellow one. It is given to you, and the white one is taken away, by a server using a large fork and spoon as tongs. When you go to the restrooms, you may encounter an attendant who has just restocked the hand towels from a large basket she carries on one arm, like Heidi out gathering wildflowers for Grandfather. There are little ceremonies like this from start to finish; I don’t know of any other restaurant that performs quite so many tasks whose only real purpose is to draw attention to themselves. And these things are rarely done with a smile; employees seem to have been directed to keep a respectful, formal distance as they carry out your requests and perform other services you’d never think of requesting. They rarely seem comfortable. Their solemnity is underlined by the sepulchral lighting at night, so gloomy it makes the crypt of Grant’s tomb look like a tiki bar. A good deal of the service is the attentive, helpful kind that you really want, but the rest of it seems designed only to give customers the sensation of temporary power over other people. Some people may love this, but it reflects a serious lack of imagination when you think about the ways the service at Blue Hill at Stone Barns or Noma, for instance, is integrated into the experience. Is it stretching a point to ask if enshrining subservience, as Del Posto does, reflects the same twisted sense of priorities that allowed Mr. Batali to get away with abusing his own power for so long? (And is it a coincidence that far more men than women seem to work in the dining room, particularly in the upper ranks?) Now that Ms. Rodriguez owns a piece of the restaurant, perhaps she can lead a reconsideration of priorities in the front of the house, and find a tone that more closely matches her philosophy in the back. She shouldn’t have to clean up the messes men made. But having worked her way to the top of a restaurant that has always aspired to provide luxury, she has a chance to decide what, in New York in 2019, that word might mean.

2,The Freakin Rican,1 star,"May 7, 2019",Pete Wells,Astoria,"Caribbean, Latin American",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/dining/the-freakin-rican-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/dining/the-freakin-rican-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"It is true that the bacalaitos at the Freakin Rican in Astoria, Queens, are not quite as big around as the ones you will see browning in veritable caldrons of oil over wood fires at kiosks scattered along the beach road in Piñones, outside San Juan. These flattened cod fritters are the size of pie plates in Puerto Rico, while in Queens they are roughly the diameter of a coffee can. Dimensions aside, they give off all the right signals. They are the color of a corn muffin, with green specks of chopped cilantro under the surface that let you know they are not made from Goya’s mix. They don’t leave your fingertips entirely free of grease, but they come close. They have an exterior crunch that surrenders quickly to the firm, chewy interior of mashed salt cod; the texture is less fried dough than fish taffy. You could start to build a business around bacalaitos like these. That, in fact, has been Derick López’s plan for some time now. Mr. López, who was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the South Bronx, is the Freakin Rican’s chef and, with his husband, Victor Vargas, its owner. About four years ago, armed with picnic coolers and a couple of folding tables, the two men began selling a short menu of Puerto Rican staples at the street fairs that seem to infiltrate a different New York thoroughfare each weekend. As they promoted the Freakin Rican catering operation, the Freakin Rican product line, the Freakin Rican Facebook page and the Freakin Rican YouTube channel, they saved their earnings so they could found the Freakin Rican restaurant. After a false start in another part of Queens, it opened a short distance from the Museum of the Moving Image one year ago this month. The dining room has 19 seats. The banana-plant wallpaper on the left wall is reflected in the mirrors on the right. In between are some metal chickens and bright-green figurines of coquís, the little frogs that chirp from every Puerto Rican tree. Diners sip on tropical-fruit shakes or bottles of Kola Champagne, Coco Rico and Malta India, the Harry, Ron and Hermione of Puerto Rican soft drinks. Héctor Lavoe may be playing over the speakers, or Víctor Manuelle, not so loudly that they can’t be drowned out by the sounds of a small number of employees singing “Happy Birthday” while wielding a tambourine and a pair of maracas. If you have spent any time at all on the trail of chicharrones, mofongo, sancocho and other wonders of the Puerto Rican kitchen, you know that Astoria is not a primary hunting ground for any of them. You also know, though, that blinking-light cuchifritos parlors and family-run cocina criolla luncheonettes have been disappearing from the Bronx, East Harlem and the Lower East Side over the past few decades, along with many of their customers. The Puerto Rican population in New York peaked around 1990, when residents of the old barrios began to flow to the suburbs in large numbers, according to Laird W. Bergad, the director of the Center for Latin American, Caribbean and Latino Studies at City University of New York Graduate Center. Beacons of Puerto Rican cuisine still survive; Casa Adela, for instance, is still busily dispensing chickens from its venerable lemon-yellow rotisserie on Avenue C, despite the death last year of its founder, Adela Fargas. But there are not so many of these places left that we can take an unlimited supply of tostones and mojo de ajo for granted, either. The Freakin Rican developed its act on the street-fair circuit, but it applied the same tactics that succeed at Smorgasburg and similar urban foraging grounds, where the ideal dish can be held in one hand, gets immediate attention, costs under $10 and can serve as a plank in a branding platform. This may explain why appetizers are the strong suit on the Freakin Rican menu. The sorullitos, Puerto Rico’s answer to hush puppies, are an exception; they are dense and dry, as if the cornmeal hadn’t absorbed enough water. Mr. López’s alcapurrias, though, are very good, even if the picadillo that runs down the middle of a tube of mashed fried plantains like the graphite in a pencil could be seasoned a little more forcefully. And his pasteles are exceptional. Pasteles are structured like tamales. Where the masa would be, Mr. López makes a sweet, enjoyably gummy mash of green plantains, taro root and kabocha squash. The filling is a soft, rich vein of stewed pork shoulder with ham, bacon, red peppers and green olives. Rolled up in a banana leaf, these pasteles probably deserve their own float in the Puerto Rican Day Parade. Mr. López fries chicken in two styles. One, the chicharrones de pollo, is traditional. The other, the Freakin Crispy Wings, is not. Each has its rewards. The chicharrones, hacked into three-bite hunks, taste of cider vinegar and garlic powder and have a smooth, achiote-tinted buttermilk crust that breaks open with a pleasing crackle. The Freakin Crispy Wings are spicier, and the shell is thicker and more deeply crevassed. These wings may owe more to Atlanta than to Mayagüez, although you can get them with a guava barbecue sauce that’s reasonably tropical. Leave behind these appetizers, the core of the street-fair business, and the menu can start to appear unsteady. At dinner, the main courses tend to be fairly plain fried or grilled meat. Grilled pork chops splashed with mojo can be dry and dull, and the grilled chicken breasts are not much more interesting. Baked pork ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce are tender enough, but they aren’t very persuasive. On several nights, I found myself gazing longingly at the lunch specials on the back of the menu, wondering why I couldn’t have a brick of pastelón for dinner. (I came back for it one Thursday afternoon, and was glad I did.) Until more long-cooked dishes like it appear at dinnertime, consider a bowl of sancocho. Listed as “vegetable root soup” for $7, it doesn’t sound like much of a meal. But it is a grab bag of a stew with at least two kinds of meat, great hunks of taro and yuca, a couple of inches of corn on the cob and a magical squash broth that has the consistency of heavy cream and the color of very ripe mango. In the unlikely event that you finish it and the bowl of rice that comes with it and then cry out for more, the Freakin Rican has just the thing for you: mofongo. A dome of mashed plantains possessed by garlic, the mofongo is cooked to order to keep the crunchy bits crunchy and the whole thing from getting boggy. You can have it with chicharrones or sliced roast pork, which leaves behind a happy impression of garlic, oregano and salt. If you have come for a birthday, a candle stuck in the meringue icing of a tres leches cake is probably in your future. If not, flan and espresso will do, and a bag of pasteles for tomorrow.

3,Wayan,2 star,"April 23, 2019",Pete Wells,NoLIta,Indonesian,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/dining/wayan-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/dining/wayan-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"If you ate at Spice Market before it closed two years ago, you may experience low-key but persistent flashbacks at Wayan, which set up shop in February on the east end of Spring Street in NoLIta. Again the flavors come from Asia and the methods, generally, from France. Again the far-off tropics are evoked through the play of indirect, dappled light, as if filtered through jungle foliage or a carved wooden screen. Again the presiding culinary sensibility belongs to a Vongerichten. Jean-Georges Vongerichten put together Spice Market in 2004, a confection of teak, silk, vodka, peanut sauce and high heels that brought the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre to its apotheosis. All the earlier examples suddenly seemed fumbling and unsophisticated, and with the possible exception of the Spice Market spinoffs in Qatar and Mexico, the ones that would follow seemed increasingly mindless and out of touch. Interior design that rummages through the musty old trunks of Orientalism doesn’t look as alluring as it did 15 years ago, and cooking that filters Asian flavors through a Western sensibility isn’t automatically met with gales of excitement. Wayan, where Mr. Vongerichten’s son, Cédric, is the chef, avoids both traps, I think. The restaurant is a tribute to Indonesia, the home of his wife and business partner, Ochi Vongerichten, and the site of two restaurants that he opened recently. (He is also the chef of Perry St. in Manhattan, which his father owns.) The scale is more personal and the cultural references are more specific at Wayan than at Spice Market and its kind. The menu is far from encyclopedic, but it is clear that Indonesia’s cuisine has been given more than the quick glance that informs a lot of Asian fusion. Ms. Vongerichten works in the dining room, stopping by tables to offer explanations of the menu and how the cooking differs from that at some other Indonesian restaurants in New York, which she cheerfully calls “more authentic.” More than any other factor, she helps keep Wayan from turning into a junior version of one of her father-in-law’s restaurants — Young Vongerichtenstein. Servers will tell you to start with a stick or two of satay. You can, although the skewers are cooked on a flattop instead of a grill, and inconsistency is an issue. The pork skewers that are so appealingly juicy and savory with sweet soy one week can be scorched and bitter the next time you see them, and just ordinary the following week. (The pickled watermelon radishes on the side, though, are always terrific; they’re brined with lime leaf.) The peanut sauce on chicken satay may hum with red curry and chiles, or may present as a sweet, inert blob. A more promising opening move, and one that will help place Cédric and Ochi Vongerichten’s mental map of Indonesia in perspective, would be the Jimbaran-style clams. This is not a dish that is likely to have been stirred by generations of sainted grandmothers since the dawn of time. It is, in fact, a specialty of the seafood vendors who sprang up on a stretch of Balinese beach where resorts first began to appear sometime around the birth of Taylor Swift. Littlenecks, flavored with soy sauce and garlic paste, are grilled under flakes of coconut, which form the golden crust that would be provided by bread crumbs if these were clams oreganata. A slice of pickled red chile sits on each one, waiting. If you were on vacation, you would order tray after tray of these. Here on Spring Street, other things will keep you distracted. In the hearts-of-palm salad, sweet and sour are carefully pitted against each other by means of a mango vinaigrette, a lime-and-fish-sauce dressing and a neon coat of passion-fruit pulp. The crab cake is, despite its sweet chile sauce, about as Indonesian as Betty White, but it is fresh and fluffy and not worth arguing about. Wayan’s rendition of the street snack bakwan jagung is a golden agglomeration of corn kernels and shallots fried into a flat, crunchy disc. There had better be nasi goreng at any restaurant that is even playing at being Indonesian. There is, the rice fried just until it crackles a bit between your teeth. It has a gentle but genuine spice undercurrent that would be welcome in more of the cooking. Of course there is a gado gado, and this being 2019, of course the main ingredient is avocado; the hard-cooked eggs belong to quail. This time the peanut dressing isn’t cloying or clumpy. As the plates get larger, few dishes really come forward as the kind of knockout that everybody will talk about later. The closest contender must be the lobster and basil with wavy noodles in a sauce containing, among other things, sweet soy and melted butter — a combination that the senior Mr. Vongerichten has used so successfully that it may be his son’s inheritance. Should the calamansi vinaigrette poured over the steamed black sea bass be more sour and spicy? Probably. But if there are few stars on the table, the contrast of flavors, colors, textures and techniques makes the meal into a memorable ensemble piece. The drumsticks in yellow chicken are crunchy, and the thighs are tender; both are mellow with a yellow curry seasoned by lemongrass and ginger. The tomato-chile sambal pressed into the surface of cod “bilindango” is potent enough to carry over to the spears of asparagus and fiddlehead ferns sprawled alongside. All of this looks very come-hither in the dining room, where the  Rockwell Group has abandoned stadium-size props, building atmospheric effects instead out of contrasting textures and light values and the movement of shadows. This is the visual language of expensive tropical resorts, and Wayan seems to give people the feeling they’re on vacation. It is not necessarily a loud restaurant, but New Yorkers are a loud people, and around 10 the noise can start to press down. It is a good time to call for dessert. The purple-yam ice cream with banana cake and caramelized bananas is good if sundaes are your thing. The pandan custard under passion-fruit pulp gets a lot of mileage from just a few flavors. But the one that sounds too boring to bother with (“assorted exotic fruit?”) is worth a second look. Lychee, mango, pineapple and dragon fruit may not be particularly exotic, but a dip or a dunk into a dark, spicy syrup of tamarind and palm sugar will wake them right up.

4,Niche,1 star,"April 16, 2019",Pete Wells,Lower East Side,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/dining/niche-review-mazemen.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/dining/niche-review-mazemen.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"In 2012 and 2013, when people were lining up at Smorgasburg and then on the second floor of the Houston Street Whole Foods Market for biodegradable bowls of Yuji Haraguchi’s mazemen — noodles that might be dressed with crisped twigs of bacon and a jiggling onsen egg, say, or yuzu-cured salmon and some Camembert soft enough to transform into a sauce — I was sure the crowds would multiply and fan out, demanding more of this strange brothless ramen. And they did, in a sense. Soon Mr. Haraguchi had established his own free-standing establishment, Yuji Ramen in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where he serves that bacon-and-egg mazemen along with his possibly visionary “tunakotsu” ramen. In 2014, when Ivan Orkin came to New York, he brought along his own mazemen recipes. Over the next few years mazemen turned up in other restaurants, too, but all of them remained better known for soup ramen, and sold more of it. It began to look as if mazemen would never be more than a sideshow act, the one-armed ax-catcher of the ramen circus. Then at the start of the year, the chef Shigetoshi Nakamura, who operates an intimate ramen shop on the Lower East Side, opened an annex next door that is dedicated to mazemen. All the seating at this new place, Niche, is at a dozen or so stools arranged around one long, narrow table. When the dining room is fully occupied, the only way to get from one end to the other is to walk sideways while holding your breath and picking up all the coats that you are going to knock off their wall pegs as you go. Not that there is much reason to roam around. Orders are taken from and delivered to the table, and there is no public restroom on the premises. As is the case next door at Nakamura, seats by the window offer a close-up view of the stone walls that support the last few yards of the Williamsburg Bridge before it empties onto Delancey Street. Before he came to New York, Mr. Nakamura was already well known in Tokyo, where he proved to have a theatrical streak. Before filling a bowl with noodles, he would yank them from the boiling water with his left hand and then hold them high in the air for a few seconds, letting them drain while standing completely motionless. Suddenly he would drop his arm and the basket would plunge toward the water again, before stopping just in time and getting one quick, emphatic shake. When Mr. Nakamura was  immortalized as one of four “ramen gods” in a set of Hello Kitty notepads and phone straps, Kitty was posed with her left paw raised high in emulation of the Nakamura Shake. If Mr. Nakamura has been practicing his choreography on the spaghetti-like, crinkly noodles at Niche, I haven’t seen it yet. The Nakamura Shake seems designed to extract cooking water as quickly as possible before the noodles cool, and temperature is not especially critical in mazemen. The idea of noodle soup without the soup has been on the loose in Japan for decades. Broth is the most expensive and labor-intensive part of a bowl of ramen; in the 1950s, a Tokyo noodle shop, in the pitiless logic of the restaurant business, began omitting the broth when ladling out noodles at staff meals, or so the story goes. This “abura soba” — oil noodle, because it was moistened with lard along with the seasoning sauce called tare — wasn’t half bad, so it went on the menu at a discounted price. As an even cheaper version of an already cheap and filling meal, abura soba was quickly embraced, especially by students. As food ideas tend to do in Japan, it evolved rapidly. Today, abura soba tends to refer to dry soups that have more or less the same toppings you’d find in a bowl of normal ramen, while mazemen generally has toppings that are rarely seen in soup and often would not respond well to being submerged in hot liquid. There is Italian-style mazemen, with anchovies, salami, olives and tomatoes. Some mazemen shops specialize in fried beef cutlets. At a Tokyo restaurant called Beefst, the centerpiece of each bowl is sliced roast beef, served rare. Mr. Nakamura has an answer to that: steak mazemen. The steak is rib-eye, in cubes that have been browned with a kitchen torch. When you stir them with the noodles and a smooth, creamy spoonful of something the menu simply calls “pork sauce,” their juices and flecks of char flavor the whole bowl. Plain spinach and fermented bamboo, meanwhile, keep the total effect from being queasy-making. Novel, straightforward, refined, unruly and impure of heart, steak mazemen has the makings of a classic New York dish. So does the duck, a common special. A sliced breast of moulard duck cooked to a deep violet-pink, it is served with a bright, focused sauce built on soy and enough warm duck juices to lubricate the whole-wheat noodles. It is not an austere dish by any means, but it is balanced and restrained. The same cannot be said for another special that is always offered on the same nights: a bowl of liquefied foie gras topped with pistachios and truffle oil. It is not clear what will happen to anyone who tries to eat this with a spoon, but the prognosis does not seem good. Instead, everybody orders it with the duck mazemen and dips the noodles into the foie gras, after which conscious thought tends to stop for a minute or two. When cerebral activity resumes, you might wonder why the sauce doesn’t come with its own noodles. No other mazemen is such a joy ride, but the vaguely Italian one with tomatoes, mushrooms, kombu and an angry red soak of chile oil is not the kind of thing you want to turn your back on. Even the tribute to Russ & Daughters, where the noodles are coated with spicy cod roe and the topping is sliced smoked salmon, can sneak up on you. Niche is one of the few ramen-yas in town where the appetizers are worth noticing. Sea urchin perched on tiny corners of toast is a strange and awkward affair, but the sardines on toast, dressed with chile flakes, are very good, as are the raw scallops with yuzu juice and the avocado salad showered with tempura flakes. Should fries be an appetizer? Maybe not, particularly Niche’s “umami kombu fries,” which have been sprinkled with powdered shio kombu until they are almost subliminally green. Apart from the color, they look like the fries at McDonald’s. The difference is that the shio kombu makes them almost diabolically hard to stop eating. And if you don’t eat them before the mazemen arrives, then when will you? Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

5,Haenyeo,2 star,"April 9, 2019",Pete Wells,Park Slope,Korean,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/dining/haenyeo-restaurant-review-jenny-kwak.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/dining/haenyeo-restaurant-review-jenny-kwak.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Looking around Haenyeo’s dining room one night in early March, I thought maybe Jenny Kwak’s time has finally come. Her third restaurant, Haenyeo was about three months old and already filled with people who looked as if they’d been going there for years. It sits on a prime corner lot, on a stretch of Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that is rich in local minichains serving banh mi, burritos, lobster rolls and so on, to take out or eat in. Intimidating restaurants don’t tend to prosper here. Very few people inside Haenyeo look the least bit intimidated as they lift grilled oysters by the shell to pour the dregs of hot seaweed butter over toast; or carve wedges of zucchini-scallion pancakes fried to a dark and satisfyingly rich brown; or stir mushrooms, squid, bean sprouts, steamed spinach and cabbage kimchi with a just-cracked egg into a bibimbap whose bottom layer of rice is golden and crunchy where it meets the hot stone bowl. The customers at Haenyeo seem to have an easy familiarity with Korean food. Some of them, at least, can probably thank Ms. Kwak for that. In 1992, when she began serving the cuisine in the East Village at her first restaurant, Dok Suni’s, the words tteokbokki and seolleongtang and jajangmyeon did not roll off the tongues of most non-Koreans. But that’s who she wanted to lure in with American music, date-night décor and Western-style service. Once she had them, she would tempt, teach, turn them on to the flavors she’d grown up with. Her mother, Myung Ja Kwak, shared cooking duties. Ms. Kwak’s was not the take-it-or-leave-it approach of 32nd Street, and she kept at it. She wrote “Dok Suni: Recipes From My Mother’s Korean Kitchen,” which was one of the few Korean cookbooks in English when it came out, in 1998. At her second restaurant, Do Hwa, she and her mother led customers deeper into unfamiliar ground. Each of the restaurants stayed open for about two decades, which is a very long time in New York. If you want a metaphor for how effectively Ms. Kwak paved the way for restaurants like Atoboy, Soogil, Danji and others whose chefs weave Korean cuisine into new patterns, consider that one of them, Oiji, moved into its address on First Avenue right after Dok Suni’s moved out. What Ms. Kwak is doing in Park Slope isn’t all that different from what she has done all her career, except that by now South Korean comfort food has become comfort food for New York in general. Haenyeo does pay more attention to seafood than Dok Suni or Do Hwa did, though. Ms. Kwak hasn’t gone pescatarian on us. She still serves impressive pork and beef bulgogis with ssamjang and lettuce, and the pan-fried dumplings are filled with high-fat ground beef seasoned with kimchi, garlic and soy. But her menu’s orientation has shifted slightly toward the ocean. This is good news, because the seafood at Haenyeo has a sparkle and sweetness you don’t always find in the smoke-filled rooms of 32nd Street. A bibimbap variant may be the menu’s sleeper dish, partly because it starts out looking like a lunch bowl from Sweetgreen. It is a version of hwe dup bap. At first you just see raw tuna, shredded romaine and perilla leaves, grated carrots and cucumber, and strips of seaweed. Hidden underneath is warm rice. But there is a pink mound of spicy cod roe in the bowl, too, with cured salmon eggs and a few lobes of sea urchin. Both of them will break apart as you stir, bringing their distinct saltwater intonations to the rice and vegetables. What the menu calls “white fish fillets” — pan-fried cod with rings of scallion showing through their thin gold sheet of egg batter, otherwise known as saeng seon jeon — is so modestly named it might get overlooked; it shouldn’t. The menu plays Don’t Mind Me again with “mackerel, grilled or braised.” Just get the mackerel, because the kitchen knows how to cook it, whether over a flame or in a dark, smoky pan of garlic and gochujang. In truth, the kitchen seems to know how to cook every kind of seafood, although perhaps it could come with a better partner for the fried scallops than the sweet, yellowish tartar sauce with corn in it. The walls are hung with photographs of Korean women in wet suits. These are the haenyeo of Jeju island, who dive up to 30 feet deep for conch, abalone and seaweed while holding their breath for several minutes at a time. The money they made diving is probably the reason parts of Jeju have a matriarchal family structure. Naming the restaurant after them, Ms. Kwak continues a theme started with Dok Suni’s, which means “strong women’s.” One dish that seems out of place is a revival of Dok Suni’s fried chicken. Was the batter always so pasty and airless? That’s not how I remember it, but it’s possible my standards have changed as Korean fried chicken has infiltrated nearly every part of town over the past decade. In any case, there is better chicken to seek out here, not just the home-style dokdoritang stewed in chile sauce but also the wings. Haenyeo double-fries wings that have been dipped in potato starch, then coats them with a fine version of a yangnyeom chile sauce, tangier and a little less sweet than some. When Ms. Kwak detours from the Korean straight and narrow, consider traipsing along behind her. You may wind up having beignets for dessert, buried under a fresh coat of powdered sugar in the best Café du Monde style. (This and the grilled oysters may betray the hand of her business partner, Terrence Segura, who is from New Orleans. He is also her husband.) Or you may follow her all the way to the joyous rice cake fundido, which starts out as tteokbokki in chile sauce and becomes totally atypical through the addition of chorizo, sliced jalapeños and a melted, browned topcoat of Oaxacan cheese that comes up in long, stretchy strings when you pull on it. It is, in all likelihood, the best Tex-Mex dish in New York. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

6,Standard Grill,2 star,"April 2, 2019",Pete Wells,West Village,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/dining/standard-grill-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/dining/standard-grill-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I’m starting to think the American cult of chef worship may really be on the way out. At the very least, it has paused to catch its breath. Since the seven-story food court in Hudson Yards was unveiled last month, the public reaction has been somewhere between shrug and ugh. Attitudes may improve as visitors eat their way to the top floor. So far, though, the response hasn’t come close to matching the greeting bestowed on the restaurants at Time Warner Center in 2004, even though the project represents the same basic idea executed by the same developer with at least one of the same chefs, Thomas Keller. Even more striking has been the low-key reception to Rocco DiSpirito’s return. Late last year Mr. DiSpirito took over the kitchen at Standard Grill in the meatpacking district. At one point, when he was the chef at both Union Pacific and Rocco’s on 22nd while starring in a television show, he was arguably the most famous chef in the country. Then both places closed, and the show was canceled. Mr. DiSpirito has not been in charge of a restaurant since George W. Bush was in the White House. For that matter, it has been some years since Standard Grill itself has done anything noteworthy. In 2009, when it was new and Dan Silverman was the chef, I reviewed it, gave it one star and then lost track of it. In other words, the selection of Mr. DiSpirito did not just come out of left field. It came from the weeds across the street from the parking lot behind left field. For surprise value alone, it should have been one of the year’s most buzzed-about news items. But the trumpets have been muted, and the back handsprings seem to lack a certain bounce. This, at least, is the view from outside the restaurant. Once you’re sitting at one of the tables — newly topped with leather pads in a major retrofitting that has made the dining room look like an expensive cabaret, blue velvet and all — you will hear quite a lot of talk about Mr. DiSpirito, or as they call him here, Chef Rocco. Chef Rocco, you learn, conceived each dish on the menu so that it can be eaten by one person or shared with others. No, I didn’t believe it at first, either, but apparently it’s true: Rocco DiSpirito invented food. There is also something that servers call Chef Rocco’s Game Changing Toast, although sometimes they shorten it to Rocco’s Game Changing or simply Game Changing, as in “Here’s a little more Game Changing for you.” The item in question is a toasted, cracker-thin slice of bread made of nuts, oats, seeds and psyllium-seed husks held together without benefit of wheat flour. Like nearly everything on the menu, it is free of gluten. Being mostly made of browned nuts, it is also delicious. Whether it is truly Rocco’s is up for debate. It seems to strongly resemble the Life-Changing Loaf of Bread recipe that Sarah Britton published on her blog, “My New Roots,” in 2013, and that appeared on another blog two years later, with minor changes, as Game Changing Nut & Seed Bread. It’s one of the items that reflect Mr. DiSpirito’s recent obsession with nutrient-dense dietary supplements, although the way it keeps coming up in the servers’ patter makes you wonder if Mr. DiSpirito spent too much time as a QVC pitchman. Anyway, somebody-or-other’s toast sits under the smoked gravlax, red with beet juice and very silky on its bed of coconut crème fraîche, that Mr. DiSpirito sends out as an amuse. A plate of the toast will also appear if you order the platter of acorn-fed, hand-sliced Ibérico ham or the chilled Maine sea urchins served on the spiky half-shell. Either one will convince you that Mr. DiSpirito knows how to get his hands on raw materials that can stun with almost no assistance. The best things at Standard Grill, and there are quite a lot of them, depend on very good ingredients touched as little as possible. Back in the Union Pacific days, Mr. DiSpirito’s interest in East Asian cuisines came out in the form of complex preparations, arcane ingredients and out-of-nowhere juxtapositions. Now he seems to have moved on to the luxury minimalism of an omakase sushi chef, a style that was foreshadowed by the only Union Pacific dish he’s brought back, bay scallops and sea urchin with a few throat-searing drops of mustard oil. Standard Grill’s ice-cold cubes of bluefin chu-toro stirred with golden osetra caviar, meanwhile, could have come straight out of Masa, while the yellowfin tartare, barely dressed with crushed macadamias and freshly grated wasabi, is like one of the better items at Tetsu. Each night there are half a dozen or so skewers cooked over Japanese charcoal and wheeled to the table on a mini-grill the size of a toaster oven. Speared on a stick might be fantastic small scallops out of Peconic Bay; a feathery mop of maitake mushrooms; buttery chicken livers with barely a hint of bitterness; or firefly squid, a little bigger than a fava bean and grilled whole so they can be swallowed guts and all. Again, the ingredients are exceptional. The skewers look simple enough, but they are all, you learn, brushed with “a little sauce Chef Rocco came up with to complement the charcoal.” The sauce for seafood involves coconut nectar and lemongrass, and what it actually does is put you, vaguely and pleasantly, in mind of Thailand. While I am one of those increasingly stooped and wizened diners who remembers, in detail, Mr. DiSpirito’s cooking at Union Pacific, far more people recall him as the meatball-pushing antihero of “The Restaurant,” an NBC series about Rocco’s on 22nd, an actual (and doomed, it turned out) Italian-American restaurant. The show, which debuted in 2003, was a pioneer in the genre of cooking-focused reality television, although when everybody started suing everybody else, it became clear it was a pioneer in the way the members of the Donner Party were pioneers. The handful of Italian dishes at Standard Grill may be meant for “Restaurant” fans. Neither of the two pastas showed Mr. DiSpirito at his best, but a chewy risotto with red shrimp and what seemed like half a dozen forms of black truffles may make you understand why Ruth Reichl started her 1998 Times review of Union Pacific with a woman moaning at the next table. Standard Grill’s Norwegian salmon on an ivory puddle of vegan cashew sauce won’t inspire the same reaction, but the steaks might; they are dry-aged until ripe, and earn their deep-brown crust over extremely hot Japanese charcoal. Given what Mr. DiSpirito is capable of doing with a piece of halibut and some goose fat, I can’t quite believe that I’m recommending the rib-eye over the seafood, but I am. It may be that Mr. DiSpirito knows exactly what he is doing. Simplicity is the whole point of a grill, which is first cousin to the steakhouse. He has also designed a menu so straightforward that if, after a respectable period of time, he is no longer in the kitchen, the food quality can stay roughly the same as long as the hotel doesn’t argue about ingredient costs. The Standard has not left the restaurant’s fate entirely in his hands, either; besides redecorating, it hired a maître d’hôtel, Michael Cecchi-Azzolina, away from Le Coucou; he is hard at work building an audience every night, handing out old-school business cards to old-school producers, chefs and publishers, sitting down to chat with Brooke Shields and Ms. Reichl. Standard Grill is so much better than it used to be, and so much better than almost any restaurant serving a comparable menu of grilled meats and chilled seafood, that it’s foolish to wish for the return of the same Mr. DiSpirito who gave us Union Pacific. It’s a little bit as if Barbra Streisand had returned to Broadway, and then sang all her songs in a whisper sitting on the edge of the stage. It might not be what you had been waiting for, but you’d watch. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

7,Violet,1 star,"March 26, 2019",Pete Wells,East Village,"Italian, Pizza",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/dining/violet-pizza-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/dining/violet-pizza-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"When I left my home state of Rhode Island at 18, it didn’t take long to discover that there was almost nothing about its local food customs that didn’t make outsiders laugh. That small children routinely bought coffee-flavored milk in school cafeterias; that “beer” was not pronounced with an “r” at the end, but pizza was; that a hot dog shortened to about four inches and topped with meat sauce is called a hot wiener, and that a counterman preparing six of them at a time may deploy a maneuver known as “wieners up the arm” — all of this apparently strikes people who grew up more than 20 miles from Providence as very funny. When New Yorkers hear that Violet, a new restaurant in the East Village, serves a style of pizza that comes from Rhode Island, they start to smile, as if getting ready for the punch line. In fact, though, Violet’s pies are a homage not to the whole state but to a specific restaurant, Al Forno, in Providence. If you know one thing about Al Forno, you know that its pizza is not a joke. One of the restaurant’s two founders, George Germon, originated the recipe in the early 1980s, more or less out of desperation. After failing to get an oven hot enough to produce a crust as thin and crunchy as the ones he remembered eating in Italy, he tossed dough on a wood-burning grill and watched in awe as it stiffened to a crisp almost instantly. The pizza he and his wife, Johanne Killeen, would develop and elaborate from there was in a category of its own. The skills required to bake dough in a pizza oven, whether it runs on gas, coal or wood, don’t apply to grilled pizza at all. This makes it an unending source of fascination to pizza technologists including Violet’s chef, Matt Hyland. With his wife and business partner, Emily Hyland, Mr. Hyland paid tribute to wood-fired New Haven and New York pizza at his first place, Emily, then took on Detroit pan pizza at Emmy Squared. They have expanded both restaurants to new locations, including Citi Field, where Emmy Squared is now the “official pizza.” But Mr. Hyland has been a student of the Al Forno school of pizza for years, since going to college in Rhode Island. Violet, which he opened at the start of the year, is dedicated to the style. He has worked allusions to other features of the state’s cuisine into the menu, which makes forays into pasta and small seafood dishes, but the pizza grill is at the center of the action. Anyone who has eaten at Al Forno will recognize the lineage of Violet’s pies. Both are as thin as a saltine all the way to the edge, with parallel lines of grill marks on their undersides. Al Forno puts fontina on its margheritas, as Violet did with all its pizzas until recently, when it began experimenting with havarti. In any case, the cheeses are on the dry side and grated for fast, thin distribution. Sauces are splashed down by the spoonful, quickly, before the crust burns. That’s the template for a pie called the Atwells: a base coat of grated havarti and pecorino under big blots of a garlic-laden pesto made even greener than usual by the inclusion of broccoli and pistachios. While Al Forno tosses raw, slivered scallions on almost every pie, Violet may chop its scallions or grill them. One appealingly eccentric pie that combines a New Haven clam pizza with a Peking duck pancake is finished with fried julienned leeks. Olive oil does give Al Forno’s crust extra crackle and flavor, but Violet’s less lavishly oiled dough, made with a sourdough starter, has more flavor of its own. It’s a little salty, crunchy but not brittle, more substantial than you expect, and highly chewable. Violet gives you a heavy pair of shears to snip the pie into wedges, or any shape you like. Wielding them supplies the palpable thrill of using exactly the right tool for the job, and it’s even better than that because the job is eating pizza. A trip to Providence last weekend, though, turned up more than structural similarities between Violet and Al Forno. Three of the four pizzas on Al Forno’s menu reminded me of pies I’d eaten at Violet. One resembled the Atwells, but its pesto was made with asparagus rather than broccoli. For Violet’s Beech Vibes, a thin layer of duxelles is spread from rim to rim, then topped with tahini, caramelized onions and pickled beech mushrooms. It reminds me of a pissaladière in which the anchovies have been replaced by mushrooms. Al Forno makes a duxelles pizza, too, but tops it with unpickled white mushrooms, and doesn’t use tahini. And, of course, both places do a variation on a Neapolitan margherita, called the margarita in Providence and the Classic in the East Village. The difference between their dough recipes doesn’t quite put to rest the suspicion that Violet should be more conscientious about avoiding overlap even though Al Forno is 180 miles away. Most diners, of course, will just be happy to have a new style of pizza in town. Any of Violet’s pies, eaten before or after the iceberg-wedge salad with blue cheese and a jolt of ranch dressing, or the frisée salad tossed with fried artichokes, would make an ideal fast dinner. Beyond that, the going can get tricky. All the pastas I tried seemed like rough drafts, from the radiatore baked in a very salty vodka sauce to the spaghetti con vongole con dashi, a Japanese-Italian blind date that doesn’t have the right chemistry. The two desserts I had were even stranger. Describing one of them, a cheesecake with banana pudding on it, the server said, “I’m just going to tell you what it is and if you guys want it, you can order it.” If the warning had been any stronger it would have come with liability waivers. If you did want to build a longer meal, some of the seafood appetizers can help. Not the “stuffies,” baked stuffed littlenecks or cherrystones that could use more clam. The smoked mackerel, though, is excellent and comes with some unusually good fresh-fried potato chips. There are also shrimp that have been grilled with their heads and shells on, placed over johnnycakes and splashed with spiced piri-piri sauce. Johnnycakes, which are made of fried cornmeal mush and taste like it, are probably more strongly identified with Rhode Island than any other food. I have never been sure why, because johnnycakes can be found, if you really want to look for them, all along the Atlantic Coast. The only time I’ve seen Rhode Islanders eating them was on a Boy Scout camping trip, and boy scouts will eat anything if you leave them in the woods for a few days. In any case, the johnnycakes that Violet places under the shrimp and the piri-piri sauce are kind of wonderful. The cornmeal has a lush, right-off-the-cob flavor. I’d have them for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Is it possible that the joke has been on me all along? Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

8,Odo,3 star,"March 19, 2019",Pete Wells,Flatiron district,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/dining/odo-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/dining/odo-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Before I tell you about the seasonally attuned courses the chef Hiroki Odo prepares at his new and virtuosic kaiseki restaurant, Odo, I want to tell you about some that he does not prepare. At two points during the March menu, a person who is not Mr. Odo faces you across the thick plank of Lebanon cedar that forms the dining counter and makes something for you. The first time is about halfway through the meal, when Seong Cheol Byun shows up, shapes half a dozen pieces of sushi and lays them down, one by one, in front of you. Some of his ingredients, kept on wooden trays that he carries from place to place, are typical, like the warm short-grain rice and the dark nikiri that he will brush over certain fish. Others are less typical. The ginger he mounds on your plate is pickled together with sliced lotus root and daikon. On March 1, looking forward to spring, he added cherry leaves to the mix. Mr. Byun, a Korean-American, ferments daikon, cabbage and sesame seeds to make white kimchi, which he wraps inside nori for a tuna roll. You eat it like an ice cream cone, but faster. When Mr. Byun worked at Sushi Nakazawa, much of the seafood he used was flown in from Japan. At Odo, almost all the fish have been caught off the East Coast of North America: Long Island black sea bass, Florida mackerel and North Carolina bluefin tuna, which may be several weeks old before Mr. Byun is ready to serve it. This sushi reflects the American region where it is made, incorporates the Korean background of the chef making it and still has an unmistakably Japanese spirit. This one course, if tripled in length, could be spun off into a separate establishment that would probably be among the top two dozen sushi restaurants in the city. The second time an Odo course is prepared while you watch, it is made in a cocktail shaker and served in a cocktail glass. It is, as you may have guessed, a cocktail, though it is also the first of two desserts, sweetish and not especially boozy. Frank Cisneros, the sommelier, subordinates the alcohol to fresh fruit, in the style of the revered Tokyo bar Gen Yamamoto. Barrel-aged shochu is muddled with one or two sprightly segments of mikan orange, subjected to a calisthenic shake and strained into a delicately etched glass before a shimmer of sparkling wine is laid down on top. Orange juice in cocktails usually tastes diluted and weak; in this drink, it was radiant. I would say that the drinkable dessert course could be expanded into a separate cocktail bar, except that Odo already has one of those. Odo, which opened in December a few minutes’ walk from the Flatiron Building, is entered through a door hidden in the back of a compact den — cafe by day and bar by night — called Hall. This arrangement seems to remind people of a speakeasy, although it would take an especially clueless bootlegger to open a speakeasy inside a bar. So far, Hall has not been fully discovered, but it still gets busy enough at dinner time that you can be stranded by the front door for a few minutes before anyone on staff notices. Some diners on their way to Odo will find this an awkward start to a meal that costs $200 before tax, tip and drinks. But they may also discern that Hall, lined with carved oak panels salvaged from what appears to have been a library or church vestry from around 1900, is one of the neighborhood’s most entrancing rooms; that the corridor, which seems too narrow and definitely climbs on its way toward a too-short brass door with no handle, is perspective-altering in a way a Surrealist would enjoy; and that Odo, a shadowy and windowless space on the far side of that door is an unusually tranquil shelter from crowds, noise and anything else you might want to get away from for a couple of hours. The 14 counter seats face the kitchen and, in the middle of it, a charcoal-gray island. This is where Mr. Odo and his cooks assemble the other courses I promised to tell you about. Duck breast has been grilled over charcoal and positioned between two sauces. One is a black spill of concentrated soy spiced with sansho pepper; the other is an ivory pool of puréed apples and cream. These sauces contrast in every way you can think of, including East versus West, and they come together like opposing poles of a magnet. A springy chunk of truffle-flavored mochi is crisped on the grill and engulfed in a white-miso soup that has grated white truffles floating on the surface. You smell truffles in the air first, get them on the tip of your tongue next and finally taste them everywhere when they’re released from the mochi. A croquette tastes something like an Italian rice ball made from New England clam chowder that has young bamboo shoots in it. This golden, breaded arancino is finished with dots of grated goat cheese. Shaved lamb shoulder, baby harukei turnip and two asparagus stalks as thin as licorice whip are served, still cooking, in a hot broth, a kaiseki version of shabu shabu. Odo — incidentally, the name is pronounced as a set of initials, O.D.O. — pursues local ingredients not just for its sushi course but throughout its menu. The simmered lamb used to gambol in the Hudson Valley, the croquetted topneck clams were raked in off Long Island and so on. Kaiseki’s near-liturgical focus on timeliness almost seems to demand local ingredients, and they have been central to Niki Nakayama’s strategy at n/naka in Los Angeles, but less so for New York’s few kaiseki chefs. Chikara Sono at Kyo Ya, for instance, takes pains to import traditional ingredients from Japan the minute they’re available. Mr. Odo came to New York as the chef of Kajitsu, the extraordinary restaurant on East 39th Street that follows the vegetarian cooking tradition known as shojin ryori, born centuries ago in Zen Buddhist temples. One contribution he made in his five years there was to freshen up the menus with more food grown nearby. In the first and last tastes of his February and March menus, he anchors Odo firmly in the New York region. When you sit down, you are immediately poured a cup of cold sake. It is brewed in Brooklyn, and it is very good, swirling with fresh-fruit aromatics. Then at the end, after the fresh fruit, Mr. Odo serves ice cream made with kasu, the creamy solids left over at the end of sake distillation. The ice cream looks like vanilla and tastes, not surprisingly, like fermented rice. This particular kasu is supplied by the same brewery in Brooklyn that makes the sake. Expanding his range to meat and fish at Odo, he has kept the resourcefulness that limitations encourage. Somewhere along the way Mr. Odo also picked up technical skills in traditions far outside kaiseki. Each night, in the gohan course, Odo offers a choice of three starchy dishes. This is where I encountered a very fine seafood curry over rice; an elegant bowl of short ramen noodles in king crab broth; and fresh soba served with little pieces of pickled vegetables and wasabi blossoms, looking a bit like broccoli florets but tasting like mustard. As with the cocktail and the sushi, each of these dishes could, if Mr. Odo wanted, be leveraged into separate specialized restaurants, or food-hall stands. You could tell yourself that $200 is a large amount of money for a single meal or you could say that for the chance to visit all these different establishments without leaving your seat, it’s a pretty good deal. Either way, you’d be right. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

9,Cka Ka Qellu,2 star,"March 12, 2019",Pete Wells,Belmont,Eastern European ,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/dining/cka-ka-qellu-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/dining/cka-ka-qellu-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The best way to enter the Albanian restaurant Cka Ka Qellu, if not the most direct, starts on Arthur Avenue. Arrive before the fish shops along this famous, not-quite-faded Italian strip in the Bronx take in the iced clams and octopus for the night. Across from Dominick’s, turn into the indoor market that Fiorello La Guardia ordered up. Move on past the hand-rolled cigars and the T-shirts reflecting various tenets of Bronx philosophy. Keep going beyond the scamorza, the soppressata and the ready-to-go heroes, and walk out the door on to Hughes Avenue. Just to the right is a spinning wheel that looks old enough to have been Rumpelstiltskin’s and next to it, another door. Open it, walk inside. The short trip seems to have taken you back in time. The spinning wheel turns out to be just one piece in Cka Ka Qellu’s collection of antique tools, stringed instruments, yokes, brass coffee mills, manual typewriters, dishes of hammered metal and embroidered costumes that the owner, Ramiz Kukaj, brought over from the old country. Some, he says, go back to the 18th century. The floors and walls seem to have been airlifted from an Albanian farmhouse, and the speakers play wistful folk tunes on traditional instruments, not the modern, globally aware wake-up calls of the brass band Fanfara Tirana. The restaurant is soaked in nostalgia. The other reason for the walk from Arthur Avenue is that it recapitulates a pattern that’s repeated throughout this neighborhood, where the signs and menus facing the street are still written in Italian but many of the people in the back rooms, seasoning the sausages and frying the veal cutlets, are Albanian. Here and there, those Albanians have brought a little of their cuisine into those Italian businesses. Cumin-laden suxhuk sausages hang to dry in the salumerias. In some pizzerias, the burek challenges the Jamaican beef patty for outsider meat-pie supremacy. One such place, also owned by Mr. Kukaj, is in the Norwood neighborhood and is called Tradita. (Ligaya Mishan reviewed it in 2017.) But if you want a deep-end Albanian experience, Cka Ka Qellu, pronounced SHA ka chell-OO, is the place to go. The kitchen does not focus on the seafood of Albania’s Adriatic coast, or the more intensely Greek- and Turkish-leaning cuisine of its southern reaches. Instead, it heavily favors the north, which shares many dishes with the former components of Yugoslavia that are its neighbors. In particular there is a strong overlap with Kosovo, home to many ethnic Albanians including, at one time, Mr. Kukaj and his chef, Afrim Kaliqani. In their kitchen, yogurt and cream are everywhere, along with curds of soft fresh cheese and triangles of creamy, unsqueaky feta. A good portion of the menu could be described as things in a creamy white sauce. Another, entirely different portion could be described as creamy white sauce with things in it. Included in the second group are some of the dips that are almost obligatory at the start of your Cka Ka Qellu experience: tarator, tart yogurt with minced cucumbers, garlic and parsley, similar to tzatziki, but nearly as fluffy as whipped cream; cream stirred with bits of suxhuk to give it a pinkish tint and a suggestion of spice; and kajmak, which our server described as “like butter for bread” and I would say was like crème fraîche blended with cream cheese and butter. (In parts of Albania, it would be made by boiling unpasteurized milk from water buffalo.) I found myself dipping sausages, vegetables and just about everything else into the kajmak, but it is exceptionally good with a warm slice of the bread that Cka Ka Qellu bakes in the pizza oven that is the first thing you see when you walk in. When the menu defines kacamak as “cream with polenta,” the cream in question is kajmak, stirred into a fine-grained, nearly white mass of cornmeal that takes on the lightly fluffed quality of really well-made mashed potatoes. Sometimes there is a creamy sauce where you don’t expect one. Each slice of lecenik, a cornbread with spinach and cottage cheese that is so rich it is only a few rungs in the ladder from cheesecake, comes to the table under a spoonful of kajmak. Sometimes there is no creamy sauce where one would do some good. The restaurant’s version of fli, the slow-baked, many-layered pancake, is served as a long, narrow wedge with no accompaniment, although it is somewhat less than fully tender and moist. Luckily it responds immediately to any spare yogurt you can forage from elsewhere on the table. The mantia, baked dumplings filled with ground veal and onions, will seem tough and dry, too, if you order them alone. The same mantia cooked with yogurt in a clay dish will seem perfect. Is there another restaurant in New York that makes as much use of veal, and as little of any other meat, as Cka Ka Qellu? It is the main ingredient in the restaurant’s qofte, ground and mixed with onions and red pepper; and in its qebapa, mild skinless sausages cooked on the grill. (The sausages would be called cevapi in other corners of the Balkans, where they are likely to be made from lamb or beef.) Veal works its way into many of the clay-dish stews, including the veal tava, something like a Mediterranean ratatouille that got itself entangled with a meat-and-potato stew from another part of Europe. Rolled up with cheeses and smoked meat, breaded and fried, veal also serves as the filling for the alluring Skanderbeg. Named after a great patriotic hero of the 15th century, Skanderbeg is generally called Albania’s national dish, although its resemblance to a kayak made from chicken cordon bleu renders it something of an outlier in the cuisine. Ladled along its crunchy, golden length is — please rise and face Hughes Avenue — a creamy white sauce. Eating all of this without a salad is unimaginable and probably unadvisable. Each of Cka Ka Qellu’s several salads seems to consist of cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions and cheese in slightly different arrangements. If the vegetables were any fresher, you’d be embarrassed to eat them in public. Surprise appearances by olives and their ilk provide extra variety. Like the breads, the desserts are baked on site: syrup-soaked baklava, a nut cake called haxhimak, a sugar cookie with nuts pressed into the top whose Albanian name is sheqerpare. I like them best with coffee boiled on the stove in a long-handled brass pitcher and served on a matching tray, both of them engraved with ancient, geometric designs that repeat and repeat.

10,Madame Vo BBQ,1 star,"March 5, 2019",Pete Wells,East Village,Vietnamese,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/dining/madame-vo-bbq-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/dining/madame-vo-bbq-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The main attraction at Madame Vo BBQ, now two months into its run on Second Avenue in the East Village, is a seven-course dinner on the theme of beef. This is a familiar concept in Vietnam, where it is known as bo bay mon, as well as in San Jose, Calif., Houston and other areas with robust Vietnamese populations. In New York, where the Vietnamese restaurant scene is more anemic, bo bay mon is still a rarity. The rough outlines of the setup at Madame Vo, though, will be familiar to any New Yorker who has gone out for Korean barbecue. New York City bureaucracy is unwelcoming to the tabletop charcoal grills seen in Hanoi, so an electric grill under a metal screen is embedded in each table. Once the grill is switched on and the metal rods down at kneecap level begin to warm up, an array of sauces, condiments and vegetables will arrive. When the rods are red, a server with a pair of tongs will lay some meat down on the screen, return periodically to fiddle with it and eventually decide when it is ready to be eaten. The similarities with, say, Han Joo Chik Naeng Myun & BBQ in Queens end, of course, with the actual food. Yes, both offer lettuce for wrapping, but at Madame Vo BBQ it is part of a Vietnamese table salad, along with fresh herbs; raw cucumbers, pineapple and apple; and pickled carrots and daikon. The restaurant also sets out a nifty caddy that holds circles of rice paper and warm water, in a miniature bathtub, for wetting the paper until it is soft enough to fashion into rolls. Rather than gochujang and sesame oil, there is a classic Vietnamese nuoc cham, an intoxicatingly good version of the pineapple-and-fermented anchovy sauce known as mam nem, and lastly a tamarind sauce, which suggests Madame Vo BBQ can follow or leap over Vietnamese tradition at will. This is about what you’d expect if you’ve eaten at another restaurant, a few blocks north, simply called Madame Vo. Jimmy Ly is the chef in both places; he and his wife, Yen Vo, are the proprietors. Each was raised in the United States by immigrants from Vietnam, and like many children of immigrants they seem to be fluent not just in two languages but in two cultures, enabling them to serve dishes their families might recognize in a setting that outsiders might embrace. The wings at Madame Vo, sticky with caramel and fried garlic, are drive-straight-from-the-airport good. The restaurant produces some of the only pho in Manhattan worth talking about. One of them, in a porcelain bowl the size of a baptismal font, is filled with a potent beef broth, a short rib on the bone and enough other cuts to make a butcher smile. At least one dish at the couple’s new restaurant can stand alongside the wings and the pho at their first: the oxtail congee. Congee, or chao thit bo, is customarily the last course in bo bay mon. It frequently takes the form of a cloudy beef-and-rice soup. Mr. Ly cooks his congee with some chicken stock until it has the consistency of polenta, then spoons over it some sweet and savory braised oxtails in honey, fish sauce and brown butter. Everything about it is wonderful, even the scallion greens on top. The first of the seven beefs is typically boi tai chanh, a raw beef salad, and this is a high point, too. Lean eye of round cut into thin pink sheets is the canvas for an action-painting whirl of fried shallots, raw red onions, chopped peanuts and slivers of fresh mint. Pretty standard stuff so far, but then Mr. Ly bathes the salad in tangerine-lime vinaigrette, which has a positively buoyant effect, and splashes it with a bright-green, lemony pulp of fresh rau ram puréed in oil. In the middle of this $59 menu come the grilled meats, the courses for which the table salad and rice paper wrappers have been waiting. The finest of these might be the relatively straightforward five-spice tongue, although the betel-leaf-wrapped bundles of seasoned ground beef — bo la lot — are soothing and stimulating at once, and the New York strip with marrow butter is a clever way to acknowledge Manhattan’s own beef-eating rituals, even if it would draw blank stares on the streets of Saigon. If you, like me, are naturally skeptical when servers persistently push a big-ticket item, you might be tempted to blaze your own path through Madame Vo BBQ’s menu. But once you’ve tried the bo bay mon you have, by and large, seen the kitchen at its best. Yes, you could get the whole catfish, and if you are not into beef perhaps you should. Despite what the menu says, the catfish is not grilled, but fried and then baked. It was perfectly done the night I had it, and was filleted at the table by a server who knew his way around a fish skeleton. By that time, all that was left to do was to wrap a chunk of fish in lettuce and rice paper with a squeeze of grilled lemon and some of the sautéed shallots, lemongrass and bird chiles that the kitchen had ladled along the snaking curve of the spine. If you are thinking about a vegetable, the skewered and grilled okra pods in soy are crunchy and unslimy. The other appetizers, though, can be tricky. One night, the grilled scallop brushed with duck fat was transporting; on another, it tasted too much like the grill. Spring rolls filled with short rib and bone marrow seemed pointlessly indulgent, and so did their truffle hoisin dipping sauce in which I couldn’t taste the truffles. A few dishes might have been improved if they’d arrived while hot, like the extra-large grilled oysters under caramelized sea urchin mayonnaise or the charred sea urchin, basted in its shell with butter, sake and fish sauce. Grilled prawns brushed with a lovely orange butter were slightly more mushy than two prawns sold for $38 should be. And while the 44-ounce tomahawk steak was more than a fair deal at $90, it would have been helped by a more aggressive sear and more salt. On certain nights, the whole operation had a slack, inattentive feeling that’s rare in new restaurants. The catfish sat on the table, getting cold, while we waited for the table salad to show up. The thick stems of stir-fried morning glory would have been better cut into shorter lengths. Madame Vo BBQ may eventually run as smoothly as its older sibling. While it works out the mechanics, the surest route to happiness is to eat the bo bay mon while sipping cold coconut water through a metal straw out of a whole green coconut that you hold in one hand, like a cup of coffee.

11,Oxalis,1 star,"Feb. 26, 2019",Pete Wells,Crown Heights,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/dining/oxalis-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/dining/oxalis-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Part of the fun of eating at a pop-up is the thrill of invading a space after hours, like being locked in the museum at night with the whale and the diamonds. Another part is the sense of being in on a secret, eating at some place that doesn’t have a Yelp entry and may not even have a name, while your friends are waiting in line at Roberta’s. The mismatch between the borrowed space and the borrowers can send off sparks, too. Three years ago, when the Danish chef Bo Bech staged a one-night pop-up in the kitchen at Cosme in Manhattan, using ingredients he’d bought from farmers and shellfishers in Virginia the day before, his Mid-Atlantic-Nordic cooking stood out against the aromas of griddled masa and roasted chiles. When a pop-up settles down into a space of its own, it loses those things. In their place, it takes on the extra weight of proprietorship. The owners have to make decisions that were previously made for them, and those decisions will start to define them. It’s their paint color on the wall, their scented candles in the bathroom, their name on the door. This is the position in which we find the former pop-up Oxalis and its chef, Nico Russell, a veteran of Daniel, in New York, and Mirazur, on the French Riviera. Beginning in 2016, Mr. Russell slalomed through a series of restaurants that would hand him the keys on off nights so he could cook tasting menus of 10 courses or so. First he inhabited Fitzcarraldo, an Italian restaurant whose combination of industrial, nautical, cinematic and Mediterranean elements has made it a frequent wedding site. Later he moved on to Egg, an austerely contemporary temple to breakfast which had begun its own life, more than a decade earlier, as a pop-up. He sold tickets to his Oxalis dinners, enough of them to get a few investors interested. With enough funding to take on a lease in Crown Heights, Oxalis opened in November in a former wine bar within sight of the Brooklyn Museum. Mr. Russell’s vision for Oxalis is the one behind the bistronomie movement in France and its disciples abroad: carefully considered food served without the hoopla that drives up tabs. He slings a lot of vegetables in Oxalis’s four- to six-course set menus, and it’s one sign of his skill that this doesn’t come across as a cost-cutting measure even though it must be, at least in part — dinner is an extremely reasonable $60. Both the price and the understated cooking style reminded me of Contra, which opened with a five-course, $55 menu. The last time I went I ate a dish built around spaghetti-like strands of rutabaga under a warm snowdrift of whipped Alpine fontina. These two mild-tasting ingredients were set in motion by the force of a third, a dark and focused coffee-and-chicory cream sauce. This was a rutabaga that made me smile. Granted, I probably like rutabaga more than the average person, but I suspect that exposure to the rutabaga at Oxalis would make the average person realize that I’m right. Meals begin with a couple of bite-size snacks, one of which tends to be a crisp potato cake dusted with bay-leaf powder and topped with a chip of nori. It looks harmless enough, but can produce powerful emotions, which are easier to understand once you know that the potatoes are stewed in duck fat and then deep-fried. The other snack might be some lightly dehydrated beets brushed with marjoram-infused cream, or tiny grilled carrots that you dip in chamomile sabayon. (This is one of the dishes that suggests the long shadow of Noma, which in its early days famously matched aged carrots with chamomile.) The price seems meant to encourage frequent visits, but if you return often you may experience déjà vu. At meals in December, January and February, I was always served some variation on raw sea scallops with daikon and apple and some version of duck breast, sweet potato and yogurt. The portions in both cases were restrained but the flavors were outsize. The scallops were cured in miso and refrigerated for a few days and came out of it with something like the concentration of flavor that beef gets from dry-aging, but none of the funk. The duck’s flavor was less surprising, but there was some energy in its collision with sweet potato purée and fig-leaf yogurt tart enough to cause double-takes. Like the rest of the menu, desserts are unshowy but can be highly impressive. One worked goat milk up into a thing of beauty: Some of it was made into a simple frozen custard, the rest cooked down into cajeta. The cooking makes it clear why people chased Oxalis around Brooklyn in its various borrowed spaces, but other aspects of the restaurant suggest that it hasn’t quite figured out how to live in a space of its own. A meal there can be a somewhat solemn experience, which doesn’t seem to be what Mr. Russell and his partners are aiming for. The layout seems to work against it. The kitchen is right up front, and the bar is all the way in the back, separated from the dining room by a glass door in a glass wall. I can’t imagine what the wall is for, unless Oxalis is planning to bring back the smoking section. Instead of serving as a street-side welcome and a source of energy for the dining room, the bar feels like a waiting room. And while it takes reservations, the tasting menu isn’t served there. The bar menu is à la carte. The dining room could use a little lift. It’s as plain as a Shaker church, with clamshell-colored wainscoting below white walls unbroken by pictures or anything else. (All the art is in the restroom.) The way the servers have been coached on their lines so far underlines the decorative stiffness. They say stuff like “Moving now into more sweet things …” rather than “Here’s your dessert,” and my neighbor one night was instructed to “sit back and relax,” something that tends to go without saying in most restaurants. Things have loosened up since the liquor license came through. In the first few weeks, the servers were always trying to push a nonalcoholic beverage pairing for $20, and while the bar was mixing sodas that were more interesting than many cocktails around town, I’m not sure they were different enough from one another to justify drinking the whole slate. Now there are also wine pairings, starting at $35. Sometimes I wondered whether it would get the air circulating if the bar popped up in the dining room, or vice versa. There’s probably some simple fix, or a series of them, that would give Oxalis some of its old sense of adventure. You can sense it lying there, waiting, when you taste that cajeta, those scallops, the fantastic little potato cakes. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

12,Bistro Pierre Lapin,1 star,"Feb. 19, 2019",Pete Wells,West Village,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/dining/bistro-pierre-lapin-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/dining/bistro-pierre-lapin-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The great Midtown shrines to French cuisine were mourned one by one as they went, often at length and in print. At the same time, another style of French restaurant was dying off, but generally without benefit of a full obituary. This was the small, discreet bistro with forehead-height curtains in the windows, Piaf on the speakers, snails on the menu, chips on the china. They could be found uptown or downtown, almost always on a side street. Unlike Le Pavillon, La Côte Basque and their ilk, and unlike Keith McNally’s immersive brasserie sets, which came later, these bistros were rarely fashionable. They were filled with professors and psychotherapists, Paris Review readers and Film Society of Lincoln Center members. Occasionally a passer-by out walking the dog would stand on tiptoe to peer over the curtain, but paparazzi did not stake out the doors of these establishments. Individually, few were landmarks. Collectively, their quiet continental self-assurance, their indifference to the passage of time, not to mention their crèmes brûlées and blood sausages and Fleuries, helped form the backdrop of the city. You always thought you’d have one within walking distance. Then, one day, you didn’t. Bistro Pierre Lapin, which the chef and restaurateur Harold Moore opened last May in the West Village, is either a very late entry into the genre, or else a homage of impressive intensity. The dining room has the forehead-height curtains — green gingham. It has Piaf on the playlist, and also Pink Martini’s “Sympathique,” which has become the “Vie en Rose” of the Spotify era, for better or worse. Pierre Lapin also throws in some frills that go beyond the basic formula. White tapers burn on every table, wall sconces throw off Cognac-colored light from behind lampshades the size of teacups, a collection of thin flowery china dishes supplements the chunky white bistro ware. Most of all, Pierre Lapin has that rich, creamy, antique cooking — all the stuff nouvelle cuisine tried to kill. As soon as you order, you get a preview of what you’re in for: A length of chewy, substantial baguette arrives with a small mound of cultured butter, a pile of truffled cheese spread and a pink hunk of rustic pork pâté. On a quiet night at home, this could serve as a light dinner. At Pierre Lapin, it is a little snack to stave off hunger before the appetizers. Going back at least as far as his days at Commerce, Mr. Moore has seemed at home with profuse helpings and sauces that settled over them like a goose-down duvet over a sleeping Saint Bernard. After closing that restaurant, he opened an ode to Southern immoderation called Harold’s Meat & Three, now just Harold’s; the most memorable thing I’ve eaten there was a Kentucky hot brown sandwich on which the Mornay sauce flowed freely. He also briefly ran a less focused study of Americana called the Greenwich Grille, where I ate a chicken potpie that I thought had potential. About a week later, I learned that the place had closed. None of Mr. Moore’s previous kitchens went for the gut quite as gleefully as Pierre Lapin’s. Your first course there could well be, and almost certainly will be if you leave the choice to me, an avalanche of mushrooms in cream cascading over the edge of a tall slab of buttered and griddled pain de mie. But it would be a mistake to overlook the Brie au four, roughly half a pound of baked Brie melting among dried figs and walnuts, all served with toasted baguette. I ended up ordering the Brie for the table, which freed somebody else to get the very meaty frogs’ legs in a small lake of parsley, garlic, butter and lemon juice, while another guest tried the “balle de matzo en consommé.” In English, that means a nice bowl of chicken soup with a single matzo ball so densely packed that if you tossed it out of a second-story window it would probably put a dent in a car hood. This is not a bad trait in a matzo ball unless you happen to own the car. The lusty tune begun by the appetizers is picked up by the main courses. There is a fairly classic coq au vin, not too winy-tasting; some hefty sea scallops under toasted almonds, sensibly outfitted with endive and citrus sections; and a grouping of gnocchi, foie gras, sautéed sweetbreads and mushrooms, black truffle shavings and puffy chicken dumplings, all milling around in a Cognac-flamed cream sauce. It sounds insanely overcrowded, but is very rewarding to unpack. We have only scratched the surface of the menu. It goes on, perhaps longer than it should, because some dishes are more appealing than others. A black sea bass “bonne femme” was simply dull instead of simple. The soupy, thin cassoulet could have used more meat and a thicker crust of bread crumbs. The garlic sauce Mr. Moore made for snails tasted less garlicky than run-of-the-mill snail butter; the snails and I never figured out what we were supposed to do with the sunny-side-up egg planted in the middle of the plate. The menu could be trimmed by about a third. The same is most likely true for a few individual dishes, although Mr. Moore’s shambolic, celebratory cooking style is one of the reasons Pierre Lapin works as well as it does. If he tidied everything up he’d be going head-to-head with Le Coucou, a contest that would not play to his strengths. The excess, the untucked shirttails on the dishes, the incomplete thoughts on the menu are part of the restaurant’s charm. That charm does not quite extend to the wine list, which looks like one from four decades ago. It’s almost entirely drawn from Bordeaux, Burgundy and the Rhone, with very few bottles under $75. This seems to be taking the joke a little too far — in 1971, you could still get cheap Bordeaux. I drank well, but I always spent more on it than I meant to, which is the kind of thing that can keep diners from coming back. For dessert there is a coconut cake that has little to do with France. Dense and rich in a homespun American style that some people will love and others will find too leaden, it followed Mr. Moore here from Commerce, where it was a big hit. Other members of the lineup you already know. The chocolate mousse is deliciously dark, though not as airy as it could be. The sugar crust on the crème brûlée is burned to order. Both are overshadowed, though, by a peculiarly likable Pavlova. It is conceived as a tart, with a meringue crust and a whipped-cream topping; once it is sliced into a white wedge, bright yellow passion-fruit curd runs down its sides. Anna Pavlova would not recognize it, but she would have liked its sense of theater. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

13,Cherry Point,2 star,"Feb. 12, 2019",Pete Wells,Greenpoint,"American, English",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/dining/cherry-point-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/dining/cherry-point-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Cherry Point sits on Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint, a few steps from the corner where Bedford Avenue, having flowed all the way across Brooklyn from the shores of Sheepshead Bay, suddenly comes to an end. The area is marked by a cluster of restaurants. Some have a washed-up feeling, as if they’d all been drifting along in Bedford’s currents and had been stranded there. A few stand out in the landscape. In the fall, Cherry Point took a decisive turn into the second category when a new chef took over, but not everyone in the neighborhood seems to realize it yet. People still tumble in for happy hour, when servers whose hairstyles take a minute to adjust to will pour three-gulp martinis, manhattans and Rob Roys (due for a revival) in little Nick & Nora glasses for $8 each, and then after happy hour ends at 7 p.m. most of the crowd generally drifts out to find somewhere else for dinner. The space, with its old-timey wainscoting and its central bar, is easy to mistake for a tavern. Let’s say you were among those who stayed put. Contemporaneously with your cocktail, you worked on a few smoked olives, green and warm; swirled a few of the golden, bite-size pig’s head croquettes in a pale-pinkish ketchup made from pears; and became curious about what else this kitchen was up to. At one point you noticed that the dining room suddenly smelled like an herb garden in August, and a minute later Belon oysters on a nest of smoking rosemary branches sailed out of the kitchen opening that lights up the back of the restaurant. You ordered a plate of your own because you wanted to know how the warm oysters would taste under their yellow blankets of smoked rosemary hollandaise. From a short list of charcuterie you chose the squab and pork terrine, with a few prunes embedded into the pink and pleasingly coarse-grained slab. You spread this on toast with creamy whole-grain mustard, apricot-ginger mostarda or some of the pear ketchup, all of them made on the premises, like the pearl onions pickled in beer and the terrine itself. And you might have thought: If these are just the snacks, what is the food going to be like when this kitchen gets down to business? Whatever happens, odds are there will be meat on the table. Cherry Point opened in 2016, taking over what had been a Polish restaurant called Cinamoon. The charcuterie was made on site from the start, but the menu swerved in a more meat-focused and English-leaning direction last fall when Ed Szymanski was hired as the chef. This might have been predicted, if not from Mr. Szymanski’s English upbringing and British citizenship, then from his work history. He has cooked at the Beatrice Inn, where various beasts of air and land are posed on silver platters for their roles in a fall-of-Rome spectacle; the Spotted Pig, in the days when it was still known for burgers basted in Roquefort and toasts buried under chopped chicken livers; and Pitt Cue, a London outpost of the modern, urbanized barbecue genre. For a panoramic tour of Mr. Szymanski’s accumulated meat wisdom, you could call two days ahead and reserve a game-and-beef dinner, $65 for at least four courses along the lines of grilled tongue on watercress. The everyday menu, though, is not exactly made up of grain bowls. On any given night, you can drop in and marvel at the fried lamb ribs, their apple glaze augmented by broken coriander and fennel seeds and raw curls of shallot. The quail will be butterflied, grilled over charcoal and served on toast, with pickled prunes above it and a reduction swirled with port below. The duck breast will be seared down until the skin is a thin brown sheet next to pink and juicy meat. This is served with roasted, puréed celery root and brûléed pears. The plates are marked by a refinement and moderation that is not always achieved by other chefs in the guts-and-fat school of cookery. A creamy pheasant, leek and bacon pie is sealed inside a cast-iron pot by a beauty of a suet crust — lacquered, scored in a starburst and very tender. Care is even lavished on the grilled rib-eye for two, which comes to the table with neatly sawed lengths of bone marrow under a tidy crust of parsley, chives, pickle shallots and buttered bread crumbs. Mr. Szymanski does not gesture toward fish and vegetables very often, but when he does he generally musters some conviction. True, the roasted pumpkin mash with toasted hazelnuts and fresh cheese has an obligatory air, as does the grilled bread with labneh and honey. But the smoked whitefish salad, with caramelized shallots and crème fraîche and a side of saltines, is more energetic than you might guess. Grilled flatbread looks out of place on this menu, but it is a fine canvas for roasted hens-of-the-woods and other wild mushrooms that are fleshy and flavorful enough to get noticed on their own. Skate, a main course, comes with smoked German butterball potatoes and a soaring, fino sherry-laced beurre blanc. The salad of radicchio and other bitter lettuces is as crisp and refreshing as any plate of leaves can be in February. It is also a very good thing to eat with steak, as it happens. Anyone who has not caught on to the English theme so far will get a last chance with the dessert menu, which offers treacle tart, sticky toffee pudding, a posset and three cheeses, all from England. The treacle tart was dry when I had it. The sticky toffee pudding was surprisingly but not unpleasantly cakelike. The posset, though, is a small miracle, an eggless custard of sugar, lemon juice and cream scented with Earl Grey tea, dressed up with Cara Cara orange wedges and a few Earl Grey meringues. There should be more possets around town. There should be possets galore. And by the way, there should be more wine lists like Cherry Point’s. Assembled by Garret Smith, who owns the restaurant with Vincent Mazeau, it consistently favors obscure and surprising over familiar and dull. By the bottle, there are oddities such as apple wine and mead, but also a few things you might have heard of: a cremant d’Alsace from Dirler Cadé, a Sybille Kuntz riesling, an Olga Raffault chinon and a lean, exact pinot noir from Enderle & Moll. Only two bottles, both sparkling wines, are over $100, and most of the others are closer to $50. At these prices, you could just close your eyes and pick something, which is lucky because the servers, though charming and truly unpretentious, haven’t fully internalized the list’s ins and outs. It’s one of the ways in which Cherry Point seems not to have caught up yet with how good it has become. If you treat it like a bar, you might not notice. But if you eat the way I did, ordering half the menu at a time, you could be putting more stress on the infrastructure than it can handle. You might be in for a very slow meal. But it will also be a very good meal. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

14,Benno,3 star,"Jan. 15, 2019",Pete Wells,NoMad,"French, Italian",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/dining/benno-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/dining/benno-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Dated was the word one friend used after going to Benno, and if you’ve eaten there, too, you’ll know why. It’s as if the past 15 years in food never happened. The menu seems to be stuck in some time between 1994, when Thomas Keller bought the French Laundry, and 2004, when he opened Per Se with a young Jonathan Benno leading the kitchen. The restaurant will probably be a tough sell to those diners who expect all restaurants to fall on a continuum between Noma and the Salt Bae place. But I prefer it to any number of newer, self-consciously modern restaurants, some of which are so determined to be of the moment that they might as well have a time stamp. Benno is not trying to be contemporary. It’s trying to be delicious. And it is, from start to finish, almost without exception. Benno is the third of three dining operations that Mr. Benno opened last year in the Evelyn Hotel, on East 27th Street. It is the one where the prices, and presumably the stakes, are highest. We know it is a statement restaurant because Mr. Benno has put his name on it, for the first time in his career. Whatever the statement is, it is not forward-looking. Most of the statement is in French (barigoule, mousseline, tête de veau, béarnaise), a significant part is in Italian (carnaroli risotto, garganelli verde, pecorino ginepro) and not one word is in Danish or Mandarin. The statement has a lot to say on the topics of stocks and purées and accurate chopping and patient skimming; it is entirely silent on the subjects of fermented vegetables, or foraging, or immigration, or food deserts, or hashtags. The statement is delivered in a windowless hotel dining room to people sitting comfortably on black-leather chairs or velvet banquettes the color of a pinot noir from the Loire Valley. It takes the form of a fixed number of courses, three or four or five, your choice. One will be dessert and one a main course. None of them is a small plate meant for sharing. None is a large-format plate either, unless you count the veal sirloin chop that arrives on a silver platter in slices that are as pink and delicately shaded as the cheek on any blushing young aristocrat Fragonard ever painted. The presentations are not overly dramatic. They can be disarmingly modest, like the cold slice of fish terrine that appeared before the appetizers one night looking pale and somewhat lost. I barely noticed it. Then I tasted fennel and other bouillabaisse flavors and — excuse me, what was your name again? — I started to pay attention. It is not news that the liquid yolk of an egg tastes good trickled over baby leeks, fingerlings, black-truffle froth and pioppini mushrooms the size of shirt buttons. But just how good it is makes an interesting item. Lamb saddle, with grill marks that could come from a steakhouse, is served with fairytale eggplant and Thumbelina carrots. Each vegetable in this miniature garden is planted in a purée or a reduced essence of itself. Each is very good, and the carrots are fantastic. Alongside them sits lamb breast that has been pressed into a rich little brick coated in bread crumbs. One corner of this brick sits in a dark-green spread that tastes like gremolata. Not one combination of flavors on this plate is original, and it doesn’t matter at all. The Italian food that Mr. Benno made at his last restaurant, Lincoln Ristorante, could be impressive, but I sometimes had the sense that he was cooking from the outside in, trying to unlock the flavors of Italy through process and method. The results didn’t always match the evident effort. I still got a bit of that feeling from his food at Leonelli Taberna, in the back of the Evelyn lobby. It’s supposed to be the hotel’s casual Italian restaurant, and it would be if you didn’t sometimes catch the food trying to relax. Only a lasagna with green noodles below a dark field of browned béchamel seemed completely comfortable with itself. (On the streetside end of the hotel is a pastry shop and bakery selling two-foot-long flatbreads called focaccia that have more in common with Roman pizza al taglio.) The cooking at Benno, overseen by Justin Skribner, the chef de cuisine, doesn’t appear to be plagued by a similar anxiety. The French ideas, like a drum of pig’s trotter under a fried quail egg with flageolets and other beans, or the darkly seared duck breast with melting foie gras and a savory triangle of duck leg, dates and pistachios in brik pastry, have an easy inevitability. Pasta is unlikely to become the thing Benno is known for. Still, when the kitchen stretches to Italy, nice things happen. Lobster fra diavolo, with the bent shells called lumache, is a tribute to an American pop hit made over, in the Thomas Keller tradition, with maximum clarity and precision. Spaghetti made with grano arso, or burned-wheat flour, tasted pleasantly toasted rather than incinerated as it soaked up the liquor of tiny hard-shell clams and a soft mass of very fresh sea urchin roe. Technique never overplayed its hand in these dishes. The only time it came up short was when a drum of steelhead salmon poached in olive oil arrived slightly mushy and underdone. A week later, the fish was cooked more successfully. The scope of the Evelyn’s dining operation is big enough to support a full-time baker (Lisa Kalemkiarian, responsible for Benno’s needle-tipped mini-baguettes, among other items) and pastry chef (Lindsey Bittner, whose desserts include a rosemary flan with candied cranberries that I ordered every time I went, so I could watch other people try it for the first time). You couldn’t call the wine list dated, with its unwashed, uncombed natural types among other groomed, sedate numbers, and some fine values between $50 and $75 tiptoeing among the super-Tuscans and 2005 Bordeaux. All this should persuade some skeptics to give Benno a try. The restaurant’s greatest challenge is that the food seems to come from an era that’s too old to seem fresh but too recent to feel nostalgic about. When pop music is that age, we cringe. When buildings are that age, we knock them down before they can be landmarked. But sometimes one chef cooking what he believes is better than 10 chefs cooking what somebody else believes.

15,Bang Bar,1 star,"Jan. 8, 2019",Pete Wells,Midtown,Sandwiches,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/dining/momofuku-bang-bar-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/dining/momofuku-bang-bar-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The fancy mall in the Time Warner Center known as the Shops at Columbus Circle has a lot to answer for. Its opening, in 2003, may have marked Manhattan’s capitulation to a retail landscape ruled by chains rather than independent, homegrown businesses. For diners, the mall is best known for its eating-and-drinking zone named, with matchless pretentiousness, the Restaurant Collection. This brought us Per Se and Masa, which overnight made the city’s other high-end restaurants seem as affordable as Veselka. It was the start of a new class of restaurants where dinner would be priced like a luxury good, with entry-level meals that today cost $300 or more. Much more, in Masa’s case. The purpose of this exclusivity was to signal to people with money to spend that they would be comfortable spending it in the Shops at Columbus Circle. For the same reason, businesses that were too far down-market were not welcome as tenants. This is why there’s a Whole Foods Market but not a Family Dollar. So those of us who follow David Chang’s mind along its switchbacks and cul-de-sacs have to wonder if he was being subversive when he decided to install Bang Bar, which is essentially a shawarma stand, on the mall’s third floor. Mr. Chang is a close observer of the ways society assigns high status to the food of some cultures and devalues the cooking of others. One of his greatest hits is a riff about New Yorkers who complain about $17 bowls of ramen while paying $30 for spaghetti. If he has a routine about vertical rotisseries I’ve never heard it, but surely he is alive to the associations they conjure, from Greek diners to taco trucks to the Halal Guys carts parked near Columbus Circle. If anybody grasps the cultural implications of bringing $6 street-meat sandwiches indoors where they can perfume the air breathed by consumers of Pink shirts and Floga furs, it is Mr. Chang. Bang Bar might make more sense as a provocation than a business concern. It begins serving at 8:30 a.m. and closes when the food is gone, usually by 1 or 2 p.m. In the weeks after its opening, on Halloween, the lines were worthy of the Department of Motor Vehicles. Employees tried to appease the horde by handing out off-the-menu snacks, like rice porridge with fermented shiitakes, and asking whimsical survey questions. (“Do you keep peanut butter in the fridge?”) After Mr. Chang opened a Momofuku Noodle Bar in the space next door, Bang Bar’s crowds grew somewhat more manageable, and when I showed up for breakfast at the end of December, there was no line at all. Maybe Deutsche Bank employees will keep Bang Bar’s early shift afloat, but right now its success seems to hinge on the lunch rush. There are two rotisseries. After 11 a.m., one spit is buried deep inside a missile of dark chicken marinated with a yakitori-style glaze. The other is at the center of a red, dripping, gochujang-rubbed tower of pork. Ideally, whichever meat you choose will have built up a dark outer bark that can be lopped off with a few knife strokes and stacked on to a disc of griddled flatbread. The bread, thicker than a tortilla and less oily than a roti, will be rolled tight, like a cigarette, then bent in half, with both open ends at the top. This is called, in Bang Bar parlance, a U. The chicken or pork can also be piled over a bowl of rice, but the bread is really very good. A close relative of the flatbread Mr. Chang’s crew originated at Majordomo in Los Angeles, it is perceptibly tangy and salted, without being salty. A couple of condiments — including habanero salsa and the brick-red Ssam Sauce used, in various iterations, to italicize Noodle Bar’s pork buns and a hundred other creations in Mr. Chang’s Momofuku restaurant group — are kept out on a counter alongside the moist towelettes. But they’re hard to apply once a U has been rolled. What I did want was a spoonful or two of raw white onions, some chopped cucumber, maybe parsley or cilantro — the kind of simple salad that is almost always lobbed into a shawarma or a doner kebab. Both the chicken and pork are slightly sweet, and could use a lift. The lunch menu also has two dips — a darkly fascinating, spicy eggplant spread, or whipped chickpeas whose sharp, pecorino-like flavor betrays the presence of Hozon, the fermented chickpea paste invented in a Momofuku laboratory. They are alluring enough, but the real reason to order them is the bread, puffier and softer than the one that wraps the U. A smaller version of this, maybe five inches across, is folded in half like a taco to make a “mini,” which replaces the U at breakfast. It is no great shock that this bread works nicely with smoked salmon and scallion cream cheese blended with just enough soy sauce to make it arguably Asian. It is more flavorful than a bagel and better at holding everything together. But it is somewhat surprising how delicious a freshly griddled mini is with caper-scallion cream cheese, salted cucumber, tomato and fresh dill inside. The whole thing tastes alive in a way that a bagel with a schmear of veggie cream cheese never will. I’ve saved the breakfast mini with mortadella for last, although it’s been the subject of the most rapt online attention. Building logs of mortadella layered with lardo and roasting them on spits is exactly the sort of thing the Momofuku group was put on this earth to do. I am glad this revolving meat torpedo exists. I respect Bang Bar’s cooks — this collaborative effort has no chef, Mr. Chang said in a phone interview — for realizing that the proper garnish for caramelized mortadella shavings is a slice of yellow American cheese and hot mustard. I appreciate the respect the sandwich pays to both fried baloney and Taylor Ham. And if I were in the habit of turning up at Columbus Circle with a hangover in the mornings, I would probably become a regular consumer of mortadella minis with Ssam Sauce. With a clear head and stomach, though, the saltiness can be a little too bracing. At either meal, Bang Bar offers a cinnamon roll modeled on the kkwabaegi, the twisted Korean doughnut stick. It is baked rather than fried, making it a rare example of a Momofuku dish that contains less fat than its inspiration. It is a fine pastry to have with Bang Bar’s Vietnamese coffee, even after you learn that the cream cheese icing contains fermented chickpeas. By the way, bang, or bbang or ppang, depending on how you like your Korean words transliterated, means bread. So this shawarma joint inside a mall is officially a bread bar, which makes sense given how pleasant the bread is. Still, I can’t help wondering how the people in charge of the Restaurant Collection felt about welcoming a place called Bang Bar.

16,Hwaban,2 star,"Dec. 31, 2018",Pete Wells,Chelsea,Korean,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/dining/hwaban-korean-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/dining/hwaban-korean-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Americans who weren’t born into Korean cuisine have discovered it in many ways and many locales over the past decade or two. Bulgogi folded into tortillas has been handed out through the window of a roving truck. Smoked kimchi has been draped over pulled pork between halves of a cheese-glazed doughnut to make an outdoor food-stall sandwich called the Chonut. Hwe, raw fish eaten with condiments that typically spread across an entire table, has been streamlined to one or two bites in a tasting menu administered by servers in sci-fi tunics. The pork belly dish bo ssam has been reimagined as a whole roasted pork shoulder that a gang of hungry people could use in a bonding ritual involving heads of lettuce, a platter of oysters and a pair of tongs. More often than not, the audience for these items is young. Youth, in fact, has been a key part of the story of how kimchi and other dishes spread from immigrants’ kitchens to the Instagram feeds of diners without a single Korean ancestor. You might get a Chonut at Smorgasburg with your roommate, take down a bo ssam at Momofuku Ssam Bar with your friends from college and sit at Atomix’s U-shaped counter to celebrate your first anniversary. Hwaban, which opened in Chelsea in August, is something different. It’s the modern Korean restaurant where you’d take your mother. The dining room is spare, sleek and uncontroversial. The brick walls have a recent coat of white paint, and there is plenty of light by which to read the menus. The banquettes and benches have gentle curves and soothing neutral colors. The only vaguely menacing items in sight are the canteloupe-size eyeballs hanging on the walls, but they turn out to be high-tech speakers, and the cocktail jazz they play never rises above a murmur. Just inside the front door is a lattice of shelves holding simple, geometric bowls and teaware. These give Hwaban the look of a cloistered Parisian salon de thé, which it resembles in other ways as well. Exceptional green tea from South Korea is brewed along with tisanes — made from mulberry leaves, mistletoe stems or dried wild pears — that Korean mothers brew in winter for sneezing and sniffling children. And while some restaurants are saving money by doing without pastry chefs, Hwaban needs two of them to keep up with its obsession with Western-style sweets. One, Ahram Song, is a buttercream specialist who tints and shapes frosting into botanically detailed flower arrangements decorating chocolate or honey-pecan cakes. Another, Lauren Kim, makes the fleecy cheesecake that is carved into slivers the length of a dinner plate; pretty, well-tailored French numbers like a passion-fruit Pavlova or a drum of white cake filled with fresh strawberries and frosted with whipped cream; and the cookies and toffees that are sold by the box, for takeout. The illusion that you’ve wandered into a tearoom somewhere on the Right Bank is extended by the drinks list, which has only two Korean sojus and a handful of Japanese sakes but several pages of wines from France. The rest of the menu is unmistakably Korean, and very often it is based on Korean family cooking. “This is my mother’s recipe,” Mihyun Han, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Key Kim, will say on one of her frequent circuits around the tables. She said it one night about the shaggy white meatball of chicken, tofu and mushrooms — the menu calls it a dumpling — sitting in a warm and transfixing soy-milk broth. Another time, she was talking about what she calls “snowy bibimbap,” a gentle, agreeable wintertime variation on the classic rice dish made with strands of mung bean jelly and shaved burdock, bellflower root, and other vegetables in shades of ivory, cream and bone. The chef, Woong Jang, does very fine work in white. One of Hwaban’s most luxurious dishes is a length of king crab leg with spinach and a poached egg, all surrounded in a rich pine-nut sauce the color of hotel sheets. Like the Manhattan restaurants Atomix and Jungsik, Hwaban de-emphasizes the sweeter and spicier side of the Korean palate so other flavors can come through. Coins of poached pollock roe are sliced over a block of soft tofu in a clear, subtle dried-seafood broth. Soy-braised abalone is served in an anchovy broth that is, if not exactly subtle, at least soft-spoken. One of two pork belly dishes on the menu involves ssamjang, the potent soy-chile paste now sold in supermarkets throughout the land, but the other does not. In that one, you eat a slice of simmered pork belly together with a pickled mushroom and a square of cabbage kimchi. There is, of course, a sharp little kick to the spicy fish stew known as maeun-tang, and a fair amount of chile paste in the daktori-tang, a spin on the classic braised chicken and vegetable dish, both of which Mr. Jang makes very well. But there is also the surprise of tasting ginger and carrots along with the chiles in a bright orange sauce for seared salmon. Ms. Han and Mr. Kim also own Kosaka, a chiaroscuro lair for omakase sushi on West 13th Street. I was a little put off by how active the servers were there; just as I was focusing on the piece of fish in front of me, somebody would dart in at one elbow or the other to ask how I was enjoying it all. The service style is similar at Hwaban, but it plays better there. A meal at Hwaban is also about three times less expensive, at $55 for an appetizer and two main courses. The mains are served at the same time, which Ms. Han says is her attempt to reproduce the abundance of Korean family tables like her mother’s. Her mother also gets credit for the two-sided fritters of minced shrimp pressed against zucchini coins on the short à la carte menu. They’re served with a crisp pair of fried shrimp and little cubes of jelly that melt into dipping sauce on contact with the warm fritters. The same soy jelly accompanies a kimchi-jeon that’s topped with browned mozzarella — in other words, a kimchi pizza. It would fit right in at Smorgasburg.

17,Bluebird London,0.5 star,"Dec. 18, 2018",Pete Wells,Midtown,"American, English",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/dining/bluebird-london-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/dining/bluebird-london-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Something seems to be going wrong at Bluebird London, the busily programmed 10,500-square-foot restaurant that the mall in the Time Warner Center imported from England in September. Maybe the people in charge have been taking management cues from Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, which has approached its Brexit plan like a class of first graders trying to build a working jet airplane out of Lego pieces and a flying-squirrel sock puppet. Or maybe the mess back home has just sapped the restaurant’s spirit. Whatever the cause, what was meant to be a cheerful gift from London has turned into the Bluebird of Unhappiness. Sir Terence Conran opened the original Bluebird in 1997 inside an Art Deco garage built on King’s Road in Chelsea for the Bluebird Motor Company. It was one of his “gastrodomes,” those soaring complexes like Quaglino’s and Bibendum that embedded restaurants within a busy hive of shops, cafes and bars. The gastrodomes’ designs were talked about more often and more enthusiastically than their menus, which aimed for unthreatening familiarity. The current owners, D & D London, have managed to keep the London Bluebird in circulation by changing upholstery and chefs, but it is not at all clear why they or the Time Warner Center believed that a Bluebird clone would play in Manhattan in 2018. True, the retail shop has been dropped. But up front, next to the desk where the hosts have mastered the art of checking reservations without making eye contact, is a cafe-slash-wine bar. A glass case there serves as a temporary prison for aging pastries and tragic snacks. Beyond is a lounge followed by a bar, the centerpiece of which is an enormous plexiglass sculpture of a ponytailed woman’s head that doubles as a shelf for weird liqueurs. Just before the ramp that descends to the main dining room is a console with two turntables which, a note on the website says menacingly, are operated on weekends by “live DJs.” At other times, the restaurant stages such events as a workshop in the art of making “a seriously chic wreath.” The poster-size menus drawn up by Nicolas Houlbert, the chef, cram so much copy onto a single page, and are organized so randomly, that they are best approached as if you were doing a word search, by unfocusing the eyes and waiting until the letters organize themselves into recognizable patterns. Look, here’s butternut squash soup. This must be fluke — no, fluke crudo. Long Island. Burrata. Long Island burrata? When you have finished the puzzle, please savor the warm feeling of accomplishment for a moment, because it goes away once the food arrives. The “crispy shrimp” have the limp, expired quality of tempura that’s been doing laps all night at a conveyor-belt sushi place. Yellowfin tuna poke has been tossed onto a big, damp heap of unseasoned quinoa, which must be there to soak up any seasoning that accidentally attaches itself to the fish. At lunch there is a lobster Cobb salad with lettuce and round, red objects that are probably supposed to be tomatoes. Because you are in an English restaurant, you will be curious about the English food. Because you are in Bluebird London, you will regret this. A prawn and monkfish curry is presented on a thali with mango chutney, basmati rice and paratha, which run the gamut from unnecessarily sweet to ridiculously sweet. The fish half of fish and chips is golden and crisp on the ends but pale and soggy in the middle. At least the minted peas that come with it are crunchy. This is more than can be said for the potato chips that come with an order of beef tartare. They are pale, cobweb-colored, not fresh, and undercooked so they sag and fall apart beneath any amount of beef. The tartare, by the way, is seasoned with ketchup, which is not as wrong as you might think. If something comes with a pastry crust, exercise caution. On top of an allegedly Cornish chicken pie, sealing in dry chicken and mushrooms coated in grease that is trying its best to be mistaken for sauce, is a dome of puff pastry; it doesn’t taste like butter or salt, but it is cooked. The thicker crust around a farmhouse pork terrine, served with a chill that brought out its Spammy qualities, is on its way to being cooked. The very, very thick football of crust encasing beef Wellington is cooked only on the surface; deep inside, where it meets the tenderloin, is a mass of wet, gluey dough. This costs $95 and will serve two people, both of whom had better like the taste of raw flour. All is not doom and gloom in the pastry department, though. The pull-apart cheese straws are thick, puffy and warm, bronzed on top with baked Montgomery’s Cheddar. Most of the sweets are likable, particularly the cube of sticky toffee pudding and the wedge of Bakewell tart with a layer of orange marmalade between the frangipane and the pastry shell. The only real hazard on the dessert menu is the barely congealed Pimm’s jelly at which somebody has hurled fistfuls of chopped cucumbers and strawberries. It’s like a stray plate of salad that you might pick up at a party before you realized that somebody had dumped the warm dregs of a drink into it. The servers seemed eager to oblige, but gave the impression of struggling in the face of unseen enemies. One night, asked “Still or sparkling?,” I chose the sparkling water. My server began to walk away, then turned on his heel and said, “I’m sorry, we’re all out of sparkling.” “That’s fine,” I said. “I’ll just have the BrewDog I.P.A. instead.” “I apologize,” he said. “We don’t have any draft beer.” After the main course was cleared, I asked him for the Chocolate Bluebird. “That is our signature dessert,” he said. I nodded. I had read that this was a chocolate mousse inside a blue-chocolate shell in the shape of a vintage racecar once made by the Bluebird Motor Company. “Unfortunately, we do not have it tonight,” he said. His courtesy went a long way. Ultimately, though, I preferred the blunt approach that one of the bartenders took with one of my guests. Looking over the long list of old and new cocktails, she asked the bartender which he would recommend. “If you want to drink something that tastes good,” he said, “I wouldn’t order anything off our menu.” Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

18,The Four Seasons Restaurant,1 star,"Dec. 4, 2018",Pete Wells,Midtown,Seafood,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/dining/four-seasons-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/dining/four-seasons-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"There is a good case to be made for not reviewing the newly relocated Four Seasons Restaurant at all but just leaving it on the slush pile, and that case can be found in court records involving Julian Niccolini. Mr. Niccolini has operated the restaurant with Alex von Bidder since the mid-1990s, first at its original home in the Seagram Building and now, after a two-year hiatus, in a smaller berth on the other side of Park Avenue. Over that time, he has frequently been celebrated for his charm. Less frequently, he has been a defendant in civil and criminal actions arising from things he was accused of having done to women inside the restaurant. In 1991, one of his waitresses sued Mr. Niccolini and the Four Seasons, citing sexual harassment. She claimed that for more than three years he had repeatedly rubbed up against her, told her in vulgar terms about his sexual urges and called her “slut,” “lesbian” and other things. Mr. Niccolini denied the charges. In 2014, a former assistant manager filed suit against Mr. Niccolini, Mr. von Bidder and the Four Seasons, alleging discrimination. The ex-manager said that after she returned from a maternity leave, the restaurant made it difficult for her to pump breast milk during work hours and, about three months later, fired her and replaced her with a man. In a response filed with the court, the defendants denied the allegations. Both suits were settled under terms that have not been divulged. In 2015, Mr. Niccolini was arrested on a felony charge of sexual abuse. According to a prosecutor, he had attacked a woman at the Four Seasons bar “with such force that he ripped her bra open and caused significant scratch marks on her back and bruising on her hip.” After pleading guilty the following year to a reduced charge of misdemeanor assault, Mr. Niccolini was given a “conditional discharge,” avoiding jail. I know people who will never eat at the Four Seasons because they don’t want to give Mr. Niccolini their money. I understand this. I also know people in the food media who think the Four Seasons should not get any coverage as long as Mr. Niccolini owns a piece of it. I understand this, too, but it’s not my view. [Julian Niccolini has since been forced to resign from the restaurant.] Their stance rests, I think, on the idea that writing about powerful men who have been accused of abusing women amounts to condoning the abuse and helping the abusers stay in power. While it’s true that media attention is often like oxygen to restaurants, critics have the power to tell a story other than the one the restaurant is pushing. Even when we’re not writing a pan, a fair assessment often requires weaving shining threads with ugly ones. The ugliest threads at the Four Seasons happen to be ugly enough to make many people stay away. But there is beauty in the fabric, too. The Four Seasons has been a significant force in dining: a pioneer in championing American ingredients and wine; an innovator in bringing contemporary design into the restaurant world; a cultivator of an eclectic scene that treated political power, financial success and creative talent as coequal branches of a high society that was peculiar to New York. Most of this happened some time ago. In its last years in the Seagram Building, the Four Seasons had become a shabby but lovely museum of midcentury architecture and design, with martinis that I didn’t mind overpaying for and food that I did. I was curious about its new incarnation, which opened in August, and curiosity is as good a reason as any for a critic to swing into action. If I were writing the next chapter in a long history, I’d mention how gracefully Diego Garcia has grown into his new job as the restaurant’s chef. I enjoyed Mr. Garcia’s fish cookery at his last restaurant, a small, bare-bones place in Hell’s Kitchen called Gloria, but he seemed limited by the kitchen’s size. He works on a grander scale now, with more expensive ingredients and more delicate treatments that still betray his creative streak. He roasts duck because the Four Seasons is famous for it, and makes fresh pasta and risotto because the captains in their black jackets need some place to shave all those white truffles. For all intents and purposes, though, he has turned the Four Seasons into a seafood restaurant, and a very good one. It’s not hard to believe he was once a sous-chef at Le Bernardin when you taste, say, the raw scallop slivers in citrus juices, elegantly equipped with tart apple and caviar, or the intensely smooth chowder of tiny, just-cooked clams in a New England-style cream broth that’s pale yellow with butterfat. He knows when to show restraint and when to go all in, taking sea-urchin ravioli that are already head-spinningly rich and draping lobes of sea urchin over them. Some of the cooking is boring in the right way. I don’t want surprises in Dover sole à la meunière, and I didn’t get any. It was flawless. The duck will surprise only people who don’t know that duck meat cooked to well-done bastes in its own fat until it is almost a warm confit. Other dishes were boring in the usual sense. The mustard sauce poured around the golden crab cake tasted like cream that was shown a picture of a mustard jar. The chapter would also depict the return of Bill Yosses. Anybody who ate his desserts before he disappeared into the White House won’t be surprised by how good they are here. They do have a slight Rip Van Winkle quality, suggesting that Mr. Yosses allowed several new waves in pastry to pass him by, but that’s no criticism. He makes a better baba au rhum than almost anyone in town, his chocolate tart with a salted stripe of caramel is both powerful and precise, and his hazelnut financier balanced over roasted pears is more delicious than almost any almond financier you can find. He has even improved the restaurant’s signature, the Kate Pierson beehive of cotton candy that sails out to the tables of valued guests. (Apparently I’ve joined that club.) This being the Four Seasons, the history would have to mention the new restaurant’s interior. It reminded me of the old Philip Johnson dining rooms without making me sad to be here instead of there, a trick I had thought was impossible. The bronze bead curtains have transformed into strings of gilded glass baubles; the flatware and glasses pay homage to the vintage designs used at the original restaurant; and the bar is once again a four-sided island in the middle of a lounge. For the first time you can eat a real meal there, while you watch the Grand Central-bound commuters outside and the cotton candy-bound regulars inside, generally a mature group in tightly knotted ties or heels that echo down the corridor to the dining room like the ticking of a grandfather clock. All of this and a generous budget (the prices are as exclusionary as ever) could make for a few hours of celebratory sightseeing of a kind that is quickly disappearing from the city. The Four Seasons offers an escape from the outside world. Escaping from what’s inside, however, takes a mental effort that is beyond me and will probably be beyond many others as well, whether Mr. Niccolini is in sight or not. During my three meals, I never saw him. Restaurants, even grand ones like the Four Seasons, are intimate places; eating is an act that requires trust and a sense of safety. We want to get up from the table feeling restored on all fronts except the financial one. Mr. Niccolini’s actions have done serious damage to his power to provide that feeling, even as he and Mr. von Bidder have made the restaurant better than it has been in years.

19,Saint Julivert Fisherie,1 star,"Nov. 27, 2018",Pete Wells,Cobble Hill,Seafood,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/dining/saint-julivert-fisherie-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/dining/saint-julivert-fisherie-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Alex Raij and Eder Montero met while working in the kitchen of a sprawling, impersonal, gloomy modern-Spanish restaurant that lasted about two years. They went on to get married and, as joint chefs and owners, opened a string of compact, intimate, slinky modern-Spanish restaurants that are still in business. Their one misfire was a small, intimate non-Spanish coffee shop in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. After dusting themselves off, they replaced the cafe tables with taller and longer ones, traded the pastry cases for a bar, installed a stripe of backlighted glass blocks that cast a subaqueous glow on the room, and in September reopened as Saint Julivert Fisherie. And what is a fisherie, you ask, having quickly consulted your French, Spanish and English dictionaries and found no such word? Saint Julivert is my first, but if it is anything to go by, then a fisherie is a seafood establishment that aspires to be more than a raw bar but does not want to be mistaken for a full-bore restaurant. Wines come mostly from coastal regions (and are organized by the nearest body of salt water). Small plates abound. And if you guessed that they are something like the tapas that Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero explore at El Quinto Pino, Txikito and La Vara, but without the running Spanish theme, you are not far off. Not that the menu is entirely un-Spanish. The octopus carpaccio from Txikito makes a special guest appearance at Saint Julivert Fisherie, the way the Fresh Prince once turned up on an episode of “Blossom.” Under marjoram leaves and pinprick grains of Espelette pepper, the carpaccio is as good as you remember; the warm plate halfway melts the fattier bits of octopus into delicious goo. There is another cameo: El Quinto Pino’s very fine combination of pink-fleshed anchovies with cold vanilla butter. The butter soothes the anchovies the way the vermouth in a martini helps the gin settle down. (On a related topic, the short cocktail list includes a deceptively soft-spoken number called the Kanpai Martini. It’s a variation on the Vesper, which itself is the amended martini that Ian Fleming had James Bond order in “Casino Royale.”) At times Saint Julivert reminds me of Cal Pep, in Barcelona, Spain, whose plain, cramped counter looks like the last place in the world where you are going to have an epiphany of the taste buds, right up until the moment the txipirones and thumbtack-size clams knock you off your barstool. Like Cal Pep, and unlike nearly every other New York restaurant, Saint Julivert serves gooseneck barnacles when they’re available, boiling them with bay leaves and salt and mounding them on a cloth napkin before they cool so that when you twist the wrinkled sheath of skin away from the sweet, edible meat inside there is a good chance somebody in the vicinity will get hit with a squirt of hot barnacle juice. Mostly, though, any Spanish-ness in Saint Julivert has more to do with its spirit than its recipes, which come from all over: the deep-fried Puerto Rican cylinders of cornmeal known as sorrullitos; a kanpachi collar whose juicy meat is shockingly white under a black rub of jerk spices; tender slices of warm beef tenderloin on a fist-size roll, known in Portugal as a prego sandwich. There is also the crispy tuna bake, a peculiarly satisfying hybrid that crosses a tuna noodle casserole by way of India with fideuà, the Spanish dish that treats pasta like the rice in paella. The noodles, short ridged tubes, are toasted and cooked with oil-cured tuna in a tomato sauce that is seasoned with turmeric and curry leaves. It is one of the most fearless, not to mention filling, dishes on a menu that could use a little more of both qualities. Although Saint Julivert works with exceptional seafood, and treats it with the care that fans of Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero have come to expect, the menu plays it safe more often than it should. Like all of the couple’s restaurants, Saint Julivert toggles between innovation and tradition. But the other places explore Spanish cuisine, so when they toss off a straight-ahead classic like patatas bravas, there’s a reason. When Saint Julivert serves fluke ceviche or a crab and avocado salad dressed with yuzu juice and trout roe, it can seem to be grasping at ideas that other restaurants are already doing — even when Saint Julivert does them better. The sautéed skate splashed with Manzanilla could not be fresher or more skillfully browned, but do the garlic chips and sliced dried chiles on top make this version of a well-known standard one I’ll remember a month from now? Maybe not, although at the time I was very happy to have it, not least because it was one of the few things on the menu the size of a standard main course. Even if you’re an old hand at navigating the shallow waters of small plates, it can be unnervingly easy to spend more than $100 on food and drinks at Saint Julivert and still wonder whether you’ve actually had dinner. Seafood this good is expensive, but the menu doesn’t stray very far above $20; the result is that portions can seem somewhat airy. When there’s an inexpensive opportunity to pad out a dish, Saint Julivert doesn’t always take it. I understand why I can’t have more than three excellent wild shrimp in a $21 bowl of red pozole, but couldn’t there be more than a spoonful of hominy kernels? Saltines fried in canola oil are served with the ceviche and with a cold and highly appealing bowl of pickled shrimp under pink pickled onions; grilled bread slices accompany the mackerel whipped into a hummus-like orange spread with piri-piri oil. Still, each time I went, somebody at my table asked for more bread. None of Saint Julivert’s issues are insoluble. The lighting could be warmed up so the room looks less like an aquarium. A few more dishes you won’t see anywhere else, like the tuna bake, would make it harder to resist. Another two or three large plates would make it a place you think of when you’re hungry. The excellent $19 prego sandwich is more snack than dinner, until you pay another $7 to have fried oysters tucked into the roll beside the beef, making it into a kind of crunchy carpetbagger. On the other hand, that’s worth doing even if you’re not hungry. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

20,Adda Indian Canteen,2 star,"Nov. 20, 2018",Pete Wells,Long Island City,Indian,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/dining/adda-indian-canteen-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/dining/adda-indian-canteen-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Something has been missing from New York’s current Indian restaurant scene, but I wasn’t sure what it was until I ate the kaleji masala at Adda Indian Canteen in Long Island City, Queens. Modernization is the theme unifying many of the Indian restaurants that have taken root around the city over the past few years. At the rarefied end of the spectrum, we have Indian Accent bringing the cuisine into line with the intricate techniques and plating that can land restaurants on the itineraries of list-clutching gastrotourists. At the populist end, we’ve seen Indian cooking gastro-pubbed by Babu Ji and other new places that try to make non-desis feel at home with house-party vibes, beer in a self-service fridge, and dishes like naan pizzas and samosa burgers. New York hasn’t seen nearly as many recently opened restaurants devoted to the pure, original stuff that is getting modernized. The snacks pitched together in a blur by hawkers at folding tables and rolling carts by the side of the road; the gravy-soaked stews and sauceless dry curries patiently made from 25 or so vegetables and seasonings, all of them chopped, ground, fried and simmered at home by those keepers of the culinary flame known collectively as the aunties — we’ve seen interpretations of this food, squeezed from eyedroppers and prepared for their photo shoots with edible flowers. But new places cooking the genuine article have been scarce. There is a problem of missing context here; twists on tradition don’t really resonate when tradition is hard to find in its untwisted form. And for anyone who truly loves Indian cooking, there is a more pressing problem of missing flavor. Five dots of tandoori-spice oil just won’t land on the taste buds with the impact of a full plate of charred and steaming tandoori chicken, no matter how evenly spaced those dots are. I hadn’t given much thought to either problem, to tell the truth, until I made it to the out-of-the-way patch of Long Island City where Adda Indian Canteen operates. This is not the part of that neighborhood where high-rise apartments grow overnight and Amazon will soon tiptoe in with 25,000 employees. Adda is east of all that, under a National Guard recruiting office, surrounded by a thicket of railroad tracks and highway overpasses. Unless you are looking for it, you are not likely to end up in the small dining room, in which Indian tabloids have been upcycled as wallpaper. Once I’d found it, one of the first things I ate was the kaleji masala, chicken livers in a dark gravy seasoned with fresh ginger and garam masala. Right away I realized that this was the kind of Indian food the city has been hungry for, or at least the kind that I’d been hungry for: made with care but no pretense; seasoned for people who love the interplay of spices; presented without apology in all its brown, lumpy glory; and complex in ways that demand full attention. Adda (ah DAH) Indian Canteen was opened in September by Roni Mazumdar, who owns it, and Chintan Pandya, who is the chef. The two men already run Rahi, in Greenwich Village, perhaps the best of the casual, modernizing Indian restaurants, where Mr. Pandya serves original notions like tandoori skate and sends almost everything out of the kitchen decorated with edible flowers. They’ve taken another angle at Adda, mining family recipes and the lessons Mr. Pandya absorbed from civilian cooks around India. The menu travels beyond the standard north Indian dishes most New Yorkers already know, but even those dishes, when they appear, are prepared so emphatically that they don’t resemble anything else in town. Adda is a lusty, full-throated defense of traditional cooking. Saag paneer, the grayest of old gray mares in many Indian restaurants, is coltishly energetic at Adda. The cheese is made in the kitchen, and it’s gorgeously soft, while the saag is a tart and peppery mix of wilted arugula, sorrel, spinach and mustard greens. Mr. Pandya does very well by the class of sidewalk treats called chaat. Each delivers the messy riot you’d hope for, busy with crunchy hieroglyphs of fried noodles and splattered with yogurt and tamarind sauce. One chaat is anchored by a big kale fritter, another by several smaller chips of battered, spiced lentil cakes, and a third by fried smashed potatoes and chickpeas. But discerning chaat lovers should probably go directly to the dahi batata puri, soft potato packed into hollow globes of fried dough that you can pick up and eat with your fingers, like chocolates. Anything that passes through Adda’s tandoor is worth investigating. Seekh kebabs, made with lamb that’s coarsely ground by hand, come out of the tandoor juicier and pinker than the usual; Mumbai-style tandoori macchi, a skewered pompano rubbed with ground mustard seeds and cilantro, is lightly charred and smoky after roasting, but still moist; bhatti da murgh, a double-marinated chicken thigh and drumstick, is so thickly crusted with coriander and cumin that it crunches when you bite it. My server expressed an enthusiasm about the poussin — plunged into the tandoor in one piece after marinating in vinegar, yogurt, fresh red chiles and kala namak, the sulfurous black salt of India — that you typically find in new converts to a cult. After tasting it, I was ready to join. He was enthusiastic about almost everything, as it turned out; the service at Adda is nothing if not eager to talk up the food. (Getting your water glass refilled is another story.) Placing a dish of yogurt and pomegranate seeds next to the goat biryani that is steamed under a lid of dough, he said, “This is going to be your best friend when the spice in the biryani starts to hit you.” It was, in fact, one of the fiercest biryanis I’ve ever met, and the yogurt tamed it so that I could taste the tender goat meat and crisp, bittersweet fried onions. Few things on the menu are quite as chile-drenched as the biryani, but Mr. Pandya definitely favors India’s more intense flavors. Adda is not big on soft-spoken cream sauces; the coconut milk in the Malvani prawn curry from the South Konkan coast, for instance, has a pronounced kick. (It’s very good if you get it on a night when the prawns are firm and not spongy.) And while Adda does serve some vegetables, it would not make my list of the 20 best local Indian restaurants for vegetarians. It would, however, be the place I’d send you if you want to know how good Delhi butter chicken can be. Or if you don’t yet believe that rara gosht, chunks of lamb stewed on the bone with spiced minced lamb, is not redundant but luxurious. And Adda is the first restaurant I’d tell you about if you woke up one morning hungry for bheja fry, goat brains cooked with onions, ginger and a considerable number of fresh green chiles. “Like soft scrambled eggs,” our server said, accurately. I might point out that a typical Indian bheja fry is drier, with a higher ratio of brains to sauce. But I would not necessarily mean that as a complaint.

21,Misi,3 star,"Nov. 13, 2018",Pete Wells,Williamsburg,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/dining/misi-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/dining/misi-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Almost everybody is calling Misi, the latest endeavor from the chef Missy Robbins, a pasta restaurant. That’s not quite right. Yes, Ms. Robbins has given half of her menu over to long noodles and short ones; strands of linguine with chopped garlic and a double dose of fish in the form of chopped anchovies and drizzled colatura; circles filled with ricotta whipped until it is as soft as cream; pinched rings of tortelli stuffed with mascarpone and spinach; the deeply ridged Sardinian shells known as malloreddus; and other Italian marvels of starch formation. True, anybody who has been to Ms. Robbins’s other restaurant, Lilia, also located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, knows that the pasta there reliably steals the show from everything else on the table. When those people show up at Misi, odds are good that they will not have chosen that day to start a keto diet. Moreover, Misi has a greater variety of pasta than Lilia, so many that the architecture makes space for them. Misi is across the street from the old Domino refinery on the East River, where the cranes used to unload sugar from barges in the open air so that on days when the wind was right you could taste it on your tongue a mile away. Next to the dining room, facing the factory’s remains, is a separate, glassed-in workshop where the temperature and humidity are kept at consistent dough-friendly levels. There, the long noodles, etc., are rolled out and cut long before 5:30 each night, when Misi’s front door is unlocked and the crowd waiting in line for walk-in seats begins to snake eagerly forward. And to be sure, if you watch Ms. Robbins and her kitchen crew at the end of one of two long dining counters, you’ll see the same quick motion over and over: an almost surreptitiously quick trip of hand to mouth, a sharp bite and an appraising chew to decide if that batch of pasta is ready to be pulled from the water. Some chefs show their mastery over pasta by pressing it thinner than a screen protector for an iPhone. Ms. Robbins likes hers to have body and heft, and the chew test is the most reliable way to tell when thick pasta like that is ready. You are very unlikely to get a piece that is undercooked at its core, or one that doesn’t fight back enough to let you know it is still alive. You get this just-in-between texture in the stubs of mezze rigatoni with a simple, glossy, ripe tomato sauce that’s been stewed with whole garlic cloves — 30 to a batch, according to the menu. You get it again in the corzetti, discs about the diameter of a Red Bull can that are pressed with a wooden stamp to give them a target pattern. In October, Misi served these ridged coins with another tomato sauce, this one barely cooked, just some Sungold tomatoes warmed until they broke open and their yellow pulp spilled out. Fresh basil, thyme and chervil were scattered over the top, as good an illustration as any of how Ms. Robbins makes her food stand out without deviating from an Italian reliance on simple, unmanipulated ingredients. But to call Misi a pasta restaurant would be to overlook its highly impressive work with vegetables. They are the subject of the menu’s other half, sneakily headlined “antipasti.” This is where you will find a globe eggplant roasted until it is as soft and easy to spread as cream cheese; the cut surfaces are dressed with Calabrian chiles, and the taste of lemon juice seems to have found its way to the center of the eggplant. There are fleshy and firm chanterelles, too, lightly pickled and preserved in olive oil until they’re brought to the table crisscrossed with rosemary needles. Grilled runner beans with garlic and chiles have been around lately, too, in a big heap that I would have enjoyed more if a few stringy, leathery beans had not gotten past the inspectors in the kitchen. Like the pastas, Misi’s vegetables tend to bring together only a few ingredients, often applied in ways you don’t quite expect. I don’t know where else you will taste pistachios and anchovies combined with skinny, leaf-bud-green leeks marinated in vinegar, or a kind of panzanella made with grilled bread, capers, fresh oregano and chunks of zucchini that are still tender after a quick poaching in olive oil. And though the gently roasted tomatoes won’t come back to the menu until next summer, you can try imagining how their dusting of fennel seeds and cracked coriander seeds responds to a last-minute squirt of spicy honey. There are enough of these vegetables, and enough meatless pastas, that a vegetarian could eat extremely well at Misi just by watching out for things like bottarga and staying away entirely from the creamy pork sugo tossed with strangozzi. (Meat eaters, on the other hand, may find the sugo helps restore chafed nerves.) Although Misi doesn’t let its kitchen range as widely as Lilia’s, it is a more successful restaurant in several ways. The menu has been distilled down to essentials, and the whole enterprise seems more carefully thought through. The restaurant is on the ground floor of a new apartment building by SHoP Architects, who chose to leave a hole in the middle that you could fly a helicopter through. The developer, Two Trees, recruited Ms. Robbins and her business partner, Sean Feeney, and gave them a chance to build the virgin space to their needs. The acoustics are better than at Lilia, and traffic between tables flows more smoothly. The interior is unusually good, with narrow horizontal wall tiles in white and nooks for stacked plates that make them part of the décor. As at Lilia, the wine list practically begs you to take something new for a whirl: a catarratto from Sicily, a Corsican niellucciu, or a croatina-ughetta blend from Lombardy softened with some uva rara. Of course, you could stick to a $45 Lambrusco, or get a $250 Champagne from David Léclapart, after which you can try flying through the hole in the building yourself. If we are striving for total accuracy, though, we need to call Misi a pasta-vegetables-and-gelato restaurant. Its gelato is made in house; there are about six kinds at any given moment. The flavors open up right away, in part because Misi serves them just below the melting point and in part because the ingredients are used prodigally. There are a lot of almonds in the almond, and the espresso could keep you up an extra hour. But even the unflavored fior di latte, made with milk, cream and sugar, comes at you in a rush. There are no desserts other than gelato. The only decision to make at the end of the night is which one you’re going to have.","Marinated leeks; roasted eggplant; chanterelles sott’olio; olive oil-poached zucchini; mezze rigatoni with pomodoro; ricotta-filled occhi; strangozzi with pork sugo; linguine with anchovy, garlic and parsley; all gelati.

22,Mama’s Too,1 star,"Nov. 6, 2018",Pete Wells,Upper West Side,Pizza,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/dining/mamas-too-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/dining/mamas-too-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"For most of its time on earth, the New York slice has not been seen as a product that needed tinkering. Yes, pizza in the city has been accessorized with toppings from crayfish (not bad) to Buffalo chicken (hmm) to Caesar salad (no, no, no, no, no). But the foldable, portable triangles of cheese, sauce and dough themselves were generally held to be a natural resource that was perfect as is, much like the soft, unfiltered city tap water claimed to be the source of their excellence. Some pizzerias try to make a better slice. Very few try to make a different slice. Mama’s Too makes a different slice. It combines some of the most appealing elements of a Neapolitan pie with the most satisfying aspects of the archetypal product sold on paper plates from sidewalk windows. It is as if Frank Tuttolomondo, the owner and pie architect of this informal but very serious pizzeria on the Upper West Side, has learned how to genetically modify pizza. The bulge of crust at the edge of what Mama’s Too calls the “house slice” is brown, more rough than smooth and baked to a ferocious crackle. You could tear it off and enjoy it on its own, or maybe with butter or olive oil, just as you can with the best Neapolitans. Yet the flat layer of crust on the bottom is firm, without the soupy center of the Neapolitan style. True to New York form, you can hold it in the air by the curved rim and it will stay flat and parallel to the floor. As they do at Totonno’s and some other brick-oven pizzerias, Mr. Tuttolomondo lays the cheese down before the sauce. Rather than drippy, milky discs of fresh mozzarella, though, he covers the raw dough (after priming it with olive oil) in shreds of a slice-friendly variety that is known in the trade as low-moisture mozzarella and that the rest of us call pizza cheese. Over this, he ladles a few blots of tomato pulp. This helps the crust to bake through without getting soggy, keeps the cheese from sliding off the crust, and most of all lets you taste the tomatoes, which are very good. You could, I suppose, think of the house slice as a white pizza with tomato-sauce topping. After the pie comes out of the oven, Mr. Tuttolomondo sprinkles it with grated two-year-old Parmigiano-Reggiano. Basil leaves are the last to go on. At this point, you can pay, walk out the door and amble toward Broadway and 106th Street cradling your slice in a paper plate and taking bites as you go. In other words, you can have the traditional sidewalk pizza experience, but you will be tasting flavors you normally find only in high-minded sit-down pizzerias like Sorbillo, Ops or Una Pizza Napoletana. Those bloodhounds who follow the city’s melted-mozzarella trail will recognize that Mama’s Too is part of a great reawakening of slice culture. Unlike brick-oven pizza, which came from Europe and relied on preindustrial technology, the New York slice is a lowly American hybrid. It is baked in gas ovens, and the sheer number of places selling it suggests that it requires no special skill. When it is praised, we don’t talk about its artisanal roots; we call it the humble slice, the street-corner slice, the slice of the common man and woman. The ordinary slice and its heftier cousin, the Sicilian-style square, were probably first rehabilitated with superior ingredients and a sophisticated understanding of baking by Best Pizza in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 2010. Today, serious pizza hobbyists talk about their favorite slices by reeling off the dough’s rising time and hydration levels. North Brooklyn is still the center of the neoclassical slice movement, with L’Industrie and Williamsburg Pizza and, most recently, Paulie Gee’s Slice Shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, but the forward-thinking slice is found in Manhattan, too, at Scarr’s on the Lower East Side and Corner Slice in the Gotham West Market. The goal of the neoclassicists is, essentially, to return to the golden age of New York takeout pizza, which survives at places like Di Fara in Midwood, Brooklyn, one of the holy sites of the neoclassical church. Paulie Gee’s Slice Shop, Scarr’s and other neoclassicist joints cultivate a self-consciously vintage atmosphere, styling their logos and signs and interiors so they look like a place where Johnny Boy and Charlie in “Mean Streets” might have gone for a pepperoni slice and a Coke. Mr. Tuttolomondo does not fetishize the past. Perhaps this is because he lived it. For almost 60 years his family has owned a series of old-school slice joints in the neighborhood. The current incarnation is literally on a street corner, at the intersection of 106th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. It is called Mama’s Pizza. He didn’t open Mama’s Too a block away to outdo his parents; he’s bringing their product into a new era. If the neoclassicists are like the folk revivalists who collected old acoustic 78s, he is Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. When Mama’s Too opened in December, it also served housemade pasta. It’s still on the menu board that hangs on one wall, but Mr. Tuttolomondo has stopped serving it to concentrate on pizza. Besides the house slice, he also makes squares that he sees as a marriage of rectangular Sicilian pizza with Roman pizza al taglio. The crust is much taller than the Roman style, and taller than some Sicilians, too, but it is airy and chewy. On the bottom it has the bronze color, the cratered surface and the pan-fried crunch of the bread on a grilled cheese sandwich. The edges, where the dough meets the pan, have a gold fringe of browned cheese, known among students of pizza styles as a “frico crust.” This fringe is, of course, crunchy and delicious. The most impressive square is, I think, the pepperoni. Unlike most of the others, it incorporates tomato sauce. The mozzarella is baked until it begins to brown. The pepperoni slices are small and concave, like contact lenses made of meat. Crunchy around the rims, these little cups are half-filled with spicy red oil. It may sound as if I approached this slice with cool, analytical detachment. The truth is I ripped into it like a pack of hyenas. The other squares tend to be white pies with toppings. Again, tomato sauce is one of the toppings. In one case it’s a thick and creamy layer of vodka sauce, one of the ideas that separates Mama’s Too from the neoclassicists. Mr. Tuttolomondo also makes a cacio e pepe Sicilian pie, essentially a four-cheese pizza in which one of the cheeses is pecorino; the whole slice hums with black pepper. The square topped with Gorgonzola dolce and pears works in a way that combination often doesn’t, although half a slice was enough for me. The shop is small, and if you sit at one of the handful of red counter stools you will share the small tiled floor up front with neighbors waiting for takeout and delivery guys. There are no vintage soda refrigerators or letterboard signs, but there is a small photograph of Robert De Niro eating pizza and a much bigger one of John Travolta in “Saturday Night Fever,” biting into his double-decker slice. The picture is in black and white except for the pizza. Tinted orange and red, it glows like a beacon.","House slice; pepperoni square; cacio e pepe square; pear-Gorgonzola square; mozzarella crescents.

23,Henry at Life Hotel by JJ,1 star,"Oct. 30, 2018",Pete Wells,Midtown,"African, American",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/dining/henry-at-life-hotel-by-jj-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/dining/henry-at-life-hotel-by-jj-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Earlier this year Henry, a new restaurant in the lobby of the Life Hotel on West 31st Street, quietly died. You wouldn’t know it to look around the place on any recent night at 8, when a seamless playlist of hip-hop and R&B unspools as servers carry stacked beef ribs to what seems like every third table. What changed? In August, the chef Joseph Johnson, better known as JJ, was made a partner and assumed control of the kitchen. What he has done is less a makeover than a takeover; his imprint radiates out from his Afrocentric menu to animate the whole enterprise. The playlist, which can run from noon until 8 the next morning without repeating a track, is his. Mr. Johnson’s initials now hang in the front window, flooding the nearby tables with pink neon. The initials have migrated to the restaurant’s website as well, where its name is now given as Henry at Life Hotel by JJ. These are not subtle gestures, but subtlety has rarely saved a restaurant on the brink of failure. Mr. Johnson has been busy hiring new employees for the front and back of the house, and the racial mix he has already achieved is as impressive as it is rare. Diversifying a restaurant’s service staff is one of the surest ways to diversify the audience, and on many nights brown faces and white faces, topknots and braids, headscarves and headbands, sit side by side, giving Henry more the appearance of a restaurant in Harlem than of one just off Herald Square. It was in Harlem, as chef de cuisine at a slinky neighborhood hangout called the Cecil and the history-drenched jazz supper club Minton’s, that Mr. Johnson made his name. Fleshing out a notion suggested by Alexander Smalls, the consulting chef in both places, Mr. Johnson explored the African diaspora, the imprint that Africans have put on cooking around the world. He does something similar at Henry, although his view has grown to embrace flavors from, say, India and Southeast Asia that turn up in Africa and in diasporic countries like Jamaica and Barbados. He calls the menu at Henry “Pan-African.” [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] This is a big story — too big to be told in full by one restaurant, or two for that matter. But it’s an important story, and it certainly beats Henry’s original idea of tying the restaurant to the history of Life magazine, which was once published in the same building, and to Henry Luce, who bought it in 1936, then radically remade it and moved it to other quarters. This concept was so wispy that Henry’s first chef, Michael Vignola, resorted to an all-things-to-all-people menu of foie gras sliders and meatball pizza. Just how vast Mr. Johnson’s scope has become will be clear by the end of the appetizer course. (Here I am assuming that you have chosen a traditional two- or three-course meal rather than eating all 15 items on the menu, in full and in order; this route costs $390 and is called “It Was All a Dream,” after a Notorious B.I.G. lyric.) There are littleneck clams, battered with rice flour and crunchy with shaved fennel and Asian pear. All of this is dotted with a tangerine-colored fluff of piri-piri sauce that is less ferociously spicy than the scalding piri-piris of Angola, Mozambique or South Africa. You are welcome to get a half-dozen, but at my table a full dozen went quickly. Benne seeds, the heirloom variety of sesame brought to North America on slave ships, add a flavor that is something like toasted almonds mixed with coffee beans to tuna tartare. The tuna is topped with a chip of curried peanut brittle and spooned over shiso leaves; you pinch the leaf and pop it in your mouth, where good things start to happen. And as you’re adjusting to this cross-pollination of Africa and Japan, Indo-Caribbean cuisine appears on the horizon: a plate of folded roti with dips. The spinach chutney is a little joyless, but the inky purée of eggplant sweetened with dates is a terrific idea. Why Mr. Johnson puts a fried egg on the roti is unclear. When your meal at Henry is over, you may wish you had been sent home with a world map showing the history of forced African migration and spice-trade routes. While it’s going on, though, you generally flow with the inner logic the way you can get into a hip-hop track without being able to name every last sample. Generally, but not always. I believe I understood some of the reasoning behind chopped collard greens and cashews tossed with a coconut dressing, but I still find raw collards somewhat rough going after the first few mouthfuls. Is the seared salmon with rice noodles, edamame and bok choy a reference to the Vietnamese community in Senegal? To me it tasted, not unpleasantly, like something one of the better Asian fusion restaurants in Manhattan would have served 20 years ago. Henry’s shrimp and pork dumplings, on the other hand, are nondescript little blobs; they sit in an aromatic “Harlem curry,” informed by Bengali cooking, that deserves a better dance partner. You could say the same about the intensely herb-scented seafood broth in a seafood boil that Mr. Johnson calls the Afropot; the clams and king crab legs were very good, but the prawns were unappealingly soft and the mussels not quite fleshy enough. The cooking, though, has been getting tighter over the past month, picking up from a first and somewhat droopy meal on a night when Mr. Johnson was not in the kitchen. Tamarind jerk chicken had no spice to speak of. A parcel of rice supposedly inspired by Dominican concón had as much crunch as if it had been left out on the counter overnight, and the eggplant curry ladled over it tasted more like a halfheartedly seasoned tomato sauce. The second time I tried it, the rice had a golden crackle and the curry was worth paying attention to. Apart from the seared scallops in a remarkably good hominy broth with cilantro pistou, those bone-in ribs are the most rewarding main course. The rewards are not so much the short ribs themselves, though they are flavorful and tender; the thrill of the dish is in the battery of little sides like stir-fried millet, spiced black beans and a hoisin sauce I wanted to take home to keep on hand for Chinese-food emergencies. I also thought about pocketing a Foie Crispy Treat, and I would have gotten away with it because everybody else at the table thought they were too weird. Weird they are, but interesting, too. Maybe you’d be happier with the sweet potato pie in a crisp butter crust, very old school apart from the purple yam in the filling. True, at some point in your meal a hotel guest may decide to march through the dining room with a full set of luggage. But under Mr. Johnson, Henry is under no risk of being capsized by that kind of distraction. He has pulled the restaurant back from the edge of failure, and that’s a rare trick.

24,Hunan Slurp,2 star,"Oct. 23, 2018",Pete Wells,East Village,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/dining/hunan-slurp-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/dining/hunan-slurp-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The rise of Sichuan food in New York has made the past decade or two a glorious era for prowlers of Chinese restaurants. Chongqing chicken and mung-bean jelly proliferated as skilled chefs flocked to the city. But while the miles of dan dan noodles and mountains of Sichuan peppercorns have been exhilarating, they have tended to overshadow the cuisine of another great chile-haunted region, Hunan. Part of the problem is nomenclature. The word Hunan on a restaurant’s front window tends to say as much about the actual cooking inside as pandas and bamboo on the sign. At first glance it can be hard to distinguish Hunan Garden, say, from Hunan House until you see the menus and learn that the former name signifies egg rolls while the latter promises the red-braised pork that Mao used to dote on. Fake Hunans outnumber real ones, which is one reason to celebrate the appearance of Hunan Slurp. Operating in the East Village since May, Hunan Slurp lives up to both halves of its name. When people in Hunan get hungry for a bowl of noodles, what they have in mind are mifen: long, white strands made from pounded rice, so smooth they may slither right out of the chopsticks of inexperienced slurpers. Chances for New Yorkers to practice their antiskid chopstick techniques have been limited, generally speaking, to the rice noodles of other parts of Asia. When you could find Hunanese noodles around town, they tended to be tucked away on larger menus with so many other Hunanese opportunities that they were rarely given a chance to slither. Hunan Slurp offers some of those opportunities, too. The chef and proprietor, Chao Wang, comes from Hunan’s second-largest city, Hengyang, and fills the menu with both traditional Hunanese dishes and his own innovations. But noodles are the heart of the restaurant. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] They peek out from underneath slices of beef, tofu and barbecued pork, all fanned out like a hand of poker, in a soup-less wonder called Hometown Lu Fen. The sauce is in the bottom of the bowl, and should absolutely be augmented with some of the chopped pickled red chiles in oil served in a small dish on the side. In the string bean mifen, the noodles weave around a fried egg and a scattering of ground Berkshire pork, stir-fried to a crackle with little rounds of sliced, pickled green beans. There is no slick of chile oil on top, and the pale broth looks harmless enough, but once the soup is stirred together it will take the crease out of a pair of newly pressed trousers. A little red sheaf of dried chile threads bobbing in the wild pepper and beef soup gives you an idea what you are in for, if the name hasn’t already given away the game. But with Hunan Slurp’s noodles, as with Hunanese food generally, heat is part of the message; it’s never the medium. Stock is to the cook what pitch is to the opera singer, goes a Chinese proverb. Hunan Slurp’s soup stocks are rounded and cloudy from long-boiled bones and meat, and they tend to get better the longer they linger with their toppings. (So do the noodles.) A master class in the art of broth subtlety is provided by the two-part soup that goes by the under-promising name fish fillet mifen. Part One is an oversize ceramic bowl of milky white pork-and-fish stock strewn with flower petals, pea shoots, purple basil and other fresh herbs. It arrives on a wooden tray next to Part Two, the noodles, which get their own bowl. The broth’s flavor was elusive at first, more a texture than a taste. Within minutes the steamed fish in the broth, together with the herbs, had transformed it into something splendid. Like many of the new Chinese restaurants that have sprouted in the East Village, Hunan Slurp pays attention to appearances. Under a backlighted logo that spells out SLURP in elongated, noodly letters, a sheet of glass on First Avenue frames the long, tunneled dining room, designed by New Practice Studio. The interior is sheathed in wooden slats that run up one wall, arch their way across the ceiling and fall down the opposite wall. Depending on your frame of mind, eating at Hunan Slurp can feel like sitting under a rack of drying noodles or finding yourself inside the belly of a particularly tidy whale. A glassed-in kitchen lies in the back, its shelves stacked with colorfully glazed modern Chinese plates and bowls that you won’t find in the restaurant-supply shops on the Bowery. Once you leave the noodle section of the menu behind, it is possible to find cooking that doesn’t necessarily live up to the standard set by the crockery. I’m told that the bands of cumin-seasoned beef speared with toothpicks can be crisp and well-browned, but the ones I got were gray and floppy. And the sweet-and-sour spareribs, an appetizer, were far more sweet than sour, and tough, too. On the best available evidence, Mr. Wang’s palate skews a bit sweet. This is unusual in a Hunanese kitchen, but only those spareribs were off-puttingly sugary. A multicolored salad of chilled cherry tomatoes was bright and refreshing despite a fruity marination in plum juice. (A similar dish sometimes turns up at Hao Noodle and Tea by Madam Zhu’s Kitchen, where it is sweeter, and still very enjoyable.) And the hint of sugar in stir-fried chicken did not soften the toothy bite of young ginger, or hide the ginger’s natural sweetness, either. You may not notice the bias toward sweetness anyway, given the kitchen’s open embrace of chiles. An electrical current of heat crackles through the dim-sum-style chicken feet, cooked until they are falling-off-the-toe tender. Bright green chiles animate a stir-fry of julienne potatoes, cooked so fast they’re still stiff. They also bring not just spice but crunch to a classic Hunanese sauté of pork and garlic topped with an egg fried to a ruffled, golden crisp. The chiles knocked around in a very hot wok with sweet, juicy cabbage are small, red, sun-dried and noticeably fruity under their mouth-zapping heat. The spice level is more subdued in the excellent stir-fry of pork and smoked tofu, and it’s almost undetectable in a very likable preparation of skinny eggplant sections topped with discs of bell pepper; the skins are left on the eggplants, which gives the appetizer something of the appearance of tuna maki wrapped with purple seaweed. Meals tend to move quickly. For this you may be thankful on busy nights when those wood slats go from attractive design elements to unnervingly effective sounding boards. As in other Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood, the crowd tends to be young, bright, quick and eager to get on with the rest of the evening. As the dinner rush ends, the howl subsides. Maybe ice cream is on the agenda, or a classic dessert soup of mung beans and barley in syrup. Or maybe a pot of tea, loose-leaf, brewed at the table while you think about chiles and rice and pork and wonder how many more Hunanese chefs can be persuaded to settle down in New York.","Marinated cherry tomatoes; chicken feet; Hunan charcuterie; stir-fried cabbage; chicken with young ginger; all noodles.

25,Atomix,3 star,"Oct. 16, 2018",Pete Wells,Murray Hill,Korean,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/dining/atomix-review-korean.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/dining/atomix-review-korean.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"A card is set down in front of you before each new course arrives at Atomix, the tasting-menu restaurant in Murray Hill run by Junghyun Park and his wife, Jeungeun. Each is printed with a boldface transliteration of a Korean word under an abstract design of geometric shapes and lines. They look like flashcards from a school run by progressive graphic designers. “Your first course is guk, which means soup,” a server will say. “This card is for hwe, Korean for raw.” “Jorim is next. Jorim means it’s been braised.” This sounds as if it would get old, but it doesn’t. Very early on, you learn that on the other side of these vocabulary exercises lie dishes of wonderful intricacy, sophistication and beauty. One after another, each of the 10 courses in the $175 meal opens up new ideas about Korean cuisine and culture. In the Atomix pedagogical method, instruction is followed closely by reward. (While we are working on vocabulary: The restaurant’s name is pronounced, somewhat counterintuitively, a-toe-mix.) [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] Many of the rewards are the kind you eat, of course. Guk-which-means-soup is a shimmering broth that Mr. Park, the chef, makes from fermented tomatoes and kelp; chilled and poured over scallop slices layered between slivers of green tomato that have been marinated in Korean fig vinegar, the broth has an electrifying sweet-sour balance. The dish may not scream “Korean cuisine,” but the next one does. This is hwe — Korean for raw, you’ll recall, and also the term for Korean-style sashimi. The fish is striped jack, brushed with plum vinegar sauce. Slices of it are folded around a mild fermented chile, a few drops of sesame oil and bits of kimchi made from cabbage and ramps. Sitting over each slice of jack is a crisp square of gim, which the Japanese call nori. Pinch some fish inside the gim and eat it, and the flavors that unspool are some of those that are brought to the table with Korean sashimi, but they’re put together with a harmony that’s hard to achieve when you swab them yourself under the influence of a few glasses of soju. Inspired by a poem from the Choson era, Mr. Park summoned an entirely different set of flavors for the hwe on Atomix’s opening menu, which ran from late May to early September. Then, the fish was sea bream, firm and chewy, marinated overnight with ginger in a magnificently good tangerine vinegar from the island of Jeju. Eaten with sea urchin, plain spinach, sparkling shards of jelly made from pale young soy sauce, and Chinese-mustard leaves fermented in some wonderful way, it was so deeply harmonic I wouldn’t have minded if Mr. Park had served it over and over for the rest of the meal. Centuries before it became the fashion among American chefs, fermentation was a pillar of Korean cuisine. Atomix exploits it in all kinds of ways. Fermentation bends a mix of juices from Korean pears, green apples and pineapple toward a cidery direction that makes it a thrilling marinade, braising liquid and sauce for exquisitely rich Wagyu strip loin. It’s the foundation for an array of vinegars you won’t find on the average table in Koreatown: cherry blossom, persimmon, mugwort, birch. And, of course, fermentation is behind the restaurant’s arsenal of pickled vegetables, the most interesting of which may be the tart brussels sprouts that Mr. Park serves in banchan format alongside roast duck with a mole sauce that could pass muster in Mexico if Mr. Park did not up the funk level with gochujang. Some of these ingredients were fermented or otherwise preserved in South Korea. Many more were put up for storage at Atoboy, the Parks’ other restaurant, over the past year or more as the Parks prepared to open Atomix. Atoboy’s food is woven around traditional banchan dishes, and while Mr. Park gives himself room to play, the cooking there stays true to the fairly simple origins of banchan. His tasting menus at Atomix make a quantum leap in complexity. It’s like seeing the guy who strums the 12-string guitar on the L platform pick up a conductor’s baton and lead an orchestra through a Mahler symphony. On the back of Atomix’s flashcards he lists the components of each dish, and each of their ingredients — around 20 on average, very few of them ordinary and none of them out of place. Nothing at Atomix tastes confused or overburdened. The dishes are even more elaborate than those at Jungsik, the rarefied Korean-inspired restaurant downtown where Mr. Park was the chef de cuisine before he and his wife struck out on their own. And while Jungsik seems determined to stuff Korean flavors into an outdated French formality, Atomix is warm, contemporary and Korean at just about every turn. The Parks, who were raised in South Korea, hired a Seoul architecture firm, Studio Writers, to remake two floors of a secretive-looking townhouse on East 30th Street. Upstairs is a small bar where you can slither into a pale-leather booth to idle over smartly conceived snacks like soy-marinated scallop jerky; beef tartare, mixed with red and black pepper, and under a snowfall of pecorino; or fried wings stuffed with fried rice and dusted with ground Sichuan peppercorns. Stairs descend to a bright, skylit lounge of upholstered benches where the tasting menu kicks off with a couple of hors d’oeuvres and drinks. The idea must be for you to leave the shuffle of Manhattan behind in stages, but I always spent my few minutes in this way station eyeing the comfortable, dark, wood-clad den a few steps away where the rest of the meal is served at a 14-seat counter. The natural materials and simple lines in the tasting room seem to bow toward Korea’s long Zen tradition, and a kind of purposeful calm reigns there. Servers and cooks all wear flowing, boat-neck shirts in a shimmering pewter color that gives them a slight science-fiction look; they are the work of a Korean-born New York designer, Sungho Ahn. Ms. Park, who goes by Ellia, glides behind the counter, smiling and holding out a cloth case to offer a pair of the Korean-made chopsticks she collects. They’re beautiful objects, and so are the handmade plates and bowls that begin to file out of the kitchen, each made by a potter or glass worker or wood carver in South Korea. These artisans are identified on the menu cards, whose abstract designs are the work of a South Korean artist. Tasting menus can be arid and sterile when a chef doesn’t have much to say. The format comes to life when a restaurant is overflowing with ideas, like Atomix. The way the Parks put Korean culture in the foreground recalls the early days of the Four Seasons, which moved beyond European models of formal dining by hiring an American architect and American industrial designers to go along with the American ingredients and even American wines. The Four Seasons had a Swiss chef, though. Atomix is more thorough: It has the Parks. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

26,Manhatta,1 star,"Oct. 9, 2018",Pete Wells,Financial District,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/dining/manhatta-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/dining/manhatta-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Shrinking modesty is not the normal attitude for restaurants with a view. The Rainbow Room had Art Deco razzmatazz and its revolving dance floor; Windows on the World, before terrorists destroyed it, served cocktails in a room named the Greatest Bar on Earth. Manhatta, which recently opened on the 60th floor of an International Style tower downtown, doesn’t follow their lead. It is the least show-offy skyscraper restaurant you’ve ever seen. The whole operation is very orderly and well behaved, apart from its refusal to spell its own name correctly. (The reference is to the Lenni Lenape name Manahatta, or Mannahatta, meaning “island of many hills,” but without the second “a” the name just looks incomplete. It’s like a child named Henr.) A dedicated door around the corner from the building’s main entrance brings you into a foyer that, with its sleek chairs and coffee tables, looks like the lobby of one of those 1960s white-brick apartment buildings in the East 40s and 50s. When you get out of the elevator — it goes to just one floor, the top — a short walk leads to another sparsely furnished sitting area, this one looking out the windows toward the harbor and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. When the lounge hasn’t been rented out for parties and sealed off, it’s busier than the foyer downstairs, but it still appears to have been designed for people who are waiting for their dates to get back from the restroom. In the other direction are Manhatta’s bar, a longish counter whose seats face uptown, and its dining room, which looks both north and east toward Brooklyn. The color scheme, navy-blue leather and dark wood, might strike the Knickerbocker Club’s board as a little too conservative. An open kitchen has been dropped down into the middle of all this, but the overall design strategy is to sit back and let the windows do the work. Danny Meyer, whose Union Square Hospitality Group runs Manhatta through a management contract with the building’s owner, told The New York Times last year that Manhatta would not be as flamboyant as a typical top-floor restaurant. “Those kinds of places often do not live up to expectations; they try too hard to live up to the view,” he said. “I expect to conceive of it like a ground-floor restaurant, as a place people might want to visit regularly.” You can’t blame Mr. Meyer for not wanting to open a mediocre splashy restaurant, but Manhatta flirts dangerously with being a mediocre unsplashy restaurant. The chef, Jason Pfeifer, doesn’t quite let that happen. His French menu, grounded in seasonal flavors, is fairly priced at $78, including tip, for a three-course prix fixe. A good amount of it is very likable, but there are more spongy patches than there probably should be. At their best, Manhatta’s better appetizers and main courses are fleshed out with fruits and vegetables so ripe and pristine they seem to come from a Greenmarket stall that only Mr. Pfeifer can see. A melon and cucumber salad with fluffy curds of feta was an exploration of melonic potential; each section of fruit was a bit different, some infused with citrus, others dripping with unfiltered garden-patch sweetness, all of them tangy with white balsamic vinegar. An admirably cooked brick of halibut was paired with bittersweet fennel bulbs and a mustard sauce with a gentle but effective bite. Raw nectarine crescents, braised lettuces and tender thin wheels of immature corn on the cob augmenting a main course of chicken were their charming selves, and all the better for their slinky dressing of chicken jus. Sweet black figs stood in for apples in a memorable little tarte Tatin garnished with raw pale-green figs. (Jennifer Bretania and Vanesa Beltran share the pastry duties.) Gently marinated hen-of-the-woods mushrooms made an exquisitely woodsy counterpoint to ruffles of shaved La Marotte sheep cheese. But generous applications of produce don’t always save the food from seeming a bit safe, conservative and slightly dated. Mr. Pfeifer, who spent eight years in the kitchen at Maialino, Mr. Meyer’s Roman-inspired restaurant, is now cooking French food in the post-nouvelle mode that Daniel Boulud has been artfully fomenting for years. Mr. Boulud has earned the right to keep working in that groove as long as he likes, but it’s strange to find a young chef at a new, high-profile destination doing it when others around the city are pushing ahead with contemporary interpretations of French cuisine. And when Manhatta turns to the classics, its use of French idioms seems skin-deep compared with Laetitia Rouabah’s light touch and sophisticated technique at Benoit, or Marie-Aude Rose’s painstaking elevations of cafe cooking at La Mercerie, or Daniel Rose’s intelligent, neoclassical excavations of silver-cloche cuisine at Le Coucou. Where Le Coucou brought back quenelles as helium-light pike dumplings in dizzyingly rich lobster-brandy sauce, Manhatta turns them into quivering balls of pudding distantly scented with seafood. Of all the ways a modern chef might grapple with cassoulet, the sublimely burly Languedocian assault on the digestive system, upending it over a crisp and golden chicken paillard has to be one of the strangest. Manhatta isn’t the first restaurant to update veal blanquette with meat that’s roasted rather than stewed, but the sauce is so blandly milky that it’s hardly there. And while modern desserts can stray into savory territory more than they did in Escoffier’s day, a vanilla soufflé with butterscotch sauce probably shouldn’t taste salty. Some of this was dispiriting, but I never got up from the table in a bad mood. There are grace notes throughout the restaurant, like the dark, shiny little canelés that show up with dessert. This being a Union Square Hospitality production, the servers seem to be trained mind readers. A pair of the mismatched binoculars scattered around the restaurant materialized just when I was trying to locate the clock tower in the Consolidated Edison Building; before I’d had a chance to point out a fruit fly in my wine (did it ride up with me in the elevator?) a sommelier spirited the glass away and brought a fresh one. Mr. Meyer was probably right to take a dialed-down approach to the top-floor restaurant genre. It dates from a more innocent age, when people could look at the financial district’s unblinking grids of lighted windows as the bland face of high-stakes cheating that we’ve come to recognize from “Margin Call” and “Billions.” At the time of the financial crisis, Manhatta’s building was the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase — a relatively minor player in the three-card-monte game of mortgage-backed securities, but a player nonetheless. Ten years have gone by, but it’s still too soon for revolving dance floors. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

27,Village Cafe,2 star,"Oct. 2, 2018",Pete Wells,Midwood,Eastern European ,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/dining/village-cafe-review-brooklyn.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/dining/village-cafe-review-brooklyn.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"During the five years Village Cafe has been open, I must have driven the length of Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn a dozen times without noticing it. At best I might have spotted the tiny parking lot in Midwood, with tattered red, blue and silver streamers flapping over its 10 or so spaces, giving it the appearance of the world’s smallest used-car dealership. In the back is a wide, single-story structure that looks like the trailer office where you would sit down to discuss loan options with Marty from financing. But that building is an Azerbaijani restaurant that stands out among the dining outposts of former Soviet republics that stretch north from Brighton Beach, and each time I’ve gone inside I was given not a credit check, but a test of my appetite’s limits. This is not just because almost every platter of food that leaves the kitchen at Village Cafe seems intended to feed an actual village. I run into trouble because there are so many things I want to order and so few things I am willing to leave on the table as the meal winds down. There will never be a time when I go to Village Cafe and decide not to have at least one qutab, if not all three. The menu gives the name of this delicate Azerbaijani flatbread, the diameter of a pita but thinner, as kutaby. Either way, it is very good when stuffed with minced, quietly spiced chicken or lamb. It is exceptional when filled with greens: spinach, scallions, and dill and cilantro, two fresh herbs that turn up again and again in Azerbaijani cooking. I will always want the crimped dumplings, the size and shape of chicken drumettes, that the English menu calls ravioli and the servers call pelmeni. Filled with chicken or lamb, these dumplings can be boiled, but the urge to ask for them fried is overwhelming, and the fried ones are better dunked in the tomato-pepper sauce that I would call salsa if I were not in an Azerbaijani restaurant. There will be liver on my table, too. Maybe it will be Turkish style, little fried cubes under a tart purple dusting of ground sumac. Or the liver may be added to bits of lamb hearts, kidney and testicles, and cooked with onions and potato cubes in a fantastically oily hash called djiz biz. Whether I will eat guru hingal will depend on how far in advance I’ve planned my meal, because it generally has to be ordered a day ahead. It is a noodle dish: very thin, wide sheets of pasta under a sauce of onions and ground lamb fried in its own fat until it is magnificently crunchy. If you poured chile oil over guru hingal, it would taste Sichuanese; stew the lamb with tomatoes and you could mistake the sauce for Bolognese. But it’s from Azerbaijan, and it’s good with yogurt. And I will have soup, even if nobody else does, because Village Cafe’s kitchen understands how to make it. The kufta-bozbash is a strong, well-skimmed lamb broth with chickpeas and a single, tender lamb-rice meatball, as big as an apple. The broth for dushbara soup is similar, but the ballast is provided by miniature lamb dumplings about the size of M&Ms. Cilantro and dried mint are added to both soups at the last minute, and the mint is especially helpful. Village Cafe’s hot borscht, strong and decidedly unvegetarian, outperforms some I’ve had in Brighton Beach. Instead of sour cream, it comes with a spoonful of yogurt. The cuisine of Azerbaijan often echoes those of its neighbors Georgia, Armenia and Iran, but other dishes, like borscht, were hauled down from Eastern Europe in the strong arms of Mother Russia. We can also thank Russia for the insane music videos that play on Village Cafe’s two televisions, typically with the volume off while American pop of the ’80s plays on the sound system. You sit at what appear to be varnished picnic tables with chairs instead of benches. The rest of the décor looks like a Brighton Beach yard sale: a mushroom cookie jar, an embroidered peasant smock, a camouflage cap, a samovar or two, a collection of beaded handbags, several ceramic cows, three statues of fat chefs with toques and mustaches, and two giant forks mounted on the wall. For atmosphere, Village Cafe is roundly beaten by my second-favorite Azerbaijani restaurant in Brooklyn, Old Baku in Kensington. Walk past the awning that says “private club,” past the curtained booths in the front dining room, past the open kitchen where chefs scoop burning coals to keep the fire under the kebabs going strong, and you enter a courtyard from another country. Almost everybody at Old Baku is smoking under the arbor of grape vines that weave around strings of white lights. If you go in the fall, you might be brought a plate of purple grapes, newly picked a few feet away. But Village Cafe gains its edge on Old Baku in the kitchen. The stewed fruit ladled over saffron rice in its plov, for instance, is a richer and more varied compilation of dried plums, apricots, chestnuts and deeply browned lamb. The salads are brighter, too, if you can get over some of the names. The menu was evidently written by someone with a weakness for poetry, so the salads are called things like “Journey to Baku,” “Winter Fun” and “Unexpected Guests.” The Journey to Baku is worth taking; it’s a sharply seasoned, smoky eggplant mash with peppers and tomatoes. The kidney beans in a traditional lobio salad are creamy, salty and well-oiled under their topping of chopped walnuts and cilantro. Main course names incline toward the allusive as well, with one chicken cutlet called “Miracle of Village” and another — buried under a white pillow of cheese and cream sauce — that goes by “Mother In Laws Chicken.” But really, the best place to go once all the amenities have been polished off is the kebabs. The quail may be a bit wizened. The grilled testicles with a hint of lemon in their lightly browned surfaces will always be a niche proposition. But the lamb ribs, the marinated lamb chops known as chalahac and the flatbread-wrapped Azerbaijani version of kofte called lulya kebabs (made from chicken or lamb) are extremely good. The vegetable skewer choices begin and end with blistered tomatoes and softly collapsing eggplant. Both are worthwhile. So is the side dish called “homemade potatoes,” if there is any room left on the table. Sliced and fried with onions, they narrowly beat out the pretty good fries. A cup or two of strong dark tea will speed your recovery from this onslaught. Dessert may not. Still, there is something to be said for trying a Napoleon made like baklava and a baklava made like a Napoleon. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

Starbucks, the company he joined after that trip and would eventually lead, might teach its employees the fine arts of Malaysian kopi, brewed by pouring hot water over grounds in the bottom of a sock, rather than show them how to operate an espresso machine. Instead of white-chocolate mocha lattes, we would drink bek-kopi, white coffee, brewed from beans that are lightly roasted in palm oil margarine. Venti would just be Italian for a number, while kopi-C kosong, or strong black coffee with unsweetened condensed milk, would have entered the American lexicon, along with kopi tarik, the same drink made with sweetened condensed milk. There would be no competitions where baristas drew swans and elephants in milk froth, and in their place we would have exhibitions of coffee and tea pulling, the art of cooling the beverage while coaxing the milk in it to form a foamy head by pouring it from one pot to another in long, swooping, steamy cataracts. In other words, the places where we get our caffeine fix might look a lot like Kopitiam, on East Broadway in Chinatown. Kyo Pang founded Kopitiam three years ago as a homage to the coffee and tea parlors of Malaysia, where she grew up. A typical Malaysian kopitiam is a ramshackle hangout where people drop in to read the morning paper, grab breakfast, catch up on neighborhood gossip and do all the other things that classically accompany a cup of tea or coffee. Something of that spirit pervades Kopitiam, too. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The original Kopitiam, reviewed by Ligaya Mishan in a 2015 Hungry City column, was situated around the corner on Canal Street and had just four seats at a single counter. In June, Ms. Pang and her new business partner, Moonlynn Tsai, relocated to a larger, if still fairly intimate, space a few steps above the sidewalk. You order at the counter and receive a number on a metal stand, a kind of promissory note for the food and beverages. If you show up on a weekday in the morning or afternoon, when seats are not hard to come by and the room has a languid, unhurried air, you could get just a cup of bek-kopi and linger over it with a newspaper. You will probably want more than that, though. From 9 a.m., when the doors open, until 10 p.m., when they close, you can get nasi lemak, Malaysia’s national dish and a particular favorite at breakfast. I don’t know another kitchen in the city where the fragrances of coconut and pandan leaf infuse the rice as elegantly, or where the tiny dried fish, which Kopitiam fries with peanuts, form a caramelized crust that erases the distinction between sweet and savory. Or your breakfast could be a bowl of two eggs boiled just long enough to turn the whites opaque while leaving the yolks free to billow into mushroom-soy broth underneath. Or it might be fish ball soup, grape-size globes of ground fish in a cloudy white broth; if the grains of white pepper on the surface aren’t intense enough for you, you can stir in a little fish sauce spiced with bird’s eye chiles. Rice vermicelli can be added, too, but the soup is easier to appreciate in pure liquid form. For mornings when nothing but a cannonball dive into sugar will do, Kopitiam is ready with a sculptural pile of thick-cut French toast battered with Milo malt-chocolate powder, a Malaysian passion, with streams of sweetened condensed milk playing the part that in this country is normally taken by maple syrup. Eat the whole stack and you will know the answer to the musical question posed by the Cramps: How far can too far go? At 10:30 a.m. Ms. Pang, the chef, adds a gang of new dishes to the breakfast crew, and all of them stick around until closing time. There are fresh little oysters embedded in a thin browned omelet, rice noodles in a chilled sesame-oil broth with a growl of chile heat and spicy skate steamed in banana leaves, the classic acoustic version of the dish that Max Ng plays with amplifiers and wah-wah pedals at Momofuku Ssam Bar. Any of these could make a small meal. But one of the most inviting aspects of Kopitiam is Ms. Pang’s fidelity to the Malaysian love of snacks. Pandan leaves wrapped around a kind of chicken sausage; ground five-spice pork rolled inside bean-curd skins and fried; fried strips of mackerel sausage with a curry-leaf sauce — any of them makes a fine appetizer, but each could just as easily be the entire goal of a between-meals stop at Kopitiam. For that matter, so could the small sweets like pulut: triangular, pandan-wrapped bundles of sticky rice tinted with blue morning glory flowers and spread with toasted coconut sugar or house-made coconut jam. Ms. Pang is devoted to cakes as well. You get the sense that if it were physically possible, she’d bake every cake she knows every day, but she settles for one or two in an unpredictable rotation. You may find the caramel-brown honeycomb cake, with its intriguing structure of hollow vertical columns at the bottom, or you may find her coconut cake, or there may be some fresh surprise. Snacks and sweets tend to get edged out of the spotlight in New York restaurants, where there’s always pressure to order something big. This is, after all, a city that turned the casual tapas bar into the peculiar genre known as the tapas restaurant. There is no such pressure inside Kopitiam, at least on weekdays. Weekend brunch is another story, as it often is. The menu is the same, but the crowds thicken. A sign-in sheet is kept outside the door, next to the pink pay phone (25 cents; it works), and hopeful customers sit on ceramic garden stools at the top of the stoop listening for their names. When you’re finally called, you may feel silly getting nothing more than tannic milky tea and a bundle of blue sticky rice. And when demand peaks, chaos can creep in, suggesting that Kopitiam is still figuring out the mechanics of its larger space. Servers may pop by anxiously to ask, “Did you get all your food?” and the answer may be no. Drink orders may stack up. Once the white coffee was off the menu; another time, no coffee at all was being poured; and for a short time one day, both coffee and tea were unavailable, an awkward state of affairs for a coffee and tea parlor. Even with a backlog of tickets, though, the food trickling out of the kitchen is almost unfailingly terrific. Maybe the stir-fried duck tongues I ate last time could have slid from their cartilaginous framework more easily. Then again, maybe I wasn’t in the right mood for duck tongues.

29,Shoji at 69 Leonard Street,3 star,"Sept. 18, 2018",Pete Wells,TriBeCa,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/dining/shoji-at-69-leonard-street-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/dining/shoji-at-69-leonard-street-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"“People always say summer is not a good time for sushi,” Derek Wilcox said. “I have no idea what they’re talking about.” Early evening, the end of August, and the granite TriBeCa sidewalks outside Shoji at 69 Leonard Street were deserted. The restaurant was empty, too. I sat alone on one side of the counter, and on the other stood Mr. Wilcox, alone, as he usually is even when customers occupy all 12 chairs. Although assistants work in the wings, the restaurant is essentially a one-man show. In the broad view, having the place to myself was unjust. In the year since Mr. Wilcox took over the restaurant — at first his work there was termed a residency or pop-up, but in June the owner, Idan Elkon, announced that he’d put a ring on it and made the arrangement permanent — he has firmly placed it in the top tier of the city’s Japanese restaurants. On the basis of sushi alone, Shoji has few plausible rivals, and for sushi embedded within a longer, kaiseki-derived menu, it has no parallel. There should be no empty seats, no matter how many New Yorkers are off lolling at the beach. Taking a selfish view, though, I wasn’t particularly unhappy to be the only customer. Mr. Wilcox, who grew up in Virginia, cooked at a kaiseki restaurant in Kyoto called Kikunoi for seven years and then spent three more at a traditionalist sushi parlor in the Ginza district of Tokyo. You might think of this as the equivalent of earning a master’s degree followed by a Ph.D. in Japanese cuisine, and one side benefit of a meal across the counter from Mr. Wilcox is the chance to hear what he learned studying abroad. Show some curiosity and you could get a short education in the mineral-rich clay used by potters in the town of Shigaraki, or the various aliases and false names under which a particularly delicious, pink-fleshed fish known as akamutsu in Japan travels under when it is away from home. On this August night, I was about to get a two-hour schooling on the pleasures of summer sushi. Mr. Wilcox’s opening move was a squiggle of what looked like short, thick noodles and turned out to be lengths of chilled eggplant; Mr. Wilcox had given them a cool bath in the light sauce in which icy coils of somen noodles are dipped in summer. Laid over the top were two tongues of bafun sea urchin, a species with the color of a nearly ripe persimmon. With one dish, he had shooed away the heat outside, shown off the uncanny harmony of urchin and eggplant, and introduced a minor theme of the night, the summer urchin harvest in Japan. This overture out of the way, Mr. Wilcox lifted what appeared to be a machete. This was a hamo knife, a heavy swath of sharp steel that can reduce the daggertooth pike conger’s dozens of tiny bones to edible smithereens; before the first one was forged in the 19th century, he explained, the eel had to be fully cooked and separated from its skeleton. This hamo would be quickly scorched on one side and served with a lick of wasabi and puréed salt-cured plums thinned with dashi. Sashimi came next in the form of shioko, or kanpachi caught when it is young and its flavor is leaner and softer than it will get later in the year. This was followed by a local fish that in the spring Mr. Wilcox had told me he didn’t like, striped bass. He had been working with it, though, salting it overnight and then grilling it until the skin crackled. Now I don’t want striped bass cooked any other way. After this was Mr. Wilcox’s nod to the kaiseki tradition known as takiawase, a plate of simmered vegetables and, in this case, seafood: a small potato, some Japanese eggplant, a crisp pink ginger shoot and the most flavorful piece of octopus I have ever put in my mouth. After my first meal at Shoji I learned to hope that chawan mushi, a bowl of steaming-hot tofu custard, was on the menu. In spring Mr. Wilcox made it with spot prawns, but tonight, in homage to clambake season, he was serving lobster chawan mushi. To this point, the menu had faithfully followed kaiseki’s ritualized sequence of courses and its stopwatch-precise attention to seasonality. It was about to veer in a different direction, but it was enough to suggest that Mr. Wilcox could open a kaiseki restaurant that would set a new standard in the city. I’m not sure the city would support it, but it would be spectacular while it lasted. The different direction, of course, was sushi. Accounting for just about half the Shoji menu, the sushi portion is briefer and offers less variety than the full monty at, say, Sushi Amane or Ginza Sushi Onodera. But I’m not sure any competitor outflanks Shoji on the quality of the seafood it does serve, or in the timeliness with which it serves up exactly the specimens most worth tracking down at any given moment. In spring, when bioluminescent firefly squid are spawning in Japanese bays, Mr. Wilcox gets them. In August, when cuttlefish are thumbnail size, unbelievably smooth and as meltingly soft as the thinnest sheet of nova at Russ & Daughters, he will lay three of those over a single finger of rice. He tracks bluefin that has been caught from healthy stocks, like the o-toro from Ireland that he served last spring and that was so seductive it could have been captioned “the guy she told you not to worry about.” While in Japan, Mr. Wilcox learned to make fresh ikura from sacs of salmon roe, a slow process that requires massaging the eggs apart by hand in many changes of water. Normally the roe is then heavily cured with sugar and salt, but the roe he was serving last month was very lightly seasoned before being spooned into a shot glass and served as is — sticky, fatty, sweet and fresh. After the last piece of fish, the kaiseki format kicks in again with a soup, which may be as simple as a classic bowl of miso or may break with tradition, like the extraordinary corn soup I ate in August. There will be something cold and refreshing, maybe a granita made from ginger or matcha, and finally a more substantial dessert. Sometimes this is a sort of tart with seasonal fruit — candied kumquats, maybe, or white peaches and blueberries — arranged in a mochi wafer called monaka. For all this the charge is $252, service included. A shorter menu is available at $190, or a longer one at $295, again with service included. That service is somewhat minimal; lately it has meant a single employee assiduously refilling water glasses and taking orders from a drinks list whose cheapest item is a $12 bottle of beer. Could my server have been more adept at deciphering the wines, sakes, shochus and Haitian rums Mr. Elkon and Mr. Wilcox have put together? Perhaps, but I wouldn’t necessarily want the scene cluttered by a sommelier in full pocket-square-and-cuff-links regalia. More employees hovering at the counter might take away from the bond Mr. Wilcox builds with the people he feeds. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

30,Sofreh,2 star,"Sept. 11, 2018",Pete Wells,Prospect Heights,Middle Eastern,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/dining/sofreh-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/dining/sofreh-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Considering the history, the influence, the depth and the sophistication of Iranian food, it has always seemed unfair that New York City has so few places to eat it. Unfair to the cuisine and unfair to would-be eaters. If you want a symbol for the state of the cuisine in New York City, Taste of Persia NYC will fit the bill. Until recently I might have called it the city’s most promising Iranian kitchen, if the word kitchen weren’t such a stretch. Taste of Persia is a takeout operation squeezed into the front window of a Chelsea pizzeria, except during the two months when fire damage forced it to take up temporary residence in a holiday market. It does show off some of the pleasures of the Iranian table, but not the table itself. So a new Brooklyn restaurant called Sofreh, which joined the Iranian ranks in June, would have caused a stir even if the cooking weren’t quite as good as it is. The dining room is spare and modern, with exposed rafters, molded plywood chairs and shades of soft white. You have to look carefully to see the breaks with garden-variety minimalism, like the echoes of medieval arches behind the bar and the Persian calligraphy carved into the plaster in the back, where a small deck hangs above a garden. Minimalism surrenders entirely in the bathroom, papered in a pulpy collage of posters from pre-revolutionary Iranian cinema. All summer, Iranian expats and hopeful fans of Iranian cuisine have been filing in, armed with questions: Does the saffron rice stand high in voluminous heaps of discrete grains? Are nigella seeds embedded in the dimpled, golden crusts of the oval loaves of barbari? Do the cold shards of sorbet frozen around threads of noodles in Sofreh’s faloodeh contain just enough rose water to soften the bite of lime syrup? Check, check and check. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The main dining room is on the street level of a Prospect Heights brownstone just off Flatbush Avenue, and the food is largely in a domestic mode. Nasim Alikhani, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Theodore Petroulas, is responsible for the menu. Ms. Alikhani has never worked in a restaurant before. Rather than following the plating fashions of more trend-conscious chefs, she models the cooking after the things she might make when company comes over. Platoons of kebabs dominate the menus of other Iranian restaurants around town, but home kitchens are rarely built with vast indoor grills; Sofreh’s cooking, entrusted to two chefs named Ali Saboor and Soroosh Golbabae, revolves around the oven and stovetop. A loaf of barbari, its crust baked to a Roman-pizza crackle in a revolving oven, is served with many of the appetizers, and it is always gone so soon that I end up ordering one or two more. This flatbread is of course ideal for tearing and swishing into the thick yogurt dips, one mixed with golden raisins and shredded cucumber, another with minced shallots and chives. It is indispensable with the eggplant mash enriched with walnuts, strained yogurt and sweet fried onions. A loaf of barbari is also spread with herbs and feta that is more creamy than briny. Earlier in the summer Sofreh offered an appetizer of dry, underseasoned beef meatballs with sour cherries. One of the only things on the menu that was hard to warm up to, it has been replaced lately by beef kofte, made light and tender by rice and stewed split peas. The kofte sit in a gentle saffron-tomato sauce that is another natural partner for Sofreh’s bread. Ms. Alikhani, 59, grew up in the sprawling desert city Isfahan, and moved to the United States in her early 20s. For years she cooked Iranian dishes from memory, and it would be decades before she traveled back to Iran to learn more about its food in preparation for opening Sofreh. Her version of ash, the herb and whole-wheat noodle stew, stands out on the menu because it stays so close to tradition. Other dishes show the acclimatizing effect of New York. It’s an article of faith for chefs in the city that any dish can be improved by putting a poached egg on it. I’m not so sure that Sofreh’s smoked eggplant halves with their sweet, garlic-drenched tomato sauce need one, though. Is the watermelon feta salad familiar from restaurants that have nothing to do with Iran? Maybe just a bit, but Sofreh’s version stands out for its intriguing sauce of nigella seeds crushed into mint oil. And while the Shiraz salad isn’t chopped to fine bits in the traditional way that makes it something like Iran’s answer to pico de gallo, its sour purple flecks of sumac distinguish it from the herd of tomato-cucumber assemblages. The menu is fairly concise, and occasionally I wished that it plunged into tradition with less restraint. For a dish called “catch of the day,” Ms. Alikhani has adapted ghalieh mahi, a tamarind-soured stew of fish and fresh herbs from southern Iran. In her version, a pan-seared hunk of whitefish — halibut and cod have taken turns in the role — is set over a long-cooked sauce. Dark with caramelized onions and fried cilantro and fresh fenugreek leaves, the sauce is hypnotically complex. Still, a sauce sitting under fish is not the same as one that has been cooked with fish so the flavors can get acquainted. A simple flattened and griddled half chicken, though, is a wonderful foil for a topping of tart barberries and a captivating sauce of dried Persian plums and saffron. And there’s lovely simplicity to the braised lamb shank with roasted garlic and sizzled onions; the turmeric- and cinnamon-scented sauce might have been put on this earth to be spooned over fluffy rice. There is no shame in ending the meal with a goblet of thick yogurt parfait with jam and pistachios. But there are harder-to-find sweets, too, like the rose-water custard, grainy with rice flour, transformed into a sort of tart by a crust of chopped nuts. Saffron and rose-water ice cream is luxuriously rich despite a few stray ice crystals. And the faloodeh, one of the world’s oldest frozen desserts, will put to rest all doubts about the wisdom of embedding sorbet in a nest of vermicelli, if there were any doubts to begin with.

31,Nobu 57,1 star,"Aug. 21, 2018",Pete Wells,Midtown,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/dining/nobu-downtown-review-nobu-57.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/dining/nobu-downtown-review-nobu-57.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"There was a time when there was only one Nobu, on Hudson Street in TriBeCa. When it opened in 1994, it was the first restaurant outside Los Angeles to offer Nobuyuki Matsuhisa’s startling new liaison of sushi and other Japanese food with Peruvian flavors. The herds of imitators were still to come. If you wanted to try raw yellowtail in ponzu under a green jalapeño wheel, or fried rock shrimp shimmering with spiced mayonnaise, or broiled black cod in miso so sweet it might have been maple syrup — and for a few years it seemed as if that was all anybody wanted — you either went to Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills, Calif., or you went to Hudson Street. Now you can eat Nobu ceviche in Dubai, Budapest and Cape Town. If you want Nobu sashimi salad for dinner followed by a night in a Nobu hotel, you can do that in Marbella, Manila, Miami or Palo Alto. When the United States Space Force establishes its first lunar base, the generals and majors will no doubt find a Nobu there, with tuna tataki on the menu and a line three-deep at the bar. This is because after the success of Nobu in TriBeCa, Mr. Matsuhisa and his partners made a strategic decision. The food would stay roughly the same — more on this in a minute — but the surroundings would grow bigger, boozier, louder, more theatrical. If Nobu did not exactly invent the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre, it certainly drew the blueprints. At these new Nobus, Mr. Matsuhisa’s food was still a major event, but not necessarily the main event. And the question was not just whether you felt like eating at Nobu but whether you felt like being at Nobu. The Malibu location in particular has a reputation for intense good-time vibes that can drive away customers who merely want to eat. All this was encapsulated for me in two brief scenes from my recent meals at Nobu Downtown and Nobu Fifty Seven. The first episode took place while I was sitting at the sushi bar of Nobu Downtown. This location, inside the old AT&T tower on Lower Broadway, is theoretically the successor to the first Nobu; it opened last year a few weeks after the original closed. The sushi bar was the heart of the TriBeCa restaurant. The chefs behind it prepared or touched at least half the food, and seats there were so coveted that during the 1990s, when even celebrities complained about how hard it was to get in, a mostly sushi restaurant called  Next Door Nobu was opened simply to contain the overflow. (It closed last year, too, and won’t be replaced.) At Nobu Downtown, the upstairs sushi counter is on the far side of the cocktail bar that the design firm Rockwell Group slipped in among the enormous fluted limestone columns that fill the building’s ground floor like a petrified forest. I had just eaten a piece of Japanese scallop sushi with a dangerous streak of wasabi when an animated group of four new arrivals appeared next to me. The sushi chefs eyed them warily, because they appeared to intend to cluster around a single stool, the way people do at a bar. Soon it became apparent that they thought they were at the bar. But the people they mistook for bartenders were all busy slicing raw fish, so eventually the group moved on to look for somebody to make them a drink. Moments like this didn’t tend to happen at the original Nobu, but they do bring Nobu Downtown in line with Nobu Fifty Seven. In business on 57th Street since 2005, Nobu Fifty Seven is another two-story proposition. Between 5 and 7 p.m. its ground-floor lounge acts on young Midtown professionals like the fishing nets evoked by Rockwell Group’s design. At the time the second scene took place, the bartenders looked as if they were struggling not to get caught. My cocktail, a Negroni-esque thing with sake in it that was ferried to my upstairs table from the downstairs bar, was neither shaken nor stirred; it was, in fact, almost hot. While I was waiting for the cocktail to be cooled by its single ice cube, a server was struggling to open a bottle of Champagne for a table of at least 10 men next to me. When the cork came out, he managed to spray the room in a manner usually seen in the Super Bowl champions’ locker room. Everybody nearby got a little wet, including me and my guests, but nobody seemed to notice. Servers at both addresses have the brisk, well-drilled, impersonal and slightly numbed quality that comes of waiting on hundreds of people a day. At Nobu Fifty-Seven, one told me, “Our menu is kaiseki style, so it’s like tapas. Everything is meant for sharing.” I must have looked confused because he added, “Some dishes are going to be bigger than others.” Nobu Fifty-Seven was given three stars in its last New York Times review, by Frank Bruni in 2005. That’s what Ruth Reichl gave the original in 1995. After three recent visits to each location, I decided that, apart from minor menu variations, any qualitative difference in the food between the two branches is too subtle for me to make out. The chefs uptown are Taku Sato and Matt Hoyle. Downtown was led by Ricky Estrellado and Ryo Hasegawa until June, when Mr. Estrellado died suddenly. His successor has not been named. Both kitchens are models of superior ingredient shopping and consistent performance. When those classic Nobu dishes appear, they will be exactly like the last time you had them. In the case of the mayo-bathed fried shrimp, that may not be an entirely good thing. And I still think the flavor of the caviar that crowns tuna, or salmon, or yellowtail tartare gets elbowed out of the way by the wasabi-soy sauce. But the tiradito, slices of yellowtail squirted with lemon and yuzu juice, then dotted with puréed rocoto pepper, is always wonderfully bracing. The candylike black cod is as hard to deny as ever, even if the extra sweetening Mr. Matsuhisa gives this traditional Japanese dish strikes me as somewhat shameless. The sashimi salad and the lobster shiitake salads are both better than any salad from a global chain has the right to be. I don’t know who orders the dishes marked Nobu Now, but I tried a few. Umami Chilean sea bass: not worth it, even for the slightly exotic return of a fish that hasn’t been seen much since the ’90s. Kumamoto shooters: a thrilling series of flavors that will recall the way you felt the first time you ate at Nobu. Michele Goldsmith’s desserts, served both uptown and downtown, are modern and playful and don’t try too hard to follow the theme, whatever that is. Over the years, the Hudson Street Nobu became something unusual, a restaurant that could serve tourists and families from around the corner with equal aplomb. But a meal at Nobu is still among the best, although not the cheapest, ways to introduce children to raw fish. And sitting at the sushi bar can still provide the intimacy that the rest of the place lacks.

32,Le Sia,1 star,"Aug. 14, 2018",Pete Wells,East Village,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/dining/le-sia-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/dining/le-sia-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The rustic little shop held out longer than many other Ukrainian outposts in the East Village. With its shelves of records, tapes, books, newspapers, dyed Easter eggs, the beeswax styluses used to give those eggs their symmetrical patterns, white smocks and blouses with red and black embroidery, and local honey, Surma Book & Music Company had operated on East Seventh Street since 1943. At other addresses, it went back to 1918. Two summers ago, it closed, going the way of Ukrainian butcher shops selling wrinkled sticks of hunter’s sausage, Ukrainian restaurants offering starchy knobs of halusky, and Ukrainian bars where the customers were downing shots of vodka before that was cool, and kept going after it wasn’t. The East Village is a less interesting place without Surma. But the chain-store monoculture that might have seemed inevitable as the Ukrainian community fell away hasn’t been the neighborhood’s fate. Not yet. New Chinese restaurants have sprung up in the area over the past few years faster than the old Eastern European business have died off. In January, one of them moved into Surma’s old address. It’s called Le Sia, and it’s thriving. Walk in any weekend night between 6 and 9, and a small throng will be waiting for seats by the entrance, below the kayaks that are stowed up by the ceiling as if this were the garage of somebody’s summer house. During the week, Le Sia takes reservations, but that doesn’t ease the demand by much. On some nights, the crowd is almost exclusively Chinese people of college age or slightly older, many of them lured out of their nearby New York University dorm rooms for steaming pans of shellfish, especially Le Sia’s specialty, crayfish. Although a server there described the restaurant to me as “Cajun seafood,” Le Sia is not serving Acadiana-style crayfish. Nor is it seasoning crayfish with the magical, butter-drenched combinations of Southeast Asian and Louisiana flavors like Thai basil-tamarind and lemongrass-ginger that were spawned in Vietnamese kitchens along Bellaire Boulevard in Houston. Yang Liu and Tianye Chen, who own the restaurant along with its chef, Zac Zhang, are following a separate, unbuttered Chinese tradition that they enjoyed before moving to the United States. It’s a fairly young one, as Chinese food traditions go. Crayfish, or xiaolongxia, arrived in China sometime in the middle of the 20th century. After regarding the novel ingredient warily for a few decades, cooks built a cuisine around it. Eaters took to it so enthusiastically that by 2016 the Chinese crayfish industry employed five million people and was worth $27 billion. One major farming center is Hubei province, which recently unveiled a 59-foot-long crayfish sculpture that is said to be the world’s largest. Its bright-red pincers are raised victoriously. Le Sia cooks crayfish and other shellfish — lobster, shrimp, and Dungeness and snow crabs — by boiling them first and then clacking them around in a hot wok with one of seven sauces. Each sauce can be further customized to one of four chile-heat levels, from mild to “fire.” Whatever combination of sea animal and seasoning you ask for, it will arrive at the table almost before the words have left your mouth. For many customers the go-to order seems to be “crayfish hot and spicy, spicy.” Hot and spicy sauce, as far as I can make out, is based on soy, miso and garlic; the firepower comes from sliced pickled chiles, but the soy and miso give it a muscular heft. It may be my favorite Le Sia sauce, although it’s a close call between that and its near relative, “numbing and spicy,” which is propelled into tingling ma la territory by Sichuan peppercorns. I’m fascinated by the kimchi-lime sauce, which conforms to no seafood-boil tradition I know of; its flavor is angular, hybridized, invigorating and not as fiery as you might expect. The garlic sauce hits just one note, and there will be no prizes for guessing which one. There is also a sauce called “thirteen special-flavor herbal spices.” I tried it twice, with wildly divergent outcomes. The first time it was a wonderful, nuanced aromatic blend of expected and unexpected Chinese spices. On a second try, it tasted like spiced seawater. The star ingredient can vary, too. Honesty compels me to note that the California crayfish Le Sia has been serving lately have a sweeter, finer flavor than the ones it was getting from Louisiana in the late spring. This will no doubt cost me some friends in New Orleans. On the other hand, those friendships are already on the rocks over my newspaper’s insistence on calling the crustacean in question crayfish, rather than crawfish. Le Sia’s shrimp, in my encounters with it, was bland and powdery. Dungeness crab arrived overcooked, the meat desperately stuck to the shell. Snow crab was much better: sweet and flaky in the legs, although the white bits at the joints were slightly broken down. But every time I ordered lobster it was juicy and sweet. It may be the safest choice, although I haven’t completely given up on the crayfish entirely. At $15 for what looks like a very generous pound, it’s worth taking a chance. As for the risks of eating without a pair of plastic gloves, kept in plentiful supply in sealed pouches on the table, or one of the synthetic-fabric black bibs with their swirling red claw-and-antenna designs, that is up to you. A vast stretch of the menu is taken up by northern-Chinese skewers of vegetables and animal parts of many kinds. These tend to arrive even faster than the other dishes, if that’s possible. They are not bad as quick, casual snacks, particularly the “King of Kings” hot dog, carved into pink lobes that stick out like cat tongues. But other skewers suggest an assembly-line approach that you don’t find among the better street-corner grills in Flushing, Queens. The application of the cumin and red pepper seasoning is often just as heavy on delicate ingredients as full-flavored ones, and the grilling times don’t seem to be monitored closely. Tiny squid legs, lamb kidneys and enoki mushrooms were all dry and overdone. So was a main course of quail, purportedly smoked over lemongrass and pine cones. Wok-fried clams in garlic sauce were delicious, though, as were many of the cold appetizers, like a rose formation of pickled radish slices; smashed cucumbers in garlic sauce; and Harbin sausage. A specialty of northern China, Harbin sausage immigrated there from Eastern Europe. Pink and dense with smoked pork and fat, it is deeply reminiscent of kielbasa. It’s right at home in the East Village.","Harbin sausage; spicy and sour cucumbers in garlic sauce; skewered chives; boiled crayfish; boiled lobster; boiled snow crab; spicy wok-fried clams. $1.50 to $3.50; cold appetizers, $4.95 to $12.95; boiled seafood, $15 and up."
33,Gem,2 star,"Aug. 7, 2018",Pete Wells,Lower East Side,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/dining/gem-review-flynn-mcgarry.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/dining/gem-review-flynn-mcgarry.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Flynn McGarry arrived in New York three years ago as the chef of a pop-up restaurant, Eureka. He was 16 at the time, but he’d been charging money for tasting menus since he was 13, running an early version of Eureka in his mother’s house in the San Fernando Valley in California. Earlier this year he opened a restaurant on the Lower East Side that is meant to be permanent, or as permanent as any business venture in Manhattan can be. This one is called Gem, which if nothing else proves he’s better at choosing names now that he’s 19. I haven’t yet seen the new documentary about him, “Chef Flynn,” but over the past six years my media diet has not been lacking in news about Mr. McGarry’s productive adolescent years. I first learned about him from a brief New Yorker piece written when he was 13, by which time he had made many of the recipes in “The French Laundry Cookbook” and cooked for a week at Eleven Madison Park. He was working several days a week in a Los Angeles restaurant and had apprenticed at Next and Alinea by 15, when he was the subject of a Times Magazine article. When he moved himself and his pop-up to New York at 16, I read that his cooking was influenced by his time in the kitchens of Maaemo in Norway and Geranium in Denmark. Still, as I walked into Gem the first time I was wondering, at some level, whether everyone had been too polite to tell him that his brownies needed more time in the oven. Of course, it would be nice to have the answer to that before you buy advance tickets for the eight- to 12-course meal at $155 a person, the only way to reserve a seat. But it doesn’t take more than a few minutes at Gem to see that the adults weren’t just humoring Mr. McGarry. His cooking is nuanced, his plating is often lyrical and the flavors, at least this spring and summer, have been delicate, subtle and very fresh. The vegetables and fruits he uses in profusion look and taste as if they had dropped off the vine right on to the hand-spun, earth-toned ceramic dishes. My favorite Gem dish so far, delicate and self-assured, was a morsel or two of grilled king crab legs lightly glazed with rose petal miso and set beside soft chamomile-scented potatoes for ballast, red currants for zing and some fluttering rose petals on top for the heck of it. A close rival was the chilled bowl of barely vinegared mackerel interwoven with grilled cucumbers, sliced plums and salty red dabs of mashed fermented plums. The harmonies were right on key, with a Japanese mood that didn’t cross the line into outright imitation. White asparagus, an ingredient that seems to flummox some American kitchens, was subjected to a wonderful treatment, patiently browned and basted in butter, then finished with a reduced chicken jus that had a glimmer of vadouvan in it somewhere. Strewing the plate with tender, pale-green pine needles seemed like an affectation at first, but their flavor lifted and brightened the whole package. Mr. McGarry does fine work with deeper flavors, too. Each menu crescendos in a complicated, multicomponent spread, and the best of these featured lamb: barbecue ribs rubbed with cracked coriander seeds and XO sauce, plus a skewered grilled lamb kebab and a tomato salad. Another night built up to an exhibition of squab. A leg, perfectly cooked and sweetened by a maple jus, was very good, but the high point was a very thin and hearty rye cracker spread with squab liver, cherries and pickled ramps; the fruit’s bright notes were played off against earthier ones so skillfully they almost shimmered. Back in the family home, and at the Eureka pop-up, Mr. McGarry used to make everything himself. Now he works alongside two cooks, bringing the kitchen team at Gem to the same size as that of my neighborhood slice joint. Some small defeats could be attributed to Mr. McGarry’s lack of experience with weather patterns in the Northeast. A warm beet, languorously braised in smoked beet juice until it is soft and sticky like salt water taffy and then basted with a beet-based bordelaise sauce, was impressive in June. In July’s heat wave it was as welcome as a space heater. And maybe he wouldn’t have served starchy grilled peas if he’d known how quickly the summer sun can make them tough. By the way, Mr. McGarry doesn’t make brownies, at least not at Gem. Dessert after each of my three meals was more or less the same thing: bowls of ripe berries, served one night with whipped cream infused with chamomile and rose hips and another time with bay leaf and bee-pollen ice creams. You couldn’t ask for a more refreshing course on a hot summer night, but at the same time it’s clear that he has room to grow as a pastry chef. Dessert is served on low coffee tables in a loungey space called the Living Room, which by day doubles as a cafe selling pastries and sandwiches on housemade bread. Rousting diners from their tables in the dining room (called, aptly enough, the Dining Room), probably seemed like a good idea on paper, but in reality it’s a bit silly. It’s one of several hiccups that keep a meal at Gem from gliding smoothly along. Servers may shoot their cuffs before fiddling with some small detail of the table setting, a fussiness that is not in keeping with the graceful, relaxed tone of the cooking. Wine glasses could sit empty for long stretches and the wines themselves, both whites and reds, were almost always too warm. That Mr. Flynn is more polished as a chef than a restaurateur is understandable. He may need a more experienced partner to straighten out the dining room, and to help him edit the menus, too. With each meal, I had the sense there were at least two superfluous courses, and occasionally Mr. McGarry seems to be straining as he reaches for the sort of razzle-dazzle you’d get at Alinea or Eleven Madison Park. An elaborate lobster course one night looked amazing, but wasn’t. An attempt at eggplant carnitas, with an underseasoned salsa of green strawberries and a charred, papery tortilla, was enough to make you wish Mr. McGarry had eaten more tacos before he left California. At times Mr. McGarry seems like a creative-writing student who fills his pages with footnotes because David Foster Wallace did it. It’s too bad that he came of age in an era when many people believe that tasting menus are the highest form of kitchen artistry. Like the style of “Infinite Jest,” those menus have to be the result of ideas that can’t be contained any other way; they’re not a blank space to be filled in. Mr. McGarry obviously learned a lot from his mentors, but he can cook in his own voice now, and it may be time to leave his idols behind.

34,Coco Pazzo Trattoria,1 star,"July 31, 2018",Pete Wells,SoHo,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/dining/coco-pazzo-trattoria-yves-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/dining/coco-pazzo-trattoria-yves-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Coco Pazzo is back. Those of you who did not eat out in Manhattan in the 1990s have no idea what I’m talking about. Those who did may now be having flashbacks to a rustic-chic Tuscan-esque restaurant, Coco Pazzo, which got a three-star Times review from Marian Burros in 1991, and to its three New York siblings, all long gone. A restaurateur’s name may be emerging from the mists of time — the name is Pino Luongo — and linked to it, the names of other vanished restaurants, Le Madri, Mad. 61, Amarcord and Tuscan Square. For readers of tabloid gossip columns, images of pasta-twirling models and executives in Armani suits may be coming into focus, along with bold-face-laden squibs about the social scenes at Mr. Luongo’s establishments in Wainscott, N.Y., and on St. Barts. If you have trouble believing that spaghetti and fettuccine once attracted what The Times critic Bryan Miller, reviewing Le Madri in 1989, called “the hugs-and-kisses-I-love-your-hat-Ciao-baby crowd,” it may be useful to remember that this was an era when pasta was commonly thought to be a health food. Nobody has seen the Ciao-baby crowd in a while. (We’ll have to send out a search party if it’s not back in 10 more years.) So far that is not who goes to Coco Pazzo Trattoria, which is shaping up to be a reliable and fairly priced neighborhood canteen on the SoHo corner that used to house a deliberately unstylish bar called Milady’s. On balance, Mr. Luongo’s version of Tuscan food retrofitted for American appetites may be easier to see for what it is now that it has lost its fashionable gloss. (He is the executive chef; Pedro Cruz is his chef de cuisine.) When you order pappa al pomodoro and taste the juicy olive oil that slicks the warm, basil-flecked, bread-thickened tomato pulp, you’re not earning bragging rights. You’re eating soup, and a very good one. Nobody will think you’re a culinary trailblazer if you get the cacciucco, either, but you can console yourself with the tender shrimp, scallops, cod and clams in the faintly spicy and fennel-scented broth. There are two ways to approach dinner at Coco Pazzo Trattoria. (By day the place is a casual outfit called Coco Pazzo Kitchen.) One is to order what Mr. Luongo calls a piatto unico, a helping of pasta next to a related something-extra on one rectangular plate. Baked littlenecks wobble next to a twirl of linguine and, nice surprise here, ribbons of zucchini soaking in a fine white clam sauce that is made with just the firm, sweet bits. Soft chicken-and-ricotta polpettine sit next to rigatoni in sugo, not on top, so you can have pasta first and meatballs second and tell yourself you’re eating like a real Italian. Alternatively, you might go with the main courses marked “Per La Tavola.” For once these plates really are meant for sharing: a substantial stack of spiced and roasted baby-back ribs under a warm slaw of cucumbers and tomatoes, or a spread of grilled rib-eye slices served with a separate plate of “Tuscan fries,” distinguishable from the regular kind by their fried rosemary needles. Those fries may be awesomely browned one week but ghostly and uncrisp the next. The tagliolini cooked in the cacciucco broth as a second course after all the seafood has been eaten might be 60 seconds away from being al dente. I am not enthusiastic about the slightly tough squid in moist bread crumbs, baked rather than fried, although the dish has a following at Mr. Luongo’s other restaurant, Morso, next to the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge. The soufflés that the servers try to sell halfway through the meal can be a little soupy. But the blueberry crostata is a genuine pleasure, its crust likably sweet and tender. And you’ll appreciate the clean, bright flavors of a shot of Aperol dumped over grapefruit granita if, like me, you veer off-script and follow your piatto unico with a couple of main courses. SPEAKING OF laid-back restaurants where you can enjoy a pleasant and unpretentious summer meal, have you been to Yves? It opened without much of a splash about two years ago, despite occupying a handsome, spare dining room whose white interior makes the most of the afternoon sunlight that hits its TriBeCa corner, opposite the restaurant Locanda Verde. I missed the original chef’s tenure, but lately I’ve been intrigued by the cooking of Alex Baker, who took over in February. She is Paris-trained, having gone to culinary school and worked at Spring and Le Chateaubriand there, before coming to New York to help open Rebelle in 2015. At Yves, she interprets French food with an appealingly relaxed, seasonal attitude. In early June she brought little bright-green favas and sticks of asparagus together with fresh-herb pappardelle, and if you’re wondering what makes that French, the answer is a pistou loaded with tarragon and chervil. There was also a reassuringly gentle navarin of lamb, with a small spring garden in addition to the customary carrots and potatoes: grilled baby leeks and asparagus stalks, and tender chard stems. Pan-fried steelhead trout is on the menu now, with a smooth, pale-green sauce of cucumbers, melons and avocados pooling beneath a jumble of warm young cucumbers. So is a side dish of recently picked pole beans and string beans charred on the grill and dressed with toasted-almond vinaigrette. As interpreted by Ms. Baker, mussels Provençal are not the usual mound of black shells in thin pink liquid with a few slices of baguette; the shells are gone, the mussels are good fat ones and their sauce is more concentrated, augmented with tomato paste and roasted cherry tomatoes and garnished with thick-crusted cubes of toasted bread. The snails are more traditional, parsley-garlic butter sloshing around in their shells. If these land snails wondered what they were doing on a bed of seaweed, they didn’t show it. There is some unevenness in the kitchen to be worked out. The fluke meunière may be sautéed to a textbook golden crackle, or it could arrive looking as pale as a fish belly. The country ham sandwich could use bread that’s easier to chew than the crust-armored baguettes from Bien Cuit. The restaurant is large, and service tends to arrive in rapid bursts separated by long pauses. The wine list is very lopsided in favor of three-figure bottles, an irritating move for a fairly casual spot. But Ms. Baker seems to be making the best of it. It’s hard to be cross with a restaurant that makes its own boursin and brings it out in a dish so big I could never manage to finish it, even with a stack of toasted baguette to smear it on.","Pappa al pomodoro; sautéed littleneck clams; grilled sardines; linguine alle vongole; bucatini e sarde; rigatoni e polpettine; lasagna alla Bolognese; tagliata di manzo; rosticciana; cacciucco; blueberry tart.

35,The Bar at Momofuku Ko,2 star,"July 24, 2018",Pete Wells,East Village,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/dining/momofuku-ko-bar-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/dining/momofuku-ko-bar-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"There isn’t another bar in the city like the one that opened in February as part of the redesign of David Chang’s Momofuku Ko. One thing that sets it apart is that it doesn’t have a name. Credit-card receipts call it “Momofuku Ko,” even though it operates in its own little room with its own entrance. The door, a few steps past Ko’s along the East Village alley known as Extra Place, is marked “Ko.” The menus don’t give a name at all. They don’t look much like menus, either. They’re notebooks in which the items available, presented in a short à la carte list (in contrast to the hourslong tastings offered for $255 at Ko), are handwritten on a fresh page each day, by different employees using different pens. The date is at the top over a list of dishes that you will not find together anywhere else. Lately there has been a lucid, refreshing plate of raw sea scallops, sliced cold and mixed with fresh green shiso and folds of pineapple, red with ground chiles. Lightly cured fillets of sardine made a thrilling appearance last month in a brick-red oil flavored with paprika, cayenne, and other components of tandoori paste. Both were solidly in the tradition of Momofuku small plates that the world has known since Mr. Chang’s Ssam Bar began remixing various Asian ideas after-hours. Both were wonderful. The savory pie stuffed with fresh-made pork sausage patties comes from another place entirely. You could tour the city’s proudest French restaurants without coming across a more skillfully done puff pastry crust, notched like a pinwheel and baked to a deep mahogany. The pie costs $45 and typically serves two, sliced into half-moons. It is plated with a reduction sauce, as classical and French as it gets but with an insistent vein of acidity that somehow makes it modern. Even if you’re used to the signature Momofuku move of white-knuckle bungee jumping from the high end to the low, certain juxtapositions may call for Dramamine. Alongside the masterly pork pie, you can find a $5 sandwich of pickled daikon and cucumber sticks inside a grilled and buttered Martin’s hot dog roll. The pickle sandwich is just the thing to eat with the cold fried chicken that is battered three times, fried four times, brushed with a spicy mirin-yuzu glaze and served nearly at refrigerator temperature. I don’t believe I’ve used that phrase approvingly in a review before, but then I don’t think a restaurant has served me cold fried chicken as good as this before. By flipping through the menu pages you can pinpoint the dates when dishes were first served, and see others that came and went. The idea is for Ko’s executive chef, Sean Gray, to use the bar as a “field for research and development for our culinary team,” according to the website. Ideas are auditioned or refined before they graduate to Ko, which I gave three stars in a 2015 review. Most menus, at least the ones that change over time, are works in progress, but few make that explicit the way the one at Ko’s bar does. The cynical way to look at this is that bar customers are paying to serve as lab rats. This will not be everyone’s idea of a fun night out. One recent evening, the menu was as meat-heavy as at Ssam Bar in the era when its menus still proclaimed, “We do not serve vegetarian-friendly items.” Among the more substantial dishes that night was a mixed-meat sausage stuffed into a chicken neck and grilled. One end of the neck was open. The other was still attached to the chicken’s head. It was a sensational sausage, but it did nothing to make Ko’s bar the kind of place that you’d take your new pescatarian friend. The bar, run collaboratively by Mr. Gray and Su Wong Ruiz, the general manager, works best for diners who don’t need a multitude of choices to be happy. To the extent that it resembles other places, it’s probably most similar to a wine bar, with its tight menu, its casual drop-in-and-stay-awhile air and its carefully considered list of wines by the glass, which it shares with Ko. Anyone who wants a whole bottle can order one from the full Ko list, a virtual who’s who of cult winemakers in certain specialties such as grower Champagne, chenin blanc from the Loire Valley and Burgundy of all stripes. On the notebook page facing the handwritten menu are two more wines that Ambrose Chiang, the beverage director, is pouring by the glass for one day only. Recently I’ve lucked into a precisely shaped Côte-Rôtie from Domaine Jasmin and a Saumur from Romain Guiberteau whose self-assurance I envied. These specials can cost twice as much as the regular by-the-glass pours, which tend to fall between $15 and $25. I can’t figure out why the wine-geek crowd doesn’t bring tents and sleeping bags to camp out at Ko’s bar. And I don’t understand why the place is almost never crowded, despite getting a fair amount of press after it opened. The experimental nature of the menu can’t be keeping people away; people expect that from Momofuku restaurants. The only dish that I thought wasn’t totally successful was the fried zucchini made in the style of the fried chicken, and I was still glad I tried it. The prices are all over the place, but a meal here doesn’t need to be expensive. While you are welcome to spend $100 on a sourdough crepe with 50 grams of white-sturgeon caviar, you can just get the crepe alone for $8. It is excellent: shiny with tangy cave-age butter, speckled with oregano cinders and crunchy from a pass over hot Japanese charcoal. The chicken, meanwhile, is $7 a piece. The only reason I can think of for the empty seats is that the place is so hard to sum up.

36,Una Pizza Napoletana,1 star,"July 17, 2018",Pete Wells,Lower East Side,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/dining/una-pizza-napoletana-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/dining/una-pizza-napoletana-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Until the new Una Pizza Napoletana came along, I didn’t think it was possible for a restaurant to fight itself to a draw. In name at least, this is the fourth incarnation of the pizzeria that Anthony Mangieri founded in 1996 in Point Pleasant Beach, N.J. He has never run more than one Una Pizza Napoletana at a time; each time he moves to a new location, he closes the old one. In the East Village (2004-9) and San Francisco (2010-17), he essentially stuck to the routine he had established in New Jersey. At the two-month-old location on the Lower East Side, though, he is in business with two chefs, Jeremiah Stone and Fabián von Hauske Valtierra, whose sensibilities are wildly different from his own. Their two other restaurants, Wildair and Contra, are very contemporary and European in outlook. A meal at either one makes it obvious that Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have carefully studied Copenhagen’s foremost exponents of fermentation and foraging. Nothing about Mr. Mangieri’s rigorously traditional pizza indicates that he could find Copenhagen on a map. The three of them do have common traits. They take their cooking extremely seriously, favor simplicity and aren’t interested in easy ways out. So their collaboration — Mr. Mangieri is the pizza guy, of course, while his new partners handle appetizers, desserts and drinks — might not be doomed, but it isn’t exactly off to a promising start. The problem isn’t the common one of strengths in one area undermined by bad performance in others. Una Pizza Napoletana is almost all strengths, but they’re at war with one another. Mr. Mangieri is a purist’s purist. His dough runs on wild yeast. For each batch, he mixes a lump of starter into Sicilian sea salt, finely ground Italian flour and water. With this he makes a crust that is delicious on its own, a minimum requirement for great pizza. He makes pies in only one size, a wheel about 12 inches across. There are five on the menu most nights. None are topped with more than four ingredients, or six if you count oil and salt. On Friday and Saturday nights a sixth, more complicated pizza is offered. Requests for substitutions or added toppings are not entertained on any night. There is no point asking Mr. Mangieri to put pepperoni on a margherita or Buffalo chicken and blue cheese on a marinara. You would have better luck persuading the driver of the M5 bus to pop a wheelie on Fifth Avenue. The pies are at least as extraordinary as the ones he used to make in the East Village. They may be better. I don’t remember the imported buffalo mozzarella’s giving the pies the flavor of melted cultured butter back then, the way it does now. And did the tomato sauce — pulp, really — always have the same natural, sun-ripened sweetness? Especially on the marinara, unobscured by cheese and seasoned only with dried oregano, fresh basil and raw garlic, it’s almost hypnotic. The Concetta pie, which has four varieties of tomato treated four separate ways, probably would have been beyond his abilities as a chef in the Jersey Shore days. He makes it only on Fridays, which is too bad, because it’s great. The everyday pie called the Filetti, made with buffalo mozzarella and ripe red cherry tomatoes, manages to be surprising while sticking to Mr. Mangieri’s strict principles. It’s a personal creed that achieves transcendence — his “My Way,” to put it in New Jersey terms. I ate one non-transcendent pie at the new Una Pizza Napoletana, a Bianco, which is topped with buffalo mozzarella, raw garlic and basil. It was excellent the next time I had it, and I immediately knew what had been missing: salt. All the pies are $25. That is a lot for pizza. On the other hand, it is only about $2.50 more than what Mr. Mangieri charged when he first came to Manhattan in 2004, once you adjust for inflation. Then again, people said he charged a lot for pizza in 2004. Mr. Mangieri and his wood-fueled oven are located at the back of the dining room, enclosed by glass on three sides. No doubt this helps keep the wood fire from wilting the customers like basil leaves, but it’s hard not to see it as a metaphor for the restaurant. Mr. Mangieri’s pizzas leave the glass box, but his sensibility doesn’t. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have put their own point of view on everything else, and it’s not the point of view of a pizzeria. Everybody knows how to eat in a pizzeria; most of us have been doing it since we were kids. The choices are few and relatively predictable. Even when the pizzas are topped with weird stuff, you basically know what you’re getting. At the new Una Pizza Napoletana, only the pizzas are predictable. What are bland chunks of white asparagus under a yellow powder of cured egg yolk and bottarga doing here? Not making new friends, I promise you. There’s a fine, tender panna cotta with fresh fruit for dessert. One night the strawberry syrup spooned over it was essentially strawberry vinegar; on another night, its sweet-sour ratio was back in alignment. The other desserts I tried — a bittersweet tiramisù with a welcome crackle of caramel hidden in its layers, and some pure-tasting, impossibly smooth, eggless ice creams, including a pistachio flavor that has to be tasted to be believed — won me over from the beginning. None of the other appetizers were as charmless as the white asparagus. A freshly shucked sea scallop seasoned with translucent strips of lemon peel and individual dots of couscous was exceptional. And raw lobster surrounded by chickpeas was wonderfully jittery with an Italian citrus-chile paste. But the chefs serve it in a form — a chopped mass of unidentifiable goo — that can’t help but look off-putting. That dish would fit right in at Wildair; here, among the tomatoes and mozzarella, it seems to be trying too hard. The same goes for the wine list. As they have done in their other places, Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske focus on natural wines. These wines can be mercurial, and the way the list is written only adds to the confusion. Almost no varietals are named, and you can’t tell much from the Italian regions, which include such major hubs as Irpinia and Solicchiata. When, helplessly, you accept a server’s offer of assistance, you’ll be asked what you intend to eat with your wine. Are there any people other than sommeliers who want to talk at length about pairing particular wines with particular pizzas? I’ve never met them and if I do, I’m sending them off to be deprogrammed. Discussing the list, tasting a few samples, trying to find something that fits your idea of a good pizza wine (yes, for some reason there are wines on the brief list that don’t taste especially good with any pizza) — all this slows down the pace, which isn’t especially brisk to begin with. By the end of the night, your meal can last twice as long and cost twice as much as it would at almost any other pizzeria in town. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske aren’t doing bad stuff at Una Pizza Napoletana, but often they’re doing the wrong stuff. They and Mr. Mangieri have taken one of the most accessible styles of restaurant dining and made it complicated and a little intimidating. Una Pizza Napoletana doesn’t need to be predictable.

37,Frenchette,3 star,"July 10, 2018",Pete Wells,TriBeCa,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/dining/frenchette-review-restaurant-tribeca.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/dining/frenchette-review-restaurant-tribeca.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson named their new restaurant after a David Johansen song from 1978, “Frenchette.” The first line is, “You call that love in French, but it’s just Frenchette,” and later when he rhymes that with “naturalette” and “leatherette” you know the suffix isn’t diminutive, it’s dismissive. The song is about what you do once you figure out that you’re not going to get the real thing, and Mr. Johansen’s answer is simple enough. “Let’s just dance,” he sings. Never mind love. Frenchette, which opened in TriBeCa in April, isn’t fake French, but it isn’t the real thing, either. Since 1997, when Keith McNally hired them as the opening chefs at Balthazar, Mr. Nasr and Mr. Hanson have cooked side by side, building a kind of brasserie-steakhouse hybrid out of standards from both genres. Mr. McNally kept loading them up with new restaurants, giving them joint command of Pastis, Schiller’s Liquor Bar and Minetta Tavern, none of which could really be called chef-driven. Frenchette, their own place and their first without Mr. McNally, takes some liberties with the formula, but not enough to get them recognized as visionaries on the level of Pierre Gagnaire. Frenchette says: Never mind art, let’s just cook. The restaurant is divided into two chambers. In front and on display to the street is a lounge with Art Deco curves, where bartenders percussively clack shakers behind a long river of zinc. If you have a seat, this room is the height of metropolitan civility. If you are waiting for one, as many people are on any given night, it’s purgatorial. The dining room is in back, behind a pair of arches and up a step so slight that its only conceivable purpose is to raise the insurance premiums; every time I approached it a worried server materialized to tell me to look out. The small tables are too small and the big ones, encircled by red-leather banquettes the size of living-room sofas, give you enough space to spread out a map while you eat. The room is grandly scaled and conspicuously underdesigned, a simplification of the brasserie archetype that doesn’t try to reproduce every chipped tile and nicotine stain. It’s a room for people who have outgrown illusions. That must describe half the people in New York, judging by the number of times I’ve been asked how to get a reservation at Frenchette at an hour when an adult might reasonably be in the mood for dinner. Even well-placed magazine editors with highly resourceful assistants can end up eating at 6 or 10 p.m., as I did. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] In the brasserie mode, the menu rambles. It goes on too long; not everything on it is worth rambling about. But once you sort it out, it’s full of dishes worth planning a night around. Some of them don’t look wildly impressive unless you know how they’re made. For each order of brouillade, a pan of eggs has to be stirred constantly over a small flame for a long time, until they look like grits. (There’s a reason you don’t see brouillade on many menus.) Dropped on top are a few excellent snails in parsley and garlic, a buttery garnish for very buttery scrambled eggs. Calf’s liver was sweet and custardy, the goal in cooking it, and one that’s not often reached. Sweetbreads with creamy white insides were fried to a pale, crinkled gold, then served with a brown, French, lovely and anachronistic sauce made from veal jus and crayfish. Lobster was roasted on a rotisserie, sending some of the shell’s flavor into the meat, which was then given a very luxurious bath in curry butter. The entire roast chicken is juicy without tasting of brine, a rare thing these days. Hidden under the drumsticks and thighs are rafts of baguette that sat under the rotisserie, imbibing every drop that fell from the bird. Some diners might say bread wet with drippings is too homespun for a dish that costs $68. They don’t know what they’re talking about. The menu is full of things that take years of practice to get right. Duck breast with a side of fries sounds ridiculously simple, but look at the crackle on that duck skin, and listen to that echoing crunch on the fries. If these chefs learned anything from Mr. McNally, it’s that people will overlook many lapses if you feed them great French fries. At Frenchette, they overlook the peculiar steak knife brought out with the duck; its sharp side is straight and its dull side is curved, and everybody who picks one up makes a joke about slicing open a finger. That would be one way to turn tables faster, but I never saw any casualties. The kitchen is at its most sure-footed with big pieces of animals, whether they’re classed as appetizers or main courses. (The guinea hen terrine appetizer is a chunky pink brick that could serve as dinner.) All those meats, combined with the chefs’ fondness for fat-enhanced sauces that cling to your lips, give the menu a wintry feel, something that the recent proliferation of peas and artichokes on the plates here doesn’t quite hide. So far, Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr have responded to the hot weather by changing ingredients but not the menu’s spirit. Green celtuce stems can be a nice crisp side dish for summer, but Frenchette serves them in a steaming-hot gratin, slick with bone marrow; it’s perfect for January. The blood sausage slab on top of a buckwheat galette that surfaced at the end of June was as seasonal as earmuffs. Reversing the natural order of the universe, the appetizers and the smaller “amuses” often seem more tentative than the main courses. Blowfish tails brushed with mustard and spice-bearing bread crumbs are terrific when they’re available, and the chefs should get some kind of award from the French government for serving iced oysters Burgundy-style, with peppery finger-length chipolata sausages. But gumball-size smoked eel beignets with a crème-fraîche ranch dressing called “Franchette” didn’t taste much like eel; pig-foot croquettes were a washout; and a bowl of oily whole-wheat spaghetti with bottarga needed to be slapped with more lemon and salt. With desserts, Frenchette tries the blunt approach that works so well for its main courses, and comes up short. Not very short, but enough to make you wish more attention were being paid. The mille-feuille doesn’t shatter on impact like the ones at Le Coq Rico or Benoit, and the pastry crust under the long band of cooked fruit in the apple tart needs to be crisper or more buttery. One of the more clever moves Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr made is hiring Jorge Riera to shepherd a list of natural, biodynamic and organic wines. Not every sommelier who has become infatuated with these labels knows where to find the good stuff, but he does. This means, though, that you will probably not end up drinking what you thought you wanted to drink. There are few safe harbors of familiarity; even if you just want sparkling water, you have a choice of Vichy Catalan or Mondariz. You’d have to be delusional to wager money on the longevity of a restaurant in New York, but Frenchette is the closest thing to a safe bet that I’ve seen in years. Mr. Nasr and Mr. Hanson seem to be in it for the long haul; if one of them hasn’t held the other’s head down in a pot of French onion soup by now, it’s probably never going to happen. More than that, they know how to flatter New Yorkers with food that doesn’t scream for attention but that smiles back when you notice it.

38,Restaurant Nippon,1 star,"July 3, 2018",Pete Wells,Midtown,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/dining/restaurant-nippon-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/dining/restaurant-nippon-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Remember sukiyaki? The details were hazy in my mind until a few weeks ago, when a woman sheathed in a kimono carried a pot of it to my table at Restaurant Nippon on East 52nd Street. There it was: the onions, shiitake caps, bok choi stems, tofu blocks and the frizzy mop of noodles under a cloud of steam. The thin slices of beef going from red to pale pink. The hot broth that is based on soy and mirin but that strangely, magically tastes like French onion soup. The raw egg that, thanks to some long-forgotten cook’s flash of greatness, serves as a dipping sauce. This refresher course would have been unnecessary if I’d made myself a regular at Nippon years ago. The restaurant opened in August 1963, a few doors west of its current address, and has offered sukiyaki since the beginning. That summer radios across the country were playing “Sukiyaki,” Kyu Sakamoto’s oblique protest song that sounded like a love song but was, in the United States, renamed after beef stew for the simple reason that it was one of the few Japanese words almost all Americans knew. The dish was that popular. For modern New Yorkers who chase Japanese thrills at Shuko, Uchu, Tetsu and other restaurants that look and act like cocktail bars, Restaurant Nippon might seem anachronistic — Kyu Sakamoto in a Cardi B world. Over the years, though, it has served as an unofficial cultural ambassador, using its dining room and its menu to make a case for the Japanese way. The restaurant is designed in the shoin style of a traditional Japanese house. Surrounding a main dining room with Western tables and chairs are the private zashiki rooms where shoes are left outside, floors are hidden under tatami mats and servers materialize at the sliding doors with the push of a button. Many details, like the wallpaper that evokes the opulently stylized folding screens painted by Ogata Korin, are lovely. A few, like the drop ceilings, could use attention. Nippon introduced or championed so many dishes that today the menu preserves the recent history of Japanese food in the United States, the way the rocks of certain canyons in the West record the history of the prehistoric world. Tora fugu, the potentially toxic tiger puffer fish, made its first regular appearance outside Japan at Nippon in 1989, when the owner, Noboyushi Kuraoka, finally prevailed in his yearslong campaign lobbying the Japanese and American governments to allow importation of the fish. Mr. Kuraoka died in January; now the restaurant is in the hands of Yasuhiro Makoshi, the manager for more than 40 years, and Akira Azuma, who has been the chef for almost that long, and it probably remains the best place in town to try fugu. As sashimi, fanned out in transparently thin slices, it is lean and very firm, like fluke but slightly richer. Nippon sends it out with chives and a spicy daikon mash, which complement its quiet flavor, and cooked fragments of fugu, which don’t. The least expensive serving, what is called a “half portion” for $70, is just big enough to give four people a couple of bites each. If I were going to spend money on fugu again, though, I would make a beeline for the sperm sacs, or shirako. Barely broiled, either plain with salt crystals or brushed with a miso glaze, Nippon’s shirako is as smooth and thick as fudge, with a flavor that recalls buttered crab meat, among other things. Many firsts have been claimed by or on behalf of Nippon. Some of them may be true. Did it have the first sushi counter in New York? I am not convinced. In a 1963 Times review, Craig Claiborne wrote that Nippon had a tempura counter where sushi, “the traditional service of raw fish,” was also available. Today the sushi is respectable, if not on its own a reason to visit. Is it a fact that no other New York restaurant was making soba noodles in 1988, when Nippon began to do so? Certainly few places have gone to the same lengths in pursuit of soba as Nippon, which imported not just buckwheat seeds but also a buckwheat farmer from Japan, and planted both in a field outside Montreal. (For years the farm also supplied a sister restaurant, Soba Nippon, now closed.) Restaurant Nippon’s soba noodles are nutty, bouncy, springy, slightly rough and very good. I like them chilled, dunked in ponzu. Against my better judgment I even like the odd, Americanized soba salads, with a pile of noodles and meat or tofu on a platter with a fistful of lettuce. The custom-farmed buckwheat also goes into an astoundingly good thing called soba miso that comes smeared on a small wooden paddle. A black sludge of fermented buckwheat studded with buckwheat kernels, it looks like brownie batter and tastes a little like chocolate, too, as well as roasted nuts and espresso and cooked mushrooms. Whether negimaki was invented at Nippon or simply made its first United States appearance there, it’s hard to see why tough beef wrapped around undercooked scallions captured America’s imagination. More intriguing is another original, beef oroshi, essentially shabu shabu except that it is cooked offstage and you get nothing but meat and broth with some spicy grated daikon. This is also the birthplace of agedashi mozzarella. If you have ever wondered what fried cheese in dashi would taste like, you will find the answer here. The backbone of the menu, though, is traditional Japanese food, nearly all of it good and some of it better than that. There is fluke for those who won’t pay up for fugu, and it is just what you’d want it to be. Broiled eel over rice makes a wonderfully soothing meal. The kamonabe is a duck hot pot cooked over a burner set on the table. The duck may not be entirely tender, but it is flavorful. The broth is a symphony. For scale, theatricality and deeply reassuring flavor, its only rival is the sukiyaki, but the kamonabe comes with a dividend: a bowl of rice cooked in the leftover broth as a second course.

39,The Islands,1 star,"June 26, 2018",Pete Wells,Crown Heights,Caribbean,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/dining/the-islands-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/dining/the-islands-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The Islands used to be a two-story restaurant on the Crown Heights side of Washington Avenue in Brooklyn, near the top of the hill, within sight of the Brooklyn Museum. Upstairs was a cramped, angular, shadowy dining room with a few tables under a ceiling so low it made tall people stoop. Downstairs was a cramped, angular, shadowy kitchen where oxtails, goat curry and other Jamaican dishes were cooked and sold. To the right of the door, behind a counter, was the restaurant’s single stove. It had three burners that were almost always going. No matter when I went there it seemed that about a quarter of the things on the menu had not finished cooking, but complaining would have been cloddish, both because the limitations on capacity were obvious and because whatever was finished was bound to be both nuanced and powerful. The whole operation was one of those precarious marvels of adaptive survival, like a pine growing from a crack in the side of a cliff. So the outlook was grim when news came two summers ago that the structures housing the Islands and another business were being torn down so a new apartment building could be constructed. This neighborhood and the ones to the south between Flatbush and Ralph Avenues owe much of their character to black- and immigrant-owned businesses, including a large swath of Caribbean restaurants such as the Islands. With developers sniffing at this part of Brooklyn, many of them are at risk. Marilyn Reid, who owns the Islands with Shuon Letchford, had other ideas. She had had other ideas since 2001, when she opened the restaurant. “We were always looking because we had outgrown it by the second day,” she said in a phone interview. “We knew.” Before closing the original space in March 2017, she and Ms. Letchford had found a much bigger one downhill on Washington Avenue. Preparing it took a few months more than she had hoped, but the second incarnation of the Islands has been up and running since January. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The new kitchen has two stoves and 10 burners. Nevertheless, what’s available when I’ve gone has always been several dishes shy of the complete menu. The stewed okra with cod is especially hard to pin down. At the same time, the comfort of the bigger dining room and the table service, an impossibility in the first space, have encouraged me to branch out beyond my usual favorites. The Islands is best known for long-simmered stews but the kitchen also knows a thing or two about frying. The flattened fritters of salt cod seasoned with fresh hot chiles, known as stamp and go, were crunchy and golden. Some Caribbean cooks deep-fry fish escovitch to oblivion, on the theory that spicy vinegar heals all wounds. The escovitch I had at the Islands was a whole red snapper, obviously fresh and fried just until firm. The vinegar dressing, meanwhile, was seasoned with not just hot chiles but pickled bell peppers, carrots and cucumbers, making this escovitch more interesting than usual. From the old days, I knew the curried goat would be very tender and richly seasoned, although like most of the cooking at the Islands, it was never scalp-piercingly spicy. Now I’ve found a new standby in the curried vegetables — a very different thing, of course, but the golden raisins, turmeric and allspice may do even more for cabbage and carrots than they do for goat meat. Barbecue chicken was ordered in a rush verging on panic because whatever I’d first wanted wasn’t ready yet. The sauce is nothing like the ketchup-based sludge I’d imagined. Made with raisins and allspice, it tastes more like a glaze for a holiday ham, and it’s lovely. I prefer it to the jerk chicken, which will sound like heresy to some customers. Like barbecue, jerk can describe either a sauce or a process, and the process needs to involve wood smoke. The Islands bakes its jerk chicken in the oven, and while I like its sauce, when I want jerk chicken I will cross Eastern Parkway and keep the windows down until I smell burning allspice logs. But I have no quarrel with the jerk shrimp or leg of lamb at the Islands — there’s no place to get an allspice-smoked version of either, as far as I know. The lamb is especially alluring, stuffed with jerk spices and slowly roasted until its outer crust falls, upon slicing, into a dark rubble that in New Orleans would be called debris. Rice and peas, fried plantains and stewed cabbage, slippery with coconut oil, are all mandatory in my book. Others insist on baked macaroni and cheese, served in a brick the size of a pound of butter. When I taste the bread crumbs on top, and wonder if they’ve been seasoned with dried onions, I think those people may have a point. All of this food is brought to the table on oval platters that could hold a small Thanksgiving turkey. Since opening in January, the new dining room has been embellished bit by bit. The walls are painted in watermelon and aquamarine. Small hurricane lamps decorate the tables. A couple of weeks ago, plaid cloth napkins made their debut in the middle of dinner service. Menus, which used to be kept inside a clear plastic sheath, are now presented inside folders made of textured handmade paper, held in place with stickers of bumblebees and butterflies. The bar, across the dining room from the kitchen, is still unoccupied while Ms. Reid waits for a liquor license to come through. A rumored roof deck has not materialized, either. In the meantime there is an excellent limeade sweetened with demerara sugar and a dark purple, fruity sorrel punch, which can give the impression it has been lightly spiked with rum. Credit for the food at the Islands is shared. There are two chefs, Delroy Henry and Ronald Porter. Most of the recipes, though, are Ms. Letchford’s, and she does a lot of the cooking. Like Ms. Reid, all of them were raised in Jamaica before moving to New York, but only Ms. Letchford did any professional cooking there. Ms. Reid is often in the kitchen too. “I do the light stuff,” she said. “I tend to stay with salads, seafood.” Is the food as good as before? I used to be impressed that anything at all could be cooked at the old Islands. That so much of it was actively delicious seemed like a miracle. It’s less astonishing now that the kitchen has 10 burners and room to turn around. But I suspect the only thing that’s changed is me. And when I’m in the mood for something miraculous, I’ll just remind myself that the Islands is still in business.

40,Legacy Records,2 star,"June 19, 2018",Pete Wells,Hudson Yards,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/dining/legacy-records-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/dining/legacy-records-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Real estate developers used to wait for restaurants to illuminate the sidewalks before they’d start investing in a neighborhood. They don’t wait anymore. If there’s no Florent or Schiller’s Liquor Bar around, they simply have one built, synchronizing the opening with the move-in date of the first new apartments. This is the tactic being used by Hudson Yards, the glass-and-steel mountain range rising above a one-time dining wasteland where soon not just restaurants but an entire “restaurant collection” will flourish, including new projects from David Chang, José Andrés and others, all “curated” by Thomas Keller. And it is the approach taken by Henry Hall, a tower of rental apartments just north of Hudson Yards on West 38th Street. To give the place the atmosphere and the hangout opportunities of a boutique hotel, Henry Hall has turned its first two floors over to a wine shop, a cocktail lounge, a private dining room and a restaurant. I am telling you all this because that restaurant, Legacy Records, is unusually good and very popular and if somebody invites you there, you should know why you are having dinner down the street from the Javits Convention Center and a stable where Central Park carriage horses go to be hosed down at night. And you will also know why Legacy Records seems eager to suggest that it has local roots — so eager that it has essentially ginned up a history for itself that brings together sloppy research with a superficial tribute to black culture. It’s not a combination that will appeal to everybody. Like the bar and the wine store, Legacy Records is run by Delicious Hospitality, the company behind Pasquale Jones and Charlie Bird. The menu, as it is in those two restaurants, is essentially Italian, but less rustic and more expensive. This is the first time the group has routinely charged more than $30, and as much as $46, for main courses. (The prices, like the ones at Pasquale Jones but not Charlie Bird, include service.) I don’t know for sure whether Ryan Hardy, the chef and one of the three partners, has upgraded to better purveyors, but I do know I was taken aback, often, by the quality of the raw ingredients at Legacy Records. There was the raw sea scallop, so intensely fresh that its slices clung together stickily; Mr. Hardy had dressed it with dots of yogurt, tiny oval basil leaves, toasted almonds and tart little pink cells of finger lime. There was chilled Dungeness crab, a few pristine white chunks under sea urchin foam, to be spooned from a shot glass. And tiles of yellowfin tuna belly, not as fatty as bluefin but very rich all the same, under bits of salted lemon peel and a splash of colatura, the Italian fish sauce. Again with the main courses, I stopped and wondered: Where did Mr. Hardy find lamb (with snap peas and smoked cream) that tasted as if it had never eaten anything but fresh herbs? How did he find a rib-eye that’s so tender and deeply flavorful without being flabby? Mr. Hardy has been quick to make the most of what the market says is the first month of spring and the calendar says is the last. Creamy new-crop potatoes deserve a little appreciation before they’re sent off to root cellars, and Mr. Hardy built a fine appetizer around them with leggy broccoli sprouts and melting chunks of fresh mozzarella spiked with anchovy. Charred snap peas made a tangy salad together with ramps in a peppery buttermilk dressing. But sweet English peas were swallowed up by a too-sharp risotto; seasoned with prosciutto, the rice took on more of the ham’s saltiness than its sweetness. Legacy Records doesn’t say anything particularly original, but it has a finesse that’s new for this restaurant group. There’s an exceptional plate of grilled pigeon, neatly carved and served with swooshes of nettle purée. It is at least as impressive as the dish that’s becoming a breakout star for the restaurant: a duck breast, its skin rubbed with pepper, chiles, honey and fennel and then roasted until it has a deep, crusty bark that a Texas pitmaster would be proud of. Ordering wine is an event in itself. Robert Bohr and Grant Reynolds, who are Mr. Hardy’s partners and the resident wine soothsayers, have seen to it that cultists can rub elbows with the Agraparts, Raveneaus and Gajas, while the rest of us will still find a few bottles under $100 from some of the most expensive arable land on earth. Oddly enough, the wine list makes less of an impression than the ones at Charlie Bird and Pasquale Jones, simply because you’d expect an ambitious cellar in a restaurant this expensive. Then again you might also expect a smart, artful dessert menu; if so, you’re out of luck. There is ice cream with strawberries, a dark chocolate meringue and a selection of gelati, served in a cone; all perfectly pleasant, but there’s more wit and creativity in the excellent cocktail roster administered by Jeff Bell. I’m sure there are people who are reluctant to go to Legacy Records because of how relentlessly noisy this team’s downtown restaurants are. But they seem to have sent the acoustics to obedience school, because all the sound waves do what they’re told: Conversations stay at their own tables, while the music stays in the background. Ken Fulk, who designed all the public spaces in the building, covered some wall panels with grasscloth, put glove-soft leather on the tabletops, and found other ways to dampen the noise. Legacy Records certainly doesn’t look like any other restaurant; Mr. Fulk went to extremes, using some motifs from the 1980s — emphatic grids, metallic finishes, whites and country-club greens — that not everybody is ready to see resurrected. Hanging in the bar is a 2006 photograph by the artist Mickalene Thomas of a black woman with an Afro and a giraffe-print shirt posed in front of albums by Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross. It has a counterpart on the second floor, a mural behind the bar based on the Ernie Barnes painting seen on Marvin Gaye’s album “I Want You.” Along with the constant hip-hop and vintage soul soundtrack and the restaurant’s name — taken, we are told, from a recording studio that once stood on this site — Legacy Records tries to present itself as a homage to another era in music. If Legacy Recording Studios had been used by Mr. Gaye, Mr. Wonder and Ms. Ross, that homage might make sense. But it didn’t. Lasting just from 2001 to 2009, the studio was built for and mostly used by orchestras, Broadway cast recordings and commercials. Legacy Records has taken this shred of history and turned it into a fantasy of black American music. Exhibited in a museum or gallery, Ms. Thomas’s photo might be taken as a comment on the different postures and personas available to black women. Hanging it next to the counter where pastries and coffee are sold by day strips out some of its meaning; it looks like an attempt to buy a personality for a restaurant that doesn’t have one of its own. If anyone gets to decide who can use black culture for what purposes, it surely isn’t me. But Legacy Records uses it in a gratuitous and offhanded way that made me uncomfortable. Stevie Wonder will always be cool, but a restaurant dreamed up by real estate developers doesn’t automatically become cool by putting him on the wall.

With no time to make a roast or stew, the legend goes, the Great Khan’s chef carved very thin slices of raw mutton and plunged them into hot broth for a few seconds. Besides serving as an inspiration to those of us who believe there is always time to eat, the chef’s impromptu recipe is said to have given China its ancient and delicious hot pot tradition. Hot pots did not jump to Japan until shortly after World War II, when kelp joined the broth and the name was changed, onomatopoetically, to shabu shabu. But like hot pots in China, shabu shabu is a do-it-yourself bash where everybody around the table gets to dunk and swish the ingredients they like best. Chefs are not required. Then on Delancey Street last fall, a new shabu shabu restaurant appeared where a chef standing behind a counter does all the cooking for no more than eight people at a time. Her name is Mako Okano. Out of a style of dining that has always been a big, informal free-for-all, she has built a quiet, refined, intimate spot called Shabushabu Macoron. Usually backed up by two other women, but occasionally working solo, Ms. Okano moves deliberately. She will gesture to the place mat, where the night’s eight or 10 courses are written out in Japanese, right to left, and then to another slip of paper with the same courses printed in English, again right to left. The price is $128. There are no choices to be made. Ms. Okano has modeled her restaurant on omakase sushi bars, where the chef calls the tune. When I first arrived, I admit that I couldn’t see the point of having a chef do the cooking when I was perfectly able to do my own dunking and swishing. Ms. Okano quickly poured two or three mouthfuls of yeasty, warm unfiltered sake into a little saucer. This arrived with a snack — cured salmon and salmon roe seasoned with fermented rice — that artfully underscored the sake’s flavor. Then she turned and quietly addressed a sauté pan over the stove. When she turned around again she had cooked an omelet and flicked it into a roll in the Japanese style. Served in a bowl of hot, clear dashi, the egg was as tender and delicate as its garnish, a tiny piece of mitsuba stem tied into a knot. Next she poached two pieces of abalone for a few seconds each in abalone broth. One she dabbed with a small, intense blip of the Japanese spice paste yuzu kosho. Over the other she spooned a sauce made from the abalone’s liver. I ate them both, and was flooded first with pleasure then with embarrassment that I’d thought simmered food wasn’t worth a chef’s time. By the time I’d eaten a small tongue of sea urchin combined with silky rags of yuba still dripping with soy milk, I was on board for anything Ms. Okano wanted to cook. For some time the bubbles in an iron pot of dashi set over a countertop burner had been getting bigger and faster. Thin strips of Wagyu beef, streaked with so much fat they looked like stained glass, were stretched out on black slate with pinkish bands of pork belly. Raw vegetables — cabbage, lettuce, enoki and shiitake mushrooms, half a brussels sprout and a cherry tomato on a wooden spear — waited on a nearby plate. Before I knew it she had cooked the first piece of beef — was it the A5 from Miyazaki or the A4 from Kagoshima? The flesh had twisted itself around, and now dusk-gray outer curls hid inner curves of faded pink. The flavors moved in rapid waves: first a few clinging, savory drops of dashi, then some already-melted beef fat, followed by the flavor of the lean meat itself, sweet and refined. Finally came a second helping of fat, freshly melted now. When Ms. Okano fished out a piece of beef, she would suggest seasoning it with one or more of an almost comically large assortment of condiments and purées that she makes herself. She seemed to favor her ponzu, and so do I; it’s more radiant with yuzu than any I’ve had before. I also liked the sweet soy once I learned to doctor it with a few drops of what Ms. Okano calls “gravy sauce,” a dark liquid that makes meat taste meatier. Many dismal meals would be saved if I carried an eyedropper of gravy sauce around with me. Swabbing the pork belly in the sticky, thick sesame paste with toasted sesame seeds produces an effect similar to, but more subtle than, the combination of peanut butter and bacon. It’s even better with a smear of salted plum, or a few drops of the yuzu-olive oil sauce that seems to have jetted in from Italy. The vegetables were spotless and fresh. A meal without them would be off kilter, perhaps to a degree that would cause grumbling from the digestive system, but on their own they are not a reason to go to Shabushabu Macoron. The chicken meatballs are, though. So are the green tea soba noodles that Ms. Okano somehow manages to cook in between everything else without seeming to leave the few square feet behind the counter. Soba is not standard with shabu shabu, but it is something she has experience making from her time in the kitchen at Cocoron, a soba-ya across Delancey Street. When she began talking about her dream of opening what she hoped would be the world’s first omakase shabu shabu restaurant, Cocoron’s owners listened. When she came back from a dunk-and-swish tour of Japan, they signed on as her partners. At times, it seems as if Ms. Okano can’t believe it all worked out. After she’d cooked me three nearly identical meals, I wondered if she’d still be as giddy a year from now. Will she be able to change the menu with the seasons to keep things interesting? Can she stash surprise ingredients below the counter for repeat customers, the way sushi chefs do? None of these questions occurred to me the first two times I ate at her restaurant. I just sat there in something like a state of wonder while she cooked for me. This is, bizarrely, a rare experience at tasting counters, where chefs are often intent on intricacies of plating. The physical setting of Shabushabu Macoron strongly suggests a shoestring budget — the paper towel roll in the restroom hangs from what may be an actual shoestring — but sitting there while Ms. Okano stands a few inches away and makes your dinner is one of the most luxurious experiences this city currently offers.

42,Don Angie,2 star,"May 29, 2018",Pete Wells,West Village,"American, Italian",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/dining/don-angie-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/dining/don-angie-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Ever since Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone began rehabilitating chicken Parm and Neapolitan cookies around 2010, I’ve been waiting for other restaurants to carry the torch of Italian-American food boldly into the future. This is a major branch of American cuisine, too important for its fate to be left to the Olive Garden. For the most part, though, the torch has gone uncarried. I have been told that Palizzi Social Club, in Philadelphia, may qualify, but because Palizzi is a veritable club — members and guests only, no new applications accepted — I don’t expect to eat there before the nation’s tricentennial. Then in October, a place opened in the West Village that seemed to hit all the right tropes. It’s called Don Angie. Two chefs share the kitchen — Angela Rito and her husband, Scott Tacinelli — and they make versions of chicken scarpariello, antipasto salad and braciole. The dining room brings back the high-glitz Italian restaurant décor of the 1970s and ’80s, the period when Formica and oil paintings of the Bay of Naples went out and mirrors with gold pinstripes came in. The floor is a black-and-white checkerboard. The bar is made of polished marble the color of beef carpaccio. There is a house Chianti, and it comes in a straw-covered bottle. There is hope for a red-sauce renaissance, after all. Unfortunately, more or less from the day it opened, having dinner at Don Angie has been only marginally less difficult than eating at a private club. That has something to do with Ms. Rito’s and Mr. Tacinelli’s knack for cooking things that Instagram can’t resist. The two spent three years running the kitchen at Quality Italian in Midtown, where they engineered, among other pieces of shutterbait, a chicken Parm that looked like a pizza. There was some wonderful stuff at Quality Italian and some less wonderful stuff, and almost all of it either arrived on trolleys or was prepared at tableside or set on fire while you watched. The restaurant group behind Quality Italian, Quality Branded, is also backing Don Angie. So as I resigned myself to eating at Don Angie close to 5:30 p.m., when I managed to get an unreserved table, I also braced for a dose of abracadabra. It arrived right on schedule with my first drink, which a server strained into a glass through a coffee filter cone lined with espresso ice. It was called Americano, Americano, and combined at least three meanings of the word: a highball, an Italian aperitif wine and a diluted shot of espresso. The Americano highball, so simple that just about any bartender can make it, doesn’t need much improvement. But I have to admit that the coffee did give it some ballast. I’m also happy to report that this was one of the last bits of stagecraft I saw at Don Angie. Ms. Rito and Mr. Tacinelli have a few tricks up their sleeves, but they save them for the kitchen. The result is food that is creative in a more interesting and more consistently successful way than it was at Quality Italian. And it arrives at the table without the aid of trolleys. When you get a Caesar salad, the server doesn’t whip together the dressing on the spot. It’s been done in the kitchen, where the chefs replaced romaine with tender chrysanthemum leaves that taste like some newly discovered herb. (The feathery leaves firmly grip the dressing and the fluffy rasped cheese, too.) I can’t remember seeing chrysanthemum in an Italian restaurant before, and it shows the chefs’ skill for cross-pollinating with other cuisines, especially Asian ones. While the Torrisi-Carbone axis is generally faithful to Italian-American standards, using more expensive ingredients and more modern techniques but leaving the basic ideas intact, the Rito-Tacinelli approach is more radical. They trample on tradition when they feel like it. Prosciutto and honeydew melon are tossed with candied hazelnuts and mint leaves in a lime, tamarind and fish-sauce dressing. This very good salad, which obviously glances toward Southeast Asia, is a smart way to handle an antipasto standby that is usually pointless except when melons are in season. Their garlic bread turns out to be a very thin disc with garlic chives and melted cheese inside and sesame seeds on top. Lightweight, salty and irresistible, it’s modeled on Ligurian focaccia di recco, but it may also bring to mind Turkish gozleme, Azeri kutab or even a Chinese scallion pancake. There’s China again, in the pepperoni fried rice served under barbecued squid. Ignore the squid unless you like it leathery, and just focus on the rice, stirring it with labneh when the heat starts to rise. The dish everybody has seen on Instagram is the pasta called caramelle. In Italian it means caramel, as in candy, but the shape will remind most Americans of an elongated Tootsie Roll, with twists at either end of a drum that’s filled with buffalo ricotta. Cameras come out because the dough is striped, with black sesame-flour bands alternating with ordinary egg pasta. The sesame barely registers; the fun of the dish is the sauce, a peppered, pickled cantaloupe that tastes like it’s still percolating. But the dish that could be Don Angie’s lasting contribution to the pasta sciences is the garganelli with meatball ragù. The central problem of red-sauce restaurants is this: Pasta and meatballs are always served together, but they remain stubbornly separate. Ms. Rito and Mr. Tacinelli have found a way out of this conundrum by crushing meatballs into a tomato-guanciale ragù. It’s not quite as simple as I’ve made it sound, but you don’t know that when you’re eating it; you just think you’re magically eating meatballs and pasta at the same time. They’ve also tried to salvage chicken scarpariello, a dish that is almost always overcooked. Their solution is to make a kind of pie with chicken meat pressed down into a kind of crust made of sausage. The flavors are accurate, and for once it’s not dry, but it’s not as engaging as other main courses, like the veal cutlet with speck and pickled mustard seeds, or the grilled fillet of orata next to herbed fregola, with buttermilk as the sauce. Reworking tiramisù almost never improves it, but as a change of pace I did like how the one at Don Angie shifted the emphasis from espresso to bittersweet cocoa. There’s a delicious, if more conventional, plate of tender, light zeppole with tangy whipped robiola under an Andy Warhol mop of spun sugar that people go wild for. I was charmed by a smaller, quieter dessert: a mochi cake stuffed with fior di latte ice cream, with sea salt and a fragrant scribble of olive oil. It’s like eating a mozzarella ball that wanted to become a dessert when it grew up, and did. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

43,Wokuni,1 star,"May 22, 2018",Pete Wells,Midtown,"Japanese, Seafood",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/dining/wokuni-sushi-japanese-restaurant.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/dining/wokuni-sushi-japanese-restaurant.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Can anybody who has to think about the price of groceries still keep up with the sushi scene in New York? Just in the past year we’ve gotten at least five omakase-only sanctuaries — Sushi Noz, Sushi Amane, Noda, Shoji at 69 Leonard Street and Ichimura at Uchu — where the price of a meal, before drinks and tax, is somewhere between $250 and $300. If you were already inclined to think that the Japanese seafood game, like so many other things in Manhattan, is rigged in favor of the robber barons, these restaurants won’t change your mind. But the next time you despair of ever tasting another slice of yellowtail, I’d suggest dropping into an izakaya called Wokuni for lunch or dinner. A short detour from Grand Central Terminal, it has been in business since October. So far it has not drawn much attention to itself. Given the mixed messages it sends out, this is understandable. It has soaring ceilings, a backlit bar with shelves so high the topmost bottles can be reached only by a gymnast, an undulating wall of overlapping tiles that suggests Frank Gehry in his fish-scale period, and a constant dance beat in the background that won’t stop no matter how hard you cry. In other words, it looks like the Asian fusion restaurant in the lobby of a W hotel built around 1999. The menu sings another tune, though. It is full of traditional izakaya dishes like tofu agedashi and chicken karaage, rounded out by sashimi and grilled skewers. There is one twist, though: Wokuni is much, much more interested in seafood than the average izakaya. As a rule, the fish at Wokuni is exceptionally good and almost bizarrely fresh, shipped daily from the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo or from a fish farm in Nagasaki owned by the restaurant’s parent company, Tokyo Ichiban Foods. (Its admirable motto: “We are changing the dietary culture in Japan with persistence.”) Raw or cooked, the seafood at Wokuni sets it apart from other izakayas in New York, best seen as embassies of Japanese drinking culture in which the food plays the role of the ambassador’s chauffeur. Sushi is rare at standard izakayas, but it is made and sold at Wokuni, at very moderate prices. While many omakase chefs age their fish to make it supple and relaxed, the sushi at Wokuni is almost insolently fresh. And if you merely get a few $5 pieces of king yellowtail sushi, or $6 pieces of sea bream sushi, and maybe a slice or two of golden-eye snapper sushi at $9 each, you won’t regret it. The fish will be shiny. It will probably be chewy. The pinks and reds and ivories and whites in its flesh will be as distinct as if they’d been painted on with a nail-polish brush. But sushi is not the highest use of Wokuni’s seafood. What the place lacks are the seasonal fish that can make a sushi excursion really memorable: gizzard shad, striped jack, firefly squid. When it comes to sashimi, though, this is not much of a liability, and the firmness of Wokuni’s fish becomes a point in its favor. Before ordering sashimi — or, in fact, anything else — check the daily specials posted by the chef, Kuniaki Yoshizawa. They will almost always include several cuts of bluefin from farm-raised fish. If you come very early for lunch and manage to get the Wokuni don, a special that centers on a sashimi rice bowl and shrimp tempura, it will strike you as an incredible bargain at $24. The kitchen makes only five Wokuni-dons a day, though, so chances are you will have to content yourself with the kaisen-don, and chances are that even though it doesn’t include tempura, the $18 you pay will still seem like one of the best raw-fish deals in town. Things get even more intriguing when Wokuni’s seafood comes into contact with heat. Again, the specials should be your starting point. There may well be a grilled yellowtail collar. If you are in the habit of ordering this at your favorite izakaya, it is a good bet that you will be surprised by how much cleaner and sweeter it tastes here. Bluefin collars and jaws are not served often enough for anybody to get into the habit of ordering them. The grilled collar at Wokuni one recent night was one of the greatest pieces of cooked fish I’ve had in a long time, every bit of it worth chasing into the hollows of bone, skin and cartilage where it hid. It is not always available, but the grilled bluefin tail is, carved into a steak with the backbone sliced open so you can get at the teaspoonful of hot, clear jelly inside the spine. Mr. Yoshizawa has had the surprising idea of treating the angles and corners of the sea bream’s body like chicken wings. Tucked into triangles, fried until crunchy and served with lemon, they are meant to be gnawned on between sips of sake. On the other hand, ei hire, a frequent special of cured, dried skate fin cut into squares, makes a chewy and likable sidekick to beer. Fish and chips, of course, will go with either — the fish species changes from night to night, but it tends to be extremely fresh, crunchy and light on batter. The chips, made from the Japanese mountain yam, were never crunchy and always needed more salt. Sometimes salt came with them, and sometimes it didn’t. Those yam fries are an example of what happens once you venture away from seafood at Wokuni: The ingredients aren’t doing the heavy lifting anymore, and everything tastes sort of, well, ordinary. Certain things are on the right side of ordinary, like the fried tofu in dashi; the warm rolled omelet, particularly when topped with grilled freshwater eel; and the tender, ghost-white baby sardines with grated daikon. Others are on the wrong side, like the grilled scallops in butter and the monkfish liver that strongly recalled canned cat food. If I worked in the neighborhood, I would eagerly return at least once a week, sticking as closely as possible to the fish specials. I doubt I’d get bored, but I would keep my eye out for something that Wokuni could put on the menu, but so far hasn’t. The parent company runs a farm that raises tiger blowfish, and about 50 restaurants in Japan that serve it. Tiger blowfish is supposed to be the most delicious kind of fugu. I think New York could make it feel appreciated on Lexington Avenue. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

44,Simon & the Whale,2 star,"May 15, 2018",Pete Wells,Flatiron,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/dining/simon-and-the-whale-restaurant-review-flatiron.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/dining/simon-and-the-whale-restaurant-review-flatiron.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I was drinking gin and pineapple juice at the bar of Gabriel Stulman’s newest restaurant, Simon & the Whale, and tasting folds of tongue pastrami laid over caramelized cauliflower, a combination that paid off against long odds, when applause broke out by the entrance. I hadn’t heard anyone drop a glass or sing “Happy Birthday,” so I asked the woman next to me, who had eaten there three or four times already, if she knew what the sudden ovation was about. “Have you been to Gabe’s other places?” she asked. “They like to clap for people.” I hadn’t noticed that, but there were other Stulman touches that had been transferred from Bar Sardine, Jeffrey’s Grocery, Fedora and Joseph Leonard to Simon & the Whale when it opened in February. Case studies in how to maximize miniature spaces, they are intimate neighborhood hangouts with elevator-size kitchens where the food and cocktails are more interesting than ought to be achievable under such conditions. It’s a genre Mr. Stulman understands as well as anybody in the city. With 76 seats in the new Freehand hotel on East 23rd Street, Simon & the Whale isn’t one of those. It’s an Army mess hall by the standards of Mr. Stulman’s Happy Cooking Hospitality group. But the design firm Roman and Williams has styled it like a California Craftsman house and subdivided it into niches and corners with open cabinets. It doesn’t display its size the way Upland, another Roman and Williams project a few blocks north, does. Even the bar is personably scaled; it’s configured like a horseshoe. Extensive personal research suggests this is the best possible shape a bar can have. Like all of Mr. Stulman’s places, Simon & the Whale is thick with high-volume conversations when it is full, which is pretty much all night long. Like Jeffrey’s Grocery and Joseph Leonard, its name comes from a relative — in this case, Mr. Stulman’s 6-year-old son, who apparently received an impressive collection of whale-decorated baby gifts. Also familiar to Mr. Stulman’s regulars will be the style of the servers. They’re young, talkative, fresh-faced, enthusiastic, as if they are new to the city and haven’t yet grown the protective exoskeleton of the hardened New Yorker. Our waiter one night showered us with recommendations for dishes, all of which he loved. We asked him about things he hadn’t mentioned. He loved those, too. He loved the cocktails, a Happy Cooking strong suit, and was especially keen on one made with mezcal. “Mezcal never hurt anybody,” he said brightly. Extensive personal research suggests this is untrue. One place where Simon & the Whale allows itself to spread out beyond the normal boundaries of the Stulman kingdom is breads and desserts. The restaurant shares a baker, Zoe Kanan, and a pastry chef, Charmaine McFarlane, with the hotel’s second-floor cafe, Studio, also run by Happy Cooking. Both are very good at their jobs. Ms. Kanan makes the black, thick-crusted barley-rye bread flecked with anise seeds that comes with a halfhearted taramosalata and, more excitingly, a swipe of butter creamed with seaweed powder. The long thin toast, crackling with grains and seeds that sits under cured and smoked Arctic char and smoked sour cream? Hers. The poppy-seed torpedo roll that helps lift the fish sandwich with carrot-squash slaw above the ordinary? Also hers, although to be fair the long, flat fries also do their part. And if your spirits have been sunk, as mine have, by the skimpy and uninspired dessert choices around town these days, Ms. McFarlane will be an answered prayer. No mere afterthought, her panna cotta sits on a low base of semolina cake and is decked out with pink grapefruit fillets and grapefruit marmalade spiced with red juniper berries. A cooling evergreen moat of pine ice surrounds an earthy rye pudding that’s enriched with brown butter; pears fried in honey are splayed out on top, and some acerbic cranberries prevent the whole thing from cloying. I defy you to eat it without smiling. I can’t say I’m as taken with crunchy knotweed-rhubarb compote as a topping for a buckwheat cake as Ms. McFarlane seems to be, but the same dessert offers one of the most astonishing ice creams around. Made with beeswax, it is as deeply aromatic as honey but not as sweet, and its texture is intensely creamy but not at all waxy. The rest of the menu is in the hands of Matt Griffin, until recently in charge of the food at Fedora and Bar Sardine. He does a neat balancing trick here, giving his adventurous side free rein at times while more often using it to add interest to the standards a hotel restaurant probably needs. A winningly over-the-top recent special was a custard-soaked pain perdu under bacon jus, pickled cabbage and speck, like some kind of demented Reuben-croque monsieur hybrid. Liver and onions turned out to be a less thrilling snack: pickled onions with deep-fried and overcooked chicken livers. Until it swam off the menu, there was an intriguing sideways version of squid ink risotto that had beech mushrooms and very tender squid confit over a black porridge of barley. Now there are spring peas, swirled with mint into a sauce for just-firm shrimp; the combination suggested pasta, but I was glad to have it without any starch getting in the way of the clear, sweet flavors. If it’s pasta you want, Mr. Griffin has a glossy, chile-speckled bowl of spaghetti acqua pazza with littleneck clams and cherry tomatoes, and while the sauce is thicker and glossier than a normal acqua pazza, it is very good. What he calls a pork-collar Milanese is maybe a few millimeters too thick for the name, but I’ll take it. The cut is more flavorful than a normal cutlet, and the apricot mostarda makes a pungent and welcome counterpoint. If you can’t finish the whole thing, it will be taken away and replaced by a plastic action figure of a New York sports hero. This is your claim check. Mine was Don Mattingly, and I wondered if maybe the applause was for him. No, Mr. Stulman said on the phone a few days later. The woman he bought Fedora from, who has since died, was 89 when she sold it and was still showing up each night. When she entered, people clapped. “We turned that into clapping for our friends,” he said. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

45,Soogil,2 star,"May 8, 2018",Pete Wells,East Village,Korean,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/dining/soogil-review-east-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/dining/soogil-review-east-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"A little skepticism is in order when you hear about the work history of a chef running a kitchen for the first time. As frequent diners know from sad experience, it is, in fact, possible to cook in an acclaimed restaurant without picking up any of the qualities that it’s acclaimed for. Even when actual skills have been learned, they are not always obvious. Or, occasionally, they’re all too obvious, and you’ll catch somebody in a two-person kitchen trying to replicate dishes originally assembled by a team of 40. One interesting thing about Soogil Lim is that you can almost draw a straight line from his résumé to what’s on the table at his four-month-old restaurant in the East Village, Soogil. It’s easy to spot the imprint of Hooni Kim’s Hanjan, where he was the executive chef for four years. Mr. Lim lived in South Korea until he was 28, so what he learned at Hanjan was not how to make the country’s traditional food but how to rework it into appealing, contemporary small plates. Daniel, where he spent seven years and reached the rank of sous-chef, turns up in the French techniques Mr. Lim leans on, in the crisp presentations that carry an echo of nouvelle cuisine, in the tender braised short rib, in his fondness for foie gras and in his preference for skillfully modulating flavors rather than tossing umami grenades. It’s also apparent, when you look around the dining room, that in his earlier jobs Mr. Lim spent most of his time in the kitchen; the lineage you taste in his cooking doesn’t show up in the design. Soogil (SOO-gil) doesn’t evoke a rambunctious Korean pub the way Hanjan does. Nor is it a carpeted and tableclothed luxury liner, like Daniel. Under the guidance of Mr. Lim’s wife, Sasook Youn, the dining room has been done in what we now recognize as the all-purpose Modern Asian style — a long banquette of blond wood against one wall, a dining counter facing another wall, and a long communal table with benches running down the middle, all of them sitting on a plank floor. A few framed prints by Suzy Taekyung Kim, a New York artist from South Korea, are suspended over the banquettes. French windows on the street can be thrown open if the weather ever cooperates. Hanging in the back is a curtain. Once in a while it parts just wide enough for Mr. Lim’s face to appear while he scans the tables. Sometimes they are full. They should be full all the time, because cooking like this does not just sprout up through every crack in the sidewalk, particularly at prices that, with one or two exceptions, don’t go over $20. A good window into Mr. Lim’s mind is the bindaetteok appetizer. Usually these mung bean pancakes present as flat, starchy discs whose golden surfaces hint at crunchiness without actually delivering it. The ones at Soogil, fried in pork fat, have golden crusts like veal cutlets; by the time you’ve speared a piece with some chopped kimchi and dunked it in the traditional dipping sauce, you have all the expected flavors, plus a formidable crunch to sweeten the deal. He tinkers with the glass noodle dish called japchae in less radical fashion. The noodles themselves, shaped into a swirl with crisp shreds of vegetables and oyster mushrooms, have drunk in more soy and sesame flavor than they typically do. And Mr. Lim seems to have tripled, at least, the amount of bulgogi, a point he emphasizes by mounding the meat over the noodles so it looks like a sloppy Joe missing its top bun. The care the kitchen pays to technique is obvious in the seafood dishes; I’ve never had one that wasn’t perfectly cooked. Monkfish, which can come off as a rubber replica of some part of the anatomy I’d rather not think about, gets wrapped in a cabbage or lettuce leaf, gently poached, and sliced into neat little wheels. Arranged over stir-fried vegetables in a sea of fermented chile sauce, it’s terrific, and about as French as Korean cooking should be allowed to get. An almost silky consistency marks the mackerel that Soogil serves, nigiri-style, over wads of rice that have been seasoned with ssamjang (standing in for wasabi?) and wrapped in chard leaves. The tender Manila clams, squid and shrimp in the spicy tofu-seafood stew kept more of their natural juiciness than usual, although very firm shellfish isn’t necessarily a defect in that dish. Mr. Lim herds all the soft tofu into a flan at the bottom of the bowl, rather than letting cubes of it fend for themselves in the broth — a move that nicely heightens the contrast of tofu and chiles. The least Korean thing on the menu must be the foie gras terrine, and it’s also one of the only disappointments, with its crumbly Melba toasts and washed-out green-plum jelly. A dish called nurungji gras is something else entirely: a fine seared hunk of foie gras laid over spinach and pickled mushrooms on a springy, crunchy sizzled rice cake. Slabs of pork belly are braised until the fat streaks are nearly liquid. Then they’re given a meaningful sear and served alongside a stripe of a sauce I’ve never had before, made with fermented shrimp and green plums and fresh red peppers: spicy, salty, sour and hot. The dish that breaks the $20 barrier is the short rib. If you’ve had Daniel’s braised short ribs, the tenderness and concentration will be familiar to you, although Soogil’s version is pointedly suffused with soy rather than red wine. Underlining the French connection, this block of beef is served with carrots, potatoes and winter squash. If you eat it by yourself, you could make dinner of it. After which you should probably investigate something that goes by the name Jenga Tower. Cigarettes of fried dough, chewy like rice sticks, are stacked like a log cabin, then dusted with sugar and misugaru, the powdered grain and bean blend Koreans use as an instant breakfast drink. You pull out a stick at the time until the tower falls and brings down the scoop of honey-and-chestnut gelato balanced on top. The dining room could take a few lessons in balance from that dessert.

46,La Mercerie,2 star,"May 1, 2018",Pete Wells,SoHo,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/dining/la-mercerie-review-soho.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/dining/la-mercerie-review-soho.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The classic cafes of Parisian boulevards — rattan chairs and their occupants facing the sun in all but the nastiest weather, waiters stepping nimbly over small dogs — are central to the city’s street culture, but they’re pretty marginal to its eating and drinking culture now. Cafes may have been known for their namesake drink in Voltaire’s day, but since then their coffee has become internationally notorious. Today the Parisian love of caffeine is more likely to be consummated over flat whites, cortados or, most un-French of all, filtered coffee at a third-wave espresso shop. Meanwhile the pillars of the cafe menu, those blunt salads and trusty omelets and utilitarian ham sandwiches, are not exactly drawing crowds like the shakshukas, pancakes, avocado toasts and acai bowls found at younger cafes like Ob-La-Di and Holybelly. With some searching, you can probably find cafes in France that produce the standards with conviction. Or you can go to La Mercerie, in SoHo, for simple, determinedly old-school French cooking with every detail in place. The chef, Marie-Aude Rose, does not make toasts, but she makes toast soldiers: sticks of white bread with butter smeared along their browned surfaces, but otherwise naked so they can drink up the orange yolk of a soft-cooked egg on a ceramic pedestal. For the past four months, Ms. Rose has been cooking as if the fate of the planet depended on the tenderness of her cheese omelets, the judiciousness of her vinaigrettes, the airy spaces in her croissants and the crackle of the buckwheat in her savory crepes. If those feats were as easy as they sound, La Mercerie’s breakfast-through-dinner menu wouldn’t be a major addition to the city’s restaurant scene. But they aren’t, and it is, and some of the thanks goes to Ms. Rose’s hard-core training when she was embedded in the unforgiving kitchens of Guy Savoy and Pierre Gagnaire. Then, like a lot of aspiring chefs of her generation, she heard the call of the bistronomie movement, and went looking for a less cloistered restaurant. What she found was Spring, a new, relaxed, seasonally attentive place where an American named Daniel Rose was doing all the cooking himself. After she turned up, something clicked and the restaurant began to get attention around Paris and abroad. Her sensibilities overlapped with Mr. Rose’s in other ways; the two started dating and later married, opening additional places along the way. The Roses moved to New York about two years ago when Daniel opened Le Coucou, his tribute to the Le and La restaurants of old. La Mercerie, three blocks west, was not in their plans until Le Coucou’s chief owner, Stephen Starr, was brought on to operate a cafe inside a furniture and housewares store being planned by Le Coucou’s design firm, Roman and Williams. La Mercerie sits at the junction of two mighty rivers of contemporary eating trends: the redundantly, if catchily, named all-day-cafe movement and the restaurant-as-shopping-catalog approach pursued by Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s places inside ABC Carpet & Home. When you sit down for breakfast (or lunch, or dinner — see, all day) at La Mercerie, you will get, in addition to a menu, a card printed with small line drawings of every piece of tableware in the cafe, and its price. If you are very taken by the “rustic washed linen napkins” you can buy a set for $104. For $275, there is a small teapot from a Danish potter who has supplied Noma. If this is outside your budget, you can still use them at La Mercerie for an hour or two before you have to give them back, like a rented tux of rustic washed linen. As borrowed lifestyles go, it’s a pretty nice one. Many of the servers are dressed in high-waisted, loose-legged trousers and flowing white dress shirts, as if they were in costume for a Fred Astaire movie. Meanwhile, the customers never seem to be rushed or out of sorts, and I started to wonder if they were all extras being paid to sit there looking serene. Or maybe eating next to a room full of expensive vases, Swedish sheepskins, enormous woven baskets and antique tables makes everybody feel as if they are one of the exhibits in a small museum. The theme of the merchandise is craft — it’s all handmade — and Ms. Rose has taken this to heart in her kitchen. La Mercerie’s chicken bouillon is simmered and skimmed just the way it should be. Marked by balance and brightness, it is oolong tea to bone broth’s double espresso. Also in the bowl are an egg with a liquid yolk and, down at the bottom, a flock of herb-pasta butterflies, each one the size of the tip of your pinkie. Ms. Rose’s pastries are already some of the finest in the city. Croissants have crisp whorls on top that you can count like tree rings; the savory ones are filled with ham and Comté, or broccoli and cherry tomatoes in custard, which may not sound good but is. More exotic is the tourteau fromagé, a palm-size cheesecake with a blackened, domed top. Born in Poitou-Charentes, it looks something like a Boston cream doughnut, but its interior is a moist, fine-crumbed cake that tastes, just barely, of fresh goat cheese. Ms. Rose serves it with a poached apricot in star-anise syrup. If you are a serious pastry watcher, you will want to add it to your life list. Having recently run up against a crème brûlée that seemed to contain no eggs and a plate of profiteroles allowed to get soggy at a purportedly French restaurant nearby, I was relieved to sink into the yolk-rich crème caramel and crisp choux puffs under bittersweet chocolate sauce at La Mercerie. A devout and often disappointed Francophile I ate with eyed the crepes au sucre warily. “The sugar had better be crunchy,” she said. It was, of course. The menu changes once a day, at noon. The soft-cooked egg goes away, replaced by the omelet. Four main courses arrive, including a very nice piece of roasted salmon with red-wine sauce. Salads appear. It is almost impossible to rave convincingly about salads, so please trust me that La Mercerie’s are great, particularly the niçoise, with tuna preserved in oil on the premises and anchovies cured in oil at the source, the Cantabrian Sea. The same anchovies, swimming on the same plate as a wedge of vanilla butter, make an appetizer that you probably won’t believe until you’ve tasted it. (The butter amplifies the richness of the fish while tamping down its sharpness.) The man who churns La Mercerie’s butter, Jean-Yves Bordier, does not sell his stuff to just anybody, and the fat slices of his buckwheat and lemon-olive oil butters are worth the $7 you pay. Most things are so precisely as they should be that it is hard to find fault. But I am not sure that a sheet of Calvados-poached apple is of much use to a wedge of Camembert, and I wish that the boeuf bourguignon’s dark and lovely sauce did not slide so easily off the smooth macaroni Ms. Rose sets under the stew. Maybe the buckwheat crepe curled above the creamed chicken reminded me a bit too much of a dosa. But the one around ham, Comté and a fried egg is reassuringly folded like an envelope. The wine list is full of the amenably drinkable bottles you want with this food. As for the coffee, it too is drinkable — one of the rare departures from French cafe tradition.

47,Claro,2 star,"April 3, 2018",Pete Wells,Gowanus,Mexican,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/dining/claro-review-brooklyn-oaxacan.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/dining/claro-review-brooklyn-oaxacan.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"If you love Oaxacan food and live in New York City, it helps to be mobile. About half a million Mexican-Americans live here, too, and while more have been arriving from Oaxaca in recent years, very few have opened restaurants. The hunting is better north of town. On a free day, you could head upriver to Poughkeepsie, N.Y., the capital of the Hudson Valley’s Oaxacan community. My own favorite destination until this winter was even farther away, a trim, bright little spot in Kingston called Just For You. Last summer I had a memorable bowl of thick crema de elote and hunks of goat stewed with guajillo chiles. But one of the owners had moved to the United States illegally in 1999 and had recently moved back to Mexico under threat of deportation; the restaurant has closed for now. Closer to home, you can make your way to La Morada, in the South Bronx, hoping the elusive mole blanco will be simmering in the kitchen that day, and ready to settle for one of the more easily spotted moles if it is not. You might go to central Brooklyn for the tamal steamed in a banana leaf, or the little fried masa pockets called tetelas, at La Loba Cantina, in Kensington. In September, a new choice appeared on Third Avenue in Brooklyn, between the verdant shores of the Gowanus Canal and the foothills of Park Slope. Called Claro, it is run by one of the owners of Freek’s Mill, a nearby restaurant where the servers wear gingham shirts and talk up the virtues of the wine list made up almost entirely of gamay and chenin blanc. His partner is also the chef, T. J. Steele, a veteran of Union Square Cafe and Tía Pol who has the word TACO tattooed on the fingers of his right hand and MASA on those of his left. Those two related themes are continued in ink drawings that run up his arms, across his torso and down to his feet. Claro, in other words, is not where you go for Oaxacan recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. Home-style soups and stews are rare. So is cooked fish. On the other hand, Mr. Steele has given himself liberty to work with ingredients that might furrow the average Mexican grandmother’s brow, like kale and sunchokes. Although he has lived part-time in Oaxaca City for more than a decade, he still thinks like a New York chef. But as his head-to-toe artwork suggests, Mr. Steele has a tendency to go all in. This is, as it happens, the only way to make the moles that are the pride of Oaxaca. The moles at Claro are riveting: The ground nuts and dried spices, the garlic and onions all seem to bring out the personalities of the chiles — sometimes fruity, sometimes vegetal — while tamping down their heat. He keeps their bitterness in check, too. Pork cheek was stewed in a mole rojo that has just enough chocolate to make you smile; the mole negro, in which marbled short ribs were cooked to extreme tenderness, was so balanced that no one ingredient ever seemed to be in the lead. Chichilo, not one of your everyday moles, was the brightest and most outgoing of the three, and a big pool of it made an exciting foil for a chile relleno filled with shredded, spiced duck. Mr. Steele also goes all in on masa, which is stone-ground and nixtamalized on site from strains of blue and yellow corn native to Oaxaca. Ten years ago you couldn’t talk about the state of masa in New York without experiencing early signs of depression; now Claro is among a handful of local restaurants whose masa is worth getting excited about. It provides the ground floor of about half the things you will eat. Pressed and griddled — in good weather, this is done outside on a domed comal set over a fire — the masa becomes the small warm tortillas that are folded into shrimp tacos with an unusually complex chipotle sauce. Larger fried tortillas are the foundation of tostadas, which can be quite the productions here: turkey in salsa with a flicker of heat soothed by crema and mashed avocados; raw yellowfin tuna with blood oranges and puffs of fried pork skin and a whiff of smoke from Oaxacan pasilla chiles. Thicker, softer wheels of masa with raised rims make up the base of memelas, the Oaxacan version of sopes and huaraches. The one with goat-cheese crema and wild mushrooms has a meaty intensity, without any meat; another, spread with an unexpectedly fluffy hash of chorizo and potatoes, is topped with house-made queso fresco to calm the chorizo’s burn. Occasionally, it can be hard to tell Claro’s memelas from its tostadas. Because together they make up a substantial chunk of the menu, if you don’t order carefully you can end up with a long, unbroken run of masa discs. (This is not the worst fate on earth.) The flavors at Claro tend to be finely tuned, so when a dish was out of alignment, I noticed. Beef tongue tacos would have needed a heavier glug of salsa to make up for meat that was as salty as country ham. And when the pickled-pepper sauce binding the bacon-and-octopus tostada was too sharp and sour, what had been the high point of one dinner became the low point of another — a vinegar tostada. Claro is filled with evidence of the connections Mr. Steele has made over the years in Oaxaca. The bar stocks a smoky but approachable mezcal that he imports, called El Buho. The tiles under the bar and the charcoal-toned plates and dishes are made by ceramists he met there. It’s all pretty restrained; you don’t get the sense he has turned the restaurant into a warehouse for crafts he bought, drunk on the exchange rate, at the artisan’s market. On the wall is a mural of three goats surrounding a woman who seems to be having a bad day; she is in a caldron over a fire, and the goats look hungry. If you want to turn the tables, try to go to Claro on a night when barbecued goat is on the menu. Served with blue and yellow tortillas, red and green salsas, and a bowl of consommé, it is more than enough to make a meal of. I ate it with one eye on the back door, thinking about what else Claro might serve when the weather is warm enough to start cooking on the wood grill every night.

48,Chez Ma Tante,2 star,"March 27, 2018",Pete Wells,Greenpoint,"American, European",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/dining/chez-ma-tante-review-brookyn.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/dining/chez-ma-tante-review-brookyn.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"All the things I love about the pancakes at Chez Ma Tante, near the Greenpoint waterfront in Brooklyn, are things that normal chefs would try to fix. They are a little too tall and too big around. The outside is nearly black in parts, and crunchy, which American pancakes almost never are. What they most closely resemble are the pancakes I’ve made on camping trips, from a mix, with about a quarter-stick of melted butter in a smoking-hot pan over a fire. Each one is the size of Frisbee because too many people are waiting for breakfast for any space in the pan to be wasted. Assuming my campfire pancakes were to catch a chef’s eye, the standard way of turning them into a brunch dish would be to refine them. The heat would come down so they’d cook to an even golden-brown. My quantity of butter would seem insane in a professional kitchen, so it would be cut. The batter would probably be thinned to make the pancakes shorter and more elegantly rounded. Rounding out the rough edges is, in a broad sense, one of the main things chefs do. They may not always do it consciously, any more than a copy editor consciously corrects typos. It’s supposed to become a reflex, which is the point of the sign on the kitchen wall at Eleven Madison Park: MAKE IT NICE. This is just what the chef Aidan O’Neal at Chez Ma Tante does not do to the pancakes. Rising up from a small flood of maple syrup, they look and taste as if they’d been made in the woods. I will gladly admit they’re better than mine. At weekend brunch, they are on virtually every table. Mr. O’Neal and his chef de cuisine, Jake Leiber, do not lack skill in the kitchen, but they know when to resist cheflike impulses and think like hungry campers. Their healthy disregard for refinement spills over to the dinner menu, which recently expanded to seven nights a week from five, just as the restaurant is approaching its first birthday. To start, you might smear a gob of chicken liver pâté on a tangy slice of miche charred over the grill, or some head cheese, a spreadable pink composite of meat not quite held together by drippy pork goo. The most rustic thing you can eat there at night, though, has to be the thick steak carved out of a pork shoulder, rubbed with mustard and maple syrup, and striped with wide, dark grill marks. Smeared over the top is a salsa verde made from fresh parsley and other herbs that were whole about three or four slashes of a knife ago. Stewed Puy lentils spill across the rest of the plate. The look may say it was thrown together, but the full, lasting flavors tell you it wasn’t. It is hard to say exactly what kind of food Chez Ma Tante serves, apart from the consistently good kind. The website calls it “food that can only be described as European.” This isn’t particularly helpful or specific; I’ve never eaten anything there that seemed Finnish, say, or Bulgarian. If the menu has a theme, you won’t guess it from the dining room. A collection of brown chairs and black tables on a black floor in an undecorated white room, it is as austere as a Shaker chapel, although one with a long, well-populated bar against the wall. No hints are forthcoming from the cocktail list, either, which plays it close to the vest with daiquiris, Negronis, Cosmopolitans and so on. It is the first cocktail list I’ve seen in a long time on which I recognized every drink. Other writers have described Chez Ma Tante as a neighborhood spot, a homage to certain well-known London restaurants, a gastro pub and a “French-Canadian bistro.” This last must be a reference to Mr. O’Neal. Raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, he cooked at Au Pied de Cochon in Montreal under Martin Picard, the grinning scoutmaster of the hungry-camper troop, before moving to New York to work at the berserk Québécois outpost M. Wells, in Long Island City, Queens. (He met Mr. Leiber a few years later when they worked together at Café Altro Paradiso in SoHo.) The name Chez Ma Tante was borrowed from a stainless-steel slot of a place in Montreal known for its steamé, a steamed hot dog in a steamed bun. An “all dressed” steamé, meaning it’s loaded up with mustard and coleslaw, is a new feature on the brunch menu in Greenpoint. Apart from that and a recurring maple motif — the jugs of syrup on a shelf outside the kitchen are not just for show — the Québécois influence is minimal. A minor British theme seems undeniable. First off, the French fries are unmistakably English chips: twice-fried wedges that are steamy and starchy on the inside. If I were from England myself, I’d probably call them “proper chips,” even though they come with a little cup of aioli on the side. Whether Chez Ma Tante’s kedgeree is a proper kedgeree I don’t know. It is, essentially, white rice dyed yellow with curry powder and mixed with hard-cooked egg and flaked cod. A fair amount of butter seems to be involved. On top is a crunchy salad of celery stalks and leaves. Somehow it’s rich and refreshing and soothing and exciting at the same time. How did falafel, fried to a crackle and served over hummus and harissa with pickle wheels, get here? Not sure, but it is a great improvement over most of the vegetarian options you meet around town. Salads, too, are better than usual: shavings of kohlrabi and apples imbued with lemon; roasted almonds and raisins over white shreds of stracciatella cheese; a Caesar whose romaine leaves are small and tender, and whose croutons are closer to fried crumbs. The night ends with straightforward bistro desserts. Maple returns one more time in a crème brûlée; its torched sugar crust is repeated, in a lighter form, on the surface of a lemon tart wedge; the tarte Tatin is classic, although the caramel one night was a little more bitter than it needed to be. Like King in SoHo, which could be this restaurant’s older sister after a junior year abroad, Chez Ma Tante offers sorbet with a shot of vodka meant to be poured over the top. Because this is Greenpoint, the vodka is Polish. Presumably for the same reason, most customers don’t bother pouring it over the sorbet; they just toss it back in one gulp.

49,JuneBaby,3 star,"March 15, 2018",Pete Wells,Ravenna,Southern,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/dining/junebaby-review-seattle-black-southern-food.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/dining/junebaby-review-seattle-black-southern-food.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"SEATTLE — As great restaurants will do, JuneBaby pulled me in from more than one direction. The first of course was the sheer pleasure of the cooking. (Without that, the others wouldn’t matter.) The food is Southern, which I was primed to like before I walked through JuneBaby’s Dutch doors in this city’s Ravenna neighborhood. And whenever Edouardo Jordan’s menu offered a dish I’d expect to see at a Southern restaurant, he gave me something better than I’d imagined. Fried catfish over grits can be better in theory than reality. At JuneBaby, the fish, from an Idaho farm, is firm, tight, fresh and free of bottom-feeder muddiness. The crust is semolina, which stays crisp and unsoggy. The grits are fluffy, yellow, full of corn flavor. Ringing the grits is an orange circle of shrimp bisque. Strictly speaking, shrimp bisque has no business on fish and grits, but if you see the bisque as a tamer, richer stand-in for hot sauce it makes a delicious kind of sense. This is the tactic — find superior ingredients and bring some fancy kitchen tricks to bear on them — favored by most of the South’s prominent restaurants. If that were all Mr. Jordan had in mind, I would still think JuneBaby is a very good restaurant. But on the menu of this nearly year-old establishment are dishes that I wasn’t expecting, that many of those other restaurants don’t serve, that pulled me in deeper. Like any good Southern chef, Mr. Jordan loves his pork. But I paid closer attention when I noticed which parts of the pig he’s cooking. He will boil ham hocks with collard greens until the leaves are soft and velvety and wonderfully smoky. He stews pigs’ ears until they surrender their ornery stiffness, then slices and fries them into irresistible, crunchy sticks. He seasons okra and tomatoes with a North African spice mix and stews them with hog maw, otherwise known as the outer wall of the stomach. “Almost nobody likes it,” Josh Ozersky wrote of hog maw in Esquire in 2014, a year before he died. “It’s tough and tasteless, like the chitterlings to which it is attached.” Mr. Jordan would disagree. By the way, he cooks chitterlings, too. These are the cuts that enslaved black people on plantations were allowed to keep when hogs were killed; after Emancipation, these were the cuts they might have had the money to afford and the skills to make into something memorable. Their healthy representation on the menu tells you that JuneBaby is not just a Southern restaurant but, specifically, a black Southern restaurant. Of course, much of the huge edifice of Southern food was built by black farmers and black cooks: as enslaved people in plantation kitchens and in their own families’ cabins; later, as domestic servants, hotel chefs, railroad cooks, restaurateurs and entrepreneurs. Mr. Jordan is interested in all of it, but he particularly wants to introduce customers to the food of his family. He was raised in St. Petersburg, Fla., where the surrounding culture wasn’t particularly Southern but his mother’s table was. “The food she cooked was the only food she knew,” Mr. Jordan said in a phone interview. “That’s where I got my experience of fried fish, fried chicken, braised meats, offals, bread pudding.” JuneBaby’s oxtails are a tribute to one of her mainstays. Mr. Jordan deepens the flavor of the beef by roasting it before braising. He focuses the broth by clarifying it with egg whites, as he would have done in culinary school and in kitchens where he’s worked, such as the French Laundry in California and Per Se and Lincoln Ristorante in New York. But he doesn’t try to prettify what the menu calls Momma Jordan’s Oxtails, serving them whole, with cubes of turnip and rutabaga, the hunks of beef barely hanging onto tailbones whose wide, white wings flare out like propeller blades. The chitterlings are essentially his paternal grandmother’s recipe, stewed with onions, carrots and garlic. Instead of water, he might use some chicken stock, or the collagen-rich liquid thrown off by the pigs’ ears. Rather than use a pot on the stove, he softens them in a pressure cooker. This both speeds the process by several hours and allows him to welcome the customers who line up each night waiting for the doors to open into a dining room that does not smell like intestines. As variety meats go, intestines are not at the top of my list. Out of strong curiosity, I’ve eaten them packed into andouillettes in France, fried and kept under heat lamps in a gas station in Mississippi, and grilled over charcoal in the backyard of a Korean restaurant in Queens. I liked them best at JuneBaby. “My grandmother’s chitterlings were a thing I loved, but never talked about,” Mr. Jordan said, a thought that will sound familiar to immigrants and other people whose families’ food veers from the mainstream American diet. “You tell your friends as a kid you eat chitterlings, they run away from you.” Eventually he ran away from them, too, until he began to prepare a follow-up to his first restaurant as both chef and owner, Salare, down the street. The menu at Salare, he has said, expresses what he has learned in his career, centering on the Italian and French food he made in other people’s restaurants. JuneBaby, though, “speaks on who I am as an individual soul and as an African-American male.” And to do that he realized he would need to go back to “these ingredients that we don’t want to talk about” and start to show them off. Junebaby’s chitterlings never come off the menu. They are not a huge revenue center for the restaurant but they may be, in a cultural sense, a loss leader. The dining room has a welcoming, domestic atmosphere; somehow it always feels as if a warm breeze were blowing through the screens, even in winter with the windows shut. For all the braised and simmered and stewed dishes, the kitchen glides easily into lighter territory. Vegetables keep their crunch. Bright green broccoli is tossed with grated Cheddar, almonds, apples and very delicate puffs of pork skin, all of them sharpened by preserved-lemon vinaigrette. The buttermilk biscuits and raised dinner rolls, known here as Antebellum Wheat Buns, are made with a light, practiced hand under the direction of Margaryta Karagodina, the pastry chef. Red-flint cornbread, baked in an iron skillet, gets its minerally sweetness from sorghum. Some of the desserts are slices of church-supper favorites, like a rich brick of bread pudding, interspersed with dark chocolate and soft apricots, sitting on crème anglaise. The Black Forest cake was the kind you rarely see anymore, three chocolate-cake layers frosted with cocoa-dusted whipped cream. Alongside one of these, it’s a good idea to let Mr. Jordan take you all the way back to the beginning of his career and have a flip. This is frozen fruit juice — pineapple the night I had it — in a paper cup, a tribute to the homemade Popsicles Mr. Jordan used to whip up out of powdered drink mix and sell when he was a boy in St. Petersburg. If the word flip doesn’t ring a bell, one of its other names might: huckabuck, hucklebuck, frozen cup, freeze cup, cool cup. If you’re still in the dark, a definition can be found in the JuneBaby encyclopedia. This still-growing document, found on the restaurant’s website, defines menu terms and concepts in Southern cuisine from Aunt Jemima to yams (“Most common African staple that fed enslaved Africans on board ships.”). The encyclopedia is another way JuneBaby drew me in. It nudged me to consider what I was eating. And it situated Mr. Jordan’s family recipes in a centuries-long arc of American history. Many restaurants start with a chef’s personal story. JuneBaby traces that story back to where it meets the country’s. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

50,DaDong,0.75 star,"March 6, 2018",Pete Wells,Midtown,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/dining/dadong-review-midtown-chinese-peking-duck.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/dining/dadong-review-midtown-chinese-peking-duck.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Every so often, I’ll wake up to an inbox full of friendly emails from people volunteering to help me do my job. The specific assistance they are offering is to meet me at some forthcoming restaurant, their stomachs empty and ready to contain at least half the menu. When I get three or four of these volunteers on the same morning, it invariably means that while I was sleeping other people were reading the advance press on an incipient opening that sounds both unusually enticing and intimidatingly expensive. The most recent rush of volunteers, it turned out, was inspired by the arrival in December of a Manhattan branch of the Beijing-based restaurant DaDong. While the Beijingese have excelled at the art of duck roasting for centuries, DaDong, I learned, is a relative newcomer, founded in the 1990s by the chef Dong Zhenxiang. At the restaurants — there are 10 in Beijing and six in other Chinese cities, not counting casual spinoffs — the birds revolve, a dozen at a time, inside a circular wood-fueled oven that Mr. Dong has patented. The result is what some people consider Beijing’s best Peking duck. This is a magical combination of words. “Beijing’s best Peking duck” suggests a mandatory eating experience in a way that, say, “Russia’s best Russian dressing” does not. It took me and my first corps of volunteers some time to find one another because the restaurant’s address, 3 Bryant Park, implied that the entrance would be somewhere around Bryant Park. DaDong is inside a stack of glass-and-steel blocks that has somehow been plunked down west of the park between 42nd and 41st Streets, beside a pocket plaza that was new to me, although the skateboarders seemed to know all about it. Inside the front door was a lobby where a host stood by herself behind a desk made out of a rock. I gave her the name and she gestured toward the elevators, sending me up to the dining room on the second floor. This space, designed by the hotel specialist George Wong, is the latest manifestation of modern China in Manhattan, a soothing study in straight lines and neutral tones with random outbreaks of contemporary Chinese art. A wraparound bar sits in the middle of the room under a hanging sculpture that looks like a flock of gold paper-towel tubes learning to fly. In this room, it is not exactly shocking to learn that the usual Peking duck garnishes may be supplemented with 10 grams of caviar for $42. In lieu of toast points, servers recommend a shard of skin. If you skip the fish eggs, they will tell you there are three ways to eat the duck: wrapped in one of the very thin and tender pancakes with scallions and a smear of sweet soy-black bean sauce (great stuff); poked into a round sesame puff with julienned cucumber and melon, raw garlic paste and the black bean sauce; and finally, dipped in a small pile of sugar, recommended for the skin alone. This kept everybody busy for some time. The bird was precisely carved, as if by a laser. None of us had seen crisper skin — you could bounce a quarter off it. The dip didn’t improve it, but it is always nice to find a new use for sugar. The meat didn’t make as firm an impression. It made very little impression at all, apart from my strong sense that there ought to have been more of it. Tasted on its own, it reminded me a bit of the lean, whitish, noncommittal supermarket pork chops I grew up on. Slowly, gradually, with great mental resistance but still inexorably, it dawned on me that I had paid $98 for a duck with almost no flavor. It was dry, too. New York City being a lush jungle of regulations, DaDong was forced to convert its wood-burning ovens to gas. Smoke might have added some flavor, but something seems to be lacking in the birds themselves, members of the Pekin breed raised on a farm in Indiana with special instructions to keep them lean, the way Mr. Dong prefers them. Unfortunately, DaDong’s problems don’t end with the duck. The menu in New York has been trimmed down considerably from the 280-page book presented to diners in Beijing, but it is still rife with dishes that are dead on arrival. Kung pao shrimp with beet coins and raw mushrooms tasted like ketchup. Sweet-and-sour pork ribs with preserved plums were as sweet as if they’d been stewed in Dr Pepper, and a dusting of powdered sugar at the table didn’t help. Little teepees of Ibérico ham came wrapped around cold, dry wads of sticky rice. Champagne-glazed tomatoes were sweet enough to serve for dessert, and the “crispy mushroom salad” they were stuffed with wasn’t crisp and didn’t particularly taste like mushrooms. Shiny and red as candied apples, the tomatoes were at least pretty to look at. Nearly everything I ate at DaDong was. The kitchen, led by Andy Xu, a veteran of Atlantic Grill and Blue Fin, certainly shows attention to the details of presentation. Occasionally, it sends out something that lives up to its appearance. A perfectly clear globe of ice, to be cracked with a spoon, kept soy-marinated ribbons of geoduck deliciously cold. Braised sea cucumber in a glossy soy-based sauce hit all the right sticky and soft marks. My favorite dish may be the seafood variation on the Sichuan classic Chongqing chicken called Hot and Spicy Lobster: a cut-up lobster stir-fried with nearly enough dried chiles to fill a pillowcase. A close second is the baby cabbage, sliced into threads and braised with chestnuts in saffron sauce. Whatever is causing the kitchen’s reach-grasp ratio to break down doesn’t seem to have affected the desserts. There is a fine plate of Beijing snacks, dense little half-sweet cakes made of lotus root, red beans, yellow split peas and so on. I enjoyed popping tiny seashells of white chocolate into my mouth to find out what each was filled with: Nutmeg? Tangerine? Wasabi? The simplest, though, the ice cream with an alluringly bitter edge of dried tangerine peel, was also the most rewarding. Servers sometimes seemed to be reading dish descriptions from a teleprompter, but they made up for that with a care and attentiveness that felt unforced. The sommeliers were particularly good at interpreting the wine list, which is well-rounded and can be quite reasonable. This list would get your attention almost anywhere, but in a Chinese restaurant in New York, it’s a treasure. But even the most gently priced bottle can go only so far to smooth over the potholes on the menu, and the suspicion that the best Peking duck in Beijing has turned into something that would struggle to stand out in Parsippany.

51,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,2 star,"Feb. 27, 2018",Pete Wells,Chelsea,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/dining/latelier-de-joel-robuchon-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/dining/latelier-de-joel-robuchon-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon may be the world’s most expensive restaurant chain. Each time I ate in the newest one, which opened across 10th Avenue from Chelsea Market in November, I listened to people around me compare notes on which of the 11 other locations they’d visited. Tokyo was popular, as were Las Vegas and, of course, the original in Paris. As they reeled off their Atelier achievements, these people always sounded contented. And it must be soothing to know that as you travel the world you will find an Atelier waiting for you to climb up on a comfortable red leather stool, watch the cooks dressed in what look like black pajamas, admire the slightly supernatural colors of the vegetables and fruits submerged in water inside glass vases, recline into a menu filled with Robuchon classics and small variations on the same key ingredients (eggplant, quail, squab, lobster), all at prices that most people can’t afford, but you can. Lulling familiarity was not Joël Robuchon’s aim when he built the first Atelier almost 15 years ago. Having won just about every honor the French gastronomic world offers at his first restaurant, he had officially retired, and when he came back it was only to knock the whole system on its side. His idea was a restaurant where the food, made to his excruciatingly precise standards, would be served not at tables but at a U-shaped counter. The format may have been borrowed from Japan or Spain, but in France the effect was radical, as were the late-night closing hours and no-reservations policy. The proof of L’Atelier’s success is how un-shocking this sounds today. Early on, as R.W. Apple reported in The New York Times, the prices could be modest “if you avoid caviar and foie gras.” This was less true by the time of L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon’s initial New York run, at the Four Seasons Hotel in Midtown from 2006 to 2012, where Frank Bruni awarded it three stars. I remember feeling distinct pain there each time I paid the check. I also remember a stunned awareness that I’d do it again. I had had no idea anything could taste as good as the simple combination of a langoustine and a basil leaf inside a see-through wrapper of fried brik pastry, or the far more complex glass of sea urchin suspended in lobster jelly under a quarter-inch of cauliflower cream that was like an insanely luxurious Jell-O salad. Nothing on the menu at the new Atelier spun my senses around like those two dishes, not even the langoustine, which is on the menu there, too, but seems to have lost the juicy sweetness I remembered. The kitchen, directed by Christophe Bellanca, shows impressive discipline. (It serves not just L’Atelier but a second restaurant, Le Grill de Joël Robuchon, which sits up front overlooking 10th Avenue.) Not one dot of sauce, and there are many, is out of place. But some crucial connection has been lost, the spontaneity and directness that was, I think, the point of the Atelier experiment. Out of three dinners, my first was the most patchy. A $44 pair of mini-burgers topped with foie gras were more like an expensive caterer’s trick than a Robuchon brain wave. A vaguely spiced mush of eggplant under a runny boiled egg, for $32, was so unappealing I couldn’t finish it. Things got better from there, and sometimes much better, though rarely much cheaper. Those two dishes were what the menu calls “small tasting portions,” and as you’d imagine, the appetizers and main courses come with higher prices. Three tasting menus, from $145 to $325, are not particular bargains. (Taking some of the edge off, service is included.) Mr. Bellanca and his crew are at their best with careful refinements of classic French cooking. Slabs of roasted duck breast with cracked pepper and kumquat preserves, which I had in a main-course portion for $64, did everything you’d want canard à l’orange to do, and did it with style and confidence. There was a handsomely improved $42 blanquette of veal cheeks with tender-crisp vegetables and a little disc of buttered rice pilaf. The beef tartare is chopped to little pieces but not beyond, smoothed with egg yolk, dressed with enough mustard to make it stand out in a crowd, and served with the fries that McDonald’s sells only in my dreams. It comes close to being a model of the form in every way except the price, $52. The $34 beet salad was full of adventure, starting with a throat-catching scoop of green-mustard sorbet and continuing with some of those famous Robuchon dots, each of which turned out to be a perfectly delicious sauce made from, say, green apples or avocado. But not many other dishes seemed interested in startling anyone. The most spectacular thing I ate did not come from the kitchen but from the bakery downstairs. Tetsuya Yamaguchi, who has been tending yeast in Mr. Robuchon’s empire for two decades, is now stationed in the basement on 10th Avenue. His masterpiece is called the escargot, a swirl of savory brioche dough with olive oil between its many warm and flaky layers. He also bakes baguettes that seem to be shrunken versions of full-scale ones; at that size they could be all crust, but somehow he keeps the crust in proportion with the rest, and they are a joy to eat. Meanwhile the pastry chef, Salvatore Martone, is making some of the finest and airiest chocolate soufflés in the city, like dark-chocolate vapor tricked into solid form. He disguises a tarte Tatin as a shiny red Snow White apple; in another optical illusion, he fashions a replica of a lemon out of blown sugar, then fills it with lemon sorbet, and while I wished it tasted as much like lemon as it looked, it was a good dessert. Those are Mr. Martone’s excellent chocolates that show up around the same time as the check, and his kugelhopf that will be waiting for you in a Robuchon shopping bag by the coat check in case you want to start the next day with a custard cake, and why wouldn’t you? The service strikes a rare balance of charm and formality that was missing from the uptown location. There will be smiles when you get there, and smiles later when you whisk your kugelhopf off to wherever it is you go with your kugelhopfs. Whether this is a restaurant for you is first of all a question of money; there is no way to eat a satisfying meal at L’Atelier without spending a lot of it. If the prices don’t bother you, then neither should my nagging sense that the cooking is not as exciting as it could be. Nobody goes to chains, even expensive ones, for new sensations.

52,Tetsu,2 star,"Feb. 20, 2018",Pete Wells,TriBeCa,"American, Japanese",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/dining/tetsu-review-tribeca-masayoshi-takayama.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/dining/tetsu-review-tribeca-masayoshi-takayama.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"When word went around almost six years ago that Masayoshi Takayama was going to bring one of his Las Vegas restaurants, Tetsu, to TriBeCa, I can’t say that my heart began to pound to the bongo beat of “Viva Las Vegas.” In fact, I braced for the worst. Eating in that city can be a wild ride, but the dining rooms often have an oversize, mall-like scale and the menus a safe, something-for-everyone vagueness — qualities that, transplanted to New York, can be real buzzkills. As far as restaurants go, what happens in Vegas should usually stay in Vegas. But a lot has happened in the past six years. Some is too painful to recount, but luckily not the story of the Tetsu on Leonard Street, which finally opened in November. It has little in common with the Nevada iteration, which will close in April. The animating idea there was teppanyaki, sizzled on flattop steel grills set into big half-moon tables that cooks stood behind, like blackjack dealers. But Mr. Takayama dropped that notion in Manhattan; now his menu is dominated by food prepared on robata grills operated behind a dining counter, supplemented widely by other techniques: raw seafood, soups, slaws, fried stuff. The roomy, half-empty white-and-beige interior of the casino Tetsu looks nothing like the shadowy and thickly settled Leonard Street Tetsu. Iron columns, steel seats, brick walls and wood floorboards give the place the look of an after-hours downtown lounge from a few years ago, before Industrial got self-conscious and became Steampunk. The prices are also much lower than they were in Las Vegas, or in a sample menu Mr. Takayama floated for TriBeCa in 2012. Only a handful of items on the two-page dinner menu cost more than $20. Can this be the same chef who collects $595 a person, before tax, for dinner at Masa? Who sells a bowl of chopped tuna belly with caviar for $68 next door at BarMasa and $78 at Kappo Masa, across town? One and the same. True, Tetsu specializes in small plates, but then none of Mr. Takayama’s other restaurants are particularly known for supersizing. What Tetsu does differently is to put away the luxury ingredients that are so central to Masa’s experience and image. At last, New York has a chance to see just how good Mr. Takayama is when he isn’t hiding behind truffles and caviar. He can, in fact, make less expensive seafood taste as precious as sturgeon roe. During the bay scallop season, which has an annoying habit of ending before I have eaten enough of them, Tetsu seared them with skinny lengths of asparagus and sent them out with garlic-anchovy oil and lime juice, simmering in a hot bowl. I will be marking this on the calendar so I don’t miss it next winter. For now there is a similar dish that operates on the same principle: tender, palm-size whole octopus sizzled in butter and lime with garlic, chopped cilantro and strands of a green Korean chile. The biggest surprise was how much I liked the salads. The menu calls them slaws, which goes a long way toward repairing some of the injuries that word has absorbed over the decades. There is a superb one with fresh kale and fried burdock in an unexpectedly Southeast Asian lemongrass dressing, and another of cabbage and roasted duck stirred with, yes, mayonnaise. (No supermarket mayo, it’s flavored with fresh orange juice and sherry vinegar.) If there was yuzu in the yuzu-daikon slaw, though, it had walked off the job the night I tried it. Items from the robata, supposedly the heart of the restaurant, were more variable than you would hope. My table went quietly wild for the soy-marinated quail eggs and the pink pork sausage with flecks of yellow and green Thai chiles. Skewered coconut shrimp received polite nods. When you get the menu, though, your eyes will automatically go straight to the raw seafood, and they probably should. It appears twice, the first time in chilled appetizers that can share some of Masa’s delicacy and subtle use of spice. Speckles of finely minced jalapeños dot little pearly pink bites of hamachi; in a more ordinary case, wasabi has been quickly grated over hunks of yellowfin tuna with a spoonful of simple guacamole. Raw seafood reappears at the end of the menu as hand rolls and nigiri. Here I have a confession to make: Almost all of my outer-stratosphere moments at Masa happened before the barrage of sushi that ends the meal. Near the end of the game comes a mesmerizing hand roll stuffed with meltingly fatty tuna belly, but the nigiri on its own it would probably not land Masa in my top tier of sushi destinations. That is roughly my feeling about the sushi at Tetsu. Although the contrast there is less extreme, its nigiri can be inconsistent and is best employed as a short and satisfying last stop, not as the main event. Should you forge on to dessert, you’ll find that the pastry chef (Matthew O’Haver, who doubles as the service director) does outstanding work: a plate-wide slice of grilled olive oil cake next to a thick stripe of tangy mascarpone; a brownielike chocolate cake made with black-sesame paste and topped with a powerfully appealing miso-caramel sauce; a green-peppercorn ice cream that clamps fire and ice together in a single rich scoop. At lunch, the menu is snipped from two pages to one. A little bit is subtracted from each category and two new ones are added: burgers and bowls of squiggly yellow ramen. The ramens are a little smaller and more refined than usual, which may not be top priorities for the average ramen fiend. But given how low in salt and fat they were, relatively speaking, I was impressed by how much flavor made its way into the miso ramen with chashu and the shoyu ramen with very, very good braised short rib. Tetsu’s burgers are cooked in a heated metal contraption with spikes that pierce the meat. Mr. Takayama designed it. I have not seen it, but it sounds like an iron maiden for the stovetop. The spikes are supposed to heat the interior, but the two burgers I’ve had were very rare with a notably dark sear. But the results were very different. I had an immediate, lingering, intensely positive reaction to the lamb burger under melted taleggio, but I would not order the underseasoned and pulpy beef burger with Cheddar again. The kitchen may also need more practice on the skinny fries — “Tetsu fries”. Once they were gold and cooked to a fine crackle; another time they were ghostly pale and limp. The lunch service is new and still fairly quiet. Dinner, though, can be a racket. If it’s just you, or you and a friend, sitting at the long counter made from a single plank of bubinga wood offers the best shot at privacy. Placed at one of the communal tables in back one night, I ended up next to a group that kept rowdily showing off its expensive wines.

53,Hwa Yuan Szechuan,2 star,"Feb. 13, 2018",Pete Wells,Chinatown,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/dining/hwa-yuan-szechuan-review-chinese-food.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/dining/hwa-yuan-szechuan-review-chinese-food.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I had eaten approximately 300 miles of cold sesame noodles before I knew they had a story. If I’d thought about them at all, I would have reflected that everything has a story, but I didn’t. Back in the 1980s, when I came to New York, they were simply a thing you had to order with Chinese takeout because somebody always wanted them, even though they usually tasted like leftover spaghetti with Skippy. Before this, though, cold sesame noodles in New York were the specialty of one particular Sichuan-born chef, Yu Fa Tang. Called Shorty by everybody, Tang came here in the early ’60s after working for more than a decade in Taiwan. By 1967 he had his own restaurant on East Broadway, Hwa Yuan Szechuan Inn, where among other renditions of Sichuanese food he made cold sesame noodles that would lodge themselves in the memories of generations of New Yorkers and be imitated, lamentably, by takeout cooks all over town. At its peak it reportedly went through 500 pounds of noodles a day. For more details on the background of the dish and its life after the restaurant closed, I refer you to a 2007 treatise that Sam Sifton wrote in The New York Times Magazine. For a taste of the original and unexpurgated recipe, I refer you to the very good new restaurant that opened on the site of the original in October. Its name now shortened to Hwa Yuan Szechuan, it is worth visiting for reasons that go well beyond nostalgia. Hwa Yuan is an imposing restaurant, built by Shorty’s son Chien Lieh Tang and his grandson James Tang to plant the family name solidly in this century. To the left of the entrance is a lounge where translucent backlit panels cast everything in a streaked-marmalade glow. Straight ahead is the first dining room, and there are more up the stairs to the right. The tables sit under white cloths, and the places are set with white china traced with gold. To the right of the plates are two pairs of chopsticks on a white-china rest, one for serving and the other for eating. Needless to say, the cold sesame noodles are mandatory, at least on a first visit. They are, for one thing, truly cold. Not left-out-on-the-counter cold, but trickling-mountain-spring cold. The temperature accentuates their smooth surface and, like the slivers of cucumber, makes the small zap of chile oil call out more clearly. The first time I ate them the sauce needed a little more salt and vinegar, but the next time it had a finely balanced tension. If you know only the sugary peanut-butter imitation, tasting Hwa Yuan’s original must be like hearing Van Morrison for the first time when you’ve grown up on Ed Sheeran. Chien Lieh Tang is the chef at the resurrected Hwa Yuan, and although his cooking is not hard to appreciate, a little orientation may help. First, a warning: Those who believe that the only good Sichuan food makes you weep, sniffle, moan, call 911 or crawl under the table will need to adjust their standards. Hwa Yuan serves many family recipes that reflect an earlier stage of Sichuan cooking and Shorty Tang’s time in Taiwan. While chiles are often present, they rarely dominate. Nor does the kitchen try to lard extra umami into every dish. The best food at Hwa Yuan tries to impress through charm, not arm-twisting. Family pride being the point here, dishes that carry the names Tang or Hwa Yuan tend to be excellent. Not, I’m afraid, the Hwa Yuan dry-aged shell steak, which got impressive flavor from basting with marrow but was knotted with tough membranes when I tried it. But Tang’s Amazing Spicy Wine Chicken was a treat, very tender hunks of dark meat in a delicate sauce of Shaoxing rice wine, bean paste and chile oil. Tang’s Amazing Tofu was a minor discovery, seared squares of pressed tofu with fresh green chiles in a sauce that’s more interesting than you’d guess from its pale tan color. Hot Tang Tang noodles may sound like cold sesame noodles run through the microwave; they are something completely different, short strands of noodle in a steaming cup of sour-and-spicy broth that has a businesslike edge of roasted dried chiles. And Whole Fish with Hot Bean Sauce, Tang Family Creation is a bona fide star, the dish I know I’ll order again even if I’m not in the mood for cold noodles. It had a devoted following at the original restaurant, where it was made with carp. Now it is barramundi, precisely cooked and resting in a rusty mash of chile oil, fermented soybeans and chopped scallions. It’s a forceful dish that’s still noteworthy for its balance. As for the Hwa Yuan crab cake, I have no idea whether it lives up to the name. The kitchen was always out of it, along with such other intrigues as duck liver pâté and foie gras with fruit. The other major warning: My Peking duck did not deserve the fanfare it gets on the menu, where it is called Beijing duck. I phoned ahead to reserve a duck and a half for a large group, was told on arrival that the half duck wasn’t available, settled for the whole duck, and found that it wasn’t worth ordering in advance, or the $65 it cost. The carving was imprecise enough to make me glad it was only a roast duck under the knife and not a heart-surgery patient, and while the meat was juicy, pink and flavorful, the skin was flabby and as crisp as boiled spinach. Less heralded menu entries warrant a look, though. There is no reason to believe that soup dumplings, which arrived in New York by way of Shanghai long after Shorty Tang’s heyday, will be any good at Hwa Yuan. They are. So are the thick and juicy pan-fried dumplings. I can never resist snow-pea shoots, and have never come across any as delicious as Hwa Yuan’s. The dry-sautéed string beans are about average, but stir-fried brussels sprouts with bacon is a rewarding variation on Sichuanese cabbage with pork. Sichuan cooks seem to have a special understanding of potatoes, which may explain why the little marble-size ones here, cooked kung pao style with peanuts and dried chiles, are so unusually good. I hope to fake my way into reproducing the dish at home, which would make me the latest in a long line of Hwa Yuan imitators. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

54,"The Aviary NYC, The Office NYC",2 star,"Feb. 6, 2018",Pete Wells,Upper West Side,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/dining/grant-achatz-office-aviary-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/dining/grant-achatz-office-aviary-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Among his other innovations, Grant Achatz is a pioneer in menu typography. At Alinea, in Chicago, courses on his tasting menus used to be printed in a long, snaking column; sweeter dishes drifted out to the right margin and more savory ones swayed left. At the Aviary, the willfully atypical cocktail lounge he founded in Chicago in 2011, the name of each drink is preceded by a bird silhouette like the ones on the endpapers of Roger Tory Peterson’s field guides. The nearer the silhouette is to the name, the more the cocktail will resemble something Nick and Nora Charles would have recognized. The farther away the bird, the weirder the drink. During my first flight at the Aviary’s new Manhattan incarnation, my server pointed to the entry for Bring Another Smurf, a mezcal and coconut drink. “If you look over here,” he said, sliding his finger left, “the bird is all the way out.” Is a cocktail improved when its bird is all the way out? The question pecked at me each time the elevator let me out on the 35th floor of the Mandarin Oriental New York, site of the Aviary NYC and its quieter, shadow-filled sibling, the Office NYC. It also is originally from Chicago, where Mr. Achatz and his partner, Nick Kokonas, have built one superb, genre-bending establishment after another. For years they have flirted with New York. It took a hotel deal to get them here. The cloned Aviary and Office are undeniably expressions of Mr. Achatz’s aesthetic, with his fondness for Rube Goldberg devices, audience participation, old ideas tilted off their usual axis and novel ideas launched into orbit. The wildest notions are reserved for drinks in the Aviary. Mr. Achatz’s food plays second fiddle in both rooms, and plays it beautifully. Yet neither space really shows off his full powers. In this perch above Central Park, the bird is half out — or, if you look at a different way, half in. Like many Aviary drinks, the one called Science A.F. (ostensibly a reference to the microbiologist Alexander Fleming) is made at the table. A small blue flame compels Scotch and other ingredients in the lower chamber of a vacuum coffee maker to ascend to an upper chamber filled with fruit tea, as dry-ice fog carpets the table. This took about five minutes and produced something that tasted like the fruit punch that might be served at a convention for designated drivers. It does not quite give you your bird’s worth, I think. On the other hand, I admired the balance and complexity of the Wake and Bake, a mutant rye manhattan made with coffee- and orange-flavored vermouth. What I can’t imagine ever loving is being asked by a server to stick my head inside the inflated plastic bag in which it is served, to see that it really did smell like an everything bagel. It did, but it was one of several moments when I felt like a parent helping the Aviary staff to complete a project for the science fair. After a round or two, the alert drinker may become gun-shy. A friend I’d invited for lunch gamely sipped a Boom Goes the Dynamite, which had never cooled below tepid despite having fumed vigorously from the dry ice inside its laboratory flask. Leaving a third undrunk, she asked for a Bloody Mary. “Our Bloody Mary is very unique,” our server said brightly. “It takes about 15, 20 minutes to make.” “Is it served ... cold?” my friend asked, hope flickering weakly in her voice. It was. A few minutes later, a relatively traditional Bloody was poured over many tiny ice marbles inside the bowl of what looked like a small spittoon. Around the spittoon’s broad brim were arranged five garnishes, or side dishes, or condiments, including chopped razor clam with celery sorbet and a little pillbox of horseradish jelly. When we were alone again, she sighed and said, “I was hoping for a glass.” The Aviary’s Bloody Mary, by the way, costs $38.  We had come to try the daytime menu the Aviary recently introduced after two months or so of nighttime-only business. While the drinks gave us a bumpy ride, all was smooth once we embarked on the three-course, $45 lunch, starting with a roasted squash soup and a salad. Both had pieces of fruit and vegetable that had somehow been talked into tasting like more than they were. Finally there was a sandwich of fried, buttermilk- and yuzu-brined chicken thigh with pickles and shredded iceberg lettuce on a bun with more sesame seeds to the square inch than I’ve ever seen. The dressing was a toasted sesame sauce, and, like everything else about the sandwich, it was excellent. Apart from a fried pork rind the size of a dish towel, the items on the evening menu are generally wispy: a single, wonderful tempura shrimp with slices of yuzu-scented pear; an octopus croquette under streamers of bonito. There is one of Mr. Achatz’s earliest inventions, the raviolo filled to the bursting point with black-truffle broth. It is still a marvel. There was only one dish I did not like, but boy, did I not like it: cold pork belly in a bland goo of banana curry, sandwiched between flat discs of iceberg lettuce. These plates run from $11 to $29. Two or three would make for an interesting postcard from the inside of Mr. Achatz’s head. Ordering the whole roster would leave you a couple hundred dollars poorer and no wiser, though. The menu is not designed for that kind of eating. Neither is the Aviary, although it’s hard to say just what it is designed for. Deals between chefs and hotels invariably entail compromise, but Mr. Achatz and Mr. Kokonas may have given up too much here. Sunk a few steps below the hotel lobby and dominated by a view of the Central Park skyline, the space is an awkward combination of destination and waiting room. Achatz devotees who paid for their spots weeks earlier through Mr. Kokonas’s reservations and guest-tracking service, Tock, may find themselves at curved leather lounge chairs next to hotel guests taking phone calls between meetings. There’s no sense of arrival, nothing to suggest you’re entering the domain of a restaurant group that has always refused to do things the usual way.  You do get that sense when you enter the Office. The Chicago Office is downstairs from the Aviary; in New York it is behind a wooden door just past the Aviary’s cocktail-assembly station. Suddenly faceless hotel luxury gives way to a den of leather club chairs, parquet floors, clothbound books, manual typewriters, contemporary art, eccentric antiques. The two Offices are usually called speakeasies. This one looks to me more like the library of stately Wayne Manor. The theme is tradition. This being an Achatz project, the theme is pushed to its limits and beyond. Micah Melton, the beverage director of both lounges (in both cities), scours auctions and private sales for old bottles of spirits. Some of the older ones go here for $500 an ounce or more, straight up. Others are mixed into what the menu calls “dusty bottle cocktails.” As a way to get rid of money, this is both alluring and appalling. I couldn’t bring myself to order a $475 old-fashioned stirred from bourbon bottled in 1969. But I couldn’t resist learning what happens when 75 grams of shaved truffle soak in a bottle of Chartreuse. (It’s fascinating, but not more delicious than untruffled Chartreuse.) The short food menu appears to have been printed by letterpress. On it are a number of time-honored plutocratic pleasures, such as cold oysters, foie gras terrine, and a really fine and forcefully seasoned tartare of ivory-veined rib-eye. Steamed mussels in cream with leeks and bacon are $35. If any pot of mussels is worth that much money, this is it. Vegetable crudités may sound like nothing. They’re very much something, a miniature forest of fruits and vegetables treated this way and that, then set on chipped ice with a dip — a harmonious, understated vadouvan-squash cream the last time I went. The contortions that Mr. Melton and Mr. Achatz put liquor through at the Aviary are as imaginative as cuisine gets; they probably have more freedom than they would if the place were a restaurant. But rather than asking how a Bloody Mary, say, can be improved, or what its essence is, they seem to ask: How would the Aviary serve it? The answer always seems to require equipment. The bird-all-the-way-out drinks especially are like elaborate magic tricks with metal boxes into which the beautiful assistant will vanish. Somehow, the boxes upstage the assistant. The cocktails at the Office are more like close-up card tricks. My favorite is: Mix me a drink and I’ll make it disappear. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

55,The Lobster Club,1 star,"Jan. 30, 2018",Pete Wells,Midtown East,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/dining/the-lobster-club-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/dining/the-lobster-club-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"One thing that sets Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone apart from other very talented chefs is how happy they seem to be creating restaurants that are not about them, or even primarily about cooking. While their peers were putting their kitchen skill front and center, through tasting menus or through restaurants where decoration was minimal and amenities were pared back until there was almost nothing left but the plates, they went in the opposite direction. From their first restaurant, Torrisi Italian Specialties, inside a fake Italian grocery store, their places have been highly distracting in ways that serious chefs tend to shun. The interiors are ornamental and over the top; the servers are dressed in uniforms that we might as well call costumes; the playlists are what your friend for whom entertaining is a life-or-death matter would put together for a highly specific theme party. Other chefs would have worried that their precious food would be overshadowed by the rest of the production. Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Carbone always seemed confident that wasn’t going to happen. Before they opened their Japanese restaurant, the Lobster Club, they were right. Now two months old, the Lobster Club is the third and final stage in the annexation of the Seagram Building’s dining spaces by the Major Food Group, run by the two chefs and Jeff Zalaznick. The first two stages were the Grill and the Pool, carved out of what used to be the Four Seasons. The Lobster Club sits under the Pool in a space that was originally a 24-hour brasserie. Vintage East Siders such as Peter Marino, the architect who designed the Lobster Club, still talk about dropping into the Brasserie for onion soup after writhing the night away at Studio 54. Mr. Marino apparently wanted to bring the party back. From the top of the stairs just inside the entrance, on East 53rd Street, a scene from Fellini seems to be playing out. A big square lounge in the middle of the room is bounded by zebra-striped panels of white ebony. Spurts and dribbles of paint cover the floor and the black trousers that some of the servers are wearing. It looks as if Jackson Pollock were called back for one last job. On the walls are prints Mr. Marino made from paintings he owns. The originals were painted by Richard Prince, modeled on paintings by Picasso. The Prince Picasso-painting prints have themselves been painted, gone over by Mr. Marino with thick pigment in a completely different style. Marvin Gaye is singing. He wants everybody to know that sexual healing is something that is good for him. Round tables are surrounded by pink lounge chairs that look, from behind, like enormous cartoon lips. The booths are upholstered in a chartreuse camouflage pattern, a useful fabric if the Army ever needs to hide in a green neon jungle. Blending in at the Lobster Club in winter means fur coats and designer sweaters. A man with silver hair, a double-breasted blazer and a pocket square is circling the perimeter, swiveling his head, an eager expression in his eyes, as if he had been told there would be a limbo pole. On the right, a big group is sitting around a skinny table that can be partitioned from the rest of the dining area by drawing a floor-to-ceiling curtain, as in an operating room. The curtain is made of black leather. All the bartenders are dressed like leather daddies. Isaac Hayes is singing now. He has some thoughts to share about a black private dick who’s a sex machine to all the chicks. What kind of Japanese restaurant is this? It would need to be a sensational one to compete with the rest of the goings-on. It is not. In fact, the Lobster Club seems to be making an effort not to be sensational. The cooking, as a whole, suggests Japanese food as seen through American eyes at some point in the recent past. There is no soup, no noodles, no tofu and few vegetables. But there is salmon teriyaki, made more meticulously than any I’ve ever seen, with a dark-pink medium-rare core and a translucent, unsyrupy glaze. The core of the menu is steak and seafood cooked on a teppan, the steel grill introduced to the United States by the original Benihana, which by the way is still in business a few blocks away. Not that Lobster Club is an explicit homage. If its cooks are juggling spatulas and flipping shrimp into the air, they are doing it behind closed kitchen doors. My Wagyu skirt steak was a far better product than anything I remember from Benihana. Ditto the teppanyaki king mushroom stems that accompanied it along with more shishito peppers than I needed and more sauces than I can name. The mustard miso was my favorite with steak; for grilled scallops, I would go with the yuzu chimichurri. Tasuku Murakami, the executive chef, was highly regarded during his time behind the counter at Sushi Azabu, in TriBeCa. He has his seafood shipped in from Japan, including seasonal treats like black-throat sea perch and tiny white shrimp called shiro-ebi. He, or one of his followers, carves it with finesse and sets it over a wad of rice that I wished were a little warmer and more strongly vinegared. The style is very traditional, except for the rolls that combine, say, fried oysters with Wagyu. The à la carte prices are on average slightly higher than at slightly better places such as 15 East. It would be silly not to try some sushi at the Lobster Club, and just as silly to travel there for it. Two skewered appetizers were among my favorite things on the menu. One is the pork belly, lightly browned on the grill and then half-buried under a chopped pineapple sauce. The other is the tsukune, or chicken meatball, which is richer than you expect thanks to an unadvertised, invisible but very noticeable addition of foie gras. Some of Mr. Murakami’s appetizers struck me as barely Japanese at all. Certain raw fish dishes could be served at any number of New York restaurants, like slices of sea bass showered with brittle strands of fried brussels sprouts, or raw cherry trout twirled around crunchy nests of fried potato threads. Both are fine things to eat, by the way. The one called wok lobster — battered and fried lobster tail pieces in a sweet-and-sour sauce — seems very Chinese. It is also very oily, like the fried rock shrimp and the teppanyaki garlic rice, which will ooze oil as you watch. “I didn’t expect it to remind me of Ruby Foo’s,” said a stranger who stopped by my table on her way out. (This kind of thing is always happening at the Lobster Club.) I think I knew what she meant. If you order the wrong things the food can be surprisingly heavy, and no matter what you eat you can’t quite avoid a sense that this place doesn’t take its supposed inspiration as seriously as it could. Then again, it is one of the only places in the city where you can end a meal with steamed black-sugar cakes, soft and homey and rarely seen outside their hometown, Okinawa. And it is among the few to serve kakigori, a mountain of shaved ice. Stephanie Prida, the pastry chef, soaks it with blood orange-syrup on one side and condensed milk on the other. As soon as one table orders it, everybody else in the vicinity wants one. I’ve never seen anybody finish it. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

56,Ferris,2 star,"Jan. 9, 2018",Pete Wells,Chelsea,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/dining/ferris-review-chelsea.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/dining/ferris-review-chelsea.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Ferris manages to do a lot within the confines of its small space in the basement of the new Made hotel, south of Herald Square. At times it reminded me of one of those Leatherman tools that unfolds to reveal not just a knife and screwdriver but also a spoke wrench, fish scaler, eyelash curler, olive pitter, tuning fork and eel skinner. One recent night I sat at Ferris’s seven-seat kitchen counter. I didn’t realize that I was also sitting at Ferris’s bar until the bartender standing in front of me had measured my drink, strained it into a stem glass and set it on a napkin, all without moving more than one step to the right or left. She had whipped up a citrus-sheathed gin number with a rustle of Chartreuse called a 388 C, and it was about as cheerful a kickoff to the dinner hour as anything I’ve come across lately. In fact, almost all the drinks that Ferris’s bartenders stir up in about four square feet of space are smarter and more bracing than what typically comes out of a full-size bar, and often they are poured into vintage etched glasses that any neo-speakeasy would envy. The cocktails encapsulate Ferris’s most likable traits. It’s a modest restaurant that overdelivers, cares about little details and has a personal, handmade sensibility. It doesn’t quite give you the feeling of showing up at a friend’s place for dinner, but it comes closer than a lot of places where that’s the explicit aim. The illusion is aided by the carpentered interior. The single dining room, clad in raw two-by-eights, could be a suburban basement finished over the weekend by a couple with a table saw. A long cushioned bench built into one end of the room provides about half the seating, along with the stools at high tables and the counter. There’s no lobby or reception area to speak of. If you arrive by elevator you’re facing the kitchen, and if you take the stairs from the sidewalk you walk straight into the action in the dining room. Standing behind the counter and facing the customers is the chef, Greg Proechel. He is generally holding a knife and spends much of the night carving meat. His cooking has settled down since his last job, at Le Turtle, a deliberately odd French spot on Chrystie Street. There, he had some original ideas but didn’t always seem to know the difference between the good ones and the bad ones. At Ferris, his only bad idea so far is trying to make roasted sunchokes into a main course, and by the time I gave up on the plate, filled out with smoked cabbage and sauced with scallion miso, I’d decided that sunchokes themselves were more to blame than Mr. Proechel. He is on firmer ground with other vegetables: Okinawa sweet potatoes, their purple flesh mashed so it opens up to a splash of buttermilk and pumpkin mustard; or roasted beets with soft curls of fresh coconut, dressed in a dark tahini made from black sesame seeds; or charred stalks of broccolini with grapes and cashews (welcome back, cashews, we’ve missed you) scattered over a cushion of yogurt spiced with Timur pepper — a relative of the Sichuan peppercorn. Agnolotti with a buttery and nearly liquid carrot filling are one of Ferris’s more appealing main dishes; they’re tossed with braised lamb neck. Maybe they would be slightly better without chips of crunchy raw carrot on top; contrary to popular belief, not every dish needs what chefs like to call texture. Mr. Proechel has a keen sense for contrasting flavors, though. He uses red pepper and sticky grilled dates to make what has to be the most exciting blood sausage in town. A chunk of grilled mackerel that any izakaya could be proud of sits in ponzu with — surprise — plums and an egg yolk cooked so that it looks and spreads like lemon curd. If you have heard anything at all about Le Turtle, then you know about the Sasso chicken that came to the table on a bed of smoldering hay with its head and feet still attached; it tasted great even though it looked as if the fire department had arrived too late at a four-alarm blaze in a chicken coop. Nothing at Ferris makes heads swivel and nostrils twitch in quite the same way, but if it’s a table-annexing feast you want, then the côte de boeuf with “all the fixings” is the dish for you. Mr. Proechel has his own notions about “fixings.” I have never looked at a grilled beef rib and thought that what it really needed was a bowl of whipped buttermilk, but apparently he has, and I have to give him credit. Beating the buttermilk turns it into something between yogurt and whipped cream; mixing that with charred cipollini makes it into a particularly luxurious onion dip. There’s also a paste of black garlic to serve as a super-concentrated steak sauce, and a shaved brussels sprout salad for relief from the richness. The only false move here was the sodden dumplings in broth, and they were easy enough to ignore in all the excitement. The danger of putting a firecracker like that on the menu is that the half of the dining room that didn’t order it ends up staring glumly at the half that did. That was me, one night, looking at the women at the corner table who doted on their steak for an hour while I poked at my (perfectly all right) cod with clams and hazelnuts. When you are ready for something to drink with the côte de boeuf, you run into another surprise of this Swiss Army knife of a restaurant: the versatile wine list, overseen by Jenny Lakin. It’s not long, and it draws mainly from France and Italy, but it’s been carefully drafted to include relative values from expensive regions and out-and-out values from less traveled areas. Ferris doesn’t knock itself out for the dessert course. The few sweets are simple and pleasant, though, from the yuzu-lemon frozen yogurt to a dark chocolate mousse stuck with chips of jasmine meringue. Ms. Lakin’s list carries over into dessert territory with amari, absinthes, liqueurs, eaux-de-vie and other end-of-the-night shots. Where all these bottles are stored I never figured out.

57,The Loyal,2 star,"Dec. 26, 2017",Pete Wells,Greenwich Village,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/dining/the-loyal-review-nyc.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/dining/the-loyal-review-nyc.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Usually, I can take or leave the slice of tomato that comes with almost every burger in America. The tomato at John Fraser’s latest restaurant, the Loyal, is the first one I’ve ever met that helps the burger so much that it becomes the whole point. Mr. Fraser calls it a “22-step tomato.” And thereby hangs a tale, no doubt, but in the interest of time let’s skip to the finished product: a peeled plum tomato collapsed down to a red cushion that more or less covers the patty. It’s juicy but not gushy, tart and sweet and complex, so it does some of the work normally done by ketchup, but it’s more dynamic and delicious. You could eat it on its own, but it completes the somewhat austere flavor of the beef from a Piedmontese cattle breed. Even under a melted sheet of Comté, the patty is not as woozily rich as many contemporary chef-burgers. In all, it’s an ingenious notion from a chef who is on his fourth current restaurant and seems to be in no imminent danger of running out of ideas. The Loyal switched on the lights over its red awning on Bleecker Street in September. Unlike the last two places Mr. Fraser opened, which have themes — Nix is vegetarian and Narcissa’s menu revolves around the rotisserie — the Loyal is a free-for-all. It has one of those overpopulated menus that borrows from brasseries, trattorias and mainstream American taverns. Cold seafood and snack sections run in a skinny column on the left side, across from a long scroll of appetizers, pastas and main courses. All this may cause eye fatigue long before you get to the crawl of side dishes at the bottom of the page. The something-for-everybody menu works, in the sense that by around 6:30 p.m. it starts to appear as if everybody has decided to eat there at once: bachelorette-party celebrators in plastic tiaras; people who look like artists and people who look like art collectors; older couples gaping in amusement at younger couples who have no idea they’re being gaped at. “What brings all these people here?” somebody at my table asked a server. She thought about it and shrugged. “Michelin-star chef?” One of Mr. Fraser’s two stars went to Nix and the other to Dovetail, his first restaurant as chef and owner, and his most formal. The Loyal is slightly formal itself. Wine bottles rest on polished steel coasters, and servers sweep crumbs from the white tablecloths after every course. Home Studios designed the dining room after the style of a 1950s nightclub, with leather booths and banquettes and one round table up front half-secluded in a cove of mirrors and marble that looks as if it is reserved for Walter Winchell. The formality is a peculiarly high-decibel variety. Enhanced by clever but not overly wonky cocktails, people strain to talk over music that is never soft, even early at night before the room fills up. At times I wanted to stuff my ears with the Parker House rolls, and at other times, like when Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock rolled into “It Takes Two,” I almost thought the noise was necessary for the interior to make sense. Starting with chilled seafood fits the retro mood of the Loyal. It’s always smart to scoop up bay scallops when they are in their short season, especially as they are done at the Loyal, lounging in their shells in a pool of blood orange-ginger juice that you could drink by the glassful. When scallop season ends, the lobster tail dressed in smoked tomato sauce would make a fine consolation prize, as would the sweet, unrubbery shrimp in a cocktail sauce that leans heavily on Old Bay. The snacks are all over the map. Some borrow from Japan, like the soft-cooked eggs in the style of a ramen shop with red lids of jellied chile oil or the beech mushrooms, fried tempura style, wonderful even if their horseradish-cream sauce wasn’t quite an ideal match. Others come from nearer to home. Molding a pâté of chicken liver so it looks like a stick of butter, then serving it on a glass butter dish, is undeniably a bid for Instagram stardom, but the port wine syrup that surrounded it was so bright and fruity that I couldn’t be grumpy about it. Mr. Fraser is very skilled at getting vegetables to do things they’re not normally inclined to do. Steamed avocado with quinoa sounds like a dish you’d feed your enemies, but while it was on the menu I loved the way it almost melted into its spicy green chermoula sauce. Chayote, rarely an extrovert, got the extra spark it needed from an orange scribble of paprika-piquillo sauce. As partner for a bowl of polenta with truffles, broccoli pesto was unexpectedly sensible. A less eccentric idea, capellini with artichokes, still pulled off some surprises because Mr. Fraser got such bright and lively flavor out of the artichokes. With the main courses, the meal tends to settle down into a routine of standard meats and fish, enlivened by the occasional firecracker side dish. Lamb chops traveled with a terrific rice pilaf, pink with harissa. The burger took not just the 22-step tomato but also a little saucer of potato “tots,” large dice fried in duck fat. The starch for the hanger steak was potato purée with lobster gravy, which may not be the highest use of lobster but is almost certainly the highest use of gravy. Knowing that early in his career Mr. Fraser worked in an ice-cream parlor makes the heavy presence of sundaes on the dessert menu seem less pandering than it would in another restaurant. Or so I thought until our server told us, in breathy tones, about the “sundae set and candy shop,” a pile of Neapolitan ice cream that comes with Pixy Stix, Chupa Chups, Gummi Bears, gold coins, M&Ms, chocolate pebbles and other sugar bombs. It would be a big hit with children, preferably somebody else’s. My ageless companions enjoyed the Sonoma Harvest sundae instead, with brûléed figs and bits of honeycomb around yogurt and Concord grape sorbets. There’s a very clever baked alaska, too; the toasted meringue is filled with graham-cracker ice cream sitting on a base of chocolate cake, so it tastes like s’mores. The California-based artist Lukas Geronimas has been gradually filling the dining room walls with small, enigmatic paintings over the past few months. The ones toward the front could be illustrations from a book for children about friendly relations among humans, vegetables and farm animals. Toward the restrooms, the relations seem more than friendly. They’d probably be a hit with somebody else’s children, too. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

58,Wallsé,1 star,"Dec. 19, 2017",Pete Wells,West Village,Austrian,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/dining/wallse-review-austrian-restaurant.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/dining/wallse-review-austrian-restaurant.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"On the first undeniably cold night in November, an idea began to take shape in my head. The shape was specific, and it looked like the map of Austria. As in my grade-school geography books, it was illustrated with images of natural resources: amber waves of Wiener schnitzel, nuggets of goulash the color of iron ore, the gentle white slopes of Salzburger nockerl. There is no wrong time of year to eat Austrian food, but the approach of winter always brings it to my mind — a lifelong habit of associating strudel and schnitzel with snowflakes that stay on your nose and eyelashes, thank you very much, Julie Andrews. So when I first saw that map, I knew what it meant: Time to go back to Wallsé. For 17 years, Kurt Gutenbrunner has been serving Austrian cuisine underpinned by farmers’ market produce at Wallsé, in the West Village. It was his first restaurant as chef and owner, the start of a minor Austrian empire that now includes Blaue Gans, where there are more wursts on the menu and more elbows on the tables, and Café Sabarsky in the Neue Galerie museum, where people sit upright over cups of milchkaffee and slim wedges of Linzer torte. Wallsé is still his base camp, where at the end of the night you might see him towering over the second-tallest person at the bar. Imposing as he is, Mr. Gutenbrunner is dwarfed by his own portrait, which hangs across from the bar. Julian Schnabel painted him looking both heroic and angry, surrounded by a lightning-blue nimbus. The blue light may represent the bolts of inspiration that drive Mr. Gutenbrunner to higher and higher creative peaks, although to me it looked as if he had been soaked with kirsch and flambéed. The painting is one of many that have accumulated at Wallsé over the years. Otherwise, the two small rooms look much as I remembered them from my last visit, around the time of its last review in The New York Times, in 2004, when Amanda Hesser gave it two stars. The windows on West 11th Street are still impressively wide; the tablecloths are still white; the chairs are still black, high-backed and convincingly Secession-ish. But furniture was not part of the map that had danced before my eyes. Schnitzel was, and the particular schnitzel I had seen was veal, pounded to the thickness of flannel, inside a rippled crust of crumbs. I wanted to be able to slice it with the side of a fork and hear it crackle. I wanted it with sweet, cool sliced cucumbers, a fingerling potato salad and lingonberries. And that is what I got. Another pressing issue: Was quark spaetzle with braised rabbit still on the menu? It was. Would this warm bowl of buttered noodles, in irregular curves and swoops like some secret alphabet, still make me glad I’d walked this far west facing a chilly wind off the river? It did. The goulash was not the home-style stew I had pictured — it was made from short ribs braised separately before being introduced to a paprika-onion sauce — but it was delicious. The fine produce that I remembered as setting Wallsé apart from more old-school Austrian restaurants was still there, too. Wonderful lobster poached in butter was woven in with small chanterelles and crisp zucchini. Little minarets of romanesco sat alongside the warm smoked char under chopped green apple and trout roe. Wallsé’s Sacher torte has a black-gloss icing made from a darker chocolate than usual, and it’s moister than some versions; it doesn’t necessarily need its little quenelle of whipped cream, but of course Sacher torte that is not served mit schlag is not Sacher torte. As for the triple-mounded soufflé known as Salzburger knockerl, it was better than anything my imagination could have whipped up. Mr. Gutenbrunner’s version looks and tastes like three peach-size toasted marshmallows with small brown peaks, and it sits on a pool of hot dark caramel and huckleberries. All these things are just what I want when I go to Wallsé. But other aspects of my recent meals knocked a little of the shine off the enthusiasm I used to feel. There were dishes that didn’t come off. The next time I tried the goulash it was a venison stew, and each bite was different. A few were tender, but others were hard, dry or gristly. Raw wild bass, with radishes and black sesame seeds, tasted as if its swimming days were a little too far in the past. Savory palatschinken, crepes rolled around smoked trout and horseradish sauce, were fine and lively one night, but on another the cold hand of the refrigerator lay heavily on them. And I tried the Icelandic cod twice without ever learning to like the peculiarly fruity, soupy squash purêe spooned around the fish. Apple strudel fell somewhere between the two extremes. You could certainly pick worse strudels to end the night with, but the pastry was a bit of a nonentity; its flavor almost disappeared into the fruit’s. The service seems to have lost the lightly starched Middle-European rectitude that I remembered. Plates were all set down at the same time, but some were cleared before everyone was finished. There are excellent Austrian bottles on the fairly concise wine list, but with prices that easily drift up above $70, you might wish the servers were better versed on their ins and outs. And it shouldn’t be so easy to be ignored in dining rooms as intimate as Wallsé’s. It wouldn’t take much to pull the lines taut again. And even with these flaws, Wallsé has Old World charm and grown-up civility that aren’t easy to find in the younger restaurants that have cropped up nearby. The things it does well it does better than anybody, which is important to know when you start dreaming about nockerl, followed, of course, by a glass of schnapps.",Quark spaetzle; smoked char; foie gras terrine; butter-cooked lobster; veal Wiener schnitzel; roasted duck; Salzburger nockerl.

59,Jeju Noodle Bar,2 star,"Dec. 5, 2017",Pete Wells,West Village,Korean,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/dining/jeju-noodle-bar-review-korean-ramen.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/dining/jeju-noodle-bar-review-korean-ramen.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Before Jeju Noodle Bar came along in September, avid noodle watchers could have believed that the New York City ramen scene had reached a point of, if not saturation, at least diminishing returns. High-functioning Japanese chains such as E.A.K., Ichiran and Ippudo had established beachheads. Ivan Orkin, Joshua Smookler and other chefs were having their way with the genre, following the trail of noodles left more than a decade ago by a young unknown named David Chang. Ramen tasting menus and ramen isolation booths were thriving along with stand-up and sit-down ramen counters. Appreciation for the finer points of tsukemen and mazemen, of seasoning shio and blending tare, had grown far beyond Japanese expatriates. But fresh wrinkles on the classics were growing rare, while new ramen-yas came along so fast it was getting hard to keep them straight. All that remained, it seemed, was to fill in the blank spaces on the map until bowls of tonkotsu and shoyu ramen were sold everywhere from Tottenville to Gun Hill Road. The one thing this view failed to take into account was the inspiration for Jeju Noodle Bar: Korean ramen. Yes, Koreans eat ramen. Oh, do they. Last year, South Korean domestic demand for ramyun, as it’s known there, reached 1.16 billion pounds, a new high. We know the weight because almost all the ramyun made and eaten in South Korea is the instant variety. This reportedly also holds true in North Korea, where reliable sales figures are harder to come by. In other words, Jeju, in the West Village, is a tribute to a packaged convenience store item made up of a compressed brick of dried or fried noodles and an envelope of powdered or concentrated soup base. Often it is sold and mixed in a disposable cup. As important as ramyun is to the Korean diet, it is not the kind of culinary tradition that typically draws the attention of American chefs who have cooked at Per Se, Bouley and Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare, as Douglas Kim did before founding Jeju. It is somewhat as if a cook had left L’Astrance in Paris to open a restaurant specializing in interpretations of Hot Pockets. To judge from the three soups on Jeju’s menu, Mr. Kim is not trying to reverse-engineer just-add-water Korean brands like Shin and Samyang. All of Jeju’s broths have the body and texture that comes with boiling and skimming for hours over an abundance of meat and bones. One of them, the so ramyun, is made with veal. It is slightly less thick and rich than eggnog, but just as smooth. Mr. Kim ladles this broth over thin squiggles of chewy noodles, a hunk of stewed brisket and thin red sheets of raw Wagyu striated with white fat. Unbashful amounts of garlic chips and black pepper rough up the edges of the broth’s gorgeously rounded beef flavor. The pork soup called gochu ramyun has a similarly lavish texture; heavy on the slippery collagen that holds pigs’ feet together, it glides across your lips. This broth, though, is spicy, and the gochujang spooned over the seared pork belly slab on top makes it even more so. This is Mr. Kim’s most obvious homage to Korean instant ramens, many of which are more fiery than the typical Japanese product. But Korean ingredients and seasonings turn up in all of his ramyuns. The gochu ramyun is garnished with daikon kimchi — not the pink, chili-bathed kind, but an unspiced white kimchi that, like the small sheaf of iceberg lettuce, provides a break from the heat. In contrast to the milky opacity of the veal and pork broths is the translucent, sparkling-gold chicken broth in a ramyun called the Fish Coop. The fish in question is bonito, flakes of which bring a mild background of seafood to the intense chicken flavor. Even with slices of jalapeño and a floating green rim of herb oil tasting of chives and dill, the broth is subtle enough that you can really taste the juicy shreds of chicken confit. Each of the three soups is so carefully considered, so well harmonized, that Jeju’s menu really could end there. But Mr. Kim makes a handful of Korean-inspired appetizers, too, all more nuanced than what you’d find in a typical ramen-ya. I love the cucumber kimchi, skinny little numbers whose soft tartness is almost bubbly and very slightly minty. Is there shiso in the brine? There’s certainly plum in the sweet dressing dotted with black and white sesame seeds. Mr. Kim’s soon du bu doesn’t have the gloom-killing uppercut of more traditional recipes — it’s a little too dainty and mild — but its tomato-shellfish broth supporting the usual soft tofu and some unorthodox but welcome green olives is very good on its own terms. One of three raw-fish appetizers is tuna yuk hwe in a pallid, forgettable dressing. But the amberjack salad with chimichurri and brown-butter vinaigrette is very delicious, as is the hwe dup bap — sashimi and trout roe over warm rice made extra-fishy by tiny black dots of flyingfish roe. There are a few other small dishes, including a likable steamed bun filled with pork belly and corn kernels. It will be interesting to see whether Mr. Kim elaborates this portion of the menu a bit, perhaps adding some larger plates. At the moment, it would be hard to make a complete meal at Jeju without ramyun, which may keep away people who don’t eat meat. Like some other young chefs, Mr. Kim has brought his cooks into the tip pool by asking them to double as waiters. It may help him recruit talent for his kitchen, but it may also be a reason the service is muddled. I’ve been served food meant for another table; I’ve been asked the same question by two people within the space of a minute; I’ve been given empty plates I didn’t need, and had to stop somebody from clearing dishes I hadn’t finished. The confusion even extended to the greeting at the door. One night when I got there before my guests, a host asked how far away everybody else was. I said I was sure they were close. “Well, your reservation was at 8,” was the reply. It was 8:03. These are minor gripes, but Mr. Kim’s cooking deserves better. And so does the dining room, which is roomier and more elegant than the words “noodle bar” might suggest. Jeju took over what used to be Nighthawks, in the space where the north side of Christopher Street meets the east side of Greenwich Street at an acute angle. It isn’t the room Hopper painted, but it’s not far off. Mr. Kim kept the wraparound windows, the black-and-white floor tiles and the recessed tin chandelier rosette, then added some backlighted shelves behind the bar to hold the handmade plates and other pottery. It is all clean and orderly, just bright enough that when you stand across the street you can see the new nighthawks bending over their bowls of noodles.

60,Ugly Baby,2 star,"Nov. 28, 2017",Pete Wells,Carroll Gardens,Thai,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/dining/ugly-baby-review-thai-brooklyn.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/dining/ugly-baby-review-thai-brooklyn.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"If you’ve ever hired a contractor, someone probably told you that you can get work that’s good, fast or cheap, but not all three. This may be an immutable law for kitchen cabinets, but it is not always true of Thai restaurants, as I learned at a new place in Brooklyn with the memorable name Ugly Baby. We were still asking ourselves whether we’d ordered too much when the first plate landed: four little fried coconut cakes, called tue ka ko, with sweet black beans and taro sticks embedded in their tops under a handful of chopped peanuts. Imagine coming across a snack that combines the best qualities of the doughnut, the mini-muffin and Orwashers’ toasted-coconut macaroon, and finding it not at some hipster’s stand at Smorgasburg but on a dim sum trolley, and you have a pretty good idea of Ugly Baby’s tue ka ko. It was the perfect dessert for a meal we hadn’t eaten yet, I decided, just as the next dish touched down. This was kang hoh, rice vermicelli tangled up with tender pork in a tamarind-soured dry curry from northern Thailand. The bits of fried pork skin on top, curled like Fritos, gave me something to munch on while I wondered how much of my tongue the curry would shut down. Not too much, it turned out; the steady drive of the heat just made me want more. But by the time that became clear, the table was full. It had taken about five minutes. Nothing cost more than $25. All of it was very good and a few things were so exceptional that they are now pinned to my map of great Thai dishes in the city, up on the mental wall with such standbys as the duck curry at Ayada and the papaya salad with crispy ground catfish at Sripraphai. Kang kua supparod is one of them. The menu terms it a mushroom pineapple curry, but you will get a sharper idea if you picture mushroom slices and squares of pressed tofu paddling around in a creamy yellow sauce of crushed pineapple and coconut milk. You can see the lime leaves that flavor it, but you only taste the lemongrass, galangal, chiles and other complications. Another is a kao tod nom klook, a warm rice salad with roots in Laos. The rice is cooked with a dry curry and a nontrivial quantity of chiles, then seared to imprint a chewy, golden crust on it. Stirred with short bits of long beans, cilantro, mint, peanuts and, crucially, some tangy pink crumbles of fermented pork sausage, it performs best when wrapped in lettuce with a basil leaf, a dried chile and anything else you happen to discover on the plate. Ugly Baby is in Carroll Gardens, across Smith Street from the hole in the earth where the F and G tracks begin to climb toward their high-rise crawl over the Gowanus Canal. Open since August, the restaurant traces its lineage back to two restaurants that had brief lives not far away in Red Hook. One, Chiang Mai, a pop-up inside another establishment, was supposed to be temporary. The other, Kao Soy, wasn’t, but the two owners found that their partnership was not built for the long haul. What the three restaurants share is Sirichai Sreparplarn. He shared chef duties at the first two and takes the wheel himself at Ugly Baby, which is named after the Thai superstition that evil spirits won’t bother harming unattractive infants. The walls are painted in a James Rosenquist palette with quick, energetic brush strokes. The cooks and servers wear cartoon colored T-shirts, sneakers and aprons, except for the younger cook whose apron is printed with a monochromatic photograph of hand-lettered cassettes. There’s buzzy guitar pop playing at volumes that can make the restaurant sound like a bar, even though the refrigerator at the entrance to the open kitchen isn’t stocked with wine and beer yet. When I reviewed Kao Soy in 2015, Mr. Sreparplarn told me that he and his co-chef were passionate about serving “the real food from the north.” He has let himself have the run of the country at Ugly Baby, although he still gives the north its due. In his larb, made with duck in the style of the Isan city of Udon Thani, smashed dried chiles do not so much coat the meat as embed themselves in it. As you chew, you summon up new waves of heat that the fresh leaves of Vietnamese coriander and bites of raw cabbage and cucumbers can do only so much to mitigate. Its only rival for sheer atomic power comes from southern Thailand. Kua kling is a beef curry that is stir-fried until it is completely dry and there is almost no hope of separating the meat from the chiles. Mr. Sreparplarn’s version is cooked with needles of lime leaf and clusters of green peppercorns on their stalks. I tasted them right away, although it took five minutes before I was able to tell anybody about it. Southern Thai cooking isn’t all scorched earth, though. Ugly Baby has a soothing fried sea bream rubbed with fresh turmeric and garlic, a favorite way to cook fish in that part of the country. Another calming seafood dish, this one from central Thailand, looks like a soup, but its tea-colored broth — soured with tamarind and brightened by sticks of ginger — is simply meant to flavor the fillets of red snapper in it, and keep them hot. Some of these dishes are rare in New York. You can’t say that about the grilled chicken skewers marinated in coconut-peanut sauce, but Ugly Baby’s might be the best available version of the dish, made with meaty thighs instead of stringy white meat. Like Mr. Sreparplarn’s first two restaurants, Ugly Baby serves a rich kao soy, with beef in the coconut broth instead of chicken this time. I have to admit that I miss the crisp haystack of fried noodles and green papaya fritters that the first restaurant piled on top, and I wish Mr. Sreparplarn added in more pickled mustard greens and less chile oil (or served condiments on the side and let you decide how sour and spicy to make the soup, as Kao Soy did). The one dessert, when it is available, is rice pudding with durian. You may love this. Or, like me, you may try a spoonful to see if you still think durian tastes like boiled pearl onions. (Yes.) Or you may want to keep your distance. If you’re in that group, and you haven’t ordered the coconut mini-muffins, now’s your chance. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

61,Cote,2 star,"Nov. 14, 2017",Pete Wells,Flatiron,Korean,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/dining/cote-review-korean-barbecue.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/dining/cote-review-korean-barbecue.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"When a Korean barbecue place wants to set itself apart from all the other Korean barbecue places, it has essentially three variables to play with: meat, heat and sides. (In this way it is similar to American barbecue, which it otherwise doesn’t resemble at all.) Cote, which has been wielding scissors and tongs on West 22nd Street since June, is resoundingly in the meat camp. Specifically, the meat that Cote grills is prime beef aged anywhere from a week to four and a half months in a cooler downstairs, next to a small lounge. Like Gallagher’s, Cote hangs the sirloins, rib-eyes, hangers, skirts and so on behind glass so customers can inspect the inventory. Unlike Gallagher’s, Cote floods the room with light the color of freshly spilled blood, making it look like a set from “American Horror Story: Steakhouse.” The two dining rooms upstairs aren’t nearly as gothic, although they are dark and moody. The walls are painted a deep blue-green, the floors are raw concrete, the tables are black soapstone. It is not exactly a date place — the hard surfaces amplify noise a little too well — but it is not exactly not a date place, either. People dress up to eat at Cote (it sounds like coat), perhaps because the Japanese-built yakiniku grills set into the center of the tables emit almost none of the smoke that can weave its way into your clothes after a night in one of the remaining barbecue palaces on 32nd Street. After taking cocktail orders (the rosé slushie, decorated with a paper flamingo, tastes the way wine does when you are 8 years old), servers will offer a tour of the menu that ends with a strong endorsement of the “butcher’s feast.” This is a set menu, at $45 a person, with fluffy steamed eggs in a pot, two fundamental Korean stews, pickles, lettuce and, at the center of it all, a dealer’s choice of four cuts of beef. After all that has been cleared, vanilla soft serve under a squiggle of soy caramel appears in little paper cups with little wooden spoons. The meats at my most recent butcher’s feast were hanger steak, the reddish-purple of a brand-new bruise; a rib-eye together with a flap of rib-eye cap, both pink and spiderwebbed with white veins of fat; a thickish slab of flatiron steak, said to be the product of a cow who had Wagyu on one side of the family and Angus on the other; and finally galbi, short ribs in a sweet soy marinade. The other cuts in the butcher’s feast vary but galbi is a constant, as it should be. The meats came out early, while the gas grill warmed up. The wire cage over it was primed with a cube of beef fat, and then the beef went on, one cut at a time. Our server turned the meat once, then walked away, and one of my guests started to worry that the meat would burn. But the flames were low, and the beef browned gradually. The gas burners at Cote will never give you the sharp, dark, crackling edges that you find in the charcoal-grilled meats at Mapo Korean BBQ in Queens (and almost nowhere else in the city). The beef, though, is in all likelihood the best at any Korean barbecue place in New York. Its two closest competitors for steak supremacy are probably Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong and Gaonnuri, and neither can match Cote for richness and concentrated flavor. One night I ignored the butcher’s feast path and went off-road so I could try some sirloin that had been ripening downstairs for 138 days. Steaks aged that long are often described as funky, but the word doesn’t cover this piece of meat. It tasted like something other than beef, or maybe beyond beef, more condiment than protein. At $80 for six ounces, it was not my cup of barley tea, but it may be yours. Next time, I’ll stick to the road more traveled by. The butcher’s feast takes in most of the menu’s highlights, avoids the lowlights, and does so at a very good price for a steak supper. No matter what or how you order, though, you will have to contend with Cote’s notions of when to serve the condiments and side dishes that make the difference between Korean barbecue and a heap of grilled meat. Pickled cauliflower and soy-marinated chayote (both very good), lettuce and ssamjang (the fermented bean paste) arrive as the beef starts cooking. Rice doesn’t turn up until midway through the meal, when you’re finally brought pickled daikon, kimchi, kimchi stew and fermented bean-paste stew. Gochujang may show up at the beginning or at halftime. There is no one right way to eat Korean barbecue, but people who like to bundle the meat into lettuce or shiso with a lump of rice and a pickled cabbage leaf will wonder why Cote parcels the side dishes out in stages. That isn’t the only case of the missing kimchi. I couldn’t taste it in the fried rice “paella” with kimchi and Wagyu. The dish didn’t have much in common with paella, either. I wouldn’t care what it was called if it were delicious, but like some of the other attempts to loosen Korean custom, it came off as timid. Simon Kim, the owner, keeps saying in interviews that Cote is a Korean steakhouse. I understand why he wants to draw attention to the steak, but anybody who shows up expecting a kimchi-fied Smith & Wollensky is going to be very confused. You will search in vain for a baked potato or creamed spinach on David Shim’s menu. You can, however, get a shrimp cocktail with gochujang cocktail sauce, an idea that’s not as good as it sounds. You can eat an adapted wedge salad with candylike lumps of bacon and an unresponsive tofu-sesame dressing. And, in a homage to Peter Luger, there is bacon as an appetizer, which turns out to be unsmoked and uncured pork jowl. It’s better with a smear of ssamjang, but then most everything is. More traditional Korean dishes tended to taste more complete. If you want more starch than rice alone, the skinny wheat noodles in hot anchovy broth are simple and delicious. Cold noodles stirred at the table with slivered apples, lettuce and gochujang are spicy, sweet and refreshing. There’s a very good dolsot bibimbap, with a chewy bottom crust where the rice meets the searingly hot bowl. Aside from the meat locker, the other useful idea Cote borrowed from steakhouses is a wine list that is chosen with beef in mind and can run into real money if you’re not careful. Anyone hoping to find a red for less than $100 will find that a quick glance at, say, California or the Côte d’Or can be discouraging. But Victoria James, who wrote the list, found some pockets of affordability in Beaujolais, Southern France, Corsica and Switzerland, and she makes a small adventure out of the wines by the glass, all poured from magnums. Does Brouilly go with ssamjang? Can a Patrimonio get along with galbi? I didn’t know I wanted answers to these questions before Cote came along, but now I do.

62,Sen Sakana,1 star,"Nov. 7, 2017",Pete Wells,Midtown,"Japanese, Latin American",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/dining/sen-sakana-review-peruvian-food-nikkei.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/dining/sen-sakana-review-peruvian-food-nikkei.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Peru is making a move on Manhattan again. Get ready for huancaína and huacatay, tiradito and tacu-tacu. Brush up on the rocoto chile and its cousins, pinpoint-bright aji amarillo and aji panca, warmer and fruitier. Renew your friendship with causas and chaufas and leche de tigre, the milk of the tiger, without which there can be no ceviche. All these things and more are draped all over the menu at Sen Sakana, which is devoted to the food created by Japanese immigrants and their descendants in Peru. Non-Peruvians who know this hybrid cuisine at all probably first ran into it at a restaurant run by Nobu Matsuhisa, the Japanese-trained sushi chef who worked in Lima for a few years in the 1970s and helped himself to local ingredients and ideas. If you have ever eaten the raw fish with yuzu and a dot of rocoto chile paste that is Nobu’s interpretation of tiradito, or its grilled skewers with spicy anticucho sauce, you have tasted Peru’s Nikkei cuisine. At Sen Sakana, you can have more than a taste. The restaurant opened over the summer on the block of West 44th Street that is home to the Algonquin, the Royalton and the Iroquois hotels. There is room for almost 200 people in the square bar up front, the main dining room with rows of light wood tables and chairs in neutral upholstery, and a raised mezzanine that manages to make room for both extra tables and an entire sushi bar. To make this vastness look less like a warehouse and more like a Japanese restaurant, the designer made liberal use of slats. Some run up and down and the rest side to side, and behind some of those slats are lights that flood the walls with red or blue. It is the kind of sleek, sprawling, good-looking restaurant that you used to see all over Midtown, and then saw less often as the dining scene’s center of gravity moved to smaller, handmade spaces downtown and across the East River, and are now starting to see again at, say, Empellón and the Grill. Sprawling and sleek is not the current fashion, but it has also become apparent that small and handmade does not always mean high quality. Like any style, it can be faked. And one advantage of Sen Sakana’s sprawl is that if you are working in Midtown when the quitting-time whistle blows, or are going there for a show, your chances of getting in are better than average. At six pages, the menu is a bit of a sprawl itself. Its many categories can, however, be distilled down to just four: appetizers, main courses, skewers and sushi. In the first group is a cold cucumber of unusual interest. Covered in crunchy quinoa, toasted sesame seeds and flakes of kelp intensified with soy, it sits on a yellow streak of sauce made from aji amarillo. The menu calls the cucumber yamitsuki, the Japanese word for addictive. I wouldn’t go that far, but it does push a lot of good buttons at once. Gyoza, a half-dozen or so bound together by a crisp, shattering crepe-like lid, are filled with shrimp, crab and an exhilaratingly big jolt of fresh ginger. Sea bream tiradito gets a shower of shio kombu and two sauces; the tart yellow one is mango with aji amarillo and white soy; and the spicy green one is cilantro. Another tiradito sets raw bigeye tuna, daikon sprouts and pickled daikon in a lake of cilantro-jalapeño sauce. I’d order any of these again, which I can’t say about all the appetizers. Root vegetable chips were more oily than crisp. Sen Sakana also has a take on Japanese onigiri in which causa, the Peruvian whipped-potato constructions, are pinched inside sheets of nori. The idea is more interesting than the flavors; the potatoes needed seasoning, and the crab and chopped salmon fillings, advertised as spicy, weren’t very. With the exception of undercrisped chicken skin, the skewers of meats and vegetables grilled over charcoal on a robata are worth investigating, especially the Japanese sweet potato with a melting slab of aji amarillo-spiked butter, and the pork belly stuffed with queso cremoso, which has the texture of mozzarella that is trying to turn itself into cream cheese. The short roster of main courses on the menu nearly gets lost. This wouldn’t be a bad thing in the case of the skirt steak over tacu-tacu, a go-to rice-and-beans dish in Peru that becomes a flavorless paste here. But there are better choices, like a pleasantly unorthodox oyakodon, with an egg and chicken thigh over rice cooked with cilantro and pumpkin. And the chicken nanban removes any doubt that quinoa can make an effectively crunchy crust for fried chicken. Peru and Japan each have one representative in the main kitchen, where two chefs, Mina Newman and Taku Nagai, share power. Ms. Newman is a New Yorker who spent summers as a child in Chiclayo, the city in northwestern Peru where her mother was born. Mr. Nagai, an Osaka native, is a veteran of Japanese restaurants in New York and Asia. The two generally keep up with the number of seats and the size of the menu, although waits between courses sometimes drag. The dining room staff doesn’t seem as well organized. My servers were cheerful and communicated well with customers, but not necessarily with each other. Three people in a row would stop by to ask the same question, and just clearing the table seemed to take a cast of hundreds. A third chef, named Sang Hyun Lee, presides over the free-standing sushi bar. His work ranges from simple, classic nigiri and sashimi to psychedelic, 10-ingredient inside-out rolls that might make Jiro Ono cross-eyed. Sen Sakana’s best sushi is somewhere in between: what Mr. Lee calls Nikkei sashimi and nigiri. Augmented with Peruvian or Japanese flavors, these pieces are only slightly out of bounds, and can be delicious. There’s pleasurable tension in topping raw scallop with a tiny fleck of yuzu-ponzu jelly and commas of shaved lemon peel, or brushing sea bream with a tart, spicy sauce of yuzu and aji amarillo, then dotting it with a tiny bit of salted plum paste. Add six more things and they would all start to collide somewhere over the Pacific. One dessert is a small waffle made from batter that contains squash and sweet potato, a homage to Peruvian picarones, with a dark molasses syrup. Another is a shallow-pan chocolate tres leches cake, which tasted something like a dense brownie over which somebody poured a glass of cocktail de algarrobina, Peru’s answer to eggnog. It had never occurred to me to soak a brownie in eggnog. “Does this make sense?” I asked, between bites, until it was gone. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

63,Momofuku Ssam Bar,3 star,"Oct. 31, 2017",Pete Wells,East Village,"American, Korean, Southeast Asian",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/dining/momofuku-ssam-bar-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/dining/momofuku-ssam-bar-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"When I see something wrapped in a banana leaf, I am almost always interested in what’s inside. Unwrapping one such package at Momofuku Ssam Bar recently I was extra interested, because the restaurant has a new chef named Max Ng who is a citizen of Singapore, and one of the dishes he has brought with him from that country is a whole skate wing cooked in a banana leaf. The wing was rubbed top and bottom with sambal belacan, a Malaysian sauce built on a foundation of fermented-shrimp paste. It was a little spicy and strongly, disorientingly funky in a way that gave me the feeling of trying to stand up in a small boat in high surf. On the side, Mr. Ng served a bowl of congee to act as a kind of buffer, although it was by no means bland. Under the orange belacan I could taste the green-tea flavor of the banana leaf, drawn out by steam. Mr. Ng had intensified that, too, by charring the leaf so aggressively that it was still smoldering when it came to the table. Smoke in restaurants is usually found in captivity these days, caged within a glass or a cloche or a bag and carefully liberated, to oohs and aahs, before it drifts toward the ceiling and is gone. This is a favorite modernist party trick that anyone can do with the right smoker and pump. It is kind of cool the first time you see it. The smoke rising from the banana-leaf skate was the old, Promethean kind, and if I’m reading its message correctly it signaled another shift in direction for Ssam Bar. Founded by David Chang in the East Village in 2006, the restaurant evolved so quickly in its first two years that it took three New York Times reviews just to keep up. In the very beginning, Ssam Bar sold three kinds of Korean burritos. Dana Bowen, writing for The Times’s cheap-eats column, called them “enjoyable enough,” then spent the rest of her space on the after-hours experiments that Mr. Chang and three other cooks were serving late at night, like a whole roasted pork butt, to be pulled apart with tongs that quickly become as joyously greasy as everything and everybody else at the table. By early 2007, when Frank Bruni weighed in, the after-hours experiments had taken over the menu, which offered previously unimagined combinations of kimchi, country ham, hamachi, rice sticks, fish sauce and organ meats. Ssam Bar had become “a nearly full-fledged restaurant in near-perfect sync with the times,” Mr. Bruni wrote. Apparently it wasn’t done fledging yet; he returned in 2008 to promote it from two stars to three. Review overkill? No. Ssam Bar wasn’t just changing its menu. It rewrote the rules by which critically acclaimed restaurants were supposed to operate, stripping away comforts (chairs with backs, sound systems with a “low” setting) and amenities (reservations, unshared tables), and gambling that everybody would be too stunned by the food to complain. It worked. Ssam Bar mounted a guerrilla attack on the dining establishment, and it won before anybody quite knew what was going on, Mr. Chang included. There followed a long period of refinement and maturation, which is more than some guerrilla outfits can say. The wine list now takes more than 20 seconds to read, and is especially worth exploring for fans of gamay and sparkling wine. (Or both — there’s a sparkling gamay.) Under Matthew Rudofker, the executive chef from 2010 until May, Ssam Bar expanded beyond pork shoulder to other sizable cuts of meat: rib-eyes, briskets, whole ducks. Over the years, like many of Mr. Chang’s restaurants, Ssam Bar was increasingly infiltrated by modern techniques, fermentation, cutting-edge plating styles and umami-building tricks. The kitchen worked at a very high level, but at times it felt slightly deracinated, as if it drew much of its inspiration from other islands in the Momofuku archipelago. Carefully but confidently, Mr. Ng is moving away from that style and toward one of his own. He has gone back to the traditions of Asia, particularly street food and Singaporean cuisine. Like the char on that smoldering banana leaf, his techniques tend to be premodern, even though he has worked for nobody but Mr. Chang since moving to the United States in 2011, starting with an externship at Ssam Bar during culinary school and rising to chef de cuisine at Momofuku Ko. Mr. Ng has been trying his hand at the fish-shaped cakes from Japan known as taiyaki. He has a terrific idea for what to do with them: stuff them with foie gras. In his hands they’re almost French, because he fills the molds with croissant dough rather than pancake batter and glazes the crust with honey and white port. Over the top he strews some candied puffed rice that would make a fine breakfast; the whole dish would make a fine breakfast, come to think of it, although you’d stand up afterward knowing your day had already peaked. Sizzling eggs arrive not quite set in a cast-iron pan hot enough to finish cooking them at the table. The heat also softens a slice of pork terrine, which melts to coat the eggs. When I first tried this open-faced omelet, the eggs had been poured around a handful of chanterelles. Now they’ve been replaced by smoked bluefish. To make one of the most original corn dishes I’ve seen in a long time, Mr. Ng cleaves the cobs lengthwise into quarters and fries them until they curl. They are dusted with spice. You pick one up with your fingers and swipe it through a black aioli of squid ink or a white streak of whipped ricotta, which will melt like butter. Then you eat the kernels from the cob as if you were gnawing the meat off a baby back rib. These new dishes live alongside some legacies of Mr. Rudofker’s regime. There are cured sardines on long fingers of toast spread with hozon, the fermented chickpea paste that in this case plays the role of butter very well. Big cuts of meat are still offered. They have to be ordered ahead, but a variation of the rotisserie duck can sometimes be had on the spur of the moment. The breast is rubbed heartily with five-spice powder and fanned out over rice, the idea being to wrap it in lettuce with fried shallots and gochujang, without getting too distracted when the duck’s fried bones show up about 15 minutes later. As if he had realized that a restaurant that acts like a teenage punk is not as endearing once it reaches middle age, Mr. Chang redid Ssam Bar last year. The seats and bar stools have backs. The communal tables have been replaced by smaller ones where you sit only with people you know. Somehow the noise has been tamed. You won’t have tinnitus by the time you get to Mr. Ng’s Singaporean coconut pie, which has a smooth, sweet, wobbly, pandan-scented filling like chess pie, a dome of whipped cream made from coconut milk and a dark brown drizzle of coconut-sugar caramel.

64,The Pool,2 star,"Oct. 17, 2017",Pete Wells,Midtown,"American, Seafood",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/dining/the-pool-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/dining/the-pool-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The Pool is such an exceptional restaurant that customers may suspect there’s something wrong with them when they walk out feeling that something was missing.

Philip Johnson designed the whole thing with richly detailed, rigorously geometric understatement that earned it status as one of the few interiors in the city protected by landmark designation. Major Food Group, the company that runs the Grill and the Pool, took its cues from Johnson to give the two restaurants contrasting styles. The Grill, with its imposing walnut paneling, has a meat-focused menu with midcentury roots that is overseen by Mario Carbone. The Pool, under the hand of Rich Torrisi, serves seafood with a contemporary outlook. Crucially, Major Food Group and the building’s owner decided that each restaurant deserved its own bar with its own style. The Grill already had one. For the Pool, which didn’t, they requisitioned, redecorated, refurnished and renamed the mezzanine. The new Pool Lounge, I discovered by making a phone call, was built without the permits from the Landmarks Preservation Commission that the law requires. In September, the commission summoned the building’s owner, RFR Holding, for a public hearing. An application has been belatedly filed to cover three major installations made without approval: the bar and the wall coverings of woven cotton, wool and silver threads in the lounge and the reception desk in the lobby off East 52nd Street. (Sheldon Werdiger, director of marketing and design development at RFR Holding, said in a statement that because furniture is not covered in the landmark designation, “we thought a new reception desk and bar in the lounge were additive fixtures to the space that can be easily removed and did not require LPC oversight.”) But you don’t need to be an architectural historian to see that none of them are remotely in the International Style. The large, inelegant reception desk belongs in an airport; you half expect to be asked if you’re checking any luggage. But the more serious rupture is the Pool Lounge. Although the building’s owner has argued that the Four Seasons used the mezzanine for private events and storage, it was open and in use for restaurant seating every time I ate in the old Pool Room. The tables up there, with their views of the lower dining room and the pool itself, were among the best in the house. Now the mezzanine looks as if it had been moved on a trailer from some other building and attached with thumbtacks. Its blue color scheme and rounded, Deco-inspired furniture fight with what is left of Johnson’s right angles and natural tones. When the lounge is full, it’s a distraction. When it’s half-empty, as it often seems to be, it looms like a stage set waiting for the actors to show up. Either way, it sucks energy from the restaurant, which needs all it can get. The Landmarks Preservation Commission is waiting for a response from the landlord before ruling on the new fixtures. One change that it is not challenging is the removal of the large planters from the four corners of the pool. When the Four Seasons opened in 1959, these held trees that were changed whenever a new spring, summer, fall or winter rolled around. The trees broke up the sight lines, so you never saw the entire space at once. Now you look around at an uninterrupted sea of heads. Messing with the subtle dynamics that Johnson set in motion puts pressure on the cooking and the dining room staff to animate the room. They don’t completely succeed right now. The Pool’s problems don’t include the ingredients, which are spectacular. The sweetness of chilled spot prawns under a few drops of olive oil made me shiver with pleasure. A trio of flash-seared Hokkaido sea scallop, Pacific mackerel whose skin had been peppered and griddled, and raw amberjack under tiny cells of finger lime suggested that Mr. Torrisi could run a stunning sushi restaurant. My eyes rolled back in my head whenever I ate sea urchin. In one appetizer, it is arranged on griddled pretzel bread with mustard oil and tiny cubes of green apple. In another, lobes of it are layered into an iced bowl to be eaten, with crème fraîche and chives if you like, over blini, hard-cooked eggs, toast or, my favorites, creamy potato halves roasted in duck fat. (Caviar and trout roe are served the same way.) Mr. Torrisi’s approach is to be lavish with punctiliously cared-for seafood and to outfit it sparingly. A beautiful illustration is the cured king salmon, two long, intensely flavorful strips served with a single potato dressed with mustard, shallots and dill. Another is any of the whole fish. The skin on turbot caught in Portugal is seared to a satisfying crackle on a plancha and served with a simple lemon vinaigrette. Like the Dover sole, it is lifted from its skeleton by a slim captain (they’re all slim) who performs the surgery wearing a Tom Ford suit. One night five captains in five suits filleted five sole for five diners at a table next to mine. It looked like a scene from “Ocean’s Eleven” that didn’t make the final cut. But some of the more elaborate dishes are underwhelming. I don’t know how striped bass with banana peppers and “mole spices” can be dull, but it is. Coconut-orange vinaigrette sounds like a terrific sauce for lobster, but it added very little except sweetness, which the lobster didn’t need. Chopped gazpacho ingredients over a puddle of actual gazpacho was both too complicated (why not just serve gazpacho?) and too plain (the cucumbers and tomatoes didn’t shine with flavor). This is all a huge improvement on what prevailed in the last years of the Four Seasons. But it doesn’t make you feel as if you are in the hands of one of the city’s best chefs, which Mr. Torrisi is, I think. Even at its best, the food rarely rises to the technical brilliance or boldness of, say, the green curry mushroom mille-feuille or the Vietnamese-flavored chicken legs he put on the menu at Dirty French. If his cooking at the Pool had some of that swagger, what’s on the plates could live up to the best parts of the original architecture and help make up for the renovation’s mistakes. This is exactly what happens when Stephanie Prida’s desserts arrive. Ms. Prida, who until a few months ago was the pastry chef at Manresa in Los Gatos, Calif., has a knack for combining flavors that seem to get more interesting as you go along, like a crème brûlée with shaved plums and bitter almond ice cream under a squiggle of reduced sherry vinegar, or coconut parfait and fluffy pink-grapefruit mousse sandwiched between the thinnest possible layers of matcha sablé. Bottles of Chateau d’Yquem going back to 1811 are kept in a glass wine room just off the entrance to the Pool, where they cast a beautiful amber glow that the servers are fond of pointing out. Enjoy it as you walk in, because this is as close as you will get to a dessert wine of any kind unless you are ready to spend at least $95, the price of the least expensive glass. The wine list is full of wonderful bottles, but its most noteworthy feature is its breezy lack of concern for normal budgets. Out of dozens of sparkling wines, more than 30 are priced above $1,000. Just one is under $90. This is quite a pinch to put on customers who are already paying between $39 and $74 for main courses. The Grill/Pool bifurcation extends to the dining room staff. In the Pool they are reserved, poised, deferential and seem to have been directed not to show any warmth or wit. Compared with the talkative, jokey characters in the Grill, who are ready to flambé something at the drop of a hat, the servers in the Pool are cardboard figures in tailored suits. Major Food Group has no fear of going over the top. So I’m reluctant to suggest that the Pool needs more personality and drama — these guys are capable of stocking the pool with live sharks if they thought it would help. But the restaurant needs something, because at these prices, what might pass for restraint and simplicity can start to seem like a sophisticated heist.

Nobody I brought there noticed it, though. Somehow it slipped my mind, too, even though I’d read about it weeks before my first meal, and had eaten things like smoked salmon and Manhattan clam chowder. The restaurant is all the way in the back of the ground floor of the new hotel on the Lower East Side designed by Herzog & de Meuron. The owner, Ian Schrager, calls it simply Public, and to make sure it lives up to its name he has divided the common areas into a sequence of hangouts. To get inside you walk down a hedgerow of rhododendrons flanked by two small lawns where hotel guests alight on Adirondack chairs as if they were up in the mountains and not a knish’s throw away from Chrystie Street. The scene changes once you come through the revolving front doors to face a pair of escalators reflected off into infinity by polished metal mirrors. It may remind you of the entrance to a mall, and the tacit message is similar: Keep circulating until you see something you want. Around the escalators to the right you come to a Vongerichten-run grab-and-go market and beyond that, the first of two Vongerichten-catered bars. While the other offers snacky highlights from the Public Kitchen menu, this one serves the whole megillah. At the far end of the bar you reach the entrance to the restaurant. Strangely, it’s one of Public’s least interesting rooms, a yawning, noisy canteen whose walls are tiled with the same shiny marble that more expensive hotels put in their showers. I’ve led you on this hotel tour to help make sense of Public Kitchen. The menu is a kaleidoscope because Mr. Vongerichten and Thomas McKenna, his executive chef, are trying to offer up something for many moods and occasions. Customers who don’t grasp the I♥NY concept when they see pasta and pizza and Chinese food will still find something to eat, whether they’re drinking mezcal below the Diego Rivera-inspired tapestry on the second floor or settling in for a couple of hours at the restaurant. One snack is so popular it’s already a classic of sorts: popcorn under a thin Frisbee of fried Cheddar sprinkled with chives and chile flakes. I didn’t totally get it, but it was a fun thing to crunch on with a drink in my other hand. So were the little latkes topped with sour cream, trout roe and smoked salmon, straight from the hors d’oeuvres tray of the fanciest Hanukkah party you’ve ever attended. Smart ideas pop up all over the place. Rigatoni with yellow wax beans and gold tomatoes is saved from ordinariness by a very good pesto in which pistachios do the work of pine nuts. Shrimp toast, one of those foods that are likable even when they’re bad, is exceptionally good at Public Kitchen, where the crunch of water chestnuts is pitted against tender, unusually sweet shrimp. There’s a phenomenally good steak marinated in soy sauce and dressed with fermented black soybeans and sesame oil. Also wonderful: roasted hake with sweet and spicy peppers interrupted by shards of fried potato. But, unusually for one of Mr. Vongerichten’s recent restaurants, a number of dishes don’t achieve liftoff. At my first meal I was nonplused by the shrimp cocktail: The shrimp were warm but served on ice, and the cocktail sauce was a bizarre and acidic collision of peaches and horseradish. The last time I went, these hot-and-cold shrimp weren’t on the menu. I hope they are using their time away to think about the choices they’ve made. Nothing else was so misconceived. But spicy avocado dip punched the lights out of a delicately flaky Chinese scallion pancake with basil in place of scallions. Nondescript cheese, bland mushrooms and a pointless egg dragged down a pizza with a very good, light crust. And Manhattan clam chowder, repurposed as a sauce for a fine, clean-tasting hunk of pan-seared salmon, was the answer to a question nobody asked. The only reason I can think of for hijacking red chowder like this is to make a connection with New York. But with a few exceptions, Public Kitchen doesn’t explore the city’s food in a coherent or illuminating way. And it doesn’t come close to hitting, as the website puts it, “all of the cultures that make up the eclectic mix and melting pot that is New York City.” Thai flavors animate one side dish, roasted carrots in red curry paste and coconut milk. But the main cuisines brought into play are Italian and Chinese, as if it were still 1970. A good menu doesn’t need a theme to hang together, of course. The pastry chef, Eric Kalaboke, found a through line in slightly old-fashioned favorites like a fruit cobbler capped with sweet sticks of puff pastry, an extremely endearing chocolate layer cake with blackberry sorbet and peanut butter ice cream, and a quietly spectacular tartufo resting in sour-cherry syrup. As for the wine list, it does a great job of presenting reasonably priced bottles from all over, made by some of the leading producers in their regions. This is a nice surprise in a hotel that seems to have been built as a backdrop for the cocktail lifestyle. And if your big idea is New York City, you’re probably better off underplaying it than going all out like the Grill, where they all but park a Checker cab next to your table. There are no lectures at Public Kitchen, blessedly, no footnotes or history lessons. The closest I got to an elucidation of the menu was when a server said, “Everything is individually portioned and meant to be shared with the table” — a Zen koan for our time. Still, it’s a sign of trouble that what Public Kitchen is trying to pull off doesn’t come across clearly. You can have a meal that is mostly very good, or one that is decidedly mixed, but either way you will probably walk out not entirely sure what sets this restaurant apart, other than Mr. Vongerichten’s sensibility. He doesn’t layer flavors like anyone else. These days he doesn’t have as many imitators as he used to, either, although his spicy tuna tartare slicked with sesame oil will be with us forever. He trots it out again at Public Kitchen, over sliced avocado, with an undulated rice cracker that left oil on my fingers. It’s hard to tell whether he’s repeating himself, making a sly comment on how pervasive the dish is in New York, or both. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

66,Oberlin,2 star,"Oct. 3, 2017",Pete Wells,"Providence, RI","American, Italian, Seafood",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/dining/oberlin-restaurant-review-providence.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/dining/oberlin-restaurant-review-providence.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Raw bluefish was on the menu at Oberlin in July, and I was thinking: I hope they know what they’re doing. Bluefish goes off so quickly that there was a chance my first impression would end my curiosity about this restaurant. But I gave it a shot, and it was great: sliced cold and neatly fanned out like sashimi, then sprinkled with olive oil and salt and pickled garlic-chive buds, the bluefish was chewy and soft at the same time, somehow, and had a rich, oily flavor that was especially delicious because I knew that in 24 hours it would taste half as good and a day after that it wouldn’t be worth eating at all. Finding bluefish fresh enough to serve raw takes connections down at the waterfront. Oberlin’s chef, Benjamin Sukle, has been cultivating relationships with fishing captains in southern Rhode Island for about four years since he opened Birch, his small tasting-counter restaurant in this city’s compact downtown. His shopping list got longer when he opened Oberlin a few blocks away early last year. Fish isn’t the only thing on the menu here, but there is a lot of it, and the ways Mr. Sukle uses it illustrate the exploration of local ingredients that makes Oberlin the most rewarding new restaurant I know of in Southern New England. The menu starts with a long list of raw seafood that is a snapshot of what’s swimming around Rhode Island at the moment. “When I go to the docks I’m not just picking the best of the catch,” Mr. Sukle said. “It’s all great.” I last ate there in the middle of September, when the raw fish included bonito and bigeye tuna, striped bass, mahi-mahi, both Spanish and Boston mackerel, and scup. A week or so later, the final gasps of a hurricane had chased the fish away, and Oberlin’s raw bar was down to a dish dreamed up in the last hurricane season, mussels marinated in their steaming juices and a slug of aioli. Slightly rich and spicy under crunchy little sweet-potato chips, it is a terrific thing to eat even with plenty of fish around. Buying whole fish instead of fillets helps Mr. Sukle, who owns the restaurant with his wife, Heidi, keep prices down and the menu varied. I loved Oberlin’s shiny, alluringly pasty brandade, made not with cod but with salted remnants of more abundant white-fleshed fish such as scup, mahi-mahi and fluke. It is served with a green splash of herbed olive oil on top and lightly toasted slices of the restaurant’s excellent sourdough on the side. Salty pink hunks of cured bigeye tasted like the canned tuna of my dreams, alongside cucumbers and explosively ripe heirloom tomatoes seasoned with basil, wild mint and seaweed. Cured local bluefish stands in for imported anchovies in a bracingly original interpretation of puttanesca sauce in which the flavor of each ingredient — garlic and tomato and chiles and bluefish and razor-thin shavings of green olives — was clear and distinct. Birch is the smaller, tidier and quieter of Mr. Sukle’s restaurants. Lamb pelts thrown over the backs of high leather-upholstered seats project a studied cool borrowed from Scandinavia. The handmade ceramics are plated with more delicate precision. Greater subtlety is drawn out of, or spirited into, the ingredients. There were delicious surprises in everything I tasted, and the set price of $55 for four painstaking courses was remarkably fair. When I ate there, charred cucumbers dressed with pistachio butter lurked below a translucent shingling of marinated cucumber. Airy fronds of fennel and a single preserved beach-rose petal had been airlifted into place on top. Wild foods like beach roses turn up in both restaurants, a sign of the imprint left by Mr. Sukle’s brief stint at Noma, in Copenhagen. Some chefs have copied Noma in exactly the wrong way, importing ingredients that grow in Denmark instead of scouring their own landscapes. I wonder if Noma’s chef, René Redzepi, ever feels like the character in “Monty Python’s Life of Brian” who tells a crowd of followers, “You’ve got to think for yourselves! You’re all individuals!” only to hear them shout back in unison, “Yes! We’re all individuals!” Mr. Sukle took Mr. Redzepi’s teachings the right way. Edible discoveries get slightly more play at Birch, but the next time I’m set loose in Providence for a night, odds are my feet will carry me to Oberlin. I like the friendly spontaneity of the dining-room crew. They’re busier and can be harder to flag down than the staff at Birch, but once you have their attention they seem more engaged. Seating is in a rhythmic hodgepodge: high tables and bar stools to the right, regular tables to the left and out on the sidewalk, and a few wooden stools at the short counter facing the cooks who put together salads and slice raw fish under a sign that reads, “Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana.” (An absurdist streak is one of Providence’s underappreciated charms.) I might settle in with sake — a diverse set of 10 are poured by the glass — or beer from such nonconformist breweries as To Ol in Copenhagen and Prairie Artisan Ales in Tulsa, Okla. If I was feeling lucky I might roll the dice on the wine list, which contains some reliably crafted natural wines alongside some lean, withholding ones. An Oregon pinot noir recommended as a staff favorite was, to me, off-puttingly thin and tart. Then I would get down to business, starting with raw fish, of course. A submerged Italian theme surfaces on the menu from time to time. My experience with Oberlin’s handmade pastas, though, was patchy. The filled pastas I ordered were not very good; both the duck inside triangular pansotti and the pork folded into doughy ravioli were dry and a little severe. But then there was that inspired puttanesca tossed with fusilli, and some wonderful potato gnocchi that were browned on one side and stirred into a buttery clam broth with tender littlenecks. Knowing that Mr. Sukle seeks out produce I’m not likely to meet every day, I’d keep an eye out for things like Victor squash. This is also known as Red Warty Thing, an accurate description in the fall when it ripens, but Mr. Sukle is fond of it when it is still green and immature. Cut into thin raw crescents that were sandwiched with juicy slices of cantaloupe and sprinkled with fresh oregano and za’atar, then arranged over creamed feta, it tasted like a cucumber that has been carbo-loading. Its thin, edible skin was also delightfully free of large warts. (The Red Warty Thing lobby should feel free to use that language in its ad copy.) Most nights see two whole, bone-in fish on the menu, one grilled and the other roasted. I’ve had yellowtail flounder and Boston mackerel, and both were cooked just the way they should be, with a hint of pink along the spine. The same two desserts were offered each time I went. One was a rustic blueberry tart that was slightly underbaked on a first encounter and perfect the second time around. The other was a peach-blossom custard topped with fresh fruit. The custard had the fluffiness of a soft meringue. It was, in fact, a panna cotta infused with flowers that were preserved just like the rose petals and then frothed with a nitrous oxide canister. It was studiously put together but easy to like, which come to think of it is not a bad description of Oberlin itself. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

67,Cervo’s,1 star,"Sept. 26, 2017",Pete Wells,Lower East Side,"Portuguese, Seafood, Spanish",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/dining/cervos-review-restaurant.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/dining/cervos-review-restaurant.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Cervo’s, a two-month-old restaurant on the east end of Canal Street, is divided in two. In front is a long bar where bartenders stir sherry with lemon-lime soda and three cooks make all the food. In the rear is a squarish dining room that can fit about 16 people if they all hold their breath. The tight quarters back there, the low ceiling broken by a skylight, and the glossy wood paneling made me feel as if I were eating in the dining cabin of a large but not excessively luxurious sailboat. And the man at the table next to mine couldn’t seem to find his sea legs. “I don’t recognize anything on this wine list,” he said. “Which is exciting, in a way, but ...” Gamely, the sommelier asked what he usually liked to drink. “Unoaked chardonnay and California-style sauvignon blanc,” he said, “but you don’t have any of those.” He was right. Drinking at Cervo’s means leaving familiar landmarks behind. Most of the wines are from Portugal and the rest from Spain, with very few well-known names between them. After a few false starts, the sommelier steered him to a vinho verde from a winery called Aphros. I’d drunk it very happily on another night. It was more lush and ripe than the thin, fizzy vinho verdes that I cut my teeth on as a youngster, and had enough citrus to come in for a soft landing in Mr. Sauvignon Blanc’s comfort zone. He took a sip, and looked as if he’d decided to wait and see what happened. Without calling itself a wine bar, Cervo’s does a good impersonation of one, pouring about 12 unfortified wines by the glass along with another dozen or so sherries, Madeiras and ports. On my previous visits I’d ranged all over the list. I’d enjoyed a sparkling wine bottled, with spirited acidity, by Sidónio de Sousa in the Bairrada region of Portugal, by the Atlantic Ocean; a quietly flowery vermouth from the Basque Country, poured from a tap; Los Bermejos’s illuminatingly bright dry malvasia, grown in the volcanic soil of Lanzarote, one of the Canary Islands; a glass of red from 4 Monos, made in the mountains west of Madrid and so approachably low in tannin that Cervo’s serves it chilled, like a Beaujolais. According to the owners, Nialls Fallon and Nick Perkins, the menu is inspired by Portugal and Spain, like the wine list. For years, they say, they talked about opening “a Portuguese version” of Swan Oyster Depot, the San Francisco institution. (They have another place in Brooklyn called Hart’s, taken from Mr. Perkins’s middle name. Hart is also an antique word for deer, which is what cervo means in Portuguese.) The menu reads like a wine bar’s, too. Portions are generally small and the plates are unstudied, starting with some basics like fleshy green olives in olive oil and paprika, or pan con tomate with ripe tomatoes and shavings of bottarga. But while the wine list sails off into uncharted territory, the menu sticks closer to home. Few of the dishes would be familiar in Lisbon, but several would be right at home in Estela or Wildair. The main ideas that Mr. Perkins and Aaron Crowder, who share the chef duties, seem to have drawn from the cuisine of Portugal is that people there eat a lot of seafood and tend to keep things simple. This isn’t a bad place to start, though. Their next move is a smart one, too. Mr. Perkins and Mr. Crowder cooked in many of Andrew Tarlow’s restaurants, smallish Brooklyn places with locavore inclinations. At Cervo’s, they work with very fresh seafood caught off the Northeastern coast, supplemented by a few things from farther away. It doesn’t take much to make these ingredients stand out. The selection of oysters is not overwhelming, but each time I’ve turned up there were new ones to swallow, Truro Pearls and Wellfleets from Cape Cod in August and, in September, Pink Moons and Savage Blondes from Prince Edward Island. From the raw bar also come things like whole white prawns marinated in white wine and garlic, or radishes shaved over anchodinas, the meaty and salty Spanish sardine fillets that are preserved like anchovies. The kitchen has a way of applying just enough chile heat to register: The pink flesh of yellowfin tuna was just starting to go opaque from lemon juice stirred with fermented Serrano chiles, while pickled banana peppers accentuated the sweetness of marinated and browned scallops, and stopped there. Cockles or small clams steamed open in vinho verde with garlic seem always to be on the menu, and they make a very delicious next step after cold seafood. There is often a strangely likable beef tartare with littlenecks and so much of the clams’ steaming juices that it almost comes across as some kind of mutant chowder. Fish — porgy or Boston mackerel recently — goes right on the plancha in one piece. Chicken skewers with sweet onions and yogurt may sound, in the context of this menu, like a sop to the seafood-averse. It is, in fact, a standout. The chicken is marinated and griddled with ground fennel seed, coriander and other spices, a bit like the great Andalusian snack pintxos moruños. The skewers are carried out on a plate with all their juices pooling around a spoonful of yogurt and petals of onions brought to the crunchy-tender threshold on the plancha. Dessert is an opportunity to look again at the Madeiras or one of the inexpensive ports, all from a young, boutique operation called Morgadio da Calçada. On some nights, there is a thick, yolk-rich custard infused with anise hyssop. Other times, I’ve eaten soft, sweet vanilla pudding decorated with peaches and tiny yellow husk tomatoes. I can’t decide which I like more. It would be easy to let my enthusiasm about Cervo’s get the better of me, the way some people have gotten carried away over Hart’s. The charm of both restaurants is that they come on easy, then deliver more than some places that are much more full of themselves. Overstating that charm wouldn’t do Cervo’s any favors. The lamb burger can be juicy one night and dry on another. (Either way, adding white anchovies for $3 more improves it, one of the few restaurant-burger upgrades I’d say that about.) Raw cabbage leaves dressed with yogurt and bottarga, meanwhile, might have come from a completely different restaurant. Cervo’s hasn’t put down deep enough roots into Iberian food yet for the kitchen to flirt with trendier styles. So I won’t make extravagant promises. I think you should just go and see what happens.

68,Prune,2 star,"Sept. 19, 2017",Pete Wells,East Village,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/dining/prune-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/dining/prune-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"First, some disclosures are in order. Gabrielle Hamilton, who owns Prune, writes one column a month for The New York Times Magazine. I don’t have anything to do with that, but I have edited a few of her essays in the past. We had a fine time working together, and kept in touch for a while. About a decade ago we introduced our toddlers for a play date while she cooked breakfast. It ended after her son hit mine over the head with a toy truck. I haven’t seen her in the five and a half years I’ve been reviewing restaurants, though, even when I’ve eaten at Prune, in the East Village. And, against our personal history, one has to balance the simmering resentment I feel each time I remember that writing is only a sideline for Ms. Hamilton, and yet she’s better at it than most people who do it for a living, including me. Any new Prune customer who isn’t already aware that Ms. Hamilton is a very good writer will realize it when the menus arrive. They are put together by somebody who understands how words work. Although these days she drafts them with Ashley Merriman, whom she married last year and with whom she shares the title of chef, their tone has not changed in the 18 years Prune has been open. They do not follow the current fad of forcing nouns into shotgun weddings to which no prepositions, participles or conjunctions were invited (“cod, radish, yogurt, nasturtium”). Instead you see phrases that could be in the first sentence of a short story you wouldn’t be able to put down. Under the bar snacks is one I defy you to read without feeling a spasm of curiosity: “Turkish disco pistachios.” You may not instantly grasp that the nuts are going to be roasted before your eyes over a mound of flaming salt, or that when the fire goes out they will be warm and will have the unmistakable flavor of anise, but you will know that something is about to happen. Often, the phrases are more direct. One of the vegetables recently was “Corn on the cob with butter and salt.” You might see corn on the cob anywhere, but the butter and salt are the kind of concrete details that could make this a line from a poem about summer. Here’s another line: “plain boiled zucchini drowned in olive oil.” There were four delicious little squashes, cooked whole with their bright firm stems on, and there was indeed enough clean, grassy oil to drown them. What’s that I hear? Is that an objection from someone who boils zucchini at home? Go ahead, knock yourself out. Just don’t try to tell me that I’ve been scammed. The whole objective of Prune is and always has been to cook the food of hunger and desire, strip it of the usual restaurant window dressing, and put it in front of you. This is why the menu reads so well. Good writing comes from clear thinking, and Ms. Hamilton’s thoughts on what makes a satisfying dinner have always been extremely clear. What more could you ask from the start of a meal than sautéed chanterelles shedding mushroom juice and butter into a thick slice of toasted white bread? And what could you add to improve a main course of swordfish, grilled gently enough that a rosé blush is left in its flesh, with melted anchovy butter that runs into the tiny boiled potatoes? Well, there is a garnish: a lemon wedge and a parsley sprig. This I suppose counts as restaurant window dressing, but because it comes from another era it also evokes a specific sense memory that gives meaning to the whole dish. Over the years Ms. Hamilton has delegated the cooking to several people. I didn’t eat there under every regime, but I can say that the meals I’ve eaten since Ms. Merriman arrived from the Waverly Inn early last year have been at least as good as any I’ve ever had at Prune. Certainly the cooking is more steadily skillful and more varied than it was around the time of its last Times review, a dozen years ago, when Frank Bruni gave it one star. Not everything sparkles; a ragout of artichokes and shell beans tasted about as gray as it looked. But for the most part Ms. Merriman has managed to nest her style inside her wife’s while, I think, expanding the boundaries of both. Braised rabbit leg is a very Prune thing to cook, but I doubt that in 1999 it would have been presented, as it was earlier this summer, over yellow hexagons of carrot mixed with Calabrian chiles, mint leaves and pine nuts, with a handful of fried bread crumbs thrown over the top. That Mediterranean tilt could be Ms. Merriman’s work, but the dish still has a Hamiltonian directness. The grilled branzino on the menu, on the other hand, is a classic Hamilton dish. The simplicity — a whole fish on a plate — has her name all over it, and the application of fennel oil is the sort of nuance — invisible, politely insistent — she prefers to screamingly interventionist moves. The two women run a kitchen that is capable of intricate footwork, but that’s not what it’s known for. What they and their cooks do, you can too, generally. This was true back when Prune still served canned sardines loaded onto a plate with Triscuits, pickles and a bloop of mustard, a dish that didn’t take any cooking but did require enough nerve to fill a punch bowl. The sardines are not on the menu, but cans are kept on hand for sentimental customers. The nerve is still there, although a less fraught word for it is confidence. It is confidence that allows Prune to place a scrupulously made martini on the cocktail list next to a Long Island Iced Tea that has been purged of its scuzzier ingredients but is still pretty louche. It is confidence that gets you unshowy desserts like slices of black plums tossed with sugar, lemon zest and cardamom and spread out on buttered toast, or a bunch of Concord grapes lounging on a plate of chipped ice. It is confidence that lets some servers wear pale pink crew-neck T-shirts and others V-necks of a riper, fleshier pink. Confidence that helps them thread through tables that are by anybody’s standards too close together; confidence that allows them to treat every customer, the ones who look like actors and the ones who look like retired semiotics professors, with the same attention and care. It is confidence that lets this French-looking bistro with its much-put-upon marble bar and fuzzed-up mirrors play Yo La Tengo one night and Whitney Houston’s greatest hits on another and still believe that somehow it will all mean something.

70,The Grill,3 star,"Aug. 22, 2017",Pete Wells,Midtown,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/dining/the-grill-review-midtown.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/dining/the-grill-review-midtown.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"New York kept certain fantasies about the Four Seasons alive for a long time. We told ourselves that it was an elegant restaurant, that it was an important restaurant, that the roll call of designers, editors and so on who ate lunch there — a short list that grew shorter as publishers moved downtown, expense accounts were clipped and longtime patrons were called by the great reservationist in the sky — was proof of something other than the tendency of famous and busy people to act from habit and herd instinct. Long before the end, fantasy and reality had gone separate ways. The Four Seasons was a mess. The beaded curtain chains that rippled upward for 20 feet in endless waves like a waterfall running in reverse were coming apart, some of them missing or broken or lying on the floor like dead snakes. The bronze-rod Richard Lippold sculpture that hangs in midair over the towers of whiskey and gin bottles inside the square bar was furry with dust. A dinner I had in 2013 was a disaster, from the stale rolls to the zombified service to the dry and crumbly duck served with fruit compote that tasted like the filling in a grocery-store pie. It goes without saying that all this cost a pile of money. Because the restaurant’s lease was winding down, I never wrote up that meal. And when the landlord signed a new one with the Major Food Group instead of the old owners, New Yorkers might have mourned the end of our fantasy Four Seasons, but there weren’t a lot of reasons to be sad about losing the real one. Now, instead of one restaurant, we have two. Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone, the two chefs who run the Major Food Group with their noncooking partner, Jeff Zalaznick, have taken a divide-and-conquer strategy. Mr. Torrisi is in charge of what was the Pool Room and is now just the Pool. The Grill, formerly the Grill Room, is in the hands of Mr. Carbone. It was the first to open, in May, and comes very close to being the kind of restaurant many of us imagined in this space all along. The Grill is confident, theatrical, retro, unsentimental, sharp and New Yorky. Like other projects from Major Food Group, it is packed with ideas and historical allusions. Unpacking it all is a lot of fun if you can afford it; preposterous expense is one reality of the old restaurant that the new tenants preserved. They also preserved the Philip Johnson interior, after the landlord proposed some changes that were swatted down by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Rightly so: funded by the Seagram Company, Johnson did something astonishing in this room. It’s a vast space that offers privacy, a corporate monument that gives back to the public, an expression of International Style austerity that feels exuberant. All that is in sharp focus again now that it’s holding a restaurant with a full battery charge. The beads have been strung back together. Lippold’s bronze glints again. The book-matched French walnut paneling is glossier and more radiant, the patterns in the grain more evocative of monumental abstract paintings, than before.  Mr. Carbone, Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Zalaznick prepare for their restaurants the way Matthew Weiner or David Simon get ready for a new show, with a mountain of research. Taking over a high point of midcentury modernism gave them license to study James Beard, rolling trolleys, Jacqueline Kennedy, the martini, John Cage, club sandwiches, Joe Baum, continental cuisine, Delmonico’s, green goddess dressing, Craig Claiborne and Catalina sauce. Some dish names are cryptic, as if written to invite a question the servers can answer with a story. The one about “Jack’s Pie” involves John F. Kennedy and comes in two parts. The second is a dubious dirty joke about Marilyn Monroe. This postmodern approach to modernism leads to some self-conscious nonsense. Next to the staircase is a buffet table set with a surreal cornucopia of vegetables, fruits and layer cakes. It’s stunning to look at but it’s purely decorative — “a buffet in name only,” the servers have to explain. Dinner sees a traffic jam of rolling carts parked tableside for various bits of stage business, some of which are pointless. Peach Melba doesn’t get better when you set it on fire, and when a server painstakingly removes a pastry seal on a cocotte to reveal two pieces of endive, you have to wonder if Mr. Carbone hasn’t lost his mind. But any doubts about his sanity vanish when you taste the spectacularly good guinea hen that the endive accompanies. Roasted and sauced with jus, Madeira and black truffles, it is among the most delicious things I’ve eaten this year. So is the Seagram crab cake, very sweet and pure under a golden lid of potato coins. So is the prime rib, carved thick or thin at your elbow — this time, the ritual makes sense — and set in front of you along with a meaty barbecued bone in a dark mustard and spice crust. So are the lamb chops, brushed with curry oil and grilled, with yogurt sauce and a fantastic molded cone of apple-mint jelly. So is the honey-mustard duck breast, dry aged for a month until it is supernaturally tender. So is the larded squab in bittersweet orange sauce with a grilled candied orange; the lard is provided by a cloak of whipped fat that bathes the squab breast as it cooks. So is the slice of lemon chiffon cake confected by Jennifer Yee, who is serving as pastry chef until the restaurant is on solid footing. Perfectly tender and fluffy and just sweet enough, it is the kind of dessert that has almost disappeared from New York restaurants, and deserves to come back. I’ll be thinking about those dishes for the rest of the year, and probably beyond. At least half a dozen others are merely very, very good: the gently spicy salad called avocado crab Louis; the anchovy-laced steak tartare that finishes with a surprising riptide of chile heat; the broodingly dark crab gumbo; the “Neptune’s crown” Dover sole under a Creole shellfish sauce; the hot pretzel twists and the griddled anadama bread and the nearly weightless dinner rolls brushed with butter that come around at the start of the meal. For all of this you pay prices that range from “Wow” to “Are you guys serious?” The reassembled lobster Newburg (or Newberg, as the menu has it), in a reduced-fat sauce outfitted with dried cherry tomatoes and basil leaves, is marked “MP” on the menu; it’s $98, about five times what you’d pay for a live lobster of the same size. At least it’s memorable, which is more than can be said for the $25 jumble of smoked wild mushrooms held together by a wafer-thin one-egg “omelet,” or the $38 chicken “à la Queen,” which is like chicken cacciatore that’s been fancied up.  Balanced against a few lapses of taste and judgment, though, is the real achievement of Mr. Carbone and his partners in breathing new life into the formal, French-derived style of dining. This used to be the only style chefs thought was suitable for expensive restaurants. But then tasting counters came along; suddenly the rituals of captains standing at attention above white tablecloths seemed antiquated. Taking off from the model the Major Food Group polished at Carbone, the Grill turns that old and increasingly empty formality into theater, or a game that everybody can get in on. The captains are allowed to have personalities, which means the rest of us can, too. It would work even better if Major Food Group hired more women for the dining room; it’s hard to imagine many female captains who would be O.K. with calling Marilyn Monroe “Jack’s pie.” As a strict constructionist about the architecture of this space, I can’t write about it without registering the loss of the lovely, understated modernist stemware, bowls and other pieces designed specifically for these rooms by Garth and Ada Louise Huxtable. Eating here without them is like visiting a Frank Lloyd Wright house furnished by Ikea. Some of the things they’ve been replaced by are very good. Others are reasonably apt. A few are painful. The chunky brass bar coasters marked with a big capital G are a Trumpian touch. So are the napkins with “THE GRILL” embroidered in gold thread. But coasters and napkins can’t cause lasting damage to an interior this extraordinary. It was always one of the most beautiful dining rooms in New York. Now it’s also one of its most exciting restaurants. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

71,Made Nice,0.75 star,"Aug. 15, 2017",Pete Wells,NoMad,"American, Salads",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/dining/made-nice-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/dining/made-nice-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"New Yorkers will have more idle hours on their hands, or at least more time to watch otter videos at work, if Made Nice turns out to be the future of dining in New York. The food appears within 10 minutes from the moment you walk through the door on West 28th Street. Before that happens, you choose one of the eight or so main courses pictured on the wall, give your order to an extroverted host who taps it into a hand-held screen, and mill around the silverware and condiment station until you hear your name and are handed your meal on a charcoal-colored tray that doubles as a place mat. This routine may sound familiar and indeed it is, being the basic model of fast-casual restaurants from Shake Shack on down. Made Nice has nipped and tucked the formula all around, but the biggest difference is what’s on the tray. It’s not a burger or a grain bowl but a multicolored, photogenic and meticulously arranged plate that bears at least a familial resemblance to the cooking at Eleven Madison Park and the NoMad. Like those two restaurants, Made Nice is under the ownership and direction of the chef Daniel Humm and his collaborator, Will Guidara. To bring some of their usual meticulous care and a few glimmers of their artistry to a high-speed operation is the trick Made Nice is trying to pull off. To do so, the two owners have requisitioned a sous-chef from Eleven Madison Park, Danny DiStefano, to run the enormous kitchen, while Mr. Humm waves his magic wand somewhere offstage. As trays loaded with salad-like dishes leave the counter, you can glimpse bits and pieces of the two more formal restaurants flying by, like the scraps of Kansas that Dorothy sees caught in the twister. Look — it’s the NoMad chicken! And isn’t that the pork confit from Eleven Madison Park? Well, no, not really, as you will discover when you sit down and eat. The Made Nice confit doesn’t have the creaminess or the concentrated delicacy that suckling pig gives the original, or the golden roof of crisp skin. It’s a dark brick of shredded pork, a heavy-tasting and oddly inert centerpiece for a summer salad of shaved corn, watercress and wheat berries. Served at night and on Saturdays, the chicken is the only major dish at Made Nice that could not even by the most elastic definition be called a salad. With a bread stuffing under its browned skin, it does resemble the NoMad chicken from a distance. But the one at NoMad tastes as if it comes from some lost island where the gene that controls delicious chicken flavor has been passed down intact for centuries. The Made Nice chicken, by contrast, is ordinary — moist without being juicy, as if all its flavor had leaked out of the meat in order to make the stuffing as gummy as possible. The price is $22 for half a chicken and skinny fries. The fries are very good. Nobody should be surprised when a stripped-down dish that can be ready in five minutes and costs, on average, about $14 isn’t as wonderful as one that was fluffed to greatness for its role in a $295 tasting menu. It’s not a fair fight, yet it’s one that Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara have invited by trying to link their fast-casual business with their other restaurants. But some of the food at Made Nice doesn’t just suffer by comparison; it can also suffer all on its own. The curried cauliflower is said to be a callout to another standby at the NoMad. I don’t remember trying it there, so I can’t say whether it’s so unevenly cooked that some pieces are brown and collapsed while others are white, crunchy and barely cooked. That’s how the cauliflower at Made Nice was, though. It tasted nothing like a real curry, and only a little bit like curry powder. Another dish is called chicken rice. The rice tastes like tomatoes and needs salt. The chicken seems exhausted. Imagine a chain of Cuban restaurants started by retired employees of the Olive Garden. This could be their arroz con pollo. Of the nine major dishes on the current menu, there are three I would be happy to eat again. One is a salad of watermelon and quinoa that has just enough twists and turns to stand out, like crisp pistachios and soft, creamy feta. Another, seared hanger steak slices over roasted broccoli that is chopped and seasoned with lime, may not sound like a winning combination, but it is. A third is smoked salmon salad whose croutons are, in fact, little fried cubes of shredded potato. Actually, there is a fourth dish worth revisiting, though I wouldn’t try to make a meal of it: the milk and honey sundae. The ice cream is soft serve — milk, uncontaminated by vanilla — strewn with a variety of fun, crunchy bits made from milk or honey. It’s $6. The sundae combines sophistication and pleasure better than anything else on the menu. It is also the only item you can’t get delivered. I suspect these things may be related. That enormous kitchen wasn’t built solely to feed the 30 or so people who can be seated in the restaurant. It was designed to handle a tall pile of takeout and delivery orders. So, in fact, were the recipes. Aside from the sundae, everything is engineered to look and taste almost as good after being sealed with a plastic lid, packed into a bag and carted 10 blocks. The explosion of delivery services has entranced chefs of all sorts. New York restaurants that would have hung up on you 10 years ago if you’d called for a delivery order — Mission Chinese Food, Hearth, DB Bistro Moderne, Santina, most of the Momofukus — are now, like Made Nice, signed up with Caviar. Others use services such as GrubHub, DoorDash and Postmates. According to one projection cited by The Atlantic, the market for delivery orders placed online will have grown 15 times faster than the rest of the restaurant business by the end of the decade. Meanwhile, restaurants across the country are anxiously watching as foot traffic falls at lunch and dinner. These twin trends have created a new and nearly invisible kind of restaurant with no dining room, just a commissary kitchen that fulfills orders to go. They’re called ghost restaurants. Made Nice seems to be something different. Its small dining room is merely the tip of a much bigger operation lurking below the surface. It’s an iceberg restaurant. To test it out, I ate one of my three Made Nice meals at The New York Times Building. My order showed up about a minute late, which counts as early given Midtown rush-hour traffic, and was pretty much as advertised. The fried chicken skins that are supposed to be scattered over the gravy-like chicken velouté didn’t show up, and a caper-dill relish that the menu said came with the tuna niçoise was smeared on the pork confit and the cod Provençal as well. Nothing was hot after about 30 minutes in transit. But the cooked items were still warm, the lettuce and other raw ingredients hadn’t wilted, and all the plates looked as if they had been primped by a food stylist for an overhead shot. Eating food like this at your desk would not feel like a complete surrender. Eating it in a restaurant is another story. Whether the same recipes can suit both experiences is the question Made Nice asks. Your own answer will depend on whether you are hoping for food that is quick, inexpensive and as delicious as you would expect from one of the city’s best-known chefs, or are willing to settle for two out of three.

72,Nur,2 star,"Aug. 8, 2017",Pete Wells,Flatiron,Middle Eastern,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/dining/nur-review-middle-eastern-restaurant.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/dining/nur-review-middle-eastern-restaurant.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"New York is supposed to be tough on out-of-town chefs who go into business here. In reality, it’s tough on chefs of all kinds. Distance simply multiplies the difficulties, and competition weeds out the unprepared. For long commutes, few chefs can top the one that Meir Adoni has been making since he opened a Middle Eastern restaurant called Nur on East 20th Street in April. He splits his time between Manhattan; Tel Aviv, the site of his two other restaurants; and his home outside Jerusalem. In Israel, he’s got a full dance card; he has published a cookbook app and has a leading role in a popular Israeli cooking-contest show called “Game of Chefs,” where he is both a mentor to one of the teams and a judge. (Television viewers in Israel must have different ideas about impartiality.) Running a new restaurant in New York tends to be more than a half-time job, and yet Nur doesn’t have the lethargy and mechanical quality of a kitchen run by remote control. The plates have energy. At times, in fact, they don’t know when to quit. The sauces and powders and garnishes proliferate so quickly that it’s hard to keep count. But it’s easier for a new restaurant to settle down after an excess of high spirits than to recover from a tentative start. The swirl of flavors also reflects Mr. Adoni’s expansive definition of the food of the Middle East. Nur’s menu embraces Morocco and Libya in North Africa, in addition to Israel, Yemen and Syria; again, it’s hard to keep count. His vision of his part of the globe is pluralistic. Inspired by the Arab cooks working in Mr. Adoni’s Tel Aviv restaurants, Nur’s Palestinian tartare begins with mounds of raw beef and adds layer upon layer of complication. Pine nuts, tender young favas, pickled onions, slices of green chiles, broccolini florets, sumac powder and micro-sprouts are strewn over at least three sauces, including a pitch-dark and smoky eggplant purée and a very good sheep-milk yogurt. All of this flirts with chaos, but it doesn’t topple over. Nur turns an Arab dessert, the folded pancakes called qatayef, into fried savory pies filled with a mince of spiced lamb. There is some sweetness in the dough and a fair amount of delicious fat in the lamb, so a break from the richness comes in the form of cucumber spears and salted green almonds. Maybe the yogurt-mint sauce would work better as a dip than a “chaser” served in a shot glass, but the flavors are right. Born in southern Israel to a Moroccan family, Mr. Adoni draws on some of the cooking of that culture. The Moroccan fritters known as sfenj are the basis of an odd and appealing appetizer he calls a date doughnut. Although it is sweetened by dates it could just as easily be seen as a smoked trout beignet, or, when you get right down to it, a fish cake. The sauce is an intense sweet-and-sour citrus vinaigrette with curry powder lurking in it; a few drops go a long way. Like the chatter of a nervous guest at a party, the hyperactivity of certain dishes probably comes from a desire to impress. But the quieter plates can be just as remarkable, sometimes more so. There is a suave and very good seafood stew that is a cross between bouillabaisse and chraime, the Moroccan braise of fish in spicy tomato sauce. On the side is a bowl of what has to be the finest couscous I’ve ever eaten in a restaurant. Mr. Adoni says he learned to make the fluffy little semolina crumbs from a Libyan woman. Also from Libya is the scoop of tershi that sits atop the couscous. Made from pumpkin, eggplant and harissa, it is sweet, spicy and terrific. One factor in Nur’s early success — the small dining room has been thronged every time I’ve gone — is Mr. Adoni’s business partner and guide to local customs, Gadi Peleg. An owner of Breads Bakery, a champion producer of babka and rugelach, Mr. Peleg found the space, which crouches three steps below grade, beneath an eyelash-extension salon. The ceilings are low. The layout is tight. The service is familiar and opinionated about the menu. (Almost all the opinions are positive.) The place looks and acts, in other words, like a New York restaurant. It sounds like one, too, when all the seats are taken and raised voices start careening off the ceiling. Oddly enough, the bar is relatively quiet, and not a bad place to eat if you want to have a conversation. Mr. Peleg had a hand in the menu, and makes all the breads at his bakery from Mr. Adoni’s recipes. There is a miniature loaf of challah brushed with honey, salt and golden flakes of garlic; a kind of Yemenite monkey bread, flecked with nigella seeds, called kubaneh; and a sesame-blitzed Jerusalem bagel the size of a small bath mat. I recommend trying all three. Probably not on the same night. With all the ideas zinging around Nur’s menu, a few are bound to veer off in the wrong direction. The brazenly trayf gefilte shrimp, buried under pebbles of dashi jelly, doesn’t open up the way it should; both it and the jelly are too firm to melt on the tongue. A main course of octopus shimmers under a fine spice glaze, but gets wrong-footed by a jumble of sauces. Sea scallops, another main course, get along better with just one good sauce, a tart sorrel purée with an undercurrent of cumin. If the kitchen can do something about the awful, overcooked nuggets of ricotta gnudi, it would be onto something. Lisa Meisenger, the pastry chef, is certainly with the program. For a recent special, she scattered some juicy, dark strawberries over a bay-leaf custard with candied walnuts and pine-nut brittle. Rounded out with a scoop of mastic ice cream and decorated with flowers and edible gold, it was one of the more straightforward desserts. Something going by the name of chocolate cassata is made up of three small sandwiches of pistachio ice cream between almond cookies. They are nearly engulfed by chocolate foam, cherries in syrup, orange zest and candied pistachio. It is hectic, but delicious. Mr. Adoni said he would like to open a second New York restaurant. Selfishly, I’m hoping it will be North African; he could build an entire menu around that Libyan couscous. But he has his sights on a kosher restaurant. If he can use ingredients as vibrant as those at Nur, and keep the prices from soaring out the window, it would be a real achievement. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

73,Guan Fu Sichuan,3 star,"Aug. 1, 2017",Pete Wells,Flushing,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/dining/guan-fu-sichuan-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/dining/guan-fu-sichuan-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Before I’d seen my first chile pepper at Guan Fu, it was already clear that it is a new kind of Sichuan restaurant for New York. To get there, you head to downtown Flushing, Queens, cross a courtyard off Prince Street and pass between the two stone lions under a small Chinese gabled roof, guarding the front door. Inside is a dignified dining room where polished wood panels stand next to weathered wooden screens under gilded, illuminated ceiling recesses. In the private rooms visible behind sliding doors, a few of the chairs look like small thrones. The ones in the main dining room are elaborate, cushioned and wide enough for two. The tables are set with dark wooden chopstick handles, wrapped in metal filigree at one end, with brushed steel tips at the other. To use them, you twist disposable bamboo tips into the steel ends. While you’re doing this, a server brings a party-size segmented wooden bowl holding sunflower seeds and roasted watermelon seeds for you to crack open while you page through the menu. Guan Fu Sichuan’s formality and rich interior detail are rare among this city’s Sichuan restaurants. Atmosphere doesn’t fill your stomach, of course, but when it’s done right, it can slow you down and wake your senses to the smells and tastes on the way. That is the case at Guan Fu, where the kitchen doesn’t always try to strafe your palate into submission with a hail of chiles. The flavors are potent, but they don’t get all of their force from their heat. I didn’t think I could love Sichuan boiled fish with pickled vegetables more than I already do until I tasted Guan Fu’s version. Here the body and flavor of what is typically a rather thin sauce is broadened with a stock made from fish bones. Fresh green chiles provide a heat held in thrilling check by the sourness. The broth is too intensely salty to qualify as soup, the server explained, but I still drank as much of it as I could handle. The kitchen gives mapo tofu, that old war horse, a new lease on life. While the chile heat is not full-bore, the fermented beans and other components are. Shimmering over jiggly mounds of white tofu is a mapo sauce as deeply flavored as any I’ve tasted. Cabbage is fried with pork and fresh chiles, but the appeal of the dish is the way the invisible presence of Sichuan peppercorns sets your mouth and lips tingling. And there is hardly any heat at all in the “eggplant with iron plate.” Traditionally made at home for Sichuan spring festivals, the dish was new to me, and I was very glad to make its acquaintance. Slices of eggplant are slit open, stuffed like dumplings with a pork-eggplant filling, then closed up, battered and fried. They are served in a pan kept over a small flame. The sauce that coated them was swimming with scallions and a few lengths of dried chile, but it drew its energy from the tension between sweet and sour. Not that the kitchen avoids spices. One reason to keep your wits about you while eating at Guan Fu is that you can’t always tell when extreme heat is about to rain down like Judgment Day. One of the hottest things on the menu, the Guan Fu-style cuttlefish salad, contains almost no red chiles. Its ability to shock and amaze comes from fresh green chiles that are roasted until black, skinned and made into a sauce that tastes almost Mexican. Barely cooked cuttlefish are scored with a knife so they twist up and look like little pine cones. That potent green sauce insinuates itself into every one of their crevices. This is one of many Guan Fu dishes that are rarely seen in New York, if ever. The menu is about 40 glossy pages long and full of color photographs of coral groupers, crystal crabs and other sea animals. In some parts it looks like a children’s book, although the kids won’t like the way the story ends for the soft-shell turtle. If you order one, a live specimen is brought out for inspection and reappears a short time later in pieces, mingled with potatoes, green beans and pickled cherry peppers. Its shell lies over the dish like a green cloche. Tradition dictates that the oldest person at the table has first crack at the chewy rim of fat around the edge. (At my table, that honor went to me. It and the soft cartilage were the most interesting parts of the animal; the meat was like fish-flavored chicken.) Not all the exotic imported species were available when I went, and others were offered at prices that scared me off. They are, presumably, meant for other customers who can afford to pay for a taste of home. Guan Fu, which joins a cluster of restaurants under the Hyatt Place hotel in the One Fulton Square real estate venture, is a reflection of the new money that is starting to transform this end of Flushing. The owners, Li Boru and Xue Wei, moved from China to New York to go to graduate school and wanted to open a restaurant that would evoke the aristocratic cooking of China’s dynastic era. For ordinary budgets, the kitchen will make most fish dishes with either tilapia or sea bass. The bass, clean and fresh tasting, is what I ordered with the pickled vegetables and in an equally heroic dish called “homemade roasted fish.” The bass was cooked whole and served with crunchy lotus root in a dark, fiery, wonderful stew seasoned with cilantro, Sichuan peppercorns and a 32-ingredient chile oil. Among the menu’s soft spots were two dishes any Sichuan restaurant should nail. Both dan dan noodles and kung pao chicken were unaccountably sleepy. Still, the noodles themselves, made on site, were very good, and the chicken had real flavor, which isn’t always the case. This wasn’t enough to make either dish interesting, but it does show the care Guan Fu takes with its ingredients. The day-to-day cooking is in the hands of one chef and the recipes are the domain of another, who works in Chengdu, the capital of the Sichuan Province. Mr. Li and Mr. Xue declined to name either man, citing personal reasons and a fear of chef poachers. According to one server, the chef in Chengdu was meant to join the one in Flushing but has been prevented from leaving China. This may explain some minor kitchen inconsistencies, like knife work that can be painstaking on some nights but haphazard on others. The dining room staff is variable, too. Multiple cues were missed at one dinner, when plates weren’t changed and cups of very good jasmine tea weren’t refilled as often as we would have liked. During other meals, the servers were extraordinarily eager to help. Guan Fu is a restaurant with room to grow. But it is an exceptional one already, throwing open a window on Sichuan cuisine to show New Yorkers the nuance and rich variety that lie beyond the old blast of chiles.

74,Atla,2 star,"July 25, 2017",Pete Wells,NoHo,Mexican,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/dining/atla-review-mexican-restaurant-noho.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/dining/atla-review-mexican-restaurant-noho.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Since Atla ambled up to the corner of Lafayette and Great Jones Streets this spring, all the people who run to every new opening in town have been telling me they want to eat chilaquiles for breakfast there; they want the chicken enchiladas for lunch; they want to hide from the afternoon sun with a tall glass of iced tepache, a tingling, off-dry agua fresca Atla makes by letting sugar ferment with pineapple rinds. Sometimes, under their breath, they query a few of the prices at this casual Mexican cafe (“Fourteen dollars for radishes?”), but I haven’t talked to anyone who doesn’t think Atla is an extremely likable place. Despite its fairly modest goals, or maybe because of them, Atla is one of the least divisive restaurants Manhattan has seen in some time. It’s as if people, worn out by the sheer effort of being scandalized by the news, had decided that 2017 would be more bearable if we could all just find one thing to agree about. Atla is that thing. Opened by Enrique Olvera, the chef best known for Pujol in Mexico City, together with his proxy in New York, Daniela Soto-Innes, and their chef de cuisine, Hugo Vera, Atla knows just what it’s doing without seeming to try. This combination is as attractive in a restaurant as it is in a person. One thing it is not trying to do is make a big statement. Mr. Olvera and Ms. Soto-Innes made their statement already, at Cosme, their more elaborate restaurant on East 21st Street, which is now nearly as well known as Pujol. Having proved at Cosme that they have original things to say about Mexican cuisine, they are set free at Atla to serve Mexican food that New Yorkers may want to eat every day. Which is not to say that this is the everyday cooking of Mexico. While Cosme specializes in the kind of layered, multicomponent dishes with which chefs make their mark, Atla’s menu is simpler. The chilaquiles are just chilaquiles, tortilla chips in red or green salsa under white onions and a tangy crema. The chips are thick enough to keep their crunch, and they get more of it from a sprinkling of toasted flaxseeds. Flaxseeds are not a standard garnish for chilaquiles, but they are symptomatic of the contemporary strain of nutrient-conscious eating Atla displays. It has less in common with the sturdy cooking of traditional Mexican restaurants than with the modified health-food aesthetic of places like Dimes that cater to the yoga-mat crowd. Besides a regular cafe con leche Atla serves two versions with no dairy; one is made with cashew milk (a little odd) and another with coconut milk (wonderful). In any form, the cafe con leche is made with strong espresso, sweet enough to get along without sugar. Chia bowls usually bore me, despite their exemplary levels of omega-3 fatty acids, but the one at Atla held my attention. It’s stirred with sweet Mexican cinnamon, like a semisolid horchata, and topped with candied ginger, pumpkin seeds and nuts. A number of dishes are flat-out salads, like the fine if not soul-stirring quinoa with cucumbers and pico de gallo. Others are salad-adjacent. Those $14 radishes, cool, crisp and skinny, surround a smooth avocado dip. The chunky guacamole is pounded with nearly enough tarragon, mint and basil to qualify as an herb salad. When it arrives it is nearly invisible under a single chile-dusted corn chip the color of a wet bluestone sidewalk, and the size of a flip-flop. A smaller, rounder blue masa chip, spread with farmer cheese and capers, is the foundation of the arctic char tostada. As an attempt to introduce Russ & Daughters to Mexico it is all right, but it doesn’t go beyond that. The ceviche verde, on the other hand, is more dynamic than you expect, thanks to the fresh ginger in its tart green sauce, among other tricks. Depending on your metabolism, all this will leave you feeling either refreshed and ready to meet the day or slightly hungry. To make a lunch of the chilaquiles I needed to fortify the plate with poached chicken, bringing a $14 dish to $19. There are more substantial things to eat. Gray sole fried in a crunchy panko crust that tastes of garlic and butter is a complete meal. It comes with a small cucumber salad, like a Viennese schnitzel, although in Vienna they probably wouldn’t bathe the cucumbers in herb juice and add green chiles and cilantro. Nor would they sell you a $3 plate of warm tortillas so you can make your own tacos. Maybe they should, though. The pambazo, meanwhile, is the traditional sandwich of chorizo and potatoes on a soft roll dipped in guajillo salsa. It’s more or less the pambazo you would get out of a Oaxacan lunch truck if you were lucky enough to find one parked on Lafayette Street. Still, the overall lightness of the food has some bearing on the one real debate you could have about Atla. The question is not whether to go, but when. (People plan their meals at Cosme a week ahead or more, and while Atla takes reservations, going there tends to be a spur-of-the-moment decision.) The dining room’s corner space is wrapped in plate glass. By day this invites the sunshine in and provides a wide-screen view of the endless fashion parade of NoHo. By night, when the eggs and other breakfast dishes roll off the menu and the room fills up with people more interested in mezcal and the “overproof margarita” than coffee and agua fresca, the windows become sounding boards. At times like this you may notice all the other hard surfaces, like the stone floor; you may wonder why only some of the seats have backs; you may be frustrated in your effort to keep all your plates and glasses on the small round table. The very qualities that make Atla ideal for a relaxed breakfast or lunch, in other words, make it a dinner destination that is best approached with a moderate appetite, a resilient lower back and a suspicion that whatever your friends are saying probably isn’t important anyway. Better still, treat it as a drinking spot where food is an added attraction. For dessert there is a curious tamal topped with queso fresco. It’s more salty than sweet, a minor-key reprise of the great corn-husk meringue at Cosme. The most appealing dessert I had was a roasted sweet potato under a caramelized pool of sweetened condensed milk. It is off the menu now, but I am telling you about it anyway because I suspect it will be back. I know I will. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

75,Little Tong Noodle Shop,2 star,"July 11, 2017",Pete Wells,East Village,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/dining/little-tong-noodle-shop-review-east-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/dining/little-tong-noodle-shop-review-east-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Wheat noodles blur at the edges. At their core, they taste of cooked flour, or flour and egg, but toward the surface, they take on the flavor of their sauce. Think of pappardelle allied with a meaty ragù, or spools of ramen entwined with pork broth, throwing off starch, drinking in soup. Their boundaries dissolve. Rice noodles have very little flavor of their own and generally don’t take on much, either. They tend to make a hard break with their surrounding flavors; the more intense those flavors, the more welcome the break. They are almost pure texture. The favorite noodle in the Yunnan Province of southwestern China is a long, round, spaghetti-like rice noodle called mixian. It is the specialty at Little Tong Noodle Shop, a small, new, inexpensive restaurant in the East Village. Little Tong’s mixian seems to have a barely perceptible sour tang, but it is the very soft and elusively smooth texture that is most memorable. Just when your mouth is about to get some purchase on the noodles, away they slip. Little Tong Noodle Shop plunges mixian into soups and sauces that make a definite impression. Yunnan shares borders with Tibet, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos; northern Thailand is not too far, either. The characteristic Southeast Asian tension of saltiness, sourness and chile heat creeps into these noodle bowls. They are buoyed by green herbs, too, by mint and cilantro, and by the tendency of the chef, Simone Tong, to twist contrasting strands of flavor together. Fundamentally, the banna shrimp mixian is a tomato soup, removed from Campbell’s reach by a whiff of smoke and a slight taste of shrimp and crab shells. Wheels of pickled green chiles add not just heat but depth; there are fried shallots, too, and fresh mint, stirred in along with coconut. In the grandma chicken mixian, a dark and grainy oil slick — a distillation of garlic and black sesame — dyes and deepens a chicken broth that is already so full-bodied it’s almost sticky. Resting on top of the rice noodles is chicken confit, which, in terms of moistness and flavor, is the exact opposite of the desiccated, used-up meat typically found in chicken soups. There are spicy red bits of fermented chile, some salty and sour pickles, an egg boiled in pu-erh tea, and long ivory chrysanthemum petals. It has to be the most interesting chicken noodle soup in the city right now. Another soup, the “little pot” mixian, tastes something like a spicy miso ramen that has shed its excess weight and picked up extra flavors. Chopped shiitakes and pork belly sit on the surface of the salty, milky pork broth, along with garlic chives and minced stems of pickled mustard greens. If this had been ramen, I would have left some noodles behind, but I finished this bowl, all of it, in an astonished haze, and didn’t regret it.  Little Tong Noodle Shop is Ms. Tong’s first restaurant as chef. She is also an owner. It is a modest place in many ways. The drinks list offers one red, one white, one rosé and a handful of beers and sakes. (The best choice may be Yunnanese tea.) There are 28 indoor seats, some pale wood slats on one wall, and exposed brick on another. The Noodle Shop does not necessarily invite comparisons to a more famous Noodle Bar three doors south on First Avenue, but it does not exactly discourage comparisons to David Chang’s restaurant, either. Like Mr. Chang, who cooked for Tom Colicchio before opening the first Momofuku, Ms. Tong threaded a path toward Asian noodles that ran through modern New York restaurant kitchens. Born in Chengdu, China, she went to culinary school in the United States. She worked as an intern for Masato Shimizu while he was still at 15 East, and cooked for Wylie Dufresne at WD-50 and Alder. It’s easier to see an American chef’s sensibility in the section of the menu called “little eats,” which are free of noodles and give Ms. Tong a chance to evoke Yunnan with East Coast ingredients. She coaxes impressive flavors from a small amount of cold Chinese broccoli dressed in citrus soy, with a salty, crunchy and smoky dusting of grated egg yolk. The “mini stir fry,” a seasonal improvisation, was made recently with fiddlehead ferns, pine nuts and tender, lime-green needles from the spring tips of spruce branches. They eat flowers in Yunnan, and Ms. Tong seems to recognize the value, in the age of Instagram, of a strategically deployed blossom or two. (They eat insects in Yunnan, too, but you don’t see her garnishing plates with deep-fried bamboo grubs.) In the case of the excellent egg drop soup, the stray petals had less presence than the corn kernels and salmon roe and the rags of cooked egg whites in the translucent broth. But I liked the peppery bite that chrysanthemum brought to the grandma chicken mixian and found the rose petals on the Yunnan salad to be more than just decorative. You will think this salad belongs in a trattoria when I tell you that it is composed mainly of radicchio and prosciutto, but no Italian would then go on to add fresh pineapple and boiled beef tendon. One night I ate peanut butter cookies for dessert. I’ve never seen them again. Where in Yunnan they came from, I don’t know; where they’ve gone, I can only guess. My latest meal there ended with six flavors of fruit sorbet in gumball-size scoops topped, of course, with edible flowers. The noodles cost either $14 or $15, except for one special, which is $16. Every appetizer is under $10 except the chopped raw beef, which is dressed with shallot oil and chile oil and can be spread on flaky, oily scallion bread with a daub of Sichuan-spiced beef fat or a swipe of smoked egg yolk. For this I paid $13 without griping. In fact, because Little Tong’s prices include service, they all seemed too low to be real. I wouldn’t mind if Ms. Tong asked $16 or $17 for noodles, rather than charging $1 each for chile oil, chile soy sauce and fermented chiles. People in Yunnan like to doctor their broth to taste from a whole range of condiments and spices; it’s part of the experience. Ms. Tong has a precise palate, I think, but there were times when I wanted to recalibrate the broth. Little Tong Noodle Shop is strict about not seating incomplete parties, even when the place is empty. Once you have a table, though, the servers are quick and sympathetic. The dining room is overseen by Emmeline Zhao, who has the twin titles of general manager and panda caretaker. One of the sakes comes in a glass decorated with painted pandas, like an old Welch’s jelly jar. Panda art hangs in the front window, and if you are ever called on to administer the Heimlich maneuver to a panda, the custom-drawn choking poster by the restroom door should provide all the information you need.

76,ABCV,2 star,"July 3, 2017",Pete Wells,Flatiron,"Vegan, Vegetarian",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/dining/abcv-review-vegetables-restaurant-jean-georges-vongerichten.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/dining/abcv-review-vegetables-restaurant-jean-georges-vongerichten.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Warnings about the risks of eating raw shellfish and eggs are now fairly routine on menus. Somewhat less common are disclaimers like the one that appears next to an asterisk on the drinks menu of Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s latest restaurant, ABCV: “These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. If you are pregnant, nursing, have a medical condition or take medications, please consult with a healthcare professional before use.” This note refers to a group of juice blends with ingredients from ayurvedic and other medical traditions, and what the Food and Drug Administration has not signed off on are not so much statements as nebulous targets that the juices may or may not hit. The first one I drank was tangerine and black currant juice dosed with rhodiola, St. John’s wort and albizia, which some believe fight anxiety and depression. ABCV calls this beverage Joy. Those who follow Mr. Vongerichten know the chef to be a protean shape-shifter. Over the years, he has championed Asian fusion, luxe American comfort food and border-dissolving pan-Latinism, among other things, all while holding down the fort of modern haute cuisine at Jean-Georges. Still, it is a bit surprising to see him pop up as a pitchman for drinks that require cutting and pasting verbiage from section 101.93 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The V in ABCV performs triple duty, standing for vegetables, vibrations and Vongerichten. It does not officially signify vegan, although many things on the menu are. Sustainable farming is favored. Ingredients whose genes have been monkeyed with are avoided. The aromas of cooking animal flesh do not pollute the atmosphere of the dining room, which is loftlike and white with a few brightly colored chairs, like the lounge in “2001: A Space Odyssey.” ABCV sits on East 19th Street, inside ABC Carpet & Home and side by side with ABC Kitchen and ABC Cocina. Mr. Vongerichten owns and operates all three with Paulette Cole, the store’s proprietor. Sustainability was a theme in the first two ABC restaurants, but ABCV extends the idea into a boutique wellness exercise. It is the sort of restaurant where the menu has a preface. ABCV, it explains, “is here to serve, inform and inspire a cultural shift towards plant-based intelligence.” The food is not simply vegetarian. It is “high vibration,” and has the goal of nurturing “our personal and planetary ecosystems.” An insert within the menu, illustrated with pretty watercolor drawings, goes into detail on the health benefits of various plants you may encounter. I found the menu’s prose mildly indigestible, but the food it describes is light, colorful, fresh and easy to like. Some of it is memorable, and none of it makes you feel as if you have asked your stomach to do things it wasn’t meant to do. These are the two sides of ABCV: a missionary message combined with cooking that has a large measure of creativity and surprise. I guess that qualifies as “high vibration.” Some of the most engaging courses at ABCV are dips. The gold medal in this event goes to the green hummus made with fresh chickpeas and Thai basil and served with substantial puffs of whole-grain pita. Good hummus has many fine qualities, but it is rarely exciting. This is. Running a close second is the labneh fortified with shallots, which give it some of the charm of an old-fashioned cocktail-party onion dip. It is great on purple potato chips or cucumbers (“a warrior against hypertension and heart disease”). Mr. Vongerichten and his chef de cuisine, Neal Harden, focus their salads in ways that turn them into precise statements. There’s nothing random about the pairing of bitter radicchio with ripe strawberries, a few of which are crushed so they get smeared around the purple leaves and join forces with the saffron vinaigrette. Warm appetizers are built with a similar care. Grilled caps of donko shiitakes the size of muffin tops are spread with a green goddess dressing with a tingling charge of yuzukosho. The mushrooms (whose B vitamins help “manage physical and emotional stress”) come with caramelized fennel, a more apt partner than you might guess. Roasted carrots (“eat with oil or a fat to absorb the full benefit of her beta-carotene”) are spritzed with lime and piled over an excellent and spicy butter, ground from toasted nuts and seeds. All of this is many miles away in flavor and charisma from the dour school of vegetable cookery that has been dished out recently by young, Nordic-influenced chefs I think of as the Brotherhood of the Charred Sunchoke. These chefs avoid the spices, citrus and chiles of warmer climates, presumably in tribute to their North Star, the Copenhagen restaurant Noma. Mr. Vongerichten and Mr. Harden aren’t playing in that sandbox. They’ve got their own toys. When a squirt of lime juice can help, squirt they will. One or two dishes struck this omnivore as not quite complete. A plate of crisp, salty, horseradish-spiked sauerkraut made from savoy cabbage was a little monotonous on its own. I’ll bet it’s fantastic on a hot dog. I also wanted more heft from the parts of the menu headed “noodles and rice” and “legumes and grains.” In the wild rice with spring vegetables and fermented carrots, rice was an ensemble player, not the lead. And when my server recommended the spinach spaghetti by means of a story about cooking pasta at his mother’s side, I was hoping for more than a sparrow’s nest of green noodles under a mulch of kale and broccoli (“a cruciferous that prevents premature aging”). The flavors were very good, livened up with preserved lemons, but I had to manage my stomach’s expectations. Desserts are unpredictable. You could get a grainy, thick, cakelike pudding trying to pass for chocolate mousse. Or you could have an exemplary pavlova outfitted with strawberries and rhubarb. And yet, I always got up from the table feeling pretty good. True, the health claims are not made in a style that appeals to everyone. ABCV goes in a little too much for the Goop style of transactional nutrition: If you eat X, then Y will (or won’t) happen. But since I tend to treat nutritional advice the way the owner of a new Lamborghini treats speed-limit signs, I sent ABCV’s menu to Jeffrey B. Blumberg, who researches antioxidants at Tufts University. For the most part, he approved. The specific claims looked largely accurate to him, and the more general ones struck him as vague enough to be harmless. “I’m not giving it a scientific endorsement for precision,” Dr. Blumberg said. “But this kind of information, in a very subtle way, gives you the idea that each of these plant foods gives you different things. And if you put enough of them on your plate, you’ll be eating according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which very few people follow.” Did I eat more vegetables than usual at ABCV? Yes. Will it stop me from aging? Time will tell. Did my Joy bring me joy? Maybe not, but it didn’t make matters worse, either. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

77,Empellón,3 star,"June 27, 2017",Pete Wells,Midtown,"American, Mexican",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/dining/empellon-review-mexican-midtown.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/dining/empellon-review-mexican-midtown.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"To begin at the end, the desserts at the new Empellón in Midtown are some of the most exciting New York has seen in a long time. Empellón is the flashiest, fanciest and newest of Alex Stupak’s three restaurants, and the one that provides the fullest expression of his dreamscape vision of Mexican food. He doesn’t reproduce or translate the cuisine; he builds a fantasy version of it, coupling deep technical skills with imagination to create a slightly unreal version of reality, the way the best animated movies do. Dessert lends itself to fantasies better than other kinds of cooking, a fact that Mr. Stupak and his pastry chef, Justin Binnie, have exploited to the hilt. One of the desserts is a frozen parfait that looks like half an avocado on a snowy bed of ice. The illusion is almost perfect, with tones of green that fade from the near black of the peel to a grassy pale color in the divot where the pit should go. The mimicry isn’t just visual. The parfait is as creamy and smooth as the flesh of an avocado left on the counter for four days. But of course it’s sweeter and tastes of butterfat, so it’s a relief when the ice crystals melt on your tongue into a bright limeade. Under the ice is yogurt infused with eucalyptus. Although making all this can’t possibly be simple, the flavors are, and they’re wonderfully balanced. Another dessert comes in the form of a taco, because why not? A waffle cone folded into the shape of a hard-shell tortilla is stuffed with a delicious ice cream flavored by corn and salt. It might be Empellón’s answer to the corn husk meringue at Cosme. It might be a tribute to Corn Pops. Either way, it’s great. “Strawberries for the table” is a plate of seven one-bite sweets with different permutations of the fruit. One is a raw, red berry. Its leaves have been replaced by shiso, it’s been stuffed with yuzu jelly, and it’s electrifying. Another is a birch-flavored marshmallow dusted with powdered, dried strawberries. Eating all seven took me about four minutes (including pauses for such penetrating insights as “Wow!”) and completely restored my faith in the power of a good pastry chef to amplify and extend the themes that started with vegetables and meat. Restaurant reviews don’t usually turn over so much space to desserts, but the ones at Empellón deserve it. They also illustrate how much Mr. Stupak has matured as both chef and restaurateur since he left a career in pastry to tackle Mexican food.  Before it closed recently, Empellón Cocina in the East Village was Mr. Stupak’s statement restaurant, and boy, did he have a statement to make. He had come out of the pastry kitchens of two of the country’s most determinedly avant-garde restaurants, Alinea and WD-50, and many of his dishes were self-consciously arty and tightly clenched. Even the action-painting bloops of salsa and mole radiated tension. I loved the flavors, but sometimes it seemed as if Mr. Stupak didn’t have the heart to tell his food that somebody was going to try to eat it. Maybe it’s the competition from Cosme, which takes a much less formalist approach to high-end Mexican cooking. Maybe Mr. Stupak has more empathy for his customers now. Maybe setting up shop in a big, two-level space in Midtown in March triggered a dormant crowd-pleasing gene. Whatever the cause, the food he is cooking at Empellón wants to be liked. There’s no doubt that you’re supposed to knock back the oyster shooter in tomato-and-orange-flavored water with drops of ketchup oil floating on the surface. A distillation of the flavors in a Mexican seafood cocktail, the shooter disappears in one fast gulp. Another seafood cocktail is made from poached lobster and curls and spears of cucumber jutting out of a lovely lobster cream that functions like a party dip. Served in a vase like a flower arrangement — there are even some purple star-shaped blossoms scattered around — it’s as striking as anything at Empellón Cocina, but the relaxed generosity feels new. There’s a wild salad of yellow beets under a snow pile of green-chile granita and coconut crema. And there’s a tart heap of salmon tartare chopped with gooseberries; it’s dotted with crema and a gooseberry-pasilla chile salsa. One dish puts young red-leaf lettuces spritzed with lime and salted water next to what looks like the icing on a birthday cake: It’s salsa verde creamed with butter, spread smooth and ringed with crema in tiny piped rosettes. If there is anyone who hasn’t yet figured out that butter makes salads better, spreading this salsa verde icing on lettuce leaves should be persuasive. Larger courses don’t have built-in structural barriers to sharing, as some dishes at Empellón Cocina did. Roasted sea bream is served whole under pickled onions, thin wheels of tomatillo and miniature salsa-verde-soaked chilaquiles. Short-rib confit pulls apart into rich purplish hunks that you eat with a version of picadillo in which every ingredient tastes more delicious than it’s supposed to. Pork belly slices attached to ribbons of crunchy skin come inside a kind of taco bowl made from a single, plate-size chicharrón. You can crack the chicharrón and use the shards as chips, or you can fold it into a warm tortilla with watermelon radishes, sliced chiles and some habanero salsa that gives the pork the get-up-and-go it needs.  In one section of the menu, Empellón’s desire to please does not quite translate into actual pleasure: the tacos. I used to think Mr. Stupak did not know what tacos are. He’s been serving them for so long, though, that now I suspect he just wants them to be something else. He seems to have the idea that because people love tacos, he can fill them with weird things — curled tendrils of octopus on spicy peanut butter, or dense and dry falafel balls with grasshopper hummus — as an invitation to the rest of the menu. Yes, anything can be turned into a taco, but perhaps not everything should. The best taco I had at Empellón, not counting the corn ice cream, was one I made from the peppers and onions sizzling on an iron plate on which a server had briefly seared a Wagyu steak. This is a great, witty take on fajitas, although the joke would be funnier if it didn’t cost $125. You can write off the tacos completely, and what’s left is still a very enjoyable restaurant. The architecture firm Glen & Company has brought some Broadway boogie-woogie to the space, creating rhythm with colors and suspending a theatrical scalloped balcony over the main floor. There’s enough room between the tables for a bar cart to trundle around loaded with bottles of mezcal and other hard stuff. It’s another way for Mr. Stupak to show that he’s serious now about bringing the party to the table. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

He could have shortened that to “get ready for a lot,” or just “get ready.” Some preparation for the meal to come is definitely in order for the uninitiated, a word that on a typical day applies to nobody at this white-tablecloth red-sauce restaurant in South Ozone Park, Queens. Don Peppe novices need to know that certain items are not welcome on the premises, as listed on a sign on the front door: No Tank Tops, Hats, Strollers, Baby Carriages, Credit Cards. With these exceptions, the dress code is permissive and allows for pantsuits, polo shirts, track jackets, pleated trousers, wide shorts. The manager in charge of the waiting list one recent night — reservations aren’t taken — had on a guayabera embroidered with a Yankees logo. Waiters wear white shirts and neckties. Bussers are dressed in black T-shirts with The Original Baked Clams printed on the back, a stirring if undocumented claim. Don Peppe is about half a mile north of a long-term parking lot for Kennedy International Airport and half a mile east of Aqueduct Racetrack. Seeing the jockey silks and photographs of thoroughbreds hanging on the walls, a first-timer might conclude that the restaurant has been a horse-themed clubhouse for touts, trainers, gamblers and bookmakers since the Damon Runyon era. In fact, the original racing décor, which dated back to the 1960s, when Don Peppe moved to Lefferts Boulevard from Brooklyn, was replaced by Italian landscape paintings many years ago as Aqueduct traffic faded. Michael DeLuca Sr., the owner, said the track crowd had started to come back recently, with bigger shares of the purse in their pockets. In their honor, he revived the equestrian motif. A person who knows of Don Peppe only as a scheme of Turtle’s in an “Entourage” subplot may ask to see the wine list. Everybody at Don Peppe drinks the house white or the house red. Both come in bottles with no cork and no label. Both are well chilled. Both have the carefree good cheer of the very young. It would be a similar error to wait for menus. They are not printed on paper. Everything, the antipasti and pastas, the seafood, meat and desserts, is printed in white on a blackboard. If the sightlines were better, a person with good vision could read it from the other side of Lefferts Boulevard. Sitting in a corner, my guide couldn’t see the menu and didn’t need to. He mentioned about a dozen family-size dishes to the waiter: baked clams, fried peppers, the “special salad,” a pound of pasta (the minimum serving), another pound of pasta, veal cutlets and something called shrimp Luciano, which may or may not be named after Lucky Luciano. “You want linguine with the shrimp Luciano?” the waiter asked. “Why not?” So that was another pound. I thought my guide had finished, but he was merely pausing for breath. “We should get the chicken Chinese, just so you can try it,” he said. “Oh, and the steak’s not bad either. Let’s get a porterhouse.” As I was saying, it was a lot, and as he had warned me, a lot of flavor, although another way to put that would be to say a lot of garlic. Garlic chopped to a fine mist and warmed with clam juice and olive oil sloshes under the baked littlenecks, a dozen to an order. Spooned over the almost blackened crust of bread crumbs, this sauce is rich and gentle. It doesn’t bully the freshly shucked clams, whose small size — inside their shells, many are no bigger than a quarter — helps distance Don Peppe from legions of other baked-clam artists around the city. Garlic in whole cloves is browned with onions and strips of red peppers in a pan hot enough to scare the peppers out of their skins. Called fried peppers, it’s essentially a three-ingredient dish, five if you count black pepper and olive oil, and the first time you eat it you can’t quite believe how far the flavors take you. One person I ate with insisted that the peppers had to have been laced with sugar. A more likely explanation is that the kitchen makes these dishes and others the way they are supposed to be made, adding a few flourishes of its own. This is a rare thing. Italian-American restaurant cooking is not an endangered species in New York just yet, but enough of its practitioners have closed or slumped into irrelevance to raise concerns about gene pool dilution. Don Peppe is one of the few exemplars where pride and purpose, both essential to this cuisine, remain intact. Mr. DeLuca employs three chefs, all charged with following recipes that in most cases go back more than 100 years, to when the restaurant was founded by a Neapolitan who went by the name Don Peppe. (His full name and the exact date were forgotten many baked clams ago.) Those pounds of pasta are one place where the difference is plain. White clam sauce can be a thin soup with stray eraser tips, or it can be, as it is at Don Peppe, a concentrated broth that sinks deep into the pasta, which sits under a wide swath of chopped fresh clams and parsley. The pomodoro sauce is a thick, profoundly red gravy that doesn’t cast a watery pool on the bottom of the plate. The same sauce, or one close to it, is the bed for shells stuffed with ricotta, topped with mozzarella and run under the broiler long enough to put a crackle on the lips of the shells. The meat sauce is just meat sauce. The marinara, though, is what every jarred sauce on the market wishes it could be. Beginners may need to have a few menu items decoded. Don Peppe special salad: iceberg, tomatoes, salami, provolone and so forth, in a huge bowl. It sounds ordinary but somehow it isn’t. Shrimp Luciano: shrimp in a garlic-butter sauce turned sunset pink by a rumor of tomatoes. It’s great, and there’s no reason not to have it over pasta. Veal Don Peppe: chopped raw tomatoes, red peppers and onions ladled over a breaded cutlet that you could slice with a wooden spoon. Chicken Chinese: cut-up chicken in a tomato sauce reduced to a brownish jam. The least compelling of these is the chicken Chinese, the subject of a homage on Carbone’s opening menu. (It didn’t make sense there, either.) At Don Peppe, it tends toward dryness, an affliction that can also touch the chicken scarpariello. In several return visits, I noticed regulars eating things not advertised on the menu — stuffed peppers, a porterhouse, a tomahawk chop with a bone that you could use to prop up a car hood. The beef is better than you might expect but will not give you the false impression that Don Peppe is a steakhouse. The best dessert is probably the cheesecake. The rest are what kids in Bay Ridge and Corona used to want on their birthdays: tortoni, tartufo, spumoni. Of course, the other people at your table will say they have no room for dessert.

79,King,2 star,"June 6, 2017",Pete Wells,SoHo,"French, Italian",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/dining/king-restaurant-review-soho.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/dining/king-restaurant-review-soho.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"A friend who has made herself a regular at the SoHo restaurant King sums up its appeal, with deep approval, as “food on a plate in a room.” This undersells the place — King offers much more than that — but she has a point. The restaurant, which opened in September, is not a show-off. The dining room is small, tidy and nearly square, painted the pale color of butter in the winter. Windows stretching to the ceiling along the north wall look out on the dormered Federal townhouses of King Street. The facing wall is broken up with a single abstract painting, a doorway to the kitchen and a long opening behind which the four people who make up the entire kitchen staff can be seen at work. It is a room content with being just a room, and letting you focus on the people you’re with and the food that’s on the plate. There will be papery curls of carta di musica before anything else arrives. Brushed with rosemary, this Sardinian flatbread shatters when you tap it. It will be gone in a minute, but it serves as a brief introduction to King’s culinary realm. After this gift from the kitchen, an order of panisse may seem redundant. It isn’t. At King, these chickpea fritters are long, thin tongues that puff up like pommes soufflés and are scented all over by fried sage. They’re beautiful. They were on the menu last month, but they may not stay long. Nothing does. King’s two chefs, Jess Shadbolt and Clare de Boer, cook a different slate of dishes each night. The changes tend to be evolutionary, drawing from a fixed repertoire of ideas. The first time I had halibut there, it was grilled, and its skin had been deeply charred without drying out the rich white meat right under it. The plate was filled out with spinach and white coco beans soft enough to mash with a spoon. The next time I ate halibut at King, it was poached, the beans were back and the greens had been replaced with small artichoke hearts simmered in white wine and amaranth. I’ll eat either dish again in a minute if the chefs give me a chance. Their food borrows liberally from the home cooking of those parts of Italy and France where New Yorkers of a certain generation dreamed of buying a summer house. This style has gone out lately, but a few years ago it was the default for the breed of American chefs who led their staff in fava-shucking parties each spring. Ms. Shadbolt and Ms. de Boer practice an English variant of the style they learned in the kitchen of the River Cafe in London. Anybody who’s eaten at that restaurant or has gone to bed with one of its cookbooks will experience occasional flashbacks at King. Polenta and almond flour go into a classic River Cafe dessert and into a different one that recurs at King. If you see it on the menu, especially if it is weighted with nectarines, pounce. Chefs can’t get far on imitation. They need to understand the how and why of things, and Ms. Shadbolt and Ms. de Boer do. Once you get past King’s debt to River Cafe, what you really notice is how many little moves they know that can raise a recipe from good to exceptional. Olive oil blended with nettles is an excellent sauce for boiled fingerling potatoes. What makes King’s even better is that a few fingerlings have been crushed into the purée, so from time to time you bite into a chunk of potato hiding inside the sauce. This was a side dish that traveled alongside a guinea hen, roasted whole with a bath of verdicchio in the bottom of the pan. Wilted nettles sprawled over its crisp skin. With a squeeze of lemon, it was one of the most appealing guinea hens I had ever come across. If you eat at King often, you can see the chefs making subtle adjustments to keep flavors in balance. Ravioli under spring peas and raw pea shoots were filled with minimally seasoned ricotta one week. The next, the ricotta inside floppy tortellini got an extra spur from lemon zest. The citrus might have stepped on the sweetness of the peas, but it helped the tortellini, because the only competition on the plate was fresh marjoram. And when some new seasonal ingredient appears on the scene, you can see the chefs strike like cobras. Saltwort, the salt-marsh-loving succulent that Italians call agretti, was the exciting foundation for a May salad built with wild arugula and raw ovals of asparagus stalks, making one of their first appearances of the year. Salty goldenrod bottarga was shaved over everything, even the white rim of the plate. To be won over by King, it helps not to expect things you’ve never seen before. Even those meeting saltwort for the first time will find that the rest of the meal looks familiar. What Ms. de Boer and Ms. Shadbolt offer is not a wild vision of new ways to cook but a solid vision of how to eat. They put pleasure at the table above gymnastics on the plate. For reasons I don’t want to understand, I associate this trait with other female chefs around town, including Rita Sodi, Missy Robbins, Gabrielle Hamilton, Sara Jenkins, Angie Mar and April Bloomfield, another River Cafe alumna. At King, the vision extends to how to drink. Annie Shi, who superintends the dining room and is a third business partner with the chefs, can offer guidance with the wine list. She favors French and Italian producers, many of them not quite famous, whose wines gracefully weave in and around the cooking. At the compact bar by the front door, cocktails are put together with the simplicity and respect for aperitif wines that you find in Italy. There is a kir and a sbagliato, which is nothing more than Campari and red vermouth on the rocks topped up with prosecco. These and other drinks slip into the bloodstream without knocking the palate out of alignment. The desserts are cafe style. They don’t look like extraterrestrial landscapes but rather recognizable slices and scoops. One of the few things at King that didn’t make perfect sense was a tiramisù; it went too heavy on the espresso and too light on the mascarpone. Every other dessert was just what I wanted, even when I didn’t know I wanted it. Chilled, thickened cream flavored with Pernod? I’m a fan now. I’m also a new convert to something called the Colonel. It’s a cup of lemon granita served with a tiny pitcher of cold vodka. You pour one over the other. I have no idea why the vodka makes the granita taste better, but it does.

80,Pinch Chinese,1 star,"May 30, 2017",Pete Wells,SoHo,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/dining/tim-ho-wan-review-pinch-chinese-restaurant-dim-sum-dumpling.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/dining/tim-ho-wan-review-pinch-chinese-restaurant-dim-sum-dumpling.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Visitors to Hong Kong who have an appreciation for dumplings, an eye toward low prices and faith that a single Michelin star reliably predicts quality will tend to eat at one of two places. Those who are more attracted to Cantonese dim sum classics will almost certainly end up at a location of the locally based Tim Ho Wan chain. The ones whose idea of a perfect dumpling is a xiao long bao with hot broth sealed inside will head to a branch of Din Tai Fung, which was founded in Taiwan. The very hungry ones will go to both. The two businesses have been busy exporting their folding and crimping technologies to dumpling-conscious cities around the world. With its 45th location, which opened in the East Village just before Christmas, Tim Ho Wan is the first of the pair to bring its towers of bamboo steamers to New York City. Tim Ho Wan was started by the chef Mak Kwai Pui, who had been in charge of the expensively exquisite dim sum at the Four Seasons hotel in Hong Kong. With his partner, Leung Fai Keung, his idea was to go back to basics, retaining some of the techniques and refinements of high-end dim sum while bringing prices down to sea level. In New York, the entire menu fits on a paper place mat. When you read it, it’s not immediately apparent why fans were willing to stand on Fourth Avenue in the cold for hours last December simply to put their names and phone numbers on a list for the privilege of being called a few hours after that, when a table was finally free. Many items can be found for about the same price (nothing is over $6) in other dim sum parlors. Now that the lines have died down considerably, it’s clear that the versions at Tim Ho Wan are good, but very few are throw-half-the-day-away good, and some have a rote quality that tends to creep into all but the most vigilant chains. True, the har gow wrappers are thinner than you expect, the shrimp inside firmer. The black bean sauce with steamed spare ribs tastes especially savory; the abalone sauce on the chicken feet a bit richer than the typical oyster sauce. The pan-fried turnip cakes contain flecks of dried shrimp that send their particular intensity in all directions. Soft as bread pudding inside, they are firmly seared, giving them an undertone of char and a hint of smoke somewhere off in the distance. The beef balls, under ragged veils of tofu skin, are the lightest and airiest I’ve ever eaten. But the rice rolls, a point of pride for the chain, are white bogs of starch that blot out the underseasoned fillings of beef, pork or shrimp. I’ve tried all three in New York, and they’re never quite there, while the pork liver rice roll I tried at a Tim Ho Wan last month in Sydney, Australia, buzzed with ginger and scallions inside its thin and delicate wrapper. The barbecued pork buns, which make the Hong Kong airport location of Tim Ho Wan the first and last stop in town for some passengers, have been a work in progress in New York. The flaky pastry, somewhere between a Parker House roll and a Southern buttermilk biscuit, shows off Mr. Mak’s finesse. The crackled surface, made of short crust dough blooped out of a pastry bag, doesn’t taste like much but somehow makes the buns more exciting to eat. The trouble has been with the gooey, half-sweet filling. Back in January, there wasn’t much of it, and it lacked conviction. In March, it was only slightly more sure of itself. This month, I finally had one that was richly flavored, well proportioned to the bun, and very hot. Steamed egg cake is another signature dish, or, as Tim Ho Wan puts it, one of the “big four heavenly kings.” A square tan slice of it is so plain it looks like the last thing left on the table of a PTA bake sale, but it’s consistently airy and wonderful, with its homey taste of molasses. It’s not a dessert. It seems to go with everything on the menu. In Australia, the osmanthus jelly, which is a dessert, was a shimmering, translucent amber, saturated with the spring-fever flavors of peaches and flowers. The New York version has been rubbery, as dark as beef bouillon, and strangely bland. Far more appealing are the coins of French toast pressed together around a center of egg custard, a cross of two Hong Kong snacks bred expressly for the New York market.  Din Tai Fung has almost three times as many branches as Tim Ho Wan, but for now its American presence is focused entirely on the West Coast. A few months ago, though, a restaurant in SoHo came along with a chef, Charlie Chen, who had been pried loose from the company’s kitchens. The xiao long bao and other dishes at Pinch Chinese will for many New Yorkers be the first taste of the Din Tai Fung aesthetic. Mr. Chen’s dumpling cooks wear masks over their mouths as they work behind glass at the end of the dining room, which gives them the air of fast-moving surgeons. The first thing you notice about their soup dumplings is that they are pretty. In other restaurants, they are baggy, saggy water balloons ready to spill their guts on impact. At Pinch, they stand upright like Hershey’s Kisses, and their skins, though very thin, don’t rupture when squeezed between chopsticks. A single dumpling fits quite comfortably in the mouth. Once you bite down, the broth that pours out is not as lip-smackingly gelatinous as it could be, but it’s still rich and full of flavor. The best and most unusual is filled with chicken soup, and you wouldn’t want it any thicker than it is. It’s very good. As finely made as those are, I somewhat preferred the non-soup dumplings: the steamed half-moons stuffed with gingery flakes of fish; the ones with a dark core of minced mushrooms and truffles; or the pan-fried semicircles filled with juicy sautéed beef, found only at lunch and brunch. Pinch also makes the best Sichuan won tons, shaped like clothesline ghosts and swimming in chile oil, that I’ve tasted outside a Sichuan restaurant. Sean Tang, who owns Pinch with a cousin, Tony Li, and Mr. Chen, has said he wants the menu to be “region agnostic.” Occasionally this results in stuff I might cook at home with a recipe from an American magazine, like the humdrum fried rice with steak or the pork ribs in cumin and chile seasoning. A magazine would call them Spicy Sichuan Ribs. They aren’t. In general, though, the conceit works. Other Sichuan-style dishes, like the ma po tofu, make up in balance what they may lack in heat. From Taiwan, there’s a highly credible three-cup chicken cooked with all dark meat (it makes a difference), as well as a hypnotically good stir-fry of cabbage with red chiles and thin slices of browned bacon. Snow Crab in a Chinese Restaurant has a generic name but a nongeneric flavor, with spicy black bean sauce over glass noodles and crab meat. The Wind Sand Chicken is a whole roast bird suffused all the way down with five-spice seasoning, then buried under a golden drift of fried garlic. It costs $45, which will strike Chinatown regulars as a large number. It will seem almost a bargain to anyone who eats in other restaurants that have wine lists like Pinch’s, which takes in pét-nats and skin-contact wines in styles from forbidding to friendly. It was put together by Miguel de Leon, who presided over the heroic cellar at Casa Mono, and you can tell he had fun with it. “You really like merlot” is a phrase that turns up twice. The first time it is above the wines by the glass, all made with the grape that everybody decided was trash after “Sideways” came out. Everybody was wrong. You really do like it.

81,Italienne,1 star,"May 22, 2017",Pete Wells,Flatiron,"French, Italian",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/dining/italienne-review-restaurant-jared-sippel.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/dining/italienne-review-restaurant-jared-sippel.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Jared Sippel might have had too much time to think before he opened Italienne. The restaurant, the chef’s first in New York City, has been open since the fall and is on its way to being something well out of the ordinary. But Mr. Sippel is trying to do so many things at once that his point of view gets garbled. The potential for confusion is even embedded in the name, which means Italian in French. Two rooms, with different styles and food, are spread out across a deep, high-ceilinged spot just west of Madison Square Park. Up front is the Taverna, where you can study the generally Italian menu of snacks and more over a cocktail and some pink folds of San Daniele prosciutto, shaved on a fire-engine-red slicer that is on display at the end of the bar like Clark Gable’s Harley at Kiehl’s. Past the bar you enter the polished, expensive Dining Room, where the food is much more French, is arranged with an eye on negative space, and is available à la carte or as a six-course, $140 tasting menu, wine pairing optional. On Monday nights, this half of the enterprise switches over to a four-course set menu devoted to the cooking of a single region, which could be French, or Italian. These party-in-the-front, business-in-the-back setups are complex propositions. They’re not hot-dog stands. Mr. Sippel has made a tough job tougher by taking on two countries and more than one style of cooking, and layering the formal-casual split on top. At times, Italienne is like somebody who starts to tell you a joke about a priest, a rabbi and an imam in a rowboat and ends up talking about Maimonidean law. Mr. Sippel moved to New York four years ago after his cooking at Quince in San Francisco and Frasca Food and Wine in Boulder, Colo., put him in the national eye. He had been hired to be the chef of the Manhattan edition of Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare, which was supposed to be imminent. It wasn’t. Mr. Sippel finally dropped out to work on a place of his own, which beat the new Brooklyn Fare to opening by about a month. Along the way, he brought together a talented crew. Erica O’Neal, who had been a sommelier at Frasca, stockpiled mostly French and Italian wines for a discovery-packed list that is full of twists and turns even at its cheap end. The desserts and pastries are under Rebecca Isbell, whose work made the end of a meal at Betony something to look forward to. His business partner and general manager is James King, a well-rounded pro who put in time at both Frasca and Brooklyn Fare. Everybody is out to make a good impression. One busy night in the Taverna, when my guests and I had to wait at the bar for about 20 minutes past our reservation time, we were handed glasses of prosecco before we had finished our cocktails. When we got to the table, two of the Italian snacks the menu calls stuzzichini were waiting for us: warm arancini with melted fior di latte at their core, and panzerotti, little turnovers filled with bits of warm salumi and scamorza. It was more of an apology than the situation called for. On the other hand, every apology should taste so good. On a quick read, the Taverna’s menu is like the ones at many other casual Italian spots. A deeper look, though, reveals more originality than usual. Scattered among the Italian favorites are a few French ideas, like the subtly curried cauliflower gratin under a tan layer of Comté. One of the snacks was a kind of sandwich filled with something like hash browns; crisp fried triangles of cheese take the place of bread. Eating it is like getting a tax refund you weren’t expecting. Under pasta was another big surprise: delicate little cabbage-and-bread dumplings the size of Swedish meatballs. They’re from far northern Italy, where they’re known as canederli. Italienne gave them an Eastern European lilt by serving them with beets, horseradish and applesauce. Mr. Sippel seemed to reach beyond the borders again with the caraway seeds and excellent braised red cabbage he brought to a plate of pork — tender ribs and a juicy chop that got a little too much finishing salt but were still close to perfect. Ms. Isbell’s desserts in the Taverna made some unexpected moves, too. Her lemon tart was wonderful and showed a sense of humor; with a cloak of white lemon icing outside and a soft filling of lemon-poppy seed cream inside, it looked just like a wedge of Camembert. But I don’t know what to make of her baba au rhum, which tasted like a two-day-old coconut doughnut that had been accidentally splashed with liquor at the bar. My first meal in the Dining Room was on a Monday, when the four-course menu was supposedly inspired by the northern Rhone. I had trouble seeing the connection, but I enjoyed it all. There was an exceptional velouté of squash and apples with a fat lobe of foie gras, and a little meditation on beef and spring onions, with a Syrah-glazed beef cheek and a slice of strip loin. Dessert was a tart of dense, rich chocolate layered over salted caramel. It was an ideal end for a dinner of refined bistro food. When I went back on another night, though, the plates were excessively fussed over, self-conscious and forced, with the form of haute cuisine but not the sense. It was like reading a French text that had been run through Google’s translator and then back again. The frogs’ legs hidden inside a frizz of kataifi were almost flavorless, and a white garlic sauce had a sharp, raw bite. Snails and strips of prosciutto strewn over buttered pappardelle never came together, and bull’s-eyes of pasta called corzetti stampati were dotted with beet greens and a walnut pesto that was sweet when it should have been savory. Other dishes were better, but the only complete successes were the warm herb fougasse, served on a hook like a Bavarian pretzel, and Ms. Isbell’s desserts — a rhubarb granita with salty candied pistachios, and a weird, inspired oat bavarois veined with chocolate ganache. Some of the food at Italienne made me want to dance on the table. Some of it made me want to hide under the table and wait for the lights to go out so I could leave without making eye contact. My three meals might have come from three different restaurants. I would settle for one where the ideas had been worked out. At the moment, that is the Taverna.

82,Pig Bleecker,1 star,"May 16, 2017",Pete Wells,Greenwich Village,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/dining/pig-bleecker-review-greenwich-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/dining/pig-bleecker-review-greenwich-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Pig Bleecker takes the second half of its name from its Greenwich Village address and the first from Pig Beach, a beer garden and barbecue stand on the idyllic shores of the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. The two places share a chef, several owners, some sauces and recipes, and a fondness for wood smoke. They have pigs in their names for a reason, but one appealing thing about Pig Bleecker is how often it gravitates toward cooking that has nothing to do with barbecued pork. One recent night, a length of striped bass was half-buried under charred green buds of romanesco broccoli, chopped smoked almonds — not the kind from a can — and spoonfuls of chopped fresh herbs in olive oil. The flavors were clean and strong, the approach direct and Italian. “I could see this at a Batali restaurant,” I wrote in my notes. I didn’t know yet that until about a year ago, the chef, Matt Abdoo, cooked at Mario Batali’s Del Posto. Pig Bleecker also has broiled oysters, meaty ones that slosh around in their shells with chile oil and melted garlic butter under a cap of flaky brown bread crumbs. Carbone, down the street, serves three styles of baked clams side by side, and I don’t think any of them outdoes these oysters. In another appetizer, chunks of cod cheeks are quickly fried with country ham that sizzles up as crisp as a potato chip. Both cod and ham are knocked around with chopped pickled peppers and their spicy vinegar. The menu calls this “Rhode Island style cod cheeks.” I grew up in Rhode Island and never saw cod cheeks in any form there. Things were simpler then. But I did see, and eat, fried squid tossed with pickled banana peppers. The last time I encountered it on a menu was at Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar in Times Square. I generally try not to think about what they did to it there, but I couldn’t help recalling it at Pig Bleecker, which gets closer to the taste of the original with fish cheeks than Guy’s did with actual squid. In fact, a lot of Mr. Abdoo’s menu successfully does what Guy’s claims and fails to do. It rounds up unfancy American dishes whose natural habitat is small taverns and bars and shacks on the state road just outside town. Utica greens, spicy chopped escarole baked under bread crumbs and Parmigiano-Reggiano, are terrific at Pig Bleecker. Mr. Abdoo’s affection for regional specialties is written all over the slate of sandwiches Pig Bleecker serves at lunch. Baltimore pit beef is represented, thinly shaved with charred edges and a horseradish sauce inside an onion roll. So is the New Orleans muffuletta. Cold cuts and smoked mozzarella are piled on a sesame hero roll instead of the customary miniature hubcap, and it’s arguably too sparing with the olive relish. So call it an Italian hero with olives; it’s still a great thing to eat for lunch. Is Pig Bleecker crazy for serving a pastrami sandwich within walking distance of Katz’s Delicatessen? Is the meat a little too lean? Does melting Gruyère on it make Mr. Abdoo a heretic? Yes to all of the above. On the other hand, his pastrami has an unusually fine flavor, shot through with a robust vein of smoke. Smoke runs through much of the cooking like a rhythm track. A thick-cut chop spends time in the smoker before it goes on the grill; served with battered onions and a peach glaze that’s spicy, tart and sweet, it’s one of the strongest main courses on the dinner menu. Pig Bleecker’s take on Buffalo wings involves not just smoking them but trimming the drumsticks into lollipops, leaving an exposed length of bone for a handle. They’re dressed in butter swirled with a reasonably spicy sauce of red Hatch peppers. You can find that sauce, or something like it, at Pig Beach, along with the Alabama white sauce that turns up as a dip for the celery sticks that come with Pig Bleecker’s wings. I must be a heretic, too, because I like the white sauce more than blue cheese dressing. The sauces Mr. Abdoo invented for Pig Beach are worth importing to Manhattan, especially a sweetened mustard number that does wonders for the pigs in blankets. The two restaurants strike different tones, though. At Pig Beach, dogs and children wander between the picnic tables, and orders are placed at a canopied bar and an outdoor barbecue counter that backs up against the Gowanus. (“No fishing,” the signs warn anyone who may have mistaken the canal for a body of water.) Pig Bleecker is more domesticated. There is one long communal table made from a single polished slab of wood in the center of the room. Around the wall is a banquette of leather the approximate color of the mustard sauce. Instead of paper towels and wet wipes in an American flag pouch, the tables are set with cloth napkins. The design is crisp and urbane, to the extent that those words can apply to a place with the head of a Texas longhorn mounted on the wall. I might give Pig Bleecker more than an enthusiastic single star if the cooking didn’t sometimes swing and miss. “Deviled steak and eggs” sounds more clever than the thing it describes, deviled eggs with beef tartare piled under the yolks. (At lunch, the eggs are more effectively paired with thin sheets of country ham.) The crudité platter is a gorgeous spread of raw and gently cooked vegetables, and a good buy at $13, but it deserves better than the generic cocktail-party dips. Oddly, given Mr. Abdoo’s time at Del Posto, pasta can be dull. Ravioli filled with juicy bundles of smoked and braised brisket could have used a real sauce instead of melted truffle butter with zigzags of reduced Barolo. Tossing house-made cavatelli with clams and ’nduja is a great idea, but I wanted more flavor from the clams and more spice from the ’nduja. There is also an Oreo cheesecake that proves not everything gets better when you stuff it into a Mason jar. More than making up for that, though, is the deliciously tart key lime pie with a crunchy nut crust. Then there is a peanut butter milkshake with hot fudge and a buckeye candy on top (creamy and smooth, like peanut ganache), and a hot fudge and brownie sundae.

83,Atoboy,2 star,"May 9, 2017",Pete Wells,NoMad,Korean,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/dining/atoboy-review-korean-restaurant-nyc.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/dining/atoboy-review-korean-restaurant-nyc.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"When all of the little plates of pickles and vegetables and whatnot land on the table at the start of a Korean meal, it’s like winning a game show. They are called banchan, and they shower down out of nowhere, like balloons. Fermented daikon and wavy cabbage leaves, pink with chile paste. Pinwheels of soy-stained lotus root. Silvery, crunchy stir-fried anchovies no bigger than paper matches. If I’m in a restaurant, I pay close attention to these dishes. The better they are, the higher my hopes for the rest of the meal. They serve as a quick reminder from the outset of how varied Korean cuisine can be, how it can pack both nuance and power. And, of course, I like them because at most Korean restaurants they’re free. It was my strong feelings about banchan that made me suspicious when I first heard that a new restaurant called Atoboy had made them the foundation of its menu. What could this be but another ploy to charge us for something that used to come with the cost of the meal? We’ve lost the battle over bread. I was ready to draw a line in the sand over banchan. After three dinners at Atoboy (ah-TOE-boy) since last fall and one quick snack at the bar, I’m happy to admit that I was wrong. This is no scam. Junghyun Park, the chef, uses banchan as a starting point, then goes on to build smart, surprising dishes around it. Look at what he does with those pinwheels of lotus root, laying them over a bed of tofu in soft, tiny curds like ricotta. It’s a great dish, half crunchy and half creamy, both halves humming along under a dressing of chile oil and sesame oil. Fans of the barbecue at Kang Ho Dang Baekjeong will remember the pan of corn in melted cheese that sits at the edge of the domed grill and is basted by the hot drippings that slide down from the sizzling meat. Mr. Park has a wonderful take on this, using bacon for its fat and taleggio for its tang, mixing in the fermented soybean paste called doenjang to make everything more intense. When a bowl of it showed up, it got side-eyes at my table. Corn out of season? Nobody who tasted it stayed skeptical. Mr. Park, 32, was raised in Seoul. Bypassing culinary school, he went on a grand tour and learned to cook at restaurants in England and Australia. At the end, he returned to his hometown to work in the kitchen at Jungsik, a westernized Korean restaurant with global aspirations. When Jungsik set up an outpost in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Park was dispatched to serve as its chef de cuisine. Finally ready to go out on his own, he opened Atoboy on East 28th Street last summer with his wife, Ellia, a veteran of the dining rooms at Noreetuh and Maialino. She manages the restaurant. Like Jungsik, Atoboy favors the subtler end of the Korean flavor spectrum, but it avoids fussing and tweezing. Mr. Park’s novel and lovely sea bass tartare, under a shimmering pale-green layer of chopped kiwi, mint and fermented spring garlic, could easily slide onto the menu at Jungsik if he decked out the plate with some foofaraw. (I’m glad he doesn’t.) The low-key atmosphere that the Parks have set down, though, has little in common with the carpeted environs of Jungsik, which affects a formality so stiff around the spine that the servers might be wearing back braces. Atoboy is also a deliberate step away from the controlled chaos of the Korean restaurants a few blocks north on 32nd Street. Between its patched walls of raw concrete, simple wooden tables are arranged in two symmetrical rows with a narrow path to the kitchen down the middle. It looks like a downtown wine bar, and in fact wine is one of the chief attractions. The list is brief but manages to take you to places you wouldn’t expect to visit in a Korean restaurant. There’s a concentration of bottles from Nikolaihof, Gut Oggau and other fine Austrian producers; a small flock of Loire winemakers such as Olga Raffault; Champagnes from Charles Ellner and other independent labels; and some respected West Coast names like Pedroncelli and Dirty & Rowdy. Everything I’ve tried has cohabited amicably with Mr. Park’s food. Although all 18 dishes on the menu can be ordered on their own, servers suggest a $36 meal made of one from each of three categories — roughly, cold salads, warm appetizers and plates where seafood or meat do most of the work. They’re served more or less in that order but without pauses between the courses, and the plates pile up in the middle of the table. This makes it too easy for nuanced dishes, like fried and braised sunchokes with oyster mushrooms and oranges dressed in a creamy truffle emulsion, to get lost. The servers insist that everything is meant for sharing. Heard that one before? But some dishes, like the delicate egg custard in a smoky dashi with morels and soybeans, were worse for wear and tear after they were doled out to individual plates. It’s almost impossible to get worked up about any of this, though, because the $36 menu is such a fair deal, and because so many of the dishes work so well and do things you didn’t know Korean food could do. Mr. Park’s take on yuk hwe is memorable, the beef tartare cut into long skinny threads that are tossed with soy sauce, dotted with nettle cream and topped with what seem to be julienne potato chips. Braised mackerel, usually cooked in soy sauce, is simmered in a complex green-chile broth. Little drums of octopus leg, a dot of parsley oil in the center of each one, are ringed around a kind of hash of kimchi and chorizo — two things that were meant to be together, though I never would have guessed. After these shifting, swirling flavors, the desserts have a clarifying effect. The ginger panna cotta with pink grapefruit is just as refreshing as it sounds. There’s also one that uses sujeonggwa, the sweet cinnamon punch ladled out at the end of Korean meals. It’s frozen into a granita and then spooned over burrata, lychee yogurt and candied walnuts for a cheese course you won’t find anywhere but Atoboy.

84,Loring Place,2 star,"May 2, 2017",Pete Wells,Greenwich Village,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/dining/loring-place-review-greenwich-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/dining/loring-place-review-greenwich-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ABC Kitchen signified a small turning point in the appetites of New Yorkers when it opened seven years ago. We had snuffled through much of the previous decade in search of pork shoulders, lamb belly, rib-eyes and marrow bones, and if we didn’t exactly wake up on the first day of 2010 doubled over with regret, some of us were starting to wonder why the bed smelled like bacon. Then that spring we got ABC Kitchen, with Dan Kluger in the kitchen, Jean-Georges Vongerichten whispering in his ear and a new way of filling our stomachs on the menu. Mr. Kluger wasn’t cooking health food, not with that mayo-spritzed cheeseburger. But a sizable chunk of the nearly 50 dishes were salads or saladlike constructions. Vegetables were everywhere, including on top of the whole-wheat pizzas. The plates jangled with flavor, and very little of it came from animal fat. We might have called the food “vegetable forward” if that term had been invented. When diners stood up at the end of the night, you could almost hear them sighing with relief that they’d had an entire meal in a hot downtown restaurant without eating lard. The two chefs teamed up again for ABC Cocina, which opened a new front on the culture wars by mashing peas into guacamole, before Mr. Kluger left Mr. Vongerichten’s synchronized-swimming team to splash around in a pool of his own. After two years of preparation, he opened Loring Place in December in an expansive space on West Eighth Street, where the shoe stores used to be. There’s a long and busy bar to the right of the entrance where the drinks list offers you very well-made classic cocktails as well as innovations that taste like classics in the making. On the left are two dining areas: one that sits on a platform in the window, and another, bigger one off the kitchen. Designed by Cycle Projects, the rooms are full of handsome expanses of white brick and stained walnut. Yes, these hard surfaces amplify the noise. Yes, they’re trying to fix it. Mr. Kluger has said in interviews that at Loring Place he is bringing back some of the tricks he picked up before he learned his ABC’s, while he was working under Floyd Cardoz and Tom Colicchio. That may be true of the recipes, but the template of the menu comes unmistakably from ABC Kitchen, all the way down to the whole-wheat pizzas. There are more salads at Loring Place, and the saladlike constructions are even more saladlike. At the end of winter, I loved the combination of crisp Bosc pears with soft roasted leeks over thick yogurt, and some sugar-glazed walnuts for ballast. A couple of weeks ago, with pollen in the air, I appreciated the arrival of sweet sugar snap peas, lightly charred and served with bright pink breakfast radishes and shreds of pecorino. In this herbivorous decade, Loring Place isn’t the only restaurant to try grinding flour from local grains, or the only one to get mixed results. The emmer crackers, armored with sunflower seeds, are terrific with a schmear of the excellent and lightly sweet hummus. So are the breakfast radishes lodged in the surface of the hummus. A friend who knows her grains looked dubious when I ordered the house-made whole-wheat spaghetti. I was skeptical, too. (It is almost never as good as it sounds.) Loring Place gets it right, though, and lets it be, tossing it with basil, chiles, grated cheese and some velvety leaves of spinach. The whole-wheat bread, on the other hand, isn’t quite at the point where Loring Place should be charging $6 for a loaf smaller than a football. The crust is impressively sturdy, but the interior is neither tender nor elastic — it’s dry and crumbly. I liked the whole-wheat pizza crust enough to wish it had been allowed to breathe a little more under a mass of shaved asparagus, maitake mushrooms, jalapeños and three kinds of cheese. But I have to admit I had a hard time keeping up my interest in the other pies at Loring Place once I’d eaten a square of what the menu calls “grandma-style pan pizza.” Like a less doughy Sicilian baked with canned tomatoes, not sauce, the grandma has been slowly expanding its range west of its traditional breeding grounds in Nassau County. The Loring Place grandma crust is thicker than in the archetypal versions, but flavorful, light and nongreasy. I hope Mr. Kluger has stocked up on pizza pans because he runs a serious risk of selling a grandma pie to every table in the restaurant. Its only close rival on the menu is the cheeseburger, which comes with bacon made on site, a likably combative pickled-pepper aioli and a cast-iron pan of thick-cut fries that seem to get crunchier as they got cooler, a neat feature. I don’t imagine Mr. Kluger wants us to think of Loring Place as a place for cheeseburgers and square pizza, but a lot of the other main courses aren’t as compelling for one reason or another. Halibut with a market’s worth of mixed mushrooms in miso and lemon juice was an ideal example of how to cook and serve fish, but I can’t say the same about the nondescript king salmon or the sea scallops in a sauce whose naked acidity was intensified by apples marinated in vinegar. Grilled chicken breast with carrot barbecue sauce sounded more exciting than it was; the sauce never kicked in hard enough to rouse the warm peas and rice that seemed to have settled down under the chicken for a long winter’s nap. As much as I want to take Loring Place on its own terms, the menu makes comparisons with ABC Kitchen inevitable, and Loring Place comes off as slightly less interesting. It’s not just that a lot of it feels familiar now; some of it is also unfocused and busy. The plates have more going on, but there’s not as much happening. To be fair, very few restaurants are as interesting as ABC Kitchen was when it opened, and there are solid reasons that reservations at Loring Place are hard to come by. They include the wine list, which packs a few nice surprises, not the least of which is the attention it pays to the $40 to $60 range. And they continue through the smartly nostalgic dessert menu. There’s a sly update on the Hostess CupCake, a tin of cookies, and a vanilla ice-cream sundae with pretzels, toffee and whatnot, modeled on the Dairy Queen Blizzard. O.K. It’s kind of like the sundae at ABC Kitchen. It’s still good. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

85,Union Square Cafe,3 star,"April 25, 2017",Pete Wells,Gramercy Park,"American, Italian",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/dining/union-square-cafe-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/dining/union-square-cafe-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Sitting at the upstairs bar, one of the best places to eat in the new Union Square Cafe, I listened in on a conversation the woman next to me was having with the bartender. In December, after a year out of operation, Danny Meyer’s first and most formative restaurant had been transferred from its original address on East 16th Street to the corner of Park Avenue South and East 19th. The woman had been transferred, too; a regular at the old location, she had some pointed questions about a certain item on the menu. “Is it the same?” she asked. “Exactly the same?” The bartender assured her that it was. “If we ever took it off the menu, we’d have a riot on our hands,” he said. The item in question was a salad of red-tipped oakleaf and Bibb lettuces, with some fresh and springy croutons and whitecaps of grated Gruyère on top. It is a very nice salad, a model of good behavior. It does not bring to mind images of mob violence. This is Union Square Cafe, though, a place that from the beginning has inspired attachments of a peculiar intensity. Other restaurants have customers; Union Square Cafe has fans, and knows it. Almost everything about the new place caters to their memories of the original, fetishizing the restaurant’s own idiosyncrasies to an amazing degree. It’s almost a museum to itself. If you’re not part of the fan base, you might feel a bit like somebody who goes to see “Rogue One” without ever having seen “Star Wars.” At the old location, I was more an admirer than a fan. I was never quite as amazed by the food as it seemed I was supposed to be. But then, fluctuation is normal in a long-running restaurant. Over the years, reviews of Union Square Cafe in The Times have ranged from two to three stars. In the most recent appraisal, in 2009, Frank Bruni awarded it two. The Rockwell Group, the architecture firm, was given the job of evoking the old address in a space that is much roomier, without the narrow passageways and sunken dining room. Some of this is done subliminally: Pendant lamps downstairs hang at the height of the 16th Street ceilings. I could swear the original downstairs bar was smaller, but that’s probably because I could almost never get a seat there. Mr. Rockwell swears that the new one is the same length: 27 feet 1 inch. The upstairs bar top where my cocktail rested was precisely the size of the old upstairs bar top because it was, in fact, the same piece of wood with a fresh coat of varnish. The art collection has come along for the ride, too, and one of the pleasures of the Rockwell layout is the way you seem to bump into a Frank Stella or a Claes Oldenburg or a Judy Rifka every time you turn around. The cellar stocks wines from Italy, France and the United States, and nowhere else. As Jason Wagner, the wine director, explained one night, those are the countries that were on the list when Union Square Cafe opened in 1985. The menu does not go so far as to point out all the old showstoppers — some from Michael Romano’s reign in the kitchen and others from that of the current chef, Carmen Quagliata — but the servers are happy to help. Do I even need to say this? It’s the most famous thing about Union Square Cafe: The servers are always happy to help. I hadn’t realized the salad was a cult object, but I did know about the gnocchi. In this case, I stand with the cult. They are not so much gnocchi as little cushions of ricotta that have been tricked into holding their cylindrical shape only for as long as it takes to move them from the plate to the mouth. Consider me a fanboy when it comes to the ideally crunchy fritto misto, and the polenta, too, a $13 bowl of warm fluff that has absorbed its weight, and then some, in milk and creamy young cow’s milk cheese. With maitake mushrooms and shiny green pesto, it’s so filling and likable that you could make a meal of it and walk away more content than if you’d had a 12-course tasting somewhere else. The risk in churning out old recipes like this is that the kitchen becomes bored, and the food boring. That’s not happening at Union Square Cafe right now; the cooks seem to have dialed right in on the qualities that made these dishes favorites in the first place. Union Square Cafe has always been the offspring of a mixed marriage between a trattoria and a bistro, with an American bar and grill somewhere in the family tree. In the current phenotype, the trattoria genes are dominant. There is a wonderfully tender and gentle rabbit sugo, tossed with bands of pappardelle. Mr. Quagliata’s pasta work can be just as satisfying when he carves out new traditions, tossing tubes of rigatoni with roasted carrots and sizzled scallions and chiles, then brightening the flavors with a spoonful of yogurt. A little less thrilling was a lasagna Bolognese that has been rotated off the menu for the time being; while the pasta sheets were as thin and light as any Italian could hope for, the flavors in the meat sauce weren’t as developed as they might have been. Though I split that lasagna with somebody else so we could have traditional appetizer-primi-secondi meals, the mains are so imposing that a simple two-course plan is the wiser path. I was nearly done in by a braised lamb shank, although the bright salsa verde helped spur me along. Even the choices that sound lighter, like red snapper sandwiched between a thatch of shaved puntarelle and a bed of chickpea purée, or a flattened half-chicken, with cumin and dried chiles embedded in its surface and slabs of white sweet potato peeking out from below, are best tackled with an undented appetite. After all: There will be dessert, and it will not be a minor event, especially if somebody at your table has strong memories of the panna cotta (beautiful; the pastry chef, Daniel Alvarez, surrounds it with citrus segments and granola), or the pumpkin bread pudding (more bread than pudding when I last saw it), or the fantastic tart topped with a caramelized puff of banana so soft it seems to have blown apart. Sometimes Union Square Cafe’s eagerness to please has something close to the opposite effect. When a server suggested with wide-eyed eagerness that I might like “a very cold glass of milk” with the espresso-chocolate cake, chills went down my spine, and not chills of anticipation. The last time I drank milk with a meal, I was wearing footed pajamas. Then I’d remember how happy the service had made one of my guests, who had shown up before me, but still about 30 seconds too late to grab a seat at the downstairs bar. She spun around in agitation for a moment, but a manager spotted her and offered to call upstairs to see if there were any open bar stools there. This empathic attunement to disturbances in the Force defines the Meyer brand of hospitality. While it flows through all his restaurants, it functions in its purest and most effective form at Union Square Cafe. The restaurant is far too nice to be polarizing, but it won’t be everybody’s cold glass of milk. Diners from the Instagram generation might want more crunch, more adventure or more spontaneity. I hope that as it settles into its new home, it gets a little less self-referential. But even now, it has a combination of energy and well-honed familiarity that’s rare in Manhattan. It’s rare anywhere, and it lifts this restaurant above fashion, to a plateau that it occupies all by itself. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

86,Torishin,3 star,"April 11, 2017",Pete Wells,Clinton,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/dining/torishin-review-japanese-yakitori.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/dining/torishin-review-japanese-yakitori.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Consider the chicken. Consider each part of the chicken. Consider eating each part of the chicken, one after another, grilled over charcoal at a yakitori restaurant called Torishin. Dark neck meat first, gathered in a ruffle around a bamboo skewer. When stuck to its long root of bone, the neck is picky business to eat, but it is full of flavor when it is pared away and the outer bits are singed over charcoal and the fat starts to spill over the rest. Now the tenderloin. Many tenderloins come to an ignominious end as “tenders,” encased in bread crumbs in the ketchup-smeared fingers of a toddler. But grilled lightly, so they firm up without scorching, they run with delicate pink juices. Livers, of course, are seared very fast so they don’t get leathery. The rich, red insides are as soft as yogurt. They take well to a few grains of ground sansho pepper, enough to spark a slow buzz on the tongue. So do the hearts, done medium-rare, like steak. On the bird’s back, above the tail feathers, are the oysters. At Torishin they go under their French name, sot-l’y-laisse — “a fool leaves it.” They are grilled with their skin, which puckers and hisses and goes from creamy blue to gold. For all I know the first yakitori chefs in Japan had nothing but efficiency in mind when they speared each anatomical bit on its own skewer. Fast-cooking livers can be pulled from the grill to make space, while other pieces take their time. In the hands of the attentive chefs at Torishin, this technique produces something beyond convenience. Cooked separately, each part has a different pleasure to offer. Some you chew, and some you crackle. Some have cerebral appeal, others call to instinct. The house style is sensitive to timing, averse to charring and careful with seasoning. The chicken is salted, brushed with a sauce called tare, which is less sweet at Torishin than at some other yakitori specialists, and grilled about an inch above long-burning sticks of binchotan, a Japanese charcoal. The cooks wave bamboo fans at the fire when it needs a boost. Sitting on the tables and counters are vaguely humanoid gourds filled with sansho and the spice blend shichimi, as well as pitchers of soy sauce. “Which skewers are good with soy?” I asked Atsushi Kono, the chef, one night when he was tending the coals. His head bobbed noncommittally before he said, “It’s there for people who think they want it.” Right, then. No soy. With minimalist cooking, the distance between dull and delicious can sometimes be measured in grains of salt. This became clear during my only meal at Torishin’s original location, on First Avenue in the 60s. There were many skewers. None of them seemed to have been seasoned. Even the pickled cucumbers and daikon that showed up at the start of the meal seemed to be under orders not to draw any attention to themselves. I knew that some people revered the restaurant, so I just figured that it fell into one of my blind spots. When Torishin moved to its current address in Hell’s Kitchen in 2015, I did not exactly rush over on my hoverboard. In fact, I didn’t make it there until last fall, a delay I regretted as soon as I had unskewered my first lump of chicken. Whatever had been missing from the chicken before was there, and it’s been there each time I’ve gone back. (I still think the pickles need more pep, though.) To the left as you enter is a small bar. The bartenders spend the quiet hours whittling big ice cubes into spheres, with knives. These rough globes are plopped into tumblers of shochu, and if you want to learn about this distilled spirit, Torishin is a fine place to start. The sake list is compact but varied. The few wines come from big, obvious names. At the end of a winding corridor is a split-level dining room. The mezzanine might be the spot for privacy. The lower space is more active, with seating at tables or around a U-shaped counter that hugs the open kitchen and a grill, the depth of a single skewer. If you know your favorite bird bits, ordering à la carte is simple enough. The menu is helpfully illustrated, from neck to tail. All but one of the skewers is under $10, and the package of seven chicken skewers plus three vegetables is a good deal at $65. But Torishin always puts me in the mood for surprises, so I like to ask for an omakase menu. The grill cooks serve up a mix of vegetables (the mushrooms are a particular treat, and I don’t think it’s possible to grill zucchini better than Torishin does); white meat (the piece wrapped in a shiso leaf and dabbed with salty plum paste is a nearly perfect bite); dark meat (chicken legs can be subdivided in more ways than you might think); and curiosities called “special skewers.” This is where you will find the oysters, the kidneys, the nugget of meat from the base of the wing, the wrinkly and fatty neck skin, the smooth and supple belly skin. Most of the surprises have been positive, like “knee gristle.” What about “main artery”? The nicest thing I can honestly say about this blood vessel, which ties the heart to some other vital organ, is that it is, in fact, edible. If hunger still calls after you have stripped all the bamboo sticks and left them standing in the ceramic cup in front of you, there is an excellent remedy in the form of oyako-don. A homey dish of chicken and egg over white rice, oyako-don can be filling or it can be almost ethereal, as it is at Torishin. To one side of the passage from bar to dining room is a narrow nook behind curtains. Inside is an eight-seat bar, called the Select Counter, where Mr. Kono presides over extended menus that borrow from the kaiseki tradition. One recent meal began with a tiny simmered octopus with peppery sansho leaves. Sashimi followed. Chicken breast was steamed in cherry leaves and served with cucumber wheels and fresh shoots of spring ginger; the flavor was lovely and transient, one of those Japanese miracles of putting the mood of a season on the plate. The $150 menu came with a complete fusillade of skewers as well as a choice of grilled luxury items: either Kumamoto beef (not as meltingly rich as it could have been) or king crab leg (smeared with some funky stuff from inside the crab’s head, and completely delicious). If Mr. Kono had kept cooking all night, I would have been happy, but to experience Torishin you don’t need to spend $150 and a couple of hours. Just a few skewers are enough to expand your sense of what’s possible in the department of chicken. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

87,Babbo,2 star,"April 4, 2017",Pete Wells,Greenwich Village,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/dining/babbo-review-pete-wells.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/dining/babbo-review-pete-wells.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"When the waiter asked if we wanted the last roasted goat’s head, I didn’t think it was a big deal. It was just another night at Babbo. This was around 1999, a year after it had opened, when Babbo had few peers among Italian restaurants, serving unusual meats with a side of light decadence. In this classically simple Greenwich Village townhouse, an energetic and pleasure-seeking chef named Mario Batali wanted New Yorkers to try something new: a salad of truffled lamb’s tongue; melting pink windowpanes of head cheese; triangles of beef-cheek-filled pasta in a sauce thickened by crushed squab livers. The strategy was to tempt us and dare us at the same time. Back then, Babbo funneled you toward giving up all restraint, right down to the wine pours, which were sold by thirds of a bottle instead of fifths. So when the chance to eat a goat’s head was dangled before me, I saw it as the natural outgrowth of an entire philosophy of eating and drinking that I wanted to adopt as my own, at least for as long as it took to find out which parts of the face were good to eat (the sides) and which weren’t (the eyes). Mr. Batali and his business partner, Joe Bastianich, now own about two dozen restaurants in the United States and Asia. Babbo remains the empire’s spiritual home, where the original formula of adventure and pleasure and curious-minded indulgence is still intact, where you can still try recipes that sprang from Mr. Batali’s forehead when he was only a minor celebrity. Now that he’s superfamous, Mr. Batali could probably pump up the prices at Babbo. He hasn’t. That’s one reason Babbo is still one of New York’s essential restaurants. But it isn’t quite the same restaurant. The cooking doesn’t always have the old finesse and bravado that my colleague Frank Bruni found when he  gave the restaurant three stars in 2004, when it was last reviewed in The Times. The service, meanwhile, can go in and out of focus more than it used to. From the restaurant’s beginning, overbooking has been an issue. Even now, when reservations are not as much in demand, the bar is often crowded with people waiting to be seated. This narrow area is less a waiting room than an exercise studio. One recent night, three guests and I ducked and bobbed and turned every minute or so as somebody tried to squeeze through with a hot plate of food, or an empty chair, or an armful of coats. This lasted 30 minutes. We never got an apology, but we did get to work on our balance and core strength. What bothered me more than not hearing “I’m sorry” was that nobody acted as though half an hour was an unusually long time to keep customers waiting. At the table, the style of service I got seemed to depend on whether I was there for the first or second seating. An early-evening dinner rolled along like a skateboard on new concrete, and the check came with the coffee. A meal that began after 8 p.m. was slow, even draggy, and at times it seemed we had dropped out of sight. Our sommelier was smart and engaging as he talked about a Sardinian red we were curious about (as ever, the all-Italian wine list is a mix of blue chips and underrated discoveries), but after decanting it, he was nowhere to be seen and our glasses stood empty. On another night, four people ordered appetizers, but only three of us got them. Mr. Batali discusses changes to the menu every week with Frank Langello, Babbo’s executive chef since 2003. Mr. Langello’s kitchen is run by professionals who seem to know by instinct when to take meat off the flame; even tricky ingredients like rabbit were faultlessly done. Given how many classic dishes are on the menu, the cooks could probably make half of them with their eyes closed. Sometimes you wonder if they do. I suspected that the salt had been left out of the soupy polenta served under Babbo’s long-running (and still terrific) beef braised in red wine, the brasato al Barolo. A salad of lamb’s tongue and browned beech mushrooms topped with a soft-cooked egg was nice. But the salad was warm and the egg was cold, so it was not as nice as it could have been. I felt the same way about a grilled guinea hen leg; it would have been easier to love if the skin hadn’t been rubbery and damp. And a banana crostata could have been exceptional if its crust hadn’t been soft and its flavors melded together, as if it had been made too early in the day. These glitches were far from catastrophic, but they were frustrating because I could usually imagine, or remember, just how good the dish was supposed to be. And with some recipes, there was no need to imagine. Babbo’s pasta station can still turn out the hit singles with plenty of the old shimmy-shimmy-shake, like the beef-cheek ravioli or the “mint love letters,” parcels of minty lamb sausage under a bright tomato sauce. Some of Babbo’s most exciting pastas stand on more delicate flavors. Goat cheese tortelloni, like little folded paper hats, were slithery with warm butter that was seasoned by dried orange peel and fennel pollen: lovely and transporting. And when the calendar said spring was here, the kitchen was ready with asparagus tossed with tender, slick fettuccine and brittle crinkles of sautéed pancetta. Rebecca DeAngelis’s desserts are memorable, too; that glum banana crostata was an outlier. The saffron panna cotta is seductively musky, its perfume offset by dried apricots soaked in passion fruit purée. And the friends with whom I shared the olive oil cake — a simple drum with a crisp top and a tender middle, splashed with a bright-green squiggle of peppery olive oil — still text me about once a day to ask if I remember how wonderful it was. I do. To say that Babbo’s long suits are its pasta and desserts is just to praise those courses, not to diminish the others. Antipasti, like the steamed mussels poured with their garlic-laden juices over thick toast, or the octopus and just-tender borlotti beans in a fantastic, citrus-packed, lightly spicy limoncello vinaigrette, manage to be very active without seeming frantic. Mr. Batali and Mr. Langello work hard to chase boredom away, but they know when to stop, and you can see that in such main courses as the pork chop, so plump it could pass for a baby ham, with cherry peppers, or the lamb chops you could pick up by the bone if you didn’t mind getting broccoli rabe pesto on your fingers. Still, I keep thinking about goat’s head. In those early days, I knew Babbo could ace the weird stuff. I’m not sure I trust the restaurant the same way today.

88,Augustine,1 star,"March 28, 2017",Pete Wells,Financial District,"American, French",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/dining/augustine-review-french-food-nyc-keith-mcnally.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/dining/augustine-review-french-food-nyc-keith-mcnally.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Keith McNally switched on the lights of his latest restaurant, Augustine, on the first day of November. New McNally projects always incite anticipation but not a great deal of suspense. Certain things are known before the first oyster is popped open. One of those things is the presence of oysters. Veteran McNally watchers will nod as they take in the recurring characters: the tag team of Shane McBride and Daniel Parilla, who also oversee Cherche Midi, is in the kitchen, and the dining room is patrolled by a crack squad deployed like Navy SEALs for the early days of each new campaign. Seasoned observers will scan Augustine’s dining room, inside the Beekman hotel in the financial district, for proof that every inch was obsessed over, down to the new paint that appears to have been on site for a hundred years before the smoking ban. They will notice the accustomed stemware, sturdy and utilitarian, for wines that run the gamut from very good to good enough. They will take it all in, the distinctive blend of the louche and the meticulous, and say to themselves, Mr. McNally has done it again. What he has done again is to borrow the tricks of successful genre fiction. As with a new Patricia Cornwell novel, everybody knows the template but shows up to see what’s different and what’s the same this time around. There have to be some fresh elements, or else why bother? But they have to be applied in ways that don’t change how the engine functions. This means avoiding self-consciously arty cooking — “cuisine” — at all costs. In a genre exercise, the addition of art just gums up the pistons. If the machinery in a McNally restaurant slows down too much, people may start to notice that his template foregrounds his habitual strengths while sweeping weaknesses, such as the occasional spottiness of Augustine’s food, into the shadows. By unanimous consent, atmosphere is Mr. McNally’s great, almost unrivaled strength. Just as the James Bond movies move from one location to another, all of which feel exactly like Bond movie locations, Mr. McNally’s dining rooms are all different and yet somehow the same. He excels at building rooms that evoke vintage Paris — not exactly the real Paris, but the city the way you remember it a year after taking a vacation there. Augustine has the prettiest, giddiest interior he’s ever done. It’s a space that makes you feel, as Holly Golightly put it, as if nothing very bad could happen to you there. Painted glazed tiles are set so that vines and stalks of flowers — tiger lilies, chrysanthemums, peonies, poppies — seem to climb the walls; more tiles place pink and white cockatoos up in the crown molding. It’s like a garden out of Fragonard, and while the 21st-century customers don’t quite look like French aristocrats, at least their hard modern edges will be blurred away by an impossibly warm honey-colored light. Augustine’s Parisian flashback mood is so successful that it doesn’t matter whether the food resembles anything you might eat in Paris itself. Beef, which can be hit or miss in France, is one of the most reliable choices on a McNally menu. At Augustine, there is a lot of it. Grilled steaks get their own menu heading — grillades. One of them is a filet mignon au poivre, but even my T-bone was sheathed in cracked peppercorns. The meat had the density and force imparted by dry aging, and was tender without being floppy. The obligatory steak frites has been exiled to the entree section. It is agreeably muscular and chewy, and served with amber-gold fries that are a perfect illustration of what may be the McNally Doctrine: Restaurants don’t need to do new things if they do the old things right. The leg of lamb has not been reinvented. Having spun on a rotisserie under a coat of herbs, it is carved off in long strips, like shawarma, and draped over very soft flageolets. A cheese soufflé appetizer recalls the warm pot de fromage at Cherche Midi; it’s delicious, even if it is breadier than a classic soufflé, more like a Gruyère-and-Parmesan popover. On Mondays, you can get a bowl of fine, fattish mussels in coconut milk with lemongrass, like a tribute to Jean-Georges Vongerichten in the Vong era. At lunch, there is a lobster roll that Mr. McBride and Mr. Parilla have the good sense to serve warm, dressed just with lemon and melted butter, the way you’d eat it on the Connecticut coast. At lunch or at dinner, somebody will be eating a burger, a richly dripping hulk of meat under melted Comté and onions cooked with Scotch. It shows up at the table with a shot of bourbon. The Scotch does more for the onions than the bourbon does for the burger. On the other hand, a shot of bourbon is just as welcome with a burger as it would be with any number of other purchases — haircuts, MetroCards, the morning paper. When invention does rear its head, the results are not always spectacular. What dark urge led the chefs to foie gras Augustine, thin slices of foie gras terrine scattered with chopped green beans and artichokes barigoule? And is there a way to get it de-Augustined? The steak tartare has been chopped to a pulp and then sent to Japan, with flakes of nori and a dose of yuzukosho that overpowered the meat on the day I had it. And while prunes are wonderful soaked in Armagnac, it turns out that when they are also incorporated into the pastry cream of a mille-feuille, they just muddy up the production. This was the only squishy spot on the dessert menu, though. Darkly caramelized apples, wound in a spiral and set on a crumbly hazelnut crust, make up the excellent tarte Tatin. Baba au rhum can be a fire-breathing beast, but the one at Augustine, soaked in an orange-scented syrup before it’s showered with rum, is sweet and gentle. As with any good genre piece, some details have been changed, but the formula remains intact; things fall into place, and yet nobody appears to have been trying too hard. That’s another advantage of conspicuously avoiding serious cuisine: If anybody points out an imperfection, you can say, “Look, it’s just dinner.” This is not the worst philosophy for a restaurant.","Soufflé au fromage; salt-baked oysters; roasted bone marrow; whisky burger; leg of lamb aux fines herbes; steaks; pommes pressées; tarte Tatin; baba au rhum; lobster roll (lunch only).

89,Sugarfish by Sushi Nozawa,0.5 star,"March 21, 2017",Pete Wells,Flatiron,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/dining/sugarfish-by-sushi-nozawa-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/dining/sugarfish-by-sushi-nozawa-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Like many habits, the pursuit of good sushi can get expensive. At the extreme end, the cost includes airfare to Tokyo and bribes to hotel concierges. Even for New Yorkers who stick close to home, the price of keeping up to date on sushi is high and climbing. Well-financed sushi nuts have already had the $145 omakase and been served on both sides of the counter by the profoundly courtly employees of Kosaka; tried Sushi Zo’s $200 omakase, the rice almost invisible under very long and very soft and unadorned ribbons of fish; sat down to Ichimura’s $300 sonata of fish cured and seasoned in an emphatic style that descends from the days before refrigeration; and handed over as much as $400 to  Sushi Ginza Onodera for nigiri and other dishes that are as minutely detailed as the interior is soaringly grand. For sushi chasers whose bank accounts are not self-replenishing, this all gets kind of depressing. Or consider the novice fan, who has begun to realize that there are realms of pleasure out there beyond tuna rolls from Duane Reade. What’s next? Sugarfish by Sushi Nozawa would like to be the answer. It’s not, but enough people believe it is, or want to believe, that getting inside this four-month-old restaurant on East 20th Street can be a test of patience. Sugarfish arrived with an out-of-town pedigree. Its branches around Los Angeles have an ardent following, and one of the chain’s founders, Kazunori Nozawa, was among the first sushi chefs to bring to that city a rigorously autocratic style. Specializing in omakase, he was known to yell at those foolish enough to stir wasabi into their soy sauce. Nobody yelled at me at Sugarfish, but the staff didn’t seem all that eager to feed me, either. I made my first assault on the host stand just after 6:30 one weeknight. (The place doesn’t do reservations.) I was alone and willing to wait even if it took until closing time — 11 that night. What an optimist I was in those days. “We’re not taking any more names tonight,” a host announced. Later, I learned to stage my raids between 2 and 4 in the afternoon, not hours when I typically crave raw fish. One lucky day, I was in within 30 minutes and out before sunset. One can order sushi by the piece, but the servers and the printed menu heavily push the three “Trust Me” meals. This is a variant on omakase, which roughly means “I trust the chef,” but a Trust Me is not an omakase meal. It is, essentially, a set menu served in waves. All three start with chilled edamame and slices of tuna in ponzu, move on to several small courses of nigiri and end with a hand roll or two. The simplest, Trust Me Lite, is $27 and includes four pieces of nigiri; the most expensive is the Nozawa Trust Me, with 12 pieces of sushi and two hand rolls at a price of $51. Each course zooms out of a window in the kitchen where sushi is made with unusual speed. Efficiency lets Sugarfish keep prices low, the volume high and the rice warm — a hallmark of what the critic Jonathan Gold has termed the School of Nozawa. The rice is not only warm. It’s seasoned with so much vinegar that it’s almost pickled. This makes it appealingly energetic, a quality that sets it apart from the rest of the food. The fish is uniformly soft and pretty, but none of it tastes much like fish. Sweet shrimp and sea scallops were both exactly as they should be. But there was no heft to the tuna, no depth to the salmon, and anybody who happens to like shiny-skinned, fishy-tasting species like mackerel or sardines is in the wrong restaurant. The menu and website make much of Mr. Nozawa’s connections among elite fishmongers, but the selection at Sugarfish rarely rises above entry level. The menu lists certain specials “when available.” Sea urchin is one; the last time I went, there wasn’t any. This has to be the only sushi restaurant in New York that can’t get its hands on sea urchin. Fresh wasabi may be too much to ask at Sugarfish’s prices, but there is no wasabi at all under the fish. This is weird. Where sushi is concerned, wasabi isn’t just a condiment. It’s the air in the tires. Sugarfish lets you apply your own from some concentric bloops of stuff that tastes like watery horseradish and looks like a green version of the poop emoji, without the smile. By the end of my third meal, I was desperate for some break in the monotony. If Mr. Nozawa had suddenly materialized to yell at me, I would have given him flowers.","Nozawa-style shrimp; bay scallops; sweet shrimp; crab hand roll. Set menus, $27 to $51; individual items, $3 to $17; service included."
90,Franklin Barbecue,2 star,"March 14, 2017",Pete Wells,"Austin, Tex.","American, Barbecue",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/dining/franklin-barbecue-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/dining/franklin-barbecue-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"AUSTIN, Tex. — “How much brisket are you having?” That’s the first question the man with the knife behind the counter will ask when you reach the front of the line at Franklin Barbecue. He won’t stab you if you don’t have an answer ready, but I might. By that point, you or another person who is either being paid by you or who just likes you very much will have been waiting outside for two hours or more — sometimes a lot more. The line starts earlier and grows faster on weekends and during South by Southwest, the festival of music, film and technology that metastasizes here each March and runs, this year, through Sunday. Nobody reaches the front of the line accidentally. If you haven’t managed to work out how much brisket to buy when you get there, you are beyond my help. I won’t blame you, though, if you double your order after the man with the knife cuts off a little block of meat and hands it to you. Look at it, the way it shades from nut-brown at the inside to cherry-jam around the border to black at the crust, stained by carbon and stubbled with coarse pepper. Smell it while the steam is still carrying the smell of burning post oak. Taste it, the way it combines the fat-bathed richness of fresh beef with the tight focus of meat cured by salt and smoke. Still want just half a pound? Other considerations come into play, like the elasticity of your stomach and your taste for pork, smoked sausage and turkey. But brisket is the foundation on which Franklin Barbecue was built, brisket as it is seasoned and barbecued by Aaron Franklin, the chief pitmaster and an owner. Mr. Franklin is a gearhead and a MacGyver with obsessive tendencies. Men like him were building hot rods in the 1960s and six-chambered bongs in the ’70s. In the 2000s, Mr. Franklin was designing and welding offset smokers and firing them up for loosely organized backyard cookouts. He writes in his book, “Franklin Barbecue: A Meat-Smoking Manifesto,” that his first brisket was “flavorless — tough and dry.” He got better. By 2009, when he began selling meat from a white-and-aqua-blue 1971 Aristocrat Lo-Liner trailer he’d bought for $300, he had moved far upscale from the cheap supermarket brisket of his first experiments. And when he moved to an actual structure, painted to look like an overgrown version of that trailer, his brisket was already famous. He had studied the physics of chimney draw and the maddeningly long time during which barbecue appears to have stopped cooking long before it’s done, known in the trade as “the stall.” He has to be the first pitmaster in Texas history whose cookbook has a list of recommended books that is devoted entirely to the food-science writers Harold McGee and Nathan Myhrvold. What Mr. Franklin had stumbled across in his backyard was a craft in which, for both the maker and the consumer, the financial barrier to entry was low and the opportunity for connoisseurship was ample. These are the two chief prerequisites of any successful hipster food business, and Franklin Barbecue set off a new-traditionalist barbecue movement across the country. One of Mr. Franklin’s apostasies from old-school central Texas barbecue technique is wrapping meat midway through smoking to keep it from drying out. All his products are noticeably juicy; the turkey is helped by a quick dip in a pan of butter and juices. He swaddles brisket in butcher paper, which lets some steam out. Other meats are sealed inside aluminum foil. I wondered if this was the reason the marbling inside the brisket was more appetizing than the fat on the pork ribs and pulled pork, which could be a little wet and squishy. Much of the fat simply yields a glossy liquid that makes a delicious sauce for the lightly smoky pulled pork. The smoke works its way more thoroughly into the ribs, which become a firm and chewy pig candy, and into the sausages. Franklin Barbecue isn’t famous for its sausages, which are custom-made by a nearby butcher. They are glorious, though, loaded with pepper and garlic and enough beef fat to make the wrinkled surface of the casings sparkle. Within the next few days, they will be ground and stuffed on site. As for the turkey, it is so mild that it will probably be of surpassing interest only to those who don’t eat beef or pork who’ve been dragged along by brisket-crazed friends. Vegetarians may find some comfort in the fine vinegared slaw of purple cabbage or the potato salad, made in the creamy style that I hope to find at every picnic. They will run from the pinto beans, which are supplemented by odds and ends of meat scraped from the butcher block. Near the cash register are palm-size pies wrapped in plastic, with old-fashioned crusts. Lemon chess pie had a citrus tartness that the Key lime pie was missing, and I admired the way the bourbon-banana pie compressed childhood and adulthood in a single dessert. And so, you ask: Is it worth the wait? The answer, like many things in life, depends on what else you could be doing with your time. I would note that in the hours required to line up and sit down at Franklin Barbecue, I could have driven 35 miles northeast to Louie Mueller Barbecue in Taylor, ordered the magnificent beef rib (which Franklin sells only on Saturdays), and eaten it until I couldn’t hold any more. But I’d also note that I would not trade Franklin’s brisket for Mueller’s. I doubt I’d trade Franklin’s brisket for anybody’s, although for other meats, and certainly for turkey, I may give a slight edge to Killen’s Barbecue in Pearland. Finally, I’d point out that the line at Mr. Franklin’s restaurant is not Mr. Franklin’s fault, except insofar as he is responsible for cooking meat that people sacrifice entire mornings for. The line is a function of popularity and the way Texas barbecue is sliced (on the spot) and sold (by weight). Franklin Barbecue also goes out of its way to offer customers standing outside what you might call palliative care. A dozen or so folding chairs are kept in a corral under the stairs for early birds. Although the main entrance is locked until 10:59 a.m., another door is opened so the faithful can use the restrooms or buy drinks. An employee will walk down the line several times in the morning, selling canned beer from a cooler (Franklin stocks beers from some of the city’s best breweries) and trying to estimate when the meats will run out. This is an imprecise science, involving people’s best guesses for what they’ll order when they get inside. On my first visit, I was right in the middle of the parking lot, and was told there was a chance I’d miss out on pulled pork. That was incorrect, I’m happy to say. Though inexact, Franklin’s estimates can fend off the kind of disappointment I felt at La Barbecue, a highly regarded local truck where I spent more than an hour one afternoon and where everything but chopped beef was gone by the time I’d inchwormed to the front of the line. Franklin Barbecue doesn’t have to be so humane. Employees could probably stand on the roof pouring hot lard over customers’ heads without driving too many people away. Once you start thinking about how much brisket you want, it’s hard to leave.","Brisket; pork ribs; pulled pork; sausage; Tipsy Texan sandwich; beans; coleslaw; potato salad. Meats, $12 to $20 a pound; sandwiches, $6 to $10."
91,Sahib,2 star,"Feb. 21, 2017",Pete Wells,Kips Bay,Indian,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/dining/sahib-review-indian-restaurant-nyc.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/dining/sahib-review-indian-restaurant-nyc.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Anybody who tries to tell you that the place to go for Indian food is Jackson Heights, Queens, hasn’t been there in a long time. Beyond question, Jackson Heights is the first stop for anyone seeking an education in the Tibetan syllabus: momos filled with brothy beef under their bellybutton pleats; laphing, noodles neatly rolled and sliced like strudel and set loose in a puddle of chile oil; steaming, salty, bracing cups of yak butter tea. Most of the neighborhood’s places for samosas and naan, though, either are gone or have faded into insignificance. You less often meet somebody who sends you to Curry Hill for the cooking of India. But it’s the correct answer. Once known mainly for cheap buffet lunches (Haandi, long the reigning champion of the steam table, is still one of Manhattan’s unnatural wonders), Lexington Avenue in the upper 20s has over the past few years become home to the most diverse and concentrated hub of Indian restaurants in New York City. A disproportionate amount of this diversity is the work of two veteran chefs and restaurateurs. Shiva Natarajan opened one Curry Hill restaurant that paid tribute to Kolkata, particularly its Jewish cuisine; another that showcased food from India’s southwest coast; a third that brought together dishes from the cities of Lucknow and Hyderabad; and a fourth that specialized in the Punjab. He sold all four to Hemant Mathur two years ago. Together they started working on a fifth, Sahib. It opened in the fall. More than those other restaurants, one of which has closed, Sahib darts around India. Mr. Natarajan, who worked as the consulting chef, organized the menu around dishes he has been gathering in India while researching a cookbook. He isn’t trying to be encyclopedic, and the menu reflects that; it pays a little bit of attention to several regions and ignores others entirely. This makes it hard to get a firm sense of any one regional style, but easy to enjoy several dishes you may have never seen before. This may even be true for Indians. Goans might not recognize Sahib’s wonderful blend of fried eggplant stirred into a smoky mash of eggplant that has been softened in a tandoor; the dish, only casually spiced, comes from the northern city of Varanasi, on the Ganges. Potatoes are stewed all over India, but Sahib’s dum olav may be new to those who aren’t from Kashmir. Little round potatoes are stabbed with a toothpick first so they will pick up more of the sauce they’re cooked in: yogurt seasoned with tamarind, cardamom and Kashmiri chiles. The sauce wins its arguments through persuasion rather than force, in part because it has no tomatoes or onions. To see what a difference leaving them out can make, try the rogan josh. If you’ve had this Kashmiri lamb dish at other local Indian restaurants, you probably think of rogan josh as a bulldozer of a dish, more powerful than graceful. Chances are onions and tomatoes were the ground floor on which the thick brown gravy was built. At Sahib, the sauce is creamier and gentle enough that the taste of saffron doesn’t get lost, and I found myself really paying attention to the flavors — a new experience when it comes to rogan josh. If the lamb in both that dish and another I tried was very slightly more chewy than my ideal, it’s also true that the goat never let me down. In the marchwagan korma, a curry from Kashmir, goat was cooked on the bones in a rich and intensely aromatic yogurt sauce. Nothing I had at Sahib was noisily spicy, but the Kashmiri chiles in this korma made themselves heard. From the city of Mangalore on the Arabian Sea comes kori gassi, a very mild and irresistible chicken stew; coriander, asafetida and curry leaves season the coconut milk. The recipe for Mr. Natarajan’s chicken biryani comes from Lucknow. Made with both yogurt and milk, cooked in a pot sealed with a leaf of pastry, it’s his favorite version of this rice dish, he says. It may be mine, too. Kolkata is the source of the batter-fried cauliflower coated in red chile sauce, called lasoni gobi. An example of what happened to Chinese food after it spent a few years in India, lasoni gobi is fun when it’s spicy, and dreary when it’s not. I’ve had it both ways at Sahib. The “chicken 65,” a dish that is much loved on the streets of Chennai, was a little dull here, too. Basic staples, though, were unusually good: fragrant lemon rice; thair pachadi, a South Indian raita with mustard seeds and okra; and the dal of black lentils with an uncommonly fresh taste (from ginger, green chiles and cilantro) under the cream and butter. Mr. Mathur is both the chef and the owner. He is probably best known for Tulsi, in Midtown, although some New Yorkers still fall into twitchy daydreams at the memory of his menu at Devi. Like those places, and like the restaurants Mr. Natarajan sold to Mr. Mathur, Sahib walks a middle ground between high-gloss operations like Junoon or Indian Accent and the places in the East Village that spent their entire decorating budget on Christmas lights. Sahib’s appearance is restrained, with a lot of whitewashed and weathered planks of wood; it looks like some of the nicer beach rentals on VRBO. Service, while overeager at times, avoids both the harried anxiety of cheaper Indian restaurants and the ceremonious pretension of more expensive ones. There is no wine or beer yet, but the waiters always offered to open any bottles we had brought. I stuck with tea or the fine mango lassi, a little tart and very slightly salty. More than once when I tried to skip dessert, the servers talked me into gulab jamun, warm globes of cheese and milk dripping with a rose-scented syrup. I’d always protest and I’d always surrender, and I was always glad I did.","Baighan bhaji (eggplant fritters); sahib dal (creamy black lentils); dum olav (Kashmir-style potatoes); khatti bhindi (sautéed okra); Banarasi baighan (smoked and fried eggplant); biryanis; kori gassi (Mangalorean style chicken curry); rogan josh (Kashmir-style lamb); marchwagan korma (Kashmir-style goat curry); gulab jamun (cheese balls in rose syrup).

92,Chinese Tuxedo,2 star,"Feb. 14, 2017",Pete Wells,Chinatown,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/dining/chinese-tuxedo-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/dining/chinese-tuxedo-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The bend halfway down Doyers Street in Chinatown used to see more killings than any other stretch of road in the country. The Bloody Angle is safe now, but not quiet. The gangs there have been replaced by packs of roaming young people who come for siu mai and har gow at Nom Wah Tea Parlor, or underground mezcal at Pulqueria, or archival cocktails at Apotheke. And, for the last few months, they’ve been filing through the door under the long vertical neon sign that reads TUXEDO. Once inside this restaurant, whose full name is Chinese Tuxedo, you run into gridlock at the dark and crowded bar. A couple of besieged hosts try, without noticeable success, to control the flow of customers and winter coats moving in both directions along a narrow passageway. It’s chaotic and claustrophobic, and you may feel a strong urge to go back outside. Keep going. At the end of the bar, the vista suddenly opens out, as if you had come out of a tunnel into daylight. You are standing at the top of a staircase that descends into a sunken dining room filled with round tables of bright white marble. Fluted columns of cast iron rise 15 feet to the ceiling. The walls look like an archaeological dig in progress, stripped back to old layers of paint and plaster. Curved black banquettes hug the perimeter, with tropical plants sprouting up behind them. The room has a vintage air and a gleam of drama, which is appropriate enough because it was once a Chinese theater, the first on the East Coast. During the Tong Wars of the early 20th century, the theater was neutral territory, where Hip Sings and Un Leongs sat separately but peaceably, until the day in 1905 when Hip Sing gunmen set off firecrackers during a performance and then opened fire on their rivals. The Chinese Theater Massacre isn’t necessarily the piece of local history that Chinese Tuxedo wants to evoke. It takes its name from another turn-of-the-century establishment on Doyers Street, an ornate restaurant where a traditional carved second-story balcony crested with a larger-than-life-size eagle was built as a kind of advertisement for passengers on the Third Avenue elevated line, who could see it through the train windows. Like the original Chinese Tuxedo, this new model, which opened in November, makes its pitch to people passing through the neighborhood as well as to locals. On some nights, the crowd is a mix of white people here simply because it’s new, and Chinese families tentatively poking at the fried eggplant and pork dumplings topped with flying fish roe. They look as if they are trying to decide whether this is really Chinese food. The answer is an unequivocal “sort of.” The chef, Paul Donnelly, is a Scot. Until recently, he ran the kitchen at Ms. G’s in Sydney, Australia, which specializes in entertainingly mongrelized dishes like cheeseburger spring rolls and masala fried rice. Mr. Donnelly has called his menu at Chinese Tuxedo “fusion.” That dreaded word deserves two qualifications. First, he doesn’t tend to handcuff together unrelated cuisines that have nothing in common except a continent; most of his dishes have discernibly Chinese antecedents. Second, there is dumb fusion and there is smart fusion, and Mr. Donnelly practices the smart kind. Each time I went back, I wanted the fried eggplant in sticky, spicy caramel again. The flicker of Sichuan peppercorn in the sauce could be more pronounced, but the chile burn is just strong enough and the eggplant keeps its wonderful airy crunch even after sitting around for a while. So does the fried pork cheek in the reformed sweet-and-sour pork, stacked up above fresh pineapple chunks and a bracing vinegar sauce that is closer to the Cantonese version than to the orange ketchup sauce that glows radioactively from inside American takeout boxes. The long, sliced slab of char siu pork glazed with honey is simple and classic; if the excellent whole squab with a glossy Peking-duck-style lacquer on its skin turned up at Royal Seafood or another traditional Chinatown restaurant, nobody would blink. It’s served in five pieces, one of which is the head. One of my guests crunched away happily on it, but I was more interested in the meatier quarters. These straight-faced Cantonese studies worked out better than Mr. Donnelly’s halting excursions into Sichuan. The smashed cucumber salad was barely dented and scarcely seasoned. Mapo lo mein, a promising enough idea, was short on heat and swagger and long on sweetness. (This was one of the few dishes that struck me as too sweet, but the menu as a whole relies on sugar more than it should.) Mr. Donnelly puts more strut into his step when he freestyles. Steak tartare on rice crackers is seasoned with fried shallots and a healthy glug of fish sauce; it may be more Vietnamese than Chinese, but it’s great. So is the glistening scoop of chicken liver pâté that you spread, with a pickled slaw of apples and radishes, on youtiao, those cruller-like sticks of fried dough. And I think my favorite invention of his is the beef and broccoli made with tender, peppery tongue pastrami. While the kitchen is fairly consistent already, service is unpredictable. Sometimes dishes crowd the table, and other times they arrive one at a time. Once, we had two waiters shadowing us all night; another time, we sat with our menus for 20 minutes trying to catch somebody’s eye. We thought somebody might take our order after an overexcited guest of mine accidentally knocked her wine glass onto the floor, but once the broken pieces were swept up, we must have put on our invisibility cloaks again. One major inconvenience: The restaurant is so popular that reservations are essential, but Chinese Tuxedo won’t take them for parties of fewer than four. When three of us showed up at 6:30 p.m., we were told we might have to wait an hour and a half. As it turned out, it didn’t take that long, but if I hadn’t been on the job, I wouldn’t have stuck around long enough to find out. The staff could also use more wine training. Chinese Tuxedo’s list is not the kind that you can point at with your eyes closed and know you’ll get a good bottle, but my servers weren’t much help in sorting it out. I sat there wishing I could get wine delivered from Fung Tu or Mission Chinese Food, where the lists are deeper and more adroitly chosen for Chinese cooking. For the moment, Chinese Tuxedo has no hard liquor. But it does have one dessert that is almost worth a trip all by itself. Called Chinese strawberries and cream, it’s a pretty pile of whipped cream and yogurt with fresh and dried strawberries, nuggets of mochi and a few other surprises. This is a dessert that has fun but also knows exactly what it’s doing.","Steak tartare; Mr. Weng’s chicken-liver pâté; roasted duck salad; crispy eggplant; Tuxedo dumplings; beef and broccoli; honey-glazed char siu; sweet and sour pork; squab; Johny fried rice; Chinese strawberries.

93,Chumley’s,2 star,"Jan. 31, 2017",Pete Wells,West Village,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/dining/chumleys-review-bar-west-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/dining/chumleys-review-bar-west-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"If you heard that Chumley’s is open again, you were misinformed. The dim, spare, beer-scented hideaway in the West Village is gone, torn down, not coming back. At its old address is a restaurant that has nothing in common with the original except a name, a door, an archway and framed photographs of, and jackets of books by, writers who used to drink there. Most of them wouldn’t be able to afford a cocktail there now, let alone dinner. Chumley’s first quietly and selectively opened its unmarked door, inside a hidden courtyard at the end of an alley, during Prohibition. Flappers, sailors, actors, Wobblies, writers heading for fame and bohemians heading for nowhere ate and drank in its windowless rooms. Simone de Beauvoir, who tumbled into Chumley’s in the 1950s on a tip from Richard Wright, wrote that it was “utterly simple, with its little tables lined against the walls, but it has something so rare in America — atmosphere.” On busy nights in later years, the atmosphere could be like that of a college rathskeller in a state with a low drinking age. But if you caught Chumley’s at the right hour, when there were empty booths and a log burning in the fireplace, it could be a shelter from the city and an ideal embodiment of it at the same time. All this time, the building, almost a century old when Chumley’s opened, was falling apart — slowly at first and then, in 2007, in a landslide of bricks. It was so far gone that it had to be torn down and rebuilt. The work went so slowly that Chumley’s nearly lost its chance to renew its liquor license. Then Alessandro Borgognone, who owns Sushi Nakazawa around the corner, was made a partner in the business; he must have hit the construction crew with a dose of wasabi, because the build-out zoomed along, the liquor license came through just in time, and the restaurant began serving in October. The chef is Victoria Blamey, who has cooked under Paul Liebrandt, Matthew Lightner and Justin Smillie. Her menu has far-flung influences — the old regulars would have taken one look at it and called for another shot — but she doesn’t let the dishes get wispy or abstract. Some of them even look like bar food, sort of. And she loads them with more excitement than you’ll come across in other new restaurants that are getting far more attention. Starting with a warm pretzel and French onion dip, you first notice just how light the pretzel is. It is to the street-cart variety what a hummingbird is to a Butterball turkey. The crust is salt-flecked and rough with toasted onion powder. Orange dots of salmon roe sit on top of the dip, which tastes pure and chemical free — cooked garlic and shallots and onions are stirred into a base of soft cream cheese, cloumage and crème fraîche. Chumley’s beef tartare goes a few places other tartares don’t. Instead of mustard and capers, it takes its sharpness from confit tomatoes and gratings of a sheep’s milk cheese from Catalonia. It’s meant to be spread on a wavy, blistered puff of fried beef tendon. Crunchier and airier than a cracker, the tendon has a very clean flavor and doesn’t soak up the taste of raw steak the way toast does. There is a terrine that would be right at home in one of those casually excellent bistros run by young chefs in Paris. Foie gras and shredded ham hock are pressed between leaves of savoy cabbage; the cross section you get on a vintage china plate is served with a tart, fruity puddle of apple cider reduced to a gastrique. It’s radically simple, and makes something memorable out of ham hocks and cabbage. (To be fair, the foie gras does its part, too.) New York may not need another burger, but any place called Chumley’s definitely does. The one Ms. Blamey has provided is like an erotic poem on the theme of fat. It is a double-decker, both of its patties buried under American cheese and soaked with bone marrow that’s been hit with a blowtorch. Liquid marrow falls from the burger; so do a few dark and crunchy fried shallots and orange blobs of cheese. On the side are very crisp and skinny fries tossed, after their second trip to the deep fryer, in melted dry-aged beef fat. I imagine the burger is pretty great after a few drinks. I ate it while I was as sober as a mechanical pencil, and it was all I could do not to paint my face with grease until I looked like Martin Sheen at the end of “Apocalypse Now.” Any qualms I had about the price, $25, vanished while I was looking around the floor for my napkin. I had also rolled my eyes at first when I saw a $43 potpie on the menu of a former speakeasy. The thing is, it is an amazing potpie. The body of a Dungeness crab is stuffed, all the way out to its spiky corners, with a crab meat stew. Ms. Blamey based it on an abalone dish from Chile, where she grew up, and it gets its kick from fresh ají dulce peppers along with ground Aleppo pepper. The richness that comes from the fatty innards of the crab helps the stew cling like cream to the tender puff pastry crust, which is dotted with sesame seeds. There are two desserts: a scoop of vanilla ice cream with pistachio streusel and parsnip purée (it’s good, I swear), and a gold-foil-wrapped sandwich of ice cream made with Luxardo maraschino cherries pressed between square almond-cocoa cookies that are as black as Oreos. Along with cocktails, Chumley’s drinks menu has a series of variations on the Scotch and soda, a terrific idea. Highballs deserve more attention from restaurants; they’re more refreshing and more amenable to food than more concentrated medicine like the manhattan. Ms. Blamey works in a galley in the back. Across from her confined territory are the restrooms, where you can visit framed slices of the original wood tables. They were deeply carved over the years, and now the names and initials are displayed behind glass like frescoes from Pompeii. Nobody at Chumley’s is likely to take a switchblade to the tables now, not after having to provide credit-card numbers to make a reservation. It’s possible to get a table without one, but you wouldn’t know that from the way the hosts greet new arrivals with one finger poised over an iPad and an expression that says, “Are you on the list?” There is something a little too clubby, too, about the way cards that read RESERVED are placed on the empty tables and in front of unoccupied bar stools, even when the restaurant is winding down for the night. Closing time is midnight now, a concession to neighbors who fought the liquor license. Chumley’s is emphatically worth going to as long as Ms. Blamey remains content to work in that kitchen. What happens after that is anyone’s guess. The reservations policy seems to keep people from just dropping by for a drink, and casual drinking was part of the atmosphere that de Beauvoir liked so much. Now, instead of atmosphere, Chumley’s has décor; the book jackets and photographs are elements in a haunted house attraction featuring the ghosts of Hemingway and Kerouac. The neighbors sleep better, but the neighborhood isn’t as interesting.","Pretzel and dip; beef tartare; John’s terrine; fried chicken al Cognac; chupe potpie; 86’d burger. Appetizers, $13 to $23; main courses, $24 to $43."
94,Fowler & Wells,2 star,"Jan. 24, 2017",Pete Wells,Financial District,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/dining/fowler-and-wells-restaurant-review-beekman-hotel.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/dining/fowler-and-wells-restaurant-review-beekman-hotel.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"You enter Tom Colicchio’s new restaurant near City Hall through what is suddenly the most stunning hotel lobby bar in New York City. The Beekman hotel’s bar is at the bottom of the atrium of the 1883 Temple Court Building, which rises up through seven floors of elaborate cast-iron railings to end in a soaring glass pyramid. It’s a striking room where you can sink into an armchair with a solidly built drink in your hand and get lost in the past, a quintessentially urban experience that most of the city’s grand old hotels no longer give us. With Fowler & Wells, Mr. Colicchio tries to extend the atrium’s Gilded Age exuberance. He never quite gets there. The problem isn’t quality or effort: The cooking is spotlessly correct, the ingredients shimmer on the plate, the flavors all make sense, and the dining room is dignified in a way that makes you realize how undervalued that trait has become in restaurants. But the central vision tying it all together is fuzzy. The restaurant is somehow less than the sum of its parts. Choosing the $135 tasting menu one night, I got a seven-course tour of robber-baron dishes as interpreted by Mr. Colicchio and Bryan Hunt, the executive chef. The opener was a delicious variation on the theme of oysters Rockefeller. Watercress stood in for spinach, and the chubby Belon oyster had been poached in oyster liquor and crème fraîche seasoned with fennel and bacon: all the right flavors, rearranged. Duck à l’orange was reworked, wonderfully, with kumquats. I smiled at how smart the chefs were to add a rippling charge to the sweetened citrus with ginger, mustard seed and vinegar made from oranges. The meat of little lobsters had been chopped and replaced in the shells with a green slash of tomalley, tarragon leaves and chanterelles the size of shirt buttons. It was very good, but was the sort of dish that chefs of Mr. Colicchio’s generation have been cooking for a couple of decades. With the possible exception of its superb pastry crust, the same was true of venison Wellington, with chestnuts and black trumpets inside a ring of huckleberry sauce. None of this is a problem in and of itself — good food is good! — but you might feel mildly let down if you believed the pre-opening press, which promised cooking inspired by an earlier era. At Le Coucou, Daniel Rose locates the energy in old-guard French dishes and then multiplies it, but the kitchen at Fowler & Wells often seems to be trying to get away from the past. If you order à la carte, the historical references are hard to spot. The freedom the chefs take here can lead to some exciting turns of imagination. Pounded rabbit loin was fried into a long, crunchy schnitzel and served over chickpeas and pistachios; lemon confit and lots of thyme leaves snapped the dish into harmony. There was a memorable monkfish cooked in hot wood smoke, served with freekeh and other grains cooked in reduced beet juice. The same grains, toasted to a crackle, had been tossed over the top. Warm crème fraîche softened the earthy taste of the beets, although I didn’t see the point of spiking this sauce with caviar. The kitchen’s creativity seems to run out of gas at some points, though. There wasn’t a lot of flavor in firm lumps of sweetbread with brussels sprout leaves and pale bands of lardon, and not much surprise in the juxtaposition of roasted salsify, sunchokes and leeks over a pale sunchoke purée. There’s a pretty plate of raw fluke under red-rimmed wheels of radish and tiny globes of finger lime; it was as good as it is in other restaurants where I’ve had nearly the same dish. The à la carte menu would be more tempting if it overlapped at all with the tasting menu. It wasn’t until my third visit that a server suggested the chef might be able to dislodge some dishes from the tasting menu to serve as an appetizer or main course. The two barely related menus make it hard to figure out what the Fowler & Wells experience is supposed to be. The disconnection carries over to the atmosphere. Like the lobby bar (but not the hotel’s other restaurant, Keith McNally’s Augustine), the dining room interior was done by Martin Brudnizki Design Studio, but seems to have been put together by two different Brudnizkis who may or may not be on speaking terms. One Brudnizki went for a turn-of-the-century glint. There are tiered bronze chandeliers and walls overlaid with green and gold plaster until they look as if they belong in the ballroom of some faded Italian palace. In the middle of it all is an immense oval cabinet, with wine bottles on its marble top and stemware on shelves held up by bronze rails that rise into the air like the upper decks of an ocean liner. The other Brudnizki commissioned huge grids of backlighted colored glass and brought in mirror tiles and sparkly faceted-glass sconces. The walls belong in “The Leopard,” but the mirrors and sconces are right out of “The Sopranos.” The name Fowler & Wells is a muddle in its own way. Before the current structure was built, another building stood on the corner of Beekman and Nassau Streets. Among its tenants were Orson Fowler and Samuel Wells, a pair of phrenologists with a sideline in publishing. The 19th-century belief that  skull shape revealed character provides some amusing, arcane cocktail names. But in its day, phrenology wrapped a gauzy cloak of fake science around the ugly armor of racism. Fowler was close to several abolitionists, but he also wrote that the heads of black people made them “our best nurses” and “excellent waiters” while dooming them to language skills that were at best “middling.” This is obviously not a side of phrenology that Mr. Colicchio, who is outspoken about his progressive politics, embraces. “We don’t want anybody to think we take it seriously, because it was used for some not very good things,” he said in an interview. Later, I told him that the dining room staff was noticeably diverse. (One day I hope that will go without saying at restaurants all over the city.) “I’m not involved in hiring front-of-house staff,” he said. “But I’ve got to say, I feel pretty good about it.” My service was sometimes jittery, but fast and attentive. A brisk professionalism is at work throughout the restaurant. The wine service and the list, overseen by Jarred Roth, is welcoming whether you have specific tastes or just a general notion of what you like. Meals always ended on a high note thanks to the pastry chef, Abby Swain. She has a nimble mind and a sensible palate, a great combination that results in desserts like a baked alaska based on the flavors of Black Forest cake, or the panna cotta with poached quince and maple syrup. Fowler & Wells has so many strengths that few people will leave unhappy. But they may wake up the next day with scattered impressions of what the place is about, until Mr. Colicchio and Mr. Hunt can bring more focus to the menu.","Chestnut agnolotti; fluke with radishes; scarlet prawns with mushrooms à la Greque; hot smoked monkfish with beets; rabbit schnitzel; baked alaska; panna cotta with quince, maple and walnuts. Appetizers, $17 to $32; main courses, $31 to $65; tasting menu, seven courses for $135."
95,Ichiran,1 star,"Jan. 17, 2017",Pete Wells,Bushwick,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/dining/ichiran-review-ramen-brooklyn.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/dining/ichiran-review-ramen-brooklyn.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Ichiran, a Japanese ramen chain that touched down in Brooklyn last fall, makes one kind of soup, the opaque ivory pork broth called tonkotsu. Like a heart surgeon who operates only on the left ventricle, it has staked out a niche within a niche. Within its microspecialty, though, Ichiran presents you with a boggling number of decisions. The first comes before the menu, and it will determine what kind of restaurant you eat in. When you walk in from Johnson Avenue, one of those Bushwick streets that runs along blank walls that hide disquieting postindustrial scars, you’re asked if you would rather sit in a booth or at a table. This is an easy choice. The tables are arranged in a bright room with red paper lanterns, promotional posters and a television in the corner. It will do if you came with a group, but it is as special as the nicer restaurants in Penn Station. The booths, on the other hand, aren’t like anything else in town. There are two long rows of them separated by a long alley where the servers work. The booths are separated from this backstage area by bamboo shades and one another by hinged partitions. When the partitions were shut and the shades were down, I was all by myself. I couldn’t decide if it felt more like a library carrel, a peep show or a confessional. (“My child, how long has it been since you last slurped a noodle?”) According to the company, which has around 60 locations in Japan, these are “flavor concentration booths.” In the closed position, the partitions did seem to keep the sweet-smelling steam that rises off the soup from wandering away on currents of air. I could soak in the aroma even when my head wasn’t bent over the bowl. The effect was minimal, though, and I wondered if the thing that was supposed to be doing the concentrating was me. The signs tacked up all over the place were distracting, though. There is even one taped to the restroom wall explaining that Ichiran’s owner is determined never to run out of toilet paper. The wall is already covered with toilet paper rolls, but a few extra sheets are tucked behind the note, in case of emergency. One of the many signs inside the booth read, “Flavor Concentration in progress — please be quiet and silence your phones.” In theory, you could eat a whole meal at Ichiran with no human contact. The menu is a checklist. A laminated card signals that you want a water refill. The paper wrapper on the chopsticks doubles as an order form for extra noodles if you finish the ones in the bowl. Leave one of them by the red call button, press it, and a server rolls up the shade to take away your order. All of this may happen wordlessly in Japan. In New York, we talk. Almost every time the shade went up, a server bent over to peer through the opening, which is at the height of a belt buckle, to chat about my order. One night, just after I sat down, the screen went up, and a hand stretched toward me. Without thinking, I held out mine, and we shook. Anxiety flushed through me. Had I broken ramen protocol? Was this like reaching over the front seat of a car to give an Uber driver a neck rub? I recovered from my shame and started filling out the menu with check marks and circles. How strong did I want the broth? How rich with melted pork fat — a few isolated slicks coasting on top of the soup, or a layer thick as frosting on a cupcake? Would I like chopped scallions or not? How about cha-shu, thin slices of marinated pork? Extra cha-shu on the side? No chopped garlic, a pile of garlic, or something in between? Should my noodles be soft on arrival, or firm because they’d get to keep cooking in the hot soup? Finally, did I want any of Ichiran’s proprietary spice mixture dropped on top, and if so, how much? Would a few pinpricks of fire do, or should I make the broth so incendiary that I would have to reach for the tissues mounted on the wall behind me? All these decisions would be pointless, of course, if the ramen were not very good. It is. Whether you will prefer it to the majestically potent tonkotsu at Mu Ramen or the memorably savory one at Ippudo, I can’t say. But it is rounded and substantial, moving across the mouth with the glide and density of extralight coffee. The flavor is very porky without any of the unnerving butcher-shop note that creeps into some tonkotsus. I was never served a bowl that was less than painfully hot, which is the ideal. One edge Ichiran holds over its competitors is that you can give what you consider the correct answer to all of those questions. For the record, my preferences after a few rounds of experimentation are: broth of medium richness and strength; yes to scallions and the standard, free portion of cha-shu (it is less flavorful than at some other places, the meat less generous with jiggly streaks of fat); a smallish dab of garlic; and firm but not “extra firm” noodles, which are straight and skinny, like spaghetti. The spice blend is called hiden no tare, which translates as “secret sauce.” Supposedly only four people know the recipe. This coarse, rust-colored paste adds more than heat; after it sits in the soup for a while, the broth takes on a toasted flavor that sometimes reminded me of roasted peanuts. The amount I asked for varied based on how badly my head required banging that day. I stopped short of a full skull-shattering dose, but it’s reassuring to know I can get it when the need arises. These basic options don’t change the cost of the soup, $18.90. Tips are not accepted, which brings the price into line with, say, Ivan Ramen or Ippudo. Ichiran’s ramen can become one of the most expensive in town, though, if you add toppings like a cooked egg, squares of dried nori or wood ear mushrooms, which come with extra charges. Those who, like me, enjoy semiliquid yolks in their ramen will not want the egg, which is solid all the way through. The only garnish I was happy to spend more money for was the little pitcher of vinegar for $1.90. It has a soft, somewhat oxidized bite, like that of aged sherry vinegar, and it brings definition to the blunt contours of the pork broth. There is one dessert, an almond-tofu pudding glazed with matcha. The only other dish, strips of simmered pork belly, can be eaten with a bowl of white rice. The pork was good enough to pad my stomach, but when hunger is my concern, I’ll go for a supplementary coil of noodles. Crouched in my booth, I’ll practice my slurp, and when hot droplets of soup fly everywhere, nobody will get spattered but me.","Tonkotsu ramen. Prices: pork belly appetizer, $9.90; ramen, $18.90; ramen toppings, $1.90 to $3.90."
96,Flora Bar,2 star,"Jan. 10, 2017",Pete Wells,Upper East Side,"American, Japanese, Spanish",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/dining/flora-bar-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/dining/flora-bar-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I’m on the verge of giving up trying to explain why Ignacio Mattos’s food is so good. I once wrote that the cooking at his first restaurant, now closed, dabbled in “deep, surrealist weirdness.” At Estela, the place on Houston Street that put him on the map, I described his food as “almost familiar, but not quite.” What struck me at his most recent restaurant, Café Altro Paradiso, was “the inverse relationship between prettiness and deliciousness.” (What I ate was unpretty and highly delicious.) In retrospect, nothing I wrote captured the qualities that made the food compelling. I latched on to visual style because I couldn’t figure out how to explain why the flavors grabbed me the way they did. After spending some time at Flora Bar, which Mr. Mattos opened in October, I’ve started to think that whatever it is that sets his food apart is something you can’t see. It’s a kind of cooking that’s almost invisible. Flora Bar is inside the Met Breuer museum, Marcel Breuer’s blunt and muscular stack of granite and concrete on Madison Avenue in the 70s, regarded as a masterpiece of the brutalist style. “The taste for its disconcertingly top-heavy, inverted pyramidal mass grows on one slowly,” the architecture critic for The New York Times, Ada Louise Huxtable, wrote in 1966, “like a taste for olives or warm beer.” The food at Flora Bar is much easier to like than warm beer. Under the direction of Jake Nemmers, the executive chef, it comes out of the kitchen in a series of tidily formal circles and squares. The rough edges of the cooking at Altro Paradiso and Estela have been refined, which makes it even more astonishing when the flavors come at you out of nowhere. A simple red disc on a white plate, Flora Bar’s tuna tartare isn’t like any I’ve had before; it pops with toasted flax seeds and crunches with fried shallots, neither of which hides the clean, cold taste of chopped yellowfin tuna. Flora Bar does not quite reinvent tuna tartare the way Estela reinvents beef tartare, but it comes closer than you’d think was possible. Steak comes with béarnaise and beet hunks. The beets look a little wrinkled, like prunes, and have an uncannily focused flavor. The béarnaise is silky and light on the herbs. The steak looks like steak, sliced. It is tender, and the flavor goes on and on as you chew, yet it doesn’t have the meat-locker stink of dry-aged beef. Something must have happened to make it so extraordinary, but the answer is not visible. (The beef has been given, among other treatments, a surreptitious marination in fish sauce.) How can a shrimp cocktail hold any surprises? Well, there’s the price, $29, which may be a record. But then there’s the astonishingly fine flavor and texture of the blue shrimp themselves, glossy and appealingly slippery on a bed of ice pebbles. They’re terrific, and so is their dark, uncloying cocktail sauce. Note the name. Flora Bar is, when you get down to it, less a restaurant than a wine bar. The plates are almost all small; even the steak, which could pass as a main course, is a far cry from a steakhouse portion. Flora Bar is not trying to be a utilitarian cafe for museum patrons who knocked themselves out taking in Kerry James Marshall’s show upstairs and now want a cheap, filling meal. That job goes to Flora Coffee next door, where you can get sandwiches and pastries during the day. The wine list at Flora Bar is about as exhaustive as any artist’s career retrospective. It contains multitudes, and in three visits, I barely scratched the surface. And I left the shelves and shelves of tempting, knowledgeably chosen spirits mostly untouched, apart from the slug of gin that went into my very soothing Tuxedo No. 2 cocktail. As wine bars go, it’s somewhat stiff. The service can be punctilious in a way that I imagine is meant to appeal to the Upper East Sider, but fans of Estela (and there are many Upper East Siders in that group) may find it slightly off-putting. Or Mr. Mattos and his business partner, Thomas Carter, may just be trying to live up to the space. It’s an exceptionally dramatic one, with marble surfaces and banquettes of dark leather and windows the size of billboards that look out on Breuer’s bridge across the moat below Madison Avenue. A sculpture garden when this building still housed the Whitney Museum of American Art, the moat is now an outdoor extension for Flora Bar. I miss the art, but the tables look inviting enough to make me come back when the weather warms up. The menu is part tapas, part sashimi and part something else. On the tapas side, we have wonderfully crunchy croquetas with a soft core of warm raclette, pink shavings of jamón Ibérico, and a plate of anchovies, three cured in oil and three in brine. The quality is impeccable if you can get over paying $18 for six anchovies. I couldn’t. Representing sashimi, there is shimmering raw seafood, some of it on or under squares of nori. You’re meant to treat the nori like a tortilla. A month ago, the filling in this taco was raw scallops and a salty streak of plum paste, and I was quietly happy. When I went back, the nori covered sticky raw red shrimp and sea urchin, and I went completely giddy. It took me a minute to warm up to another raw dish, the lobster crudo. Raw lobster is not something you naturally want to cuddle up with. Here it is chopped with shiso and molded into a disc, ready to be swabbed in a soft-spoken mayonnaise. It’s refined and almost comforting. As for something else, you tell me how to characterize raclette and golden slices of rutabaga over a thin, buttery tart shell, or an omelet that is in fact cooked in a thin disc, inverted on to the plate runny-side down, and then topped with spoonfuls of hackleback caviar, firm trout roe and crème fraîche. There’s a fine line between simple and dull, and one or two dishes fell on the wrong side. Stracciatella with lemon peel and cubes of fennel struck me as an ordinary burrata salad traveling under an alias. Halibut with wild mushrooms was no more than the sum of its parts, although they were very good parts. Natasha Pickowicz’s desserts sound safe but can be daring. Mandarin sorbet in a kind of cradle made of coconut was served with a yuzu sauce so sour it made me sit up straight. After the initial shock, I loved it. If I’d expected the parfait of chocolate and amarena cherries to be a layered dessert served in a tall glass, like other parfaits, I was wrong. This was cherry-flavored chocolate, as dense as ganache, and served in the shape of, you guessed it, a disc.","Tuna tartare; blue shrimp with cocktail sauce; potato croquettes; purple endive, pecans and blue cheese; rutabaga and raclette tart; steak with beets and béarnaise; chocolate parfait with amarena cherries. $9 to $35, although a seafood platter and some caviar items blast through the $40 ceiling."
97,The Odeon,1 star,"Dec. 27, 2016",Pete Wells,TriBeCa,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/dining/the-odeon-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/dining/the-odeon-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Why do I keep going back to the Odeon? It’s not because people on Condé Nast expense accounts have returned to this TriBeCa landmark with the bones of a brasserie, even though it’s nice to know that some editors still have time for lunch. Nor is it because Lena Dunham had the neon sign on West Broadway replicated in blazing-orange ink on her body this year, either, although I appreciate how neatly the sign’s progress from the front cover of “Bright Lights, Big City” in 1984 to Ms. Dunham’s backside encapsulates the recent cultural history of New York. Nostalgia is not the lure for me. The Odeon was opened in 1980 by Lynn Wagenknecht; Keith McNally, whom she would later marry; and his brother, Brian. I had not moved to New York yet when the surfaces of its downstairs bathrooms provided cocaine runways for some “Saturday Night Live” cast members and a troop of art-market players and fixers. And besides, knowing that by the end of the decade drug abuse would kill at least two famous regulars, John Belushi and Jean-Michel Basquiat, makes it hard to see much glamour in that white-powdered scene. I don’t go to the Odeon for the last word in culinary fashions, which were part of the package under the first chef, Patrick Clark. Mr. Clark had cooked under Michel Guérard, one of the founders of nouvelle cuisine, and he was one of the earliest American chefs to apply its principles to homegrown ingredients. Moira Hodgson, who during her brief stint as restaurant critic for The Times in 1980 may have been one of the only people who went to the Odeon to eat, was impressed enough by dishes like “médaillons of tender veal on a green pool of puréed watercress artfully decorated by leeks, string beans, carrots and celery” that she gave the restaurant two stars. (It got the same rating in its last full review, by Bryan Miller in 1989.) The kitchen at the Odeon, in the hands of Vincent Nargi for more than a decade, retrenched long ago to a comfortably broken-in lineup of French and American standards. So when I go, I often start with oysters on ice or with frisée and lardons in warmed vinaigrette, even if I wonder why the poached egg that completes the salad is optional. In cold weather, I ask for a scalding crock of French onion soup, lifting my spoon higher and higher in the steam until the thread of melted Gruyère finally snaps. Anything out of the ordinary I approach with caution. “Spicy chicken dumplings” turn out to be Buffalo chicken wontons with a blue cheese dipping sauce. This is every bit as wrong as it sounds. I ate one with the grim consolation of knowing I’d gotten exactly what I deserved. The pressed octopus appetizer sounds risky, too, but it is good, tender and lightly charred with some chickpeas and preserved lemon and a smooth sauce of leeks. It’s hard to look at the Odeon’s slowly revolving ceiling fans, hanging globe lamps, white tablecloths and burgundy banquettes without the words “steak frites” popping into your head. This is an understandable reaction, and a smart one. The steak, a New York strip, is of high quality, and the fries are exactly what you’re picturing, skinny and golden and salty in their paper-lined metal cups. If the words you hear instead are “moules frites,” you’re still in good shape; the mussels will be fat and fresh, and their saffron-cream sauce will be rich and flavorful, even if the taste of saffron is more of an allusion than an outright statement. Under Ms. Wagenknecht, now the sole owner, the restaurant looks virtually the same as it did when she and the McNallys assembled it, including the Art Deco bar, itself larger than many restaurants. One night, when I’d arrived early, I was waiting there with a fine approximation of a Sazerac when I asked the bartender if there were any main courses I shouldn’t overlook. He thought about it for a while. “The roast chicken is kind of a sleeper,” he finally said. Whether roast chicken qualifies as an underdog is debatable, but the Odeon does a fine job with it and sends it to the table with root vegetables and a simple jus. A better sleeper candidate is the omelet. Who goes to a restaurant for an omelet? I do, if it’s the one at the Odeon, which tastes like real eggs and is a little puffy but never looks as if it is trying out for a role as a balloon in Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Cooking like this is sometimes called comfort food, but I think of the menu and everything else about the Odeon as restorative. The word shares a root with restaurant, a term that goes back to pre-revolutionary France, when aristocrats made a show of their delicate constitutions by sipping health-giving bouillons in public dining rooms. The Odeon doesn’t market itself to neurasthenics on the verge of collapse, but it does go out of its way not to jangle anybody’s nerves. In so many places now, the servers want to know if you have any questions about the menu. (When you don’t, they always seem disappointed.) They want to know if it’s your first time, too, as if special instructions might be required. At the Odeon the servers never ask either question, probably because they assume the answer will be no. They are steady, unexcitable and prompt. Most of all, they don’t seem to need anything from you except your order and eventually your credit card. Once in a while, it’s nice not to be needed. It’s good to know that you don’t have to live up to the chef’s expectations, too. The restaurant world has gone a little crazy lately. Other parts of the world were crazy a long time ago. This is why the Odeon has been hitting the spot for me these past few months. I go there to feel restored, to act sane for a while, and to finish my meal with a crème brûlée that’s exactly what I expect.","Frisée salad; French onion soup; roast chicken; steak frites; moules frites; croque monsieur; hamburger; omelet; chocolate pudding; crème brûlée. Appetizers, $13 to $19; main courses, $23 to $40."
98,Cut by Wolfgang Puck,1 star,"Dec. 20, 2016",Pete Wells,Financial District,"American, Steak Houses",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/dining/cut-by-wolfgang-puck-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/dining/cut-by-wolfgang-puck-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Imagine the restaurant Wolfgang Puck might have opened if he had wafted into New York in the 1980s on warm, mesquite-scented Southern California breezes. In that era, Mr. Puck was a nonstop innovator. He turned the Sunset Strip on to duck-sausage pizzas and other exercises in treating Italian cuisine as a blank slate at Spago. He hipped Santa Monica to Chinese-style fried catfish with Japanese ponzu at Chinois on Main, the kind of crossbreeding we would learn to call Asian fusion. Above all, by the end of the decade, he had shown chefs the way to scrub the starch out of their restaurants and still be taken seriously. All of these ideas would hitch rides to New York sooner or later, but Mr. Puck could have given us a peek into the future of dining if he had come to town in those days. It never happened. Aside from opening a kiosk at Kennedy Airport about a decade ago, he stayed away until September, when he opened a steak-driven restaurant in the financial district. Nothing on the menu at Cut by Wolfgang Puck breaks new ground. It sits on the ground floor of the new Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown, to allow both operations their full, overtaxed names. (There are five other Cut restaurants flung across the world.) The steaks, presented bare, on white plates, are excellent. Appetizers and other dishes are appealing, if a little unfocused. The food is served in rooms whose design, by Strata Architects and Jacques Garcia, appears to have been lost in the mail for a decade or so. It is a new restaurant that already feels dated. To the right of the glass doors on Church Street is an entryway framed by fold upon fold of shimmery red fabric, suggesting that you are about to walk into a room full of elegantly debauched vampires. Instead you find hotel guests and solitary men in an awkward lounge illuminated by slashing bolts of red neon lightning; it’s how you’d imagine a sexy downtown bar if you’d never been downtown, gone to a bar or had sex. To the left of the entrance is the main dining room, its rear wall given entirely over to a diptych by a young, fast-climbing artist named Alex Israel. Each half of the work features text in sans-serif block capitals, in the manner of Barbara Kruger, but instead of spooky aphorisms about power, we get cheese-ball romantic comedy dialogue superimposed on pink fireworks: “‘Sometimes you know it in your head,’ the chef whispered.” “‘Sometimes you feel it in your stomach,’ she smiled, buzzed.” Sometimes you gag in your mouth, the critic sighed. Early in the meal, a short glass vase arrives at the table loaded with Parmesan-crusted breadsticks about a yard long. They always seem to be aimed straight at my face, as if challenging me to a duel. They do taste good, though, and the sharp, creamy gougères that show up next are terrific. While we’re looking at our menus, somebody stands next to the table holding a white china platter arrayed with cuts of Wagyu beef wrapped in black napkins. Each hunk of muscle is pointed out and described appreciatively. There is less ceremony when you buy a diamond at Tiffany. Some pride in these steaks is understandable, particularly in the case of the Japanese beef. Imported from Miyazaki Prefecture, this is true Wagyu, rarely offered in American restaurants. It is rich in a way that’s hard to fathom, the melting streaks of fat cascading from the flesh onto your tongue. It is sold at $25 an ounce. I can’t stand pointlessly expensive luxuries, but this one has a point. The beef is so rich that a table of curious diners for whom the price is not an automatic deal breaker might share a six-ounce steak, the smallest cut offered. I am less inclined to splurge on the hybrid Wagyu raised in Idaho, with its broader, less graceful flavor and noticeably less marbling. Next to the genuine article, it tastes like a compromise. Of course there are normal American steaks, too, from three sources. One night, I ran a controlled study on two of the rib-eyes, both of them cornfed. While I was taking apart a steak from Kansas that had been aged for 28 days in vacuum-sealed plastic, a guest ate one raised in Illinois that had been dry aged for 35 days. The contrast kept us trading slices all night. Mine was chewier, more purple, a little more concentrated, with a potent red-meat flavor. The other exemplified the old-fashioned American ideal: soft, pinkish, mild and shiny with rendered fat. Cut uses a technique for cooking its varieties of beef that I strongly endorse. Steaks are grilled over wood and charcoal and then blasted under a broiler running at 1,200 degrees, roughly hot enough to melt aluminum. The meat arrives with a textured, almost brittle outer bark, like the crust on a really great loaf of sourdough. Old-guard steakhouses are losing their juice these days because well-connected chefs like Mr. Puck can often buy better, more flavorful beef. Other ingredients at Cut are enviable, too. The tender and herbaceous double chops of lamb come from Elysian Fields Farm in Pennsylvania, and two preparations of bay scallops out of Nantucket popped up, near the start of their brief, glorious season in November. Very little about the menu says steakhouse aside from the steaks. Cut is not a wedge-salad joint. The executive chef, Raymond Weber, who comes to New York from the Cut in Dubai, makes elaborate new dishes alongside vintage ones from the first Cut restaurant, in Beverly Hills. Impressively tender and flavorful veal tongue with artichokes and white beans was served at the original from the start, and it is worth repeating. So is the lobster and crab Louis, the chilled shellfish set over a coaster of panna cotta pointedly spiked with horseradish. A few dishes fail to land their punches. A bone-marrow flan, meant to be spread on toasted brioche with a savory mushroom marmalade, was very delicate but didn’t taste much like marrow. Steamed salmon with snow peas and spicy soy sauce reminded me of all the perfunctory, umpteenth-generation Asian fusion dishes that made everybody lose interest in the genre. The pastry chef is Zairah Molina, another Puck veteran. Like the rest of the kitchen, her department can overcomplicate its plates. But she always puts a good idea at the center, like the crisp membrillo-stuffed fritters dusted with cardamom sugar next to a spoonful of kabocha ice cream that she was serving last month. Except for the art, nothing about Cut is less than good. But a lot of it isn’t very inspired, either. The Wolfgang Puck in charge here is the proficient overseer of high-end hotel amenities, not the chef who crossed boundaries and defined an earlier era. If 80 percent of success is just showing up, as Woody Allen has said, a good chunk of the remainder is arriving at the right time.","Lobster and crab Louis cocktail; veal tongue; whole roasted Dover sole; double lamb chops; steaks; doughnuts and cream; butterscotch chocolate bar. Appetizers, $18 to $25; main courses, $29 to $150."
99,Aska,3 star,"Dec. 6, 2016",Pete Wells,Williamsburg,Scandinavian,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/dining/aska-review-brooklyn.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/dining/aska-review-brooklyn.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"One of the 20 or so courses served to me the first time I ate at the new Aska in Brooklyn was a cluster of nasturtium leaves, next to a bundle of burned herb sprigs and flower stalks, tied up with a string. It looked pretty and pagan at the same time, like a page from a Martha Stewart lifestyle magazine for witches. This plate was more than just photogenic, though. Wrapped inside the scorched bouquet was a langoustine, very gently cooked to a soft pink. It tasted of herbs and ashes. There were blots of chamomile jelly and a langoustine-head sauce on the plate, too, and when I rubbed a bit of the orange-pink lobster around in there, the combination of flower and shellfish flavors was a complete surprise, extraordinary in ways I’d never imagined before. One of the rewards of working as a restaurant critic for a few years is getting to see chefs growing into their ambitions. On my watch, few have done this as dramatically and successfully as Aska’s chef, Fredrik Berselius. Aska, which opened beneath the ribs of the Williamsburg Bridge in July, is his third restaurant. And with each fresh incarnation, his cooking has taken a leap forward. His first, in 2012, was a part-time operation called Frej, which shared its space in Williamsburg with a ramen outfit and a coffee bar. Its five-course menu was a great deal at $45, and Mr. Berselius, who was born and raised in Sweden, was already showing a gift for delicately naturalistic compositions in the New Nordic style. But some of the flavors were tentative, like underexposed photographs. Mr. Berselius fleshed out some of those sketches when he turned Frej into a full-time restaurant, called Aska. The menus were longer and a little more expensive. Some dishes were too subdued and others were just off-putting; I may still have a bit of a coagulated-pig’s-blood cracker stuck between my teeth. The pleasures, however, were numerous and original enough to persuade me that Aska was easily a two-star restaurant. Less than two years in, though, Mr. Berselius closed Aska, saying that he had outgrown the site. New York’s real estate and construction industries being what they are, it took him more than two years to find and then renovate the new space, a warehouse from the Civil War era about a mile south. He installed a bar and lounge in the basement, a patio in the courtyard and a moody main dining area and open kitchen in the soaring, big-boned room at street level. Mr. Berselius must have used some of that time to bear down in the kitchen, too, because his new tasting menus vault past the ones at the old Aska. They are longer, and much more expensive, at $145 for 10 courses and $215 for 19 courses, service included. But the flavors don’t hide anymore; they have an insistent presence, and their dynamics are beautifully modulated from one dish to the next. You will still be eating things you probably didn’t think you wanted to eat. A new pig’s blood creation has replaced the cracker, and this time it leaves a memory I’m happy to be haunted by. The blood lends a mineral tang to an appealingly tender traditional Swedish pancake set under rose petals, cherries and a sweet-sour rose hip jelly. It looks, and even tastes, a little like a thin chocolate cake. (Blood imitates chocolate again in a little truffle that shows up at the end of the night.) Reindeer lichen, another ingredient that didn’t entirely win me over last time around, is back. I may never learn to love the way a clump of it feels in my mouth — like a cross between kataifi pastry and a hairball — but I loved the chanterelles and their broth that surrounded the lichen and the swoosh of cream, cooked down to a caramelized sweetness, that was hiding beneath. Mr. Berselius is the rare chef who thinks like an artist and gets away with it. His Nature Boy act took a turn toward the mystical on a recent night as he delivered a dish to the table; he recalled seeing a small flock of sheep in the Catskills, amid hills overrun with bedstraw. He said he wanted to bring the two together, which he accomplished by placing lambs’ hearts under burning bedstraw until the hearts collapse into ashes. These ashes are then scattered over sunchoke cream mixed with pickled sunchokes. The pairing of bitter cinders and sweet sunchokes was fascinating, and reminded me of baking chocolate grated over melted white chocolate. But one or two tastes were enough for me; incinerated heart may be better expressed as a one- or two-bite snack, like the grape-size puff of pommes soufflées, topped with wonderfully smoky flounder roe. Part of the program at Aska asks us to look again at nature, and to try ingredients that aren’t sold in any supermarket. Mr. Berselius does impressive things with more ordinary materials, though, like the slabs of scallop and their dark-coral roe with elderflower-scented brown butter spooned over the top, or a simple and remarkably good stick of roasted king crab leg with tiny potatoes, cooked almost al dente. The procession of plants and seafood is usually broken up by some red meat right before dessert. Once, it was dry-aged beef bathed in rendered beef fat, tasting the way the air at Peter Luger smells: hypnotic. More recently, there were a few deep-red slices of wild wood pigeon, brought in from Scotland; a very fine thing on a chilly, windy fall night. After that came an amazing sorbet of raw milk served with little strawberries preserved during the summer, along with some fermented juice on its way to becoming wine. This was followed by birch ice cream under white slices of raw pine mushrooms and woodruff leaves, an odd, herbaceous and unexpectedly stirring combination. In my tour of duty, I’ve eaten a number of dishes that were supposed to represent a walk in the woods, but none came as close to capturing the forest’s aromas as this one. The service is warm and unpretentious, even down to earth. Guidance through the wine list, which has some fashionably esoteric choices alongside some excellent, familiar ones, isn’t quite as fluid as at the old Aska, but the servers know how to listen and respond. Their tone is especially welcoming in the basement lounge, where you can sprawl on a couch or unwind at a small table over a martini that’s been Nordicized with Icelandic birch liqueur and syrup distilled from prehistoric amber. The à la carte menu downstairs offers a fantastic cured pork shoulder in mushroom vinaigrette, or red-leaf lettuce leaves dotted with a mash of smoked hake that tastes like unusually good gefilte fish. These and other dishes may not be the makings of a filling weeknight meal, but they do provide a fine, low-cost introduction to the Aska worldview. Mr. Berselius has a lyrical sensibility, though it seems to have abandoned him when it came time to design the main dining room. The tablecloths and the ceiling are black, which makes most of the room disappear. When I was there, most of the tables were taken by couples seated side by side, facing the open kitchen. It looked as if they were at a cabaret, waiting for the show to start. By the third hour of the night, I was restless and conscious of the passage of time; I kept expecting the cooks to do something, maybe sing a little Sondheim. The atmosphere at a lot of tasting-menu restaurants can feel a little inert. This tends not to matter very much to most customers, few of whom are going to put a $215 19-course menu into their regular rotation. What they want is a delicious, memorable night that takes them to places they haven’t been before. Aska does all of that, and throws in a little blood and poetry.","Set menu, with no choices, in the dining room. In the bar, smoked pork shoulder; lettuce with smoked hake; matjes herring with potato; pancake with gooseberries and salted beef. $145 for 10 courses, and $215 for 19 courses in the dining room; $4 to $16 in the bar. (All prices include service.)"
100,Bad Saint,3 star,"Nov. 29, 2016",Pete Wells,Washington D.C.,Philippine,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/dining/bad-saint-dc-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/dining/bad-saint-dc-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"WASHINGTON — I have now spent roughly twice as many hours standing on the sidewalk outside Bad Saint as I have spent inside eating its Filipino food. This is not an ideal ratio, but at least I had company. Bad Saint, in this city’s Columbia Heights neighborhood, has never taken reservations since it began operating in 2015. The line that begins forming on 11th Street at least two hours before the doors open at 5:30 p.m. is by now as much a part of the experience of having dinner at Bad Saint as hanging out in the stadium parking lot is a part of the experience of seeing a Phish concert. Repeat customers are common and easy to spot. They’re the ones who have brought folding chairs, bottles of water, boxes of wine, volumes of Murakami and Ferrante, and bug spray to keep away the mosquitoes who also like dining at Bad Saint. Blankets appear as the weather gets chilly; in scheduling my meals for this review, I watched the approach of winter as anxiously as covered-wagon pioneers eyed the clouds over the Donner Pass. To pass the time before I was allowed to eat Bad Saint’s extraordinary Filipino food, I chatted with Blelvis, the Black Elvis, who challenged me to name a song of Mr. Presley’s he did not know, and felt mildly ashamed of myself when I stumped him with “Froggy Went a-Courtin’.” I tried not to eavesdrop as a woman gave her friend a year-by-year account of her decades-long marriage and the affair that took it down. I met a paid line-stander who said that waiting outside a restaurant for three to four hours paled beside his greatest achievement: camping out in front of the Supreme Court for more than a week on behalf of a client who wanted to hear the oral arguments in the same-sex marriage case. Absorbing as these intervals were, I felt relief and joy each time the four bamboo blinds would be raised in unison at 5:30 by four servers, one of whom would then unlock the door and start filling the 24 seats. Genevieve Villamora, the partner who most often handles this task, has compared it to a game of Tetris. The largest tables hold just four people, as some parties of five or six have learned to their regret. All the other seats are jimmied into blind alleys and passageways around the open kitchen. Once they are all taken, Ms. Villamora takes names and numbers for openings later in the night. With a woven Filipino mat on the wall and light filtering down from geometric slashes in a ceiling of oxidized-steel tiles, the restaurant has a certain compulsory intimacy. It’s easy to strike up a conversation with somebody, although it won’t necessarily be the somebody you arrived with. Seated at a shallow ledge in the back one night, I stood up to talk to one of my dining partners, who was three seats away. The arrangement had a cocktail-party charm until I was asked to return to my seat; I was blocking the path to the restroom. Clearly, Bad Saint was built to make the best of its scarce square footage, not to handle the pressure of being one of Washington’s most sought-after restaurants. Now it has to do both, because the food that Tom Cunanan and his cooks prepare under columns of wok smoke is richly compelling no matter how many prior run-ins you’ve had with Filipino food. Most people with a glancing knowledge of the cuisine have tried an adobo, a garlic-laden stew braised in soy sauce that’s been soured with vinegar. But Bad Saint’s adobo of tender squid is still astonishing, its sauce deepened and darkened by squid ink and given a slow, lingering burn by long peppers. The oxtails and bok choi stewed in peanut sauce with an intense undercurrent of shrimp and anchovies is amazing whether this is your first encounter with kare-kare or your hundredth. I love bitter melon, but even the skeptics I’d brought with me were won over by Bad Saint’s stir-fry, in which the vegetable’s aggressive tendencies are offset by fermented black beans, softened by eggs and sweetened by a topcoat of fried shallots. My guests were even more dubious about pancit canton, a Filipino lo mein that can be reassuringly bland. As interpreted by Mr. Cunanan, with lots of royal trumpet mushrooms and a steady thrum of Calabrian chiles, it is startlingly good. Ms. Villamora and her partner in the restaurant, Nick Pimentel, have Filipino heritage but were born and raised in the United States. (The restaurant’s name is derived from St. Malo, La., the first Filipino settlement in this country.) Mr. Cunanan was born in the Philippines and has called his mother his main inspiration in the kitchen. Some of the cooking has a homey simplicity, like the arroz caldo, chicken in a ginger-laced rice porridge that can be cranked up with a dab of red chile paste or left to its own, soothing charms. In other dishes, Mr. Cunanan stretches tradition to wrap it around local ingredients. In the Philippines, laing would be made by stewing dried taro leaves in coconut milk. At Bad Saint, the leaves are kale, braised to a velvety tenderness and swaddled in Chesapeake crab meat. This laing is so luxuriously flavorful, I can’t get it out of my head, and I don’t want to. If you don’t get into the first seating, you might spend the cocktail hour checking the screen on your phone while you wait a few doors down at Room 11, also owned in part by Mr. Pimentel. Once you gain entry, you can have one of the Filipino-influenced mixed drinks like the Chili Manilli (spicier than I wanted with this food) or a home-brewed green mango soda (lovely). Bad Saint carried about three wines when it opened. Now the selection is almost long enough to be called a list, and is wisely centered on lively, aromatic bottles like a red grenache from Tarragona or a still white from Catalonia that is a blend of xarello and riesling. The beers are even more esoteric and reflect this restaurant’s easy assurance that people come here to be turned on to something new. I especially admire Bad Saint’s refusal to translate Filipino food into the European-derived idioms of fine dining. When the servers say the dishes are served family style, they mean it. There’s no artfully blank space on the plates, no Abstract Expressionist smears of sauce. The food goes from the wok to the plate, and it is relentlessly delicious. Because the cuisine of the Philippines is so closely tied to home cooking, it’s been hard to imagine what a three-star Filipino restaurant would look like. Now I know that it looks like Bad Saint.",Ginisang ampalaya (bitter melon); adobong dilaw (cauliflower and squash stew); laing (kale in coconut milk); kinilaw na pugita (octopus with potatoes and green olives); adobong pusit (squid adobo); sinigang (stewed branzino); arroz caldo (rice porridge with chicken); kare-kare (oxtails in peanut sauce). Prices $10 to $36.
101,Fish Cheeks,1 star,"Nov. 22, 2016",Pete Wells,NoHo,Thai,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/dining/fish-cheeks-review-restaurant-noho.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/dining/fish-cheeks-review-restaurant-noho.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"In the early days of Thai cuisine in the United States, when pad Thai and spring rolls were exotic treats, Americans fell hard for the interlocking tastes of lime, fish sauce, chiles and herbs. Over the years, that love has grown lukewarm. Many of the restaurants weren’t very good to begin with, and watered-down, sloppy Americanized versions of dishes from central Thailand were the only Thai food many Americans knew. When a reformist tide of traditional Thai food began rolling in about a decade ago, it was led by restaurants specializing in the cooking of the north and northeast regions. Now, when thrill chasers tell you about Thai meals that realigned their taste buds, they’re likely to be talking about Kris Yenbamroong’s organ- and chile-laden cooking at his two Night & Market restaurants in Los Angeles, or Johnny Monis’s sticky-rice-centric set menus at Little Serow in Washington, D.C., or Andy Ricker’s deep repertoire of Isan dishes at the far-flung outposts of Pok Pok. This northward expansion has brought eye-opening discoveries. It’s also made it painfully obvious how desperately the central and southern Thai food available to Americans needs an overhaul, the way the last shirt I bought made it clear that I could use a haircut. All of this is to explain why I’m so interested in Fish Cheeks, a new restaurant in NoHo that focuses on traditional seafood dishes from around Thailand. The menu isn’t particularly adventurous or long by Thai standards, with just five appetizers and nine family-style main courses. Service is still in the eager-but-wobbly toddler stage, and the cocktail list is not so much a minefield as a box of live grenades. But the cooking is fresh, vivid and intense. The kitchen is in the hands of Chat Suansilphong and his brother, Ohm, who cooked at Nahm in Bangkok under its erudite and painstaking chef, David Thompson. Fish Cheeks doesn’t aspire to the worldwide recognition Nahm has won. But the neighbors seem to be enjoying it, filing under the awning of fish-scale shingles to take their places on wooden chairs painted blue, yellow and hot pink. On the black-and-white letter board that lists the daily specials is a note proclaiming “No pad Thai zone.” This may be true, but it gives the impression that Fish Cheeks is going to take you on a wild ride careening down the unmarked back roads of Thai cuisine. This isn’t quite accurate. The Suansilphongs, in fact, serve tom yum, the sour and spicy soup that can be found at almost every Thai restaurant in the land; often it’s watery and acrid. The version here hums with fresh galangal, lime leaves and lemongrass. Shrimp and knobby mushrooms simmer in a broth that gets extra body from milk, a twist I’ve never seen before but one I approve of. It could be spicier, but the use of bird’s-eye chiles is far from shy. Woon sen, the transparent noodles that are almost as widespread as tom yum, are baked with shrimp and pork belly in a sweet, Chinese-influenced casserole. From southern Thailand comes a lush and complex crab curry, rich from coconut milk and hypnotically aromatic from freshly ground spices. Nam tok, a northeastern salad of grilled meat with green herbs and shallots, is another familiar sight, but the pork is more flavorful than usual, with a deeply satisfying char on the edges. And I wish every Thai restaurant could make fried chicken with shallot rings and a classic sweet red-chile dipping sauce that is as engaging as the appetizer version at Fish Cheeks. If you’ve ever eaten a Thai seafood dish that was undermined by the shallow-pond flavor of farmed fish, you’ll understand why I hope the Suansilphongs keep using local bluefish. In one recurring special, they steam a big skin-on fillet and serve it in a pot that bubbles as it lands on the table. The broth is mild on its own, but the spicy green nam jim sauce and the fresh bird’s-eye chiles liberally tossed over the top are exactly the kinds of aggressive partners that bluefish enjoys sparring with. Bird’s-eye chiles also brought a pleasantly psychedelic level of heat to raw butterflied shrimp flash-marinated in fish sauce, lime and garlic. The dish turns up at Somtum Der, among other local restaurants, and the version here is forceful enough to suggest that the brothers have faith that people on Bond Street can take a little pain. For the ones who like to walk on the mild side, there is a very likable branzino that has been fried to a golden crackle with garlic. On the side is a dish of fish sauce, which you should dump on top. It’s almost laughably uncomplicated, and while I wouldn’t try to make a meal of it alone, it’s useful as a spacer between more intense bites. I would recommend Fish Cheeks even more loudly if the cooking had been more consistent. Pad cha, a stir-fry of mixed seafood with wild ginger, little eggplants and grapelike clusters of green peppercorns, was bracingly intense one night. It was unremarkable a week later, and green-lipped mussels in a perfectly good galangal and lemongrass broth had been cooked so furiously they were rubbery. On the short list of mixed drinks, I didn’t object to the iced tea with Cognac, which tasted like a Southeast Asian milk punch. The old-fashioned was bitter in ways that didn’t help it make its case, though, and the mango sticky-rice cocktail simply made me wish I could have mango sticky rice. There’s just one dessert on the menu, a Thai tea panna cotta. Servers usually mentioned it offhandedly, as if it didn’t make much difference whether you ordered it or not. This turned out to be the case. But nobody judges Thai restaurants by their desserts. What comes before is what counts, and Fish Cheeks had won me over by the end of the meal.

102,TsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie,1 star,"Nov. 15, 2016",Pete Wells,Union Square,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/dining/tsurutontan-udon-noodle-brasserie-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/dining/tsurutontan-udon-noodle-brasserie-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The news reports filled the city with gloom. From out of a big Manhattan real estate firm had come a change that few locals expected or wanted. Reactions were apocalyptic. There was a shared fear that we were moving in the wrong direction, that the values of our community were being trampled by dark, hostile forces. I speak, of course, of Union Square Cafe’s losing its lease after 30 years, when the landlord decided in 2014 to drastically raise the rent for the space on East 16th Street. Danny Meyer’s first restaurant, for many years one of the most beloved in New York, moved out. Writers and internet commenters saw it as another step toward a Manhattan in which independent and worthwhile restaurants can’t make it. It seemed likely that the proposed $650,000-a-year rent would scare off any business that wasn’t part of a chain. That part was true. But the chain that moved in turned out to be more interesting than another franchise selling lattes in paper cups or burgers in paper wrappers. TsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie is the first United States location for an operation that owns 13 restaurants in Japan. It’s now easier to find a ramen shop in Manhattan than a mailbox, but udon specialists are rare. As far as I can tell, TsuruTonTan is the only one that mixes, kneads, rolls and cuts the dough for these long, pale wheat noodles on site. They have almost no flavor and are the opposite of delicate. But their consistency, the way they slide past your lips and spring back against your teeth, provides a distinct physical pleasure that will surprise anybody who has had only shaggy, overcooked udon that starts breaking apart before you have a chance to chew it. This is the rare restaurant where the servers’ explanations of how to order is actually helpful. “With any of our udons, you can choose thick or thin noodles,” I was told the first time I ate at TsuruTonTan. Thick ones are suggested for the hot soups, and thin for the chilled udon with dipping sauce on the side. “You can also order a large udon, which just means extra noodles, for the same price.” I liked this place already, and I didn’t change my mind after learning I wasn’t allowed to take home leftovers. This rule is apparently not meant to encourage customers to act as if they’re in the Nathan’s hot dog eating contest; our server said the restaurant just hadn’t found takeout cartons it was happy with. Following instructions, I ordered my chilled udon with thin noodles, about the diameter of bucatini. In TsuruTonTan’s uni udon, they were slicked down with a majestically rich sauce of sea urchin and dashi. In the zaru udon, they had been wound in a loose figure eight like yarn and placed on ice chips. Before I got to eat them, I had a job to do, mashing sesame seeds with a birch pestle and stirring them together into a soy dipping sauce with scallions and ginger. It’s a summer dish. I responded to the cold splash of udon in my mouth with an appreciative shiver in October. Under the direction of the chef, Tomoya Tamaru, the menu switch-hits between soups with this kind of lean Japanese purity and more zaftig concoctions. In the first category are the soups with sliced duck breast or the one with Wagyu rib-eye shavings slowly warming on the surface of a carefully balanced broth. Both broths are built on a deeply savory and focused dashi, although the rib-eye shavings were a little too hard to locate in a dish costing $19. The broths, savory with fish and seaweed, did not taste fatty or leave me with that sensation of having swallowed a boiled football that I sometimes get from ramen. On Team Zaftig, we have bowls like “truffle crème with mushroom,” a full-on swoon in which Parmigiano-Reggiano, cream and truffle oil swirl together into a kind of Japanese Alfredo. The broth is so intensely creamy I couldn’t finish it, but that’s no sin in an udon restaurant. TsuruTonTan’s Japanese curry is more sauce than soup, too. The thick liquid is not especially spicy, but it is very good with a tonkatsu-style pork cutlet, tempura shrimp and shaved beef in the $23 “curry deluxe.” I was less taken by the mentaiko broth; the scoop of spicy cod roe in the middle of the bowl didn’t save the soup from tasting a little heavy-handed. In Japan, like most udon specialists, TsuruTonTan mostly sticks to its noodles. To woo New York, the company whipped up a bunch of new donburi and appetizers such as spicy tuna cones, heavily accessorized sashimi, and fried chunks of chicken in a tartar sauce the color of borscht. Rather than describing each individually, I’ll share a handy method I came up with for dealing with all of them at once. Unfold the menu and place it on the table so that you see the noodle dishes. The reverse side, with the appetizers and donburi, will be face down. Now, never turn the menu over. If you have accidentally learned the name of a dish printed there, don’t say it out loud. Even when TsuruTonTan is very good, you never forget that it’s a chain. But if you leave aside the stuff it shouldn’t be serving anyway, it’s a very impressive chain. Soups come in heavy, gorgeous ceramic bowls made by Japanese potteries that have access to intensely colorful glazes. The larger ones are big enough to give a puppy a bath in. Servers are well versed in the menu, paying close attention when somebody at the table told them about a food allergy. Although they’re busy when the place fills up, they take time to greet customers on the way in and the way out, and they’ll guide you to the restroom as if they were working in a much more formal restaurant. Several times, I got to watch people who had not realized where they were sitting suddenly recognize the bones of Union Square Cafe. The space has lost its old dowdiness and gained an energetic horizontality that makes a virtue of the low ceilings, though the design doesn’t do much to dampen the noise. The crowd is different now, of course, with a lot of young Japanese noodle enthusiasts. As I looked around, the anger directed at the remorseless workings of the rental market seemed misplaced. The engines of New York real estate may plow under the past, but they also clear the ground for new opportunities. A far more direct threat to the values of the New York dining community is the snarling hostility to immigrants now at loose in the country. As a restaurant critic, I am very concerned about where this will lead. New Yorkers have been told lately that they live in a bubble, but it is a large bubble with room for people from many other countries and cultures. Real estate shapes the city’s food scene, but a longstanding openness to different ways of cooking and living, a curiosity about Yemeni roast lamb or Oaxacan mole or Japanese noodle soup, defines it.","Udon: duck, kitsune, nabeyaki, Tsuruton curry deluxe, truffle crème with mushroom, uni, zaru.

103,Paowalla,2 star,"Nov. 8, 2016",Pete Wells,SoHo,Indian,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/dining/paowalla-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/dining/paowalla-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"After Tabla, Floyd Cardoz doesn’t owe New York anything. In his 11 years as the chef of that restaurant across from Madison Square Park, he used the language of Indian cuisine to say things we had never heard before. A native of Mumbai, he showed us that the Indian spice cabinet can perform many other tricks besides curry. Upstairs at Tabla, he helped end the era in which the fine-dining wing of the restaurant business operated as a club to which cuisines of non-European descent need not apply. At the bottom of the winding staircase, in the little lounge known as Bread Bar, he showed us that a serious chef could pull off a more affordable and accessible menu without pandering. Restaurants that change people’s perceptions don’t come along very often, though. So in assessing Mr. Cardoz’s new restaurant, Paowalla, it’s more productive to view the things it does well (and there are a lot) as a bonus, without getting caught up in the ways in which it doesn’t quite live up to Tabla. The next two jobs Mr. Cardoz held in New York after Tabla closed in 2010 took him away from Indian cooking. In theory, North End Grill and White Street could have set him free. In practice, neither gave free rein to his talents. Luckily for him and for us, he is his own boss at Paowalla, and he’s cooking Indian food again. Reaching into his back catalog, Mr. Cardoz is serving some dishes and even a couple of cocktails, like the mind-clearing cucumber-gin highball called the Kachumber Cooler, that are flashbacks to Tabla and Bread Bar. He found a corner spot in SoHo that used to be an Italian restaurant. The wood-fueled pizza oven in the middle of the dining room was a stroke of luck, fitting in with the theme that also led to the name. Paowalla means bread seller, and breads lead the menu. They come in many shapes and sizes, from the familiar standards like naans and rotis to more exotic forms. Pao are yeasted dinner rolls, a Portuguese-derived specialty of Goa with a slight, charming sweetness. (If you grew up with Parker house rolls, you want to drop a pat of butter on them.) The white spirals called tingmo are Tibetan steamed buns, which Mr. Cardoz treats like cinnamon rolls with chile paste where the cinnamon should be. Rosemary naan had almost no rosemary flavor, and naan stuffed with minced bacon wasn’t as irresistible as it should have been. But the kulcha filled with Cheddar was improbably wonderful. I understand why Mr. Cardoz has put the breads at the top of the batting order on his menu. But I think his policy of automatically serving them first, with nothing but chutneys to accompany them, is a mistake. These breads deserve to be on the table in the company of other food. They’re a little lonely on their own. A lot of the menu is made up of small plates, many of them snacklike and many served with bread, to the benefit of both bread and snack. The melting roasted bone marrow is terrific spread on sliced pao and drizzled with a thrilling chutney of fresh herbs and curry leaves. Potato fritters are sandwiched between halves of pao in a fun evocation of wada pao, a Mumbai street snack. A curried shrimp turnover is a homage to one that Mr. Cardoz remembers eating as a child on the beaches in Goa. I’d remember a hand pie this good, too. Another street snack he’s toying around with is chaat; the night I had it, he was making it with sweet potatoes and apples, an untraditional assemblage that made perfect sense. One likably eccentric aspect of Mr. Cardoz’s menu at North End Grill was the raft of egg dishes. Eggs make a more limited, but still memorable, appearance at Paowalla. Scrambled eggs patia are sultry with ginger and very, very soft; like the marrow, they come with sliced pao. Eggs kejriwal, meanwhile, is simple and totally likable: a sunny-side-up egg on toast ratcheted up by a green-chile chutney. With the larger plates, the playfulness and street-food allusions are mostly left behind. The results can be mixed. Mr. Cardoz has an excellent idea for getting New Yorkers to eat dal: He drops a globe of burrata in the middle of the plate. It’s one of the only large plates without meat or fish; in general, it’s a little tricker to eat a vegetarian meal at Paowalla than it should be. I wanted more flavor from the pork in baby pig vindaloo and a higher sour-to-sweet ratio from the sauce. And I wanted the bacon-and-chorizo biryani to be different in any number of ways: less saturated with smoke, more aromatic with spices, and probably cheaper than the $57 Paowalla is charging for it, although I might not whine about the price of this family-size portion if I had liked the way it tasted. The seafood main courses, though, tended to be very good, including the dogfish rubbed with a mildly spicy coating of coconut and tomatoes and then steamed inside a banana-leaf packet, or the whole sea bream roasted with a thick vein of vinegared spice paste inside. The menu sprawls, offering more than enough reasons to try Paowalla once. Whether you will come back depends on how much you mind the peculiarly disjointed dining space and service that can be unintentionally maddening. At first glance, Paowalla looks like a cozy neighborhood retreat, but several design decisions make it peculiarly uncomfortable. A row of stools facing a window puts anyone who sits there up for the inspection of pedestrians on Sullivan Street. The back end of the dining room is separated by a steel-and-glass partition, turning one medium-size space into two cramped, awkward ones and doing a real number on the acoustics. The most comfortable and, oddly enough, most peaceful evening I had at Paowalla was spent at a sidewalk table. That night was also free of a hovering, mosquitolike service style that I encountered inside. Once I had been spotted, somebody was always leaning in to clear a glass, or fill one, or wipe the table, or make room for another plate. When a new course arrived, before anybody had a chance to try any of it, I heard a question that was new to me. “First impressions?” It’s bad enough to be asked, as happens more and more often lately, “How are the first few bites tasting?” If we have to give opinions on how the food looks without tasting it, we may as well stay home looking at Instagram.","Breads; Bombay wada pao; scrambled eggs patia; eggs kejriwal; Goan shrimp curry pie; baked crab; burrata with sea island peas; sea bream stuffed with rechado; banana-leaf-wrapped dogfish; Barkha’s Goan bibinca; grilled pineapple.

104,Le Coucou,3 star,"Nov. 1, 2016",Pete Wells,SoHo,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/dining/le-coucou-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/dining/le-coucou-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"New York City cannot compete with Los Angeles’s patchwork quilt of cuisines, Northern California’s sainted ingredients, New Orleans’s discerning and passionate diners. What sets New York’s restaurant culture apart is that it never quite shakes the past and has never fully severed its ties to Europe. This is why New York can seem to be stuck in the last century, but it also explains its unusual receptivity to news from across the Atlantic. (No American city has been as fast to take up natural wines or the New Nordic mode.) With Le Coucou, this attention to Europe and attachment to the past come together in ways that are creative and fresh. The chef, Daniel Rose, runs a restaurant in Paris called Spring, but he’s from Chicago. He has said that his old-guard French menu is meant in part as a homage to Lutèce, a restaurant in Manhattan that he never visited. (It closed 12 years ago.) In other words, a chef who knows a lot about what actual French people are eating in 2016 has decided to summon a long-closed Manhattan restaurant that gave many Americans their ideas about French cuisine in the last four decades of the 20th century. This idea would make no sense anywhere but New York. It may not make sense here, either, but of all the restaurants to open in the city over the last year, Le Coucou would be my first pick for visitors from out of town who wanted a meal they couldn’t have back home. Not that it’s a tourist restaurant. Locals have been pouring through the doors at the south end of Lafayette Street since they opened, in the last week of spring, and reservations are scarce unless you want to eat before 6 p.m. or after 9:30. A lot of the love is due to Mr. Rose’s decision to bring back the long-gone high style of French cuisine. At Spring, his first restaurant in Paris, he put market produce in the foreground, following the seasons and his own contemporary impulses. Le Coucou’s cooking is more informed by old-school traditions and focused on animal parts, like the bands of fried tripe, crunchy on the outside and wonderfully creamy within. Or the eel fried in a sheath of rye batter, sauced with a vinaigrette that has a subtle and somehow very French flavor of curry. Much of the cooking revolves around glossy, spoon-coating, cream- and butter-reinforced sauces that some younger diners have never tasted. These sauces aren’t remotely heavy or deadening, two of the charges hurled at them when they were led to the guillotines by the Robespierres of nouvelle cuisine. In fact, they are so dynamic, the contours of their flavors so precise and rewarding, that smart diners lick the sauces from the heavy, scrolled, silver-plated tablespoon set to the right of the gold-rimmed plates, waiting for just this purpose. When the bourride arrived, I used the tablespoon to drink the shellfish fumet that a server had ladled from a copper sauté pan over a fillet of black sea bass in a soup bowl. I used it again to stir the smooth yellow aioli into the fumet, and again to taste the garlic-ridden aioli on its own. There were clams and a prawn in the sauté pan, too, and they were excellent. But the body and balance of the fumet were so right that it became the point of the dish; the shellfish were mere pretext. It’s no accident that after Americans swore off rich sauces, they began to hunger for fatty cuts like pork butt and rib-eye. But you can see the point of the old high style when you eat Le Coucou’s beef filet. The lean, rosy slices taste pure and clean; the decadence is supplied by ovals of soft beef marrow and by the marrow jus spooned over the meat. A side dish that comes with the beef is a rare mismatch: thin, crunchy slices of potatoes boulangère that don’t absorb the juices of the braised oxtail underneath. A bulging lobe of sweetbreads, scored with a knife and seared in a pan, is wonderful with its surrounding sauce, but you will also want to get some of that lively union of cream, white wine, tomatoes and fresh, minty tarragon on its own. You’ll also need to taste the brandy and lobster in the foamy sauce Américaine both with and without the delicate white mound of a pike quenelle. After eating that dish, a Francophile friend pronounced, “Downtown finally has its La Grenouille.” True enough, but I’d add that the food coming out of Le Coucou’s kitchen is more focused, the ingredients are finer, and the service is more tuned in. As for the wine list constructed by Aaron Thorp, it is better in every way you can name. Mr. Rose and his partner, Stephen Starr, allow themselves a couple of stagy visual references to those old French restaurants. The menu is written in French, although there are English subtitles. The cooks all wear tall white toques, and for many customers, Le Coucou will probably be the first place they’ve seen that piece of headgear outside children’s books. For the most part, though, Le Coucou carefully avoids the things that people found intimidating about the old Le and La restaurants. Mr. Rose wears a black shirt and no toque; his modern outfit sets the tone for the dining room. To the right of the front door is an intimate, soft-focus cocktail alcove that doubles as a waiting area. There are no seats at the bar, which is too bad if you want to eat by yourself, but which also gives the room a little bit of romance. The space opens up as you enter the dining room, with chandeliers that look like concentric rings of votive candles suspended above the white tablecloths, each of which is set with a single white taper. What Le Coucou achieves in its look and feel is impressive. It has an elegance that is well outside the everyday rumble of New York life but that doesn’t have any of the heaviness in décor or the off-putting reserve that nobody really misses from the old days. The only place where Le Coucou falls slightly on the wrong side of the line between casual and formal is in Daniel Skurnick’s desserts. They’re lovely, but some seem too relaxed after the rigorously elegant main courses. There’s a roasted pear stuffed with vanilla ice cream standing gracefully upright amid candied almonds, the golden folds of its skin clinging to it like a silk shawl. But other desserts, like the rice pudding with chopped pistachios or the chocolate mousse under leafy chocolate shavings, have a slouching, stuff-in-a-bowl informality that seems to belong in a wine bar. (A wine-bar annex to Le Coucou isn’t a bad idea, by the way.) One night, I sat next to two Parisian women who said they were regulars at Spring. A French-speaking waiter appeared and engaged them in a long deliberation about the cheese course. They sent over their cheese, we shared our desserts, and then I slipped outside with them while they lit up their Gauloises. “This is very different from Spring,” one said. “But it makes sense in New York.”","Leeks; veal terrine; lobster-stuffed squash blossoms; fried eel; pike quenelle; sweetbreads; halibut in beurre blanc; bourride; sole Véronique; pheasant for two; filet of beef; wild hare; roasted pear; chiboust.

105,The Beatrice Inn,2 star,"Oct. 25, 2016",Pete Wells,West Village,"American, French",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/dining/beatrice-inn-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/dining/beatrice-inn-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The last time I reviewed the Beatrice Inn, the going was tough. Formerly a nightclub that reliably infuriated its neighbors in the West Village, the place had just been rehabilitated by new owners, including the magazine editor Graydon Carter, who envisioned a chophouse of old-establishment sensibilities. They were on their third chef by the time I wrote it up with a Satisfactory rating, in the spring of 2013. All three had obvious talent. As far as I could tell, they were just having trouble making food that was as dull as the owners wanted. The restaurant hired its fourth chef later that year. Her name is Angie Mar. A dinner there not long after she took over convinced me that the kitchen was moving in the right direction, but it did not hint that she would eventually make the Beatrice Inn into a meat lover’s palace with a menu unlike any other in the city. Ms. Mar, who bought the restaurant over the summer, still calls it a chophouse, but it is no longer a place where cautious eaters seek refuge from the unknown. Her Beatrice Inn offers an irresistible opportunity to take chances and eat with abandon. She refers to the past, all right; the restaurant is big on vintage silver tongs and serving spoons whose patterns glint in the low light. But Ms. Mar isn’t looking for safety. She’s mining history for neglected pleasures and forgotten indulgences. A quick look at the menu tells you the direction her kitchen obsessions take. The main courses are divided into “Of the Land” (12 choices) and “From the Sea” (two). A couple of the meat dishes are said to serve two people, others are meant for two to four, and the tomahawk rib-eye roasted on a bone the size of a cricket bat is simply listed as “for the table.” When an animal can be cooked and served in one piece, that is what Ms. Mar will do. There is a whole rabbit smoked over apple wood, giving it the flavor of meat wrapped in bacon and roasted, except that the smoke goes all the way down to the bone. Ducks, meanwhile, are cured in salt for four days, then smoked, then slowly roasted, then doused with flaming booze at the table. The skin is dark, and the meat is pink and pull-apart tender; it reminded me of a slow-cooked Easter ham. The entire-animal approach is not restricted to animals. A side dish on a recent night was a carnival squash, roasted whole and carved at the table, like a chicken. Knowing all this, I should have been ready for the cheese incident. Before dessert one night, a server brought out a platter with an ash-coated pyramid of Valençay, a white and gently slumping wheel of a Rensselaer County triple cream, and a stack of shaggy leaves of clothbound Cheddar, each with its own jam or honey. We said we’d like some of the Valençay. “You realize that you’ll be getting that whole pyramid, right?” our server asked. We hadn’t, but we were game (though it would have been nice if he had warned us that we’d pay $38 for it). Or you could just get a burger. The patties are tall, firm and moist with fat in the style of the Spotted Pig, where Ms. Mar used to cook. The ones in the dining room are made from beef aged for a month and a half. Lamb burgers are sold at the bar, where you can also get a manhattan served inside a crystal candy jar that the bartender has filled with a cloud of wood smoke. But the best chef-engineered burger can’t hold my attention the way a really good classic stew does. My last time at the bar, I sat down in front of half a dozen Nova Scotia oysters followed by a hulking stump of oxtail braised in Madeira. I ate the beef with a spoon, as I’d been instructed, scooping up the juices and stewed prunes and honest-to-goodness mashed potatoes. Enjoy your burgers, kids. Ms. Mar brings back champvallon de tête, an old French artillery piece in the battle against hunger. Beef cheeks and veal are braised separately and then, when they have reached different forms of seductiveness, combined with chanterelles and porcini. The whole stew is then baked under a thin fan of sliced potatoes. It is like shepherd’s pie cooked by very happy shepherds. The game pie is very much in the same vein, although here the stew is a mix of venison, lamb and boar. The only true game animal is the boar, but Ms. Mar coaxes a brawny flavor, not fully tamed, from the combination of meats. The crust, an expanse of golden suet pastry, was a little tough the night I ate it, but I’d rather have an overworked suet crust than no suet crust at all. On another night, the suet crust under a savory tart of fall plums was much more tender, though there was still room for improvement. Pastry is not the kitchen’s strong suit. One of two desserts is a fried pie whose apple filling was jarringly oversalted on a recent night. The better choice, and really the only choice if you have bought into the Mar aesthetic, is the crème brûlée in a marrow bone. It is lovely and weird, the familiar custard supplemented with a flavor that is unmistakably animal. Ms. Mar cooks animals, of course, but she also cooks for animals. She cooks for the animals that we are. She knows we have powerful senses of smell, that we can be led by our appetites, that certain instincts kick in when we sit together taking another animal apart. In many ways, the Beatrice Inn resembles a steakhouse, but Ms. Mar has given it a strong undertow of sensuality that would be unwelcome in most steakhouses, where the rites of male bonding are well established and don’t encourage unexpected detours into pleasure. In fact, the restaurant is one of the few meat joints in town that doesn’t seem to be pitched to men. Not all of Ms. Mar’s obsessions strike me as wise. Her bourbon-aged rib-eye, based on a technique she learned from the French butcher Yves-Marie Le Bourdonnec in which beef is kept wrapped in whiskey-soaked cloth for more than a hundred days, tasted to me like a very expensive hangover. But she has a vision. A vision isn’t the same as a concept. In the restaurant business, a concept is a market niche, while a vision can lead beyond the bounds of business sense, or any other kind. Ms. Mar might draw more customers if she didn’t seem to look down on vegetables, for instance. If that’s not a deal breaker for you, though, her cooking will seem especially wonderful because it’s so clear that she believes in what she’s doing. By following her gut, she has made the Beatrice Inn one of the most celebratory restaurants in the city. I don’t mean that you should go there to celebrate an anniversary or a new job. It’s a place to go when you want to celebrate your life as an animal.","Romaine and apple salad; yellowtail carpaccio; chicken liver pâté; milk-braised pork shoulder; roast duck flambé; champvallon de tête; braised oxtail; tartiflette; roasted squash; bone marrow crème brûlée.

106,Karasu,1 star,"Oct. 18, 2016",Pete Wells,Fort Greene,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/dining/karasu-zadies-oyster-room-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/dining/karasu-zadies-oyster-room-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Restaurants have made bar food their own. In fancy kitchens serving fancy dining rooms, chefs have found almost inconceivably fancy ways to make pub and roadhouse food. The burgers are ground to order and slapped on rolls fresh out of the oven; the hot dogs are squirted with proprietary condiments; the Tater Tots are enrolled in elite private day care. Bars have to fight back somehow. Some of the smartest ones are taking the high road. They’re serving what would have been considered fairly ambitious restaurant food back when categories like that still made sense. To get to Karasu, you enter a small and well-populated corner tavern called Walter’s, across from Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn. You walk past the bar, past the kitchen, past the restrooms, and stop when you get to the midnight-blue wall in the back. At this point, some people decide they’re in the wrong place and walk out. Don’t. Locate the handle, push gently on the door and step inside. These speakeasy shenanigans may annoy you, particularly when the speakeasy in question is advertised on a chalkboard out on the sidewalk, but it’s hard to hold a grudge once you’re inside. Dark and tranquil, its only window so near the ceiling that the room is effectively cloistered from the street, Karasu is a refuge from noise and crowds. The first surprising thing about the food is that there is any. The second is that it’s so polished and considered. The kitchen is a box at the end of the bar so cramped that most D.J.’s would refuse to work in it. A space this size usually calls for reduced expectations. Yael Peet and Elena Yamamoto, the chefs, have other ideas. Their menu can read like an izakaya’s, but the plates have all sorts of subtle flourishes that most izakayas wouldn’t bother with. Sashimi could be a matter of shopping and slicing. At Karasu, it’s more than that. On a recent night, bonito was marinated in soy and sake, then gently smoked over smoldering mesquite. Finally, it was rolled in ground sesame and seared. A lot had happened to this tuna, but the flavors were restrained, and very agreeable. The wonderful Japanese sweet potatoes, just coming into season, had been deep-fried with kabocha squash and set in a soy-enhanced syrup. Steamed hard-shell clams were excellent in ponzu sauce, and thin slices of octopus made a welcome appearance with crunchy marinated cucumbers. Some things, like the terrific assortment of pickled daikon, work best as punctuation marks between sips of cocktails. When you start thinking about dinner, there is pasta with mentaiko sauce; the spicy red dots of cod roe are embellished with uni, and the thin noodles were rolled and cut on the premises, somewhere. One night they were slightly limp, always a risk with fresh pasta, but on another they were ideally firm and bouncy. If more serious hunger calls, there is a generous tonkatsu, left fairly thick and fried on the bone. Still more impressive is the koji-rubbed rib-eye, forcefully blackened on both sides and served sliced in a skillet, basted in its own fat. In the heat of the moment, I declared that it was better than the steak at Peter Luger. I am pretty sure I meant it. The first few times I walked through the black door, what I had in mind was a mixed drink or two. Overseen by Thomas Waugh, formerly the chief barman at ZZ’s Clam Bar in Manhattan, they reflect the punctilious Japanese approach to cocktail culture. (The heavy brass mold behind the bar that will melt the corners off a large ice cube and turn it into a large ice ball comes from Japan.) Some of the drinks, like a refocused mai tai called the Nettai, paddle through the lagoons of Polynesia with restraint and elegance, an unusual sight in those lagoons.  Wine is in the genetic makeup of Zadie’s Oyster Room, in the East Village. It replaces a wine bar called Fifty Paces, which replaced a wine bar called Terroir. The common thread linking all three is the chef Marco Canora. Mr. Canora converted Terroir to Fifty Paces soon after splitting with his business partner Paul Grieco, and the place had the provisional quality often found in the apartments of freshly divorced men. With Zadie’s, he seems to have regained his footing. Zadie’s chef, Devin Dearden, devotes his menu to the oyster in all its edible forms. Oysters are of course served raw on ice, with a good mignonette and an irrelevant cocktail sauce. But they are also broiled under minced seaweed and Parmigiano-Reggiano in a nervy, compelling take on oysters Rockefeller; poached in sherry and cream along with late-summer succotash for a soup that is halfway between oyster stew and chowder; and steamed with garlic, vermouth and butter, a suave oyster-dunking sauce that becomes a soup once you add oyster crackers. The only dud method is pickling, and the problem there may have been that the oysters were lost amid a heap of bitter greens and puréed seaweed. Mr. Canora seems to have realized that the huge growth in cultivating oysters hasn’t been matched by similar progress in cooking them. New York restaurants serve them raw, almost invariably. If Zadie’s can nudge a few chefs into rethinking this, it could signify the start of a new chapter in the city’s long relationship with oysters. And if not, I’ll still drop by when I’ m craving smoked bluefish spread, a New England treat that almost never turns up this far south. And I’ve never craved a tuna melt in my life, but that may only be because I’d never tasted the one at Zadie’s.","Pickled vegetable; sashimi; sunomono; daigaku imo; clams; handmade pasta with mentaiko; tonkatsu; rib-eye for two.

107,Pondicheri,2 star,"Oct. 11, 2016",Pete Wells,NoMad,Indian,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/dining/pondicheri-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/dining/pondicheri-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"“This is the first place you’ve taken me where I’d come back and spend my own money,” a friend said in the middle of lunch at Pondicheri. He is highly sensitive to pretension and unjustified expense, so whenever I take him along on one of my hunting parties, I try to pick something with a high ratio of flavor to price. At Pondicheri, I finally hit his sweet spot. By that time, I was sure I’d be back, too. The chef and owner, Anita Jaisinghani, chose New York as the first site of a string of all-day Indian cafes she hopes to open around the country, modeled on her original Pondicheri in Houston. She also has a more formal Indian restaurant there called Indika, but if she brought that to Manhattan, she would have to compete with such restaurants as Paowalla, Tamarind Tribeca and Indian Accent. There isn’t anything in the city quite like Pondicheri. A few blocks north of the Flatiron Building, it inhabits a space so cavernous that maps may be useful. (It wasn’t until my fourth meal that I discovered a corner table hidden behind a wall all the way in the back of the restaurant.) The sheer number of seats is one of the things that makes it worth keeping in mind, because Pondicheri would work for so many occasions. When I wanted to have breakfast alone, I’d go to the front counter and ask for a cup of masala chai. Pondicheri makes it smooth and strong, with more than a whisper of spice. Then I’d find a table where I could eat the wonderful aloo paratha with my hands, loving the way the crisp shell collided with the soft potatoes inside, feeling the mustard oil rake the back of my throat, licking the ghee from my fingers. Or I might get the masala eggs, firmly scrambled with fennel, onions, peppers and spices, and then spread out over a wedge of spiced carrot paratha. For a morning meeting with people who’d never seen me lick ghee off my fingers, I’d probably point to a few things behind the glass pastry cases — whatever looked good that day. I’d hope for a return of the fig cake I had last week, essentially fig preserves baked into a muffin top. And I’d keep an eye out for the honey mesquite cake, which is delicate with almond and mesquite flour, savory with ginger and other warm spices. Honey has been spritzed around, but the cake hasn’t been drenched in it. It’s a delicious example of Ms. Jaisinghani’s strategy of importing Indian flavors into American daily life. The best time to take Pondicheri’s full measure is between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., when servers at the counter will take orders for either breakfast or lunch. Beet uttapam is technically a breakfast dish here. But this spongy, slightly tangy pancake topped with a fried egg makes a perfect lunch; it is served on a thali platter next to little metal cups holding a nice crunchy salad, some cilantro chutney and a turmeric soup that tastes as if it held the secret of eternal health. In the nonvegetarian version, another cup carries a small crumbly heap of lamb keema, very tasty stuff. There are roti wraps called frankies, as well as salads and curries, like the chicken stewed in a tomato-tinged curry of unusual complexity. It’s named Chicken 25 after the number of seasonings in the curry, and it is worth asking for even though it sounds like a genetic engineering experiment. I liked this much more than the sayel lamb kofta, meatballs in a nondescript meat sauce. The snacks and side dishes that become available after 11 a.m. are exciting, too. I can’t remember a meat samosa that I liked better than the ones that Pondicheri fills with lentils and goat braised in spices. Papdi chaat, a plate of semolina crackers and lentil dumplings buried under yogurt and chutney, is completely messy and a joy to eat. My friend who’s planning to come back to Pondicheri insisted we get the fried okra, one of his benchmarks for Indian kitchens. Crunchy and free of any trace of goo, it passed his test. And I love Pondicheri’s “desi fries,” which start with curly fries (a very good place to start, as Maria von Trapp would say) that are blasted with an irresistible spice mix. After lunch, I stopped at the bakery counter, where the morning pastries had been replaced by cookies (there’s a great spiced chocolate chip and a puffy ginger cookie with a scalloped edge that makes it look like a paw) and appealing lemon bars that take their flavor more from the aromatic peel than from the sour juice. Raised in India, Ms. Jaisinghani earned a degree in microbiology, with the idea that she would eventually work as a pathologist. Her career was held up while she had two children. (Her daughter, Ajna Jai, now manages her New York City restaurant.) When she was ready to work again, she didn’t send her résumé to a laboratory but to one of the best restaurants in Houston. The two years she spent learning about flour, sugar and eggs in the pastry kitchen at Cafe Annie must account for the skill and creativity of Pondicheri’s bakery. If you go for dinner, the menu changes shape again. The food is a little dressier, is ordered at the table and falls more neatly into appetizers and main courses. My dinner started very well with tangy, tamarind-marinated quail, with a pine-nut stuffing tucked into the breast. Some lamb skewers were disappointingly dry, but I was wild about a version of saag paneer made with mustard greens; as soon as I tasted it, I knew I was going to crave the sharper, more assertive flavor the next time I had saag paneer made with spinach. The impressive size of Pondicheri may be an advantage at lunch, because it virtually guarantees that you will find a seat. At dinner, though, it works against the place. The crowds so far haven’t been big or energetic enough to fill the room, and even the long bar doesn’t do much to turn up the voltage. The staff can be a bit desultory, too, although I found this more charming than off-putting. (I loved the deadpan way our server said, describing the crudités appetizer, “All the vegetables come from the Greenmarket, if that’s of any interest.”) Pondicheri is not the place to take a crowd of people who want dinner to be the show. But that’s fine. It doesn’t need to do absolutely everything a restaurant can do when it already does several things so well.","Honey mesquite cake; masala eggs; aloo paratha; papdi chaat; goat and lentil samosa; spiced okra; desi fries; tandoori quail; saag paneer; Chicken 25.

108,Sauvage,1 star,"Sept. 27, 2016",Pete Wells,Greenpoint,"American, French",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/dining/sauvage-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/dining/sauvage-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Roughly half of what I’ve eaten at Sauvage since it opened just before Memorial Day has been either forgettable or familiar. In the other half, though, this restaurant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, seemed to be on to something exciting, a combination of European kitchen discipline and a gut instinct for meeting appetite head on. Nothing I ate this summer knocked me back quite as hard as Sauvage’s pig head confit. The name is no figure of speech. This is the head of a pig in profile, flattened like a Cuban sandwich. I was still staring at it when a server said sweetly: “Just so you know: I forgot to mention that the sauce is made from the brains. It’s coming out of the ear.” When brain sauce is spilling from the ear of a pig, you don’t need to tell me what to do. I tore into the head, beginning with the tanned cheeks, following the curve of the smile and ending with the round snout, the size of a Ritz cracker. The skin was chewy and crunchy, with a compressed layer of firm meat underneath, basted in fat. On the side were plump white shell beans baked with some pig tongue, along with bitter greens in vinaigrette. The beans would have been creamier with a few more minutes in the oven, but on the whole, I couldn’t get over how skillfully done it all was. The chef is Lisa Giffen. She cooked for about three years at Adour Alain Ducasse, with shorter stays at Daniel and Blue Hill. In 2013, she was hired to run the kitchen of Maison Premiere, a cocktail parlor and raw bar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, whose owners opened Sauvage. I ate at Maison Premiere one night just after Ms. Giffen had started. I remember thinking that the compositions were pretty; the ingredients, especially the seafood, were excellent; and the portions were feathery, to the point that I wasn’t convinced I’d had dinner. There is some wispiness on the menu at Sauvage, too. Sea urchin with scraps of pickled watermelon rind didn’t make a lasting impression. A terrine of leeks with clams needed salt and acidity. A salad of peeled and pickled grapes, a recent special, wasn’t worth the obvious trouble that had gone into making it. The same was true of a plate of tiny stuffed vegetables, including a baby eggplant that was cute but underbaked. But Ms. Giffen’s talents are best used when she abandons the miniaturist mode. There’s a full-throttle thrill to breaking open chilled snow crab legs and dunking their briny flesh in brown butter that’s reinforced with mashed crab liver. There’s undeniable pleasure in slicing open the malakoff, dough mixed with alpine-style cheese that’s lumped on a slice of sourdough and then deep fried. This bonanza of starch, cheese and oil comes with pickled vegetables. It should also come with a small mountain for you to you climb after you finish it. Ms. Giffen’s chicken pot-au-feu is an essay in beak-to-tail poultry cooking. The breast goes into delicate white sausages that share an enameled casserole with a confit of dark meat, mushrooms, carrots and fennel. The vegetables are braised but still crisp. On a separate plate is a slice of sourdough toast spread with whipped schmaltz and fragments of brittle skin; the menu doesn’t call them gribenes, but I will. The pot-au-feu is a small feast and, at $25, a great buy. The pig head confit is $65. While price is not likely to be a deciding factor for people who want brain sauce coming out of a pig’s ear, there is a more affordable cut of pork on the menu. An Old Spot porterhouse, set off with pickled rhubarb, was intensely good and cost $31. The meat, robustly seasoned and juicy, was cooked and served on a bone that was last seen between the teeth of a woman at my table. Like Liz Johnson at Mimi in Greenwich Village, Ms. Giffen doesn’t cook in a systematically French way; both chefs just borrow French ideas at will and both have the French knack for spurring desire and then satisfying it. You can taste Ms. Giffen’s respect for the Gallic kitchen in the way she makes potatoes: the creamy dauphinoise with strip steak, the lavishly buttered chunks and bits of potato with lobster (itself slicked down with olive oil and served with a subtle, earthy blood sauce). One area that would benefit from a more overtly French treatment is the dessert menu. Recently there was a honey panna cotta, a chocolate cremeux and a mascarpone semifreddo — three variations on a sweet, creamy substance with random stuff in it. Cheese, when it’s offered, is a more persuasive last course. Ms. Giffen is a partner in the restaurant along with Joshua Boissy and Krystof Zizka, the people behind Maison Premiere. When Maison Premiere opened in 2011, its attention to period details like the weathered French Quarter facade, the antique absinthe fountain and the suspendered barmen was so thorough that it was easy to believe you’d wandered into an underground party for enthusiasts of Belle Époque New Orleans cosplay. But there was a serious dedication to food and drink, both of which got better as the place went along. (The quality of the work at Maison Premiere’s bar won it an award from the James Beard Foundation this year.) For all the hype about Brooklyn restaurants, the ones that turn out to be most impressive often come together slowly. Before Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare and Roberta’s became national names, it was hard to tell whether they were following a grand, premeditated design or just making it up as they went along. Sauvage at least has the advantage of starting off with expertise that Maison Premiere needed several years to accumulate. It has Ms. Giffen. It has Will Elliot, a former bartender at the first establishment whose cocktail recipes and spirit choices at Sauvage I’ve enjoyed very much, even though I haven’t had a chance to try out all six forms of ice he is rumored to stock. It has a wine list whose shallow end is very rewarding and whose deep end betrays extensive, possibly obsessive attention. This is no doubt the case with the restaurant’s design, too, but this time the owners are not as interested in historical re-enactment. Sauvage, which sits across the street from McCarren Park and opens its cafe doors on warm days and nights, seems to come from another era, but it’s hard to say which one the owners had in mind. Maybe they’re making it up as they go along.","Oysters; queen crab; malakoff; summer crudité; lobster with blood sauce; Plymouth Rock chicken pot-au-feu; Old Spot pork porterhouse; pig head confit.

109,Günter Seeger NY,2 star,"Sept. 20, 2016",Pete Wells,West Village,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/dining/gunter-seeger-ny-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/dining/gunter-seeger-ny-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"It’s complicated to praise someone whose confidence already seems to be reinforced with steel and clad in granite. It’s even more complicated in the case of Günter Seeger, whose confidence is the source of both his success in the kitchen and his occasional capacity for sabotaging himself in the dining room. Even the believers in Mr. Seeger’s lyrical cooking, and I became one the first time I ate at his new restaurant in the West Village, have noted that his insistence on following his vision does not always work to his advantage. This has been a theme since his time in Atlanta, first at the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton, Buckhead, and then at his own restaurant, called Seeger’s. Christiane Lauterbach, an admirer from the moment she tasted his red cabbage (“Aha!” she remembers thinking. “A German who doesn’t cook like a German!”), wrote in Atlanta magazine in 1999 that his refusal to hire a parking valet at Seeger’s cost him money. Each time it poured, customers canceled their reservations so they wouldn’t have to get wet running from the lot to the front door. “Ja,” Mr. Seeger told her. “I do it my way.” Those who wanted to eat at Günter Seeger NY when it opened on Hudson Street in May had to do it his way, too. Instead of offering reservations, the restaurant sold tickets for $185 a person, service included. Paying for a meal in full up front always gives me the feeling that the restaurant is worried I’m going to try to dine and dash. I put up with it, grumblingly, only for restaurants that have limited seatings and offer something I can’t get anywhere else. What did Günter Seeger NY have, besides Mr. Seeger himself, who hasn’t had a restaurant since Seeger’s closed nine years ago? New Yorkers griped. Then, in a sign that he has learned to bend a little, Mr. Seeger dropped the ticket scheme. Now he offers reservations, with a $100-a-person fee for cancellations within 48 hours. The restaurant’s website also shows the day’s menu, now priced at $148 before tip and tax. It’s easier paying for dinner once you’ve put away 10 to 12 courses and a bottle of German riesling from Günter Seeger NY’s impressive stash. But it isn’t quite easy enough to keep you from wondering just what you’re getting for the money. One thing it doesn’t buy you is a lot of fabrics in the dining room. Velvety clusters of roses sit on the bare tables; the uncarpeted floors clatter with the footsteps of servers pacing back and forth; the brick walls are painted white and echo with stiff formalities. “Chef wants you to feel like he’s welcoming you into his home,” we were told one night. When you go to dinner there, do you have to call him Chef, too? This deeply undomestic dining room is overshadowed by the immense stainless-steel kitchen in the back, where Mr. Seeger and his crew are on display, moving soundlessly under lights of operating-room intensity. With every detail, Günter Seeger NY tells you that the food is the whole show. At these prices, it had better be close to perfect. And on my first two meals, it was. The cooking is deeply expressive — expressive of the season and of Mr. Seeger’s focused, disciplined style. He doesn’t try for bizarre juxtapositions. When you’re surprised by his cooking, it’s because the voice of the ingredients is coming through more clearly than you’re used to. Chilled pea soup had a beguiling, toasted depth, and even the garnish was delicious, an open pea pod stretched across the rim of a shot glass. On another night, the soup was lemon cucumber, and it was refreshing in the way you want a gin and tonic to be, or an afternoon shower. A squash blossom twisted around delicate lobster mousse was served with a distinctive squash blossom pesto, crunchy with pistachios and seasoned, thrillingly, with saffron. Mr. Seeger welcomed the return of matjes herring with an early-summer tartare that was bright with apples, cucumbers and the piercing taste of ginger. Abalone was quickly grilled, sliced and sent back to its shell with dashi, briny threads of sea bean and a live-wire dab of yuzukosho. There were moments of theatricality. One night, a server ferried a wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano the size of a wedding cake to the table. “This is your cheese course,” he said, then toted it away, returning a short time later with a plate dusted with grated cheese and grated pistachios and slivers of candied citron. It was very good. Mr. Seeger’s people like to say that he draws up the menus while wandering the farmers’ market each day. Like the bit about welcoming you into his home, this is largely fiction. He didn’t find abalone or Parmigiano-Reggiano in a New York City Greenmarket. Well, who cares whether he gets his inspiration in Union Square or while talking on the phone to his importer: The point is that he knows where to find ingredients that speak far more eloquently than any server reeling off prepared talking points. After two dinners, I was as convinced of the excellence of Mr. Seeger’s cooking as he seems to be. I knew the sterility of the dining room would keep some people away, and I wasn’t sure anybody should have to pay quite so much for dinner, but the cooking had a finesse that’s exciting to find because it’s so rare. Then, in my last meal, nothing was quite as exquisite. Mr. Seeger’s opening move that night was a ball of sweet, flat-tasting langoustine ice cream with caviar and a fragment of sea urchin. I love langoustines, and hated to see them end up like this. It was the first dish I’d had that might have come from Mr. Seeger’s recipe files from the ’90s rather than straight from his heart. Later in the meal, that great squash-blossom pesto came back, this time with a small European sole the size of my hand. It had spent both too much time on the grill and too little. Crosshatches of char overpowered the sole’s exquisite flavor, and yet the thickest part of the fish clung to the spine, not fully cooked. For all his confidence, Mr. Seeger must be feeling a bit exposed right now. His future in New York City is riding on a restaurant that’s both brilliant and off-putting. Before it opened, Mr. Seeger told an interviewer, “The food will be simplistic, but also technically perfect.” That’s a cool trick when it works. When it doesn’t, there’s nowhere to hide.",Set menus offer no choices; dietary restrictions are accommodated. $148 for a 10- to 12-course menu; $198 for 10 to 12 courses at a communal table in the kitchen.
110,Hao Noodle and Tea by Madam Zhu’s Kitchen,2 star,"Sept. 13, 2016",Pete Wells,Greenwich Village,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/dining/hao-noodle-and-tea-by-madam-zhus-kitchen-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/dining/hao-noodle-and-tea-by-madam-zhus-kitchen-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"In the hedonist’s view of American immigration patterns, bad times for chefs in China are good times for dumpling chasers and noodle hunters in New York. When experienced cooks couldn’t make a living there for political or economic reasons, they came here. Conversely, over the last decade or so, the hypertrophic Chinese economy has left the kitchens of our Chinatowns somewhat flattened, with fewer high peaks of talent standing out in the landscape. But a cash-flush China may be working to the advantage of New Yorkers for once. An energetic entrepreneur named Zhu Rong, who owns restaurants in four cities around China, recently expanded her territory to Greenwich Village with a place she has named (take a breath) Hao Noodle and Tea by Madam Zhu’s Kitchen (exhale). Ms. Zhu brought along a pair of chefs whose skillful manipulation of bubbling oil, steam and smoking-hot woks is evident in almost everything they cook. They also know a thing or two about dough and hot peppers. The traditions invoked by the menu come mainly from Beijing, Shanghai and Ms. Zhu’s hometown, Chongqing. The interpretations are contemporary. The portions are generally bigger than a street snack but smaller than one of those platters that descends with a thunk on the Lazy Susans of Chinatown. The food is sometimes arranged with an attention to negative space that can make you wish you saw less plate and more food. Balancing any spareness, though, are the spicy intensity of some dishes and the stripped-down purity of others. The chefs are virtuosic fryers, able to express many nuances in the simple language of crust. The coating on the fish fritters is almost as soft as cake crumbs, a pale gold tinted green by seaweed powder. It’s a subtle partner for the delicate fish inside. Crispy shrimp sauté has a more rugged crunch, almost in fried chicken territory, with dark, thrilling slips of dried chiles clinging to it. Between the two extremes are the wonderful cubes of creamy tofu inside a crisp and ultrathin shell; they’re like mozzarella sticks refined to the nth degree. Everything on the menu’s many pages gets a color photo, and it all looks good. Mostly, it is. Lunch or dinner might start with chilled appetizers like the fresh and tender clams in a stack of quietly seasoned Chinese chives; or the juicy smoked sole, marinated in sweet soy sauce. Both were exceptional. So was the chilled salad of poached grape tomatoes. Fizzy on the inside and infused with plum syrup, they were a quick respite from the weather on a muggy summer day. Cold sliced beef shank, a Sichuan notion, pulled its punches on the night I tried it. But other cold appetizers from that region, like the translucent logs of mung bean jelly stacked up under a chile and fermented black bean sauce, landed all the expected body blows and uppercuts. There are excellent wood ear mushrooms, floppy and crisp at the same time in their dressing of vinegar and a dose of chile oil that will sneak up on the unwary. The more familiar dishes are some of the least interesting. Sweet and sour pork with pineapple was less sugary than usual, but I still left it alone. Seafood pancakes are tough and oily triangles that lack the tender layering that makes scallion pancakes so appealing. Something called rainbow salad is a plate of quinoa and carrots that you’d be happy enough to find at the company cafeteria. All danger of dullness is obliterated, though, when Madam Zhu’s Spicy Fish Stew shows up. It’s a Sichuanese inspiration, with a flaky fish in a lightly sour green broth so packed with fresh chiles that it brought all conversation, not to mention rational thought, to a standstill. The noodles and dumplings are toward the back of the menu, and tend to arrive near the meal’s end. The bacon sticky rice shumai, sheer wrappers that barely contain their stuffing, have instantly entered New York’s gallery of great dim sum. Everybody at my table marveled, too, at the half-moons called clay pot dumplings: These tender wrappers of cooked egg folded over pork and water chestnuts are something like omelets crossed with pierogies that moved into a bowl of soup. The only part of the menu I found unreliable was, oddly enough, the noodles. On a night when the restaurant was at full capacity, the Taiwanese pork noodles were monotonously sweet, and the dan dan noodles were an unfocused blur. But they and other dishes — there’s a fascinating and novel bowl of fresh tomato soup with ragged hand-pulled flat noodles and gingery pork meatballs — were excellent on slower days. I wondered if the kitchen had simply been moving too quickly. To gloss one of the eight words in the restaurant’s name: The tea is very good. There is delicate silver needle and white peony, pungently herbal green tea grown at high elevations, and a fine aged oolong, among others. The servers never seem to suggest tea, but once you order it they do remember to refresh your pot with hot water until the leaves have given all they’ve got. Ms. Zhu is a refugee from the art gallery business and she brings an airy, creative aesthetic to her restaurants. With framed prints of Arne Svenson’s window-peeping photography on the walls and a long, rough-grained communal table in the center of the room, Hao Noodle and Tea looks like an especially nice Brooklyn espresso bar where the rapture has arrived and taken only the laptops. There is enough space between the white tables and chairs to drive a riding lawn mower. Even the people at my table who are normally unmoved by Chinese sweets were impressed by the desserts. Slippery, cool taro soup was soothingly bland, which is no put-down. The rosewater jelly was the real surprise, broken into shards as sparklingly clear as cold vodka.",Chinese chives with clams; sweetly smoked sole; Le Shan chicken; wood ear mushrooms; eight spice crispy tofu; clay pot dumplings; Madam Zhu’s spicy fish stew; crispy shrimp sauté; dan dan noodles; sticky rice bacon shumai; steamed tian mian pork buns; rosewater jelly. $5 to $26.

Starting today, we will occasionally offer such reviews of restaurants in other cities as well, applying the same standards that govern our reviews in New York: a minimum of three anonymous visits to the restaurant. SANTA MONICA, Calif. — On my table at Cassia was a thick, black, gnarled pig tail. The menu said it was grilled, but I was ready to believe it had been incinerated in a rage, as if I had mortally insulted the chef and serving me this stick of carbon were his revenge. But the nice woman waiting on me didn’t seem to think anything was wrong. She seemed excited for me. Would I like her to cut it up, she asked? “Um,” I began. Before I finished, she slid a knife’s point down the length of the tail. “I want to make sure you really get all the meat,” she said, lifting out links of bone. “Sometimes I see people serving themselves, and they don’t get into it the right way.” She got into it, all right, leaving me with a heap of meat, soft fat and skin. It was not nearly as annihilated as it looked at first glance. I rolled a forkful or two into a curl of Bibb lettuce with some Thai basil, cilantro and laksa leaf, and dipped it into nuoc cham. The antiphony of char and fat, cool leaves and warm grease, fish sauce and green herbs is in the end a simple thing. Or it would be simple if Vietnamese stalls across the United States sold grilled pig tails. One of the most appealing things about Cassia, a year-old restaurant here, is its pointed lack of interest in being confrontational, as my meeting with the pig tail illustrates. The restaurant goes out of its way to be accommodating, without doing too much violence to the various Asian cuisines that inspire much of the menu. Bryant Ng, the chef, isn’t in the business of scrawling his signature on other countries’ cultures. He doesn’t max out the fat and the funk, the standard tactic now for American cooks who want to let it be known that they are down with Asian cuisines. He’s more focused on balance than extremes. Mr. Ng owns Cassia with his wife, Kim Ng, and another couple, Josh Loeb and Zoe Nathan, who among other places run an impressive wine bar nearby called Rustic Canyon. The idea of Cassia was to flesh out the ideas Mr. Ng developed at his last restaurant, the Spice Table, within the framework of a busy, well-oiled brasserie. A whiff of blazing wood drifts across the menu and around the restaurant, which would look like an aircraft hangar if it weren’t broken up by an open grill, an oyster-shucking counter and a bar where seats have a view of Seventh Street beyond a mountain range of liquor bottles. As if you were at La Coupole, you could start with a shellfish platter, although here you’d be working your way from oysters with a lime and black-pepper mignonette and a sambal cocktail sauce, to snow-crab claws with a chunky and char-flecked romesco, to chilled prawns that taste of garlic, laksa leaf and smoke. Another portal into a meal, one that better suggests the kitchen’s reach, is a charcuterie plate: thin mahogany slices of lamb ham; a floppy, spicy sausage something like mortadella crossed with ’nduja; spoonfuls of salty pork fat, melting away under bread warm off the grill; strips of Singaporean candied bacon; a slab of Vietnamese pork meatloaf, liberated from banh mi at last, and excellent with some chopped fermented cabbage. The only dull item of the bunch was the smoked curried duck, a bit dry and not especially curried. The cabbage relish may or may not be Mr. Ng’s homage to choucroute, but his pot-au-feu has more obvious ancestors. The clarity and focus of the broth, along with the tenderness of the braised short rib, come from the classic French pot roast; the star anise and cinnamon in the broth are borrowed from Vietnamese pho. The short rib had something in common with corned beef, too, which along with the cabbage and mustard made me wonder whether the Irish weren’t also mixed up in this remarkable dish somehow. It’s the lamb breast, though, that really shows off Mr. Ng’s skill for harnessing the energies of his ingredients. Cumin seeds and Sichuan peppercorns have been stuck on the meat, and then a big flame-red gob of sambal has been dropped on top. Sesame sauce and a bed of jasmine rice lap up the spices. The dish could have landed like a brick to the back of the head, but its powerful flavors are handled with some delicacy. Nothing about Cassia is small. Not the dining room, not the menu, not the well-priced wine list, which covers about 80 bottles from Europe and the West Coast, and not the portions, which are really and truly meant for sharing. My table of three never made it to the bottom of a bowl of chickpeas sunk in a lush coconut yellow curry, as delicious as they were pinched in crisp triangles of flatbread from the clay oven. I left some of the charcuterie fried rice behind, too, even though I’d kept going back in for another taste of sweet lap cheong, pork fat and salted fish long after I’d stopped feeling hungry. On the other hand, my appetite was still intact when I lost interest in the jellyfish salad, the name an unsuccessful attempt to rebrand a sesame-chicken salad that would have been called “oriental” in the 1980s. Meals glide on currents of fish sauce and lime juice, steered by the staff’s attention to the mechanics of family-style service. Serving spoons arrive before you can ask, and bowls that are wet with the anchovy broth that is poured over black cod will be cleared and replaced before you’re brought the grilled pork belly over Vietnamese vermicelli noodles, slick with a dressing that is a little more concentrated and caramel-rich than usual. If there are any doubts that Cassia has a thick Gallic streak, the floating islands will dispel them. Yes, the puffs of meringue bobbing in lime crème anglaise are browned, but this is unmistakably the dessert that has disappeared into the mouths of a million French citizens. There is also a tart of dark chocolate with bananas in a pastry shell that is classically crisp. If I were to recommend one meal that captures some of the energy in the Los Angeles dining scene right now, I might come up with reasons not to mention Cassia. It is an outlier. It’s not exploring new horizons in fermentation, like Baroo. It doesn’t offer a direct connection to another country’s cuisine, like the dizzyingly good Sichuan mini-chain Chengdu Taste. It isn’t impossibly, irresistibly tiny, like Petit Trois or Le Comptoir. It doesn’t have the take-it-or-leave-it bravura of Night & Market (Song). It isn’t alluringly scruffy, like Gjusta, serving bialys to Venice beach bums. It’s not making an explicit appeal to the generation that grew up thinking of Los Angeles as the easternmost city in Asia, as Roy Choi’s places do. All these other options would flash through my mind. And then I’d wonder if maybe I were overthinking the question. Because, while Cassia is not the epitome of any particular trend, most of the food coming out of its kitchen is just really delicious.","Vietnamese sunbathing prawns; charcuterie platter; spicy wontons; grilled pig’s tail; green papaya salad; chickpea curry with clay-oven bread; whole grilled sea bass; Vietnamese pot-au-feu; grilled spicy lamb breast; beef rendang; charcuterie fried rice; floating island.

112,Gramercy Tavern,3 star,"Aug. 16, 2016",Pete Wells,Flatiron,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/dining/gramercy-tavern-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/dining/gramercy-tavern-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Long before it turned 22 last month, Gramercy Tavern had settled into classic status. It is a classic, but there’s a downside to putting a restaurant in that category. The more familiar something is, the harder it is to see. Like the other restaurants in Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group, Gramercy Tavern is virtually synonymous with a certain style of service. Cheerful, wholesome, engaging, proactive, the servers are the sort you’d be comfortable leaving young children with. (Mr. Meyer could run a great babysitting company.) Whether we walk into the easygoing front tavern or reserve a table in the more expensive and ceremonious dining room in the back, we take for granted that the service will be very good. When that’s all it is, and if we forget that Gramercy Tavern on a very good night is still better than most restaurants when they try their hardest, it’s possible to be mildly disappointed. The staff seems to understand that high expectations work against the place, though, and sometimes you can be treated to next-level hospitality. One recent night, our table had interrupted the march from main courses to desserts by sharing a small cheese plate. A cheese interruption is never a bad idea at Gramercy Tavern. What I really went wild for, though, was a simple condiment that arrived with the cheeses, a little dish of sour-cherry preserves. I ate it on a wedge of aged goat, I ate it on crackers, and after they were gone, I dropped red jam onto my finger from a spoon and slipped the finger into my mouth. To make space for the desserts, the cheese plate was soon cleared away. Not the jam dish, though, because I had covered it with my hand and smiled in a way that said, “You’ll have to kill me first.” This being Gramercy Tavern, I knew I’d win without a fight. But I didn’t expect a manager to swing by a few minutes later and say: “I told Miro how much you enjoyed the cherry jam, and he was thrilled. It’s his grandmother’s recipe, from Serbia, and he loves making it.” As if by magic, my piggishness had been turned into a compliment to the pastry chef, Miro Uskokovic, and my happiness had become the restaurant’s. This is what’s meant by the cliché “It’s our pleasure to serve you.” But it takes in-the-moment intelligence to bring that phrase to life. Gramercy Tavern can do that. Maybe I paid a little more attention to Mr. Uskokovic’s desserts from then on, noticing how gingered pineapple and crumbled pralines brightened the wonderful carrot cake, appreciating the innocent sweetness that angel food croutons brought to a cheesecake topped with dark, soft strawberries. Maybe I also enjoyed the desserts more because I was in a good mood. They had the openness and generosity of spirit that I’d admired at Untitled, where Mr. Uskokovic is also the pastry chef. The executive chef at both restaurants is Michael Anthony. In 2006, he took over at Gramercy Tavern from Tom Colicchio, who had run the kitchen from the beginning. As the torch passed, it sputtered. In Gramercy Tavern’s last review in The Times, nine years ago, Frank Bruni wrote about “forgettable” meals at the end of Mr. Colicchio’s tenure and a “clumsy, laughable one” at the start of Mr. Anthony’s. The new team finally hit its stride, and Mr. Bruni’s appraisal carried three stars. But the kitchen’s sensibility changed much more significantly than a restaurant trying to remain classic would normally allow. Where Mr. Colicchio would often focus on a star ingredient, Mr. Anthony’s dishes tend to be ensemble efforts. It’s as if he has fallen in love with everything he puts on the plate. He’s like somebody who goes to the farmers’ market hungry, ends up buying everything he sees, then figures out a way to make it all come together. A bin of small hot red peppers must have jumped into his shopping bag in early August, when he made them into an unusually forceful and perfectly harmonious foil for corn and very tender poached lobster. What to do with red currants, so pretty and so resistant to the spotlight? Mr. Anthony scattered them over a chilled marigold-yellow soup of summer squash, which needed their jolt of juicy tartness. Mr. Anthony’s keen sense of what to do with produce was on full display in the $110 vegetable tasting menu, of course. But I also saw it in the $125 tasting, where blackberries helped out a braised pork shoulder paved with crackling hazelnuts and where a supple hunk of halibut sat over warm summer tomatoes given a briny, oceanic intensity by scraps of kombu. Even over three courses at a fixed price of $98, Mr. Anthony gives you a sense of what’s going on that week in the vegetable patch that few chefs can match. These are the menus offered in the back dining room. But the keen responsiveness to the season still comes across if you order à la carte at the long, perennially busy bar or one of the tables next to it. I loved the taste of corn kernels and green tomatoes, sliced into see-through wheels, on a flatbread dotted with lamb sausage, and the way Mr. Anthony made room for cool peaches in a tomato-basil salad. For the Tavern’s dessert menu, Mr. Uskokovic bakes a pie that has pastry-crust stars on top of a dark field of wild blueberries — an edible flag. It would be hokey if it weren’t so good. The barroom is more than a low-priced alternative; it’s integral to the restaurant’s personality. For example, it sets the tone for the way people drink in both rooms. Gramercy Tavern’s wine list is justly celebrated for its catholic embrace of diverse regions and styles, but how many other restaurants make cider or a glass of beer (on draft or from one of the vintage bottles) seem like a natural choice with a dinner that costs $100 or more? Although it’s not as plush as the dining room, the tavern is more attractive. The colors of the fruits and vegetables in Robert Kushner’s scrolling mural above the bar still leap out at you after all these years. In the back rooms, the collision of Italianate arcades and ye olde timbered beams is more clearly a pastiche than it once seemed. The appeal of Gramercy Tavern transcends design, though. It springs from a sense of trustworthiness that is kept vital by acts of imagination like the manager’s report about the cherry jam and Mr. Anthony’s constant adjustments to the season. You can tell that people value that combination if you study the clothes they wear to eat in the front room. With a wait for tables that may be right next to the crowd at the bar, the setup there is not too different from the Spotted Pig’s, but most dress as if they were going to one of the nicest restaurants in New York. And they’re right.","Dining room: beef carpaccio; pole bean salad; striped bass, artichokes, shell beans and basil; duck breast and sausage; strawberry, whipped cheesecake and vanilla angel food cake crisps.

113,Olmsted,2 star,"Aug. 9, 2016",Pete Wells,Prospect Heights,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/dining/olmsted-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/dining/olmsted-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Olmsted, a two-month-old restaurant in Brooklyn, looks innocent enough. Not much in the dining room sets it apart from any number of other new places to eat. The houseplants whose vines slink down one wall may well come from Lowe’s. Toward the back is a cooking space big enough for two people; I believe the term in the trade is “a two-butt kitchen.” The chef, Greg Baxtrom, works on the outside of the pass, putting the last touches on dishes that cost no more than $24. But hidden inside this simple and approachable neighborhood restaurant is another, more unusual one waiting to get out. Your first clue comes when you head out to the garden before dinner for a drink and encounter the livestock. At the bottom of an enamel claw-foot bathtub by the rear door, crayfish scuttle for cover as you get close. At the far end of a long, raised bed of radishes, against the back fence, is a bird coop. Living inside are one mottled quail and an all-white one, an experimental breed, no doubt the first of its kind to settle in Prospect Heights. This is not normal neighborhood-restaurant behavior. I’ve tried to garden in a Brooklyn backyard, and I’ve tried to raise crayfish. Each effort was done in by unforeseen complications. (Shade, cannibalism.) Olmsted is more serious about its backyard farming than I was. Mr. Baxtrom’s chief partner in the restaurant is Ian Rothman, the founder of a 10-acre farm in Massachusetts and the former horticulturist at Atera in TriBeCa, where he grew kale and other greenery in hydroponic beds under lights in the basement. His urban farm behind Olmsted is a trickier project, and it includes a composter in which vegetable scraps are broken down by the larvae of black soldier flies that, after they mature, are fed to the crayfish. The peppery leaves of those radishes go into Olmsted’s gazpacho. Thickened a bit with potatoes, it comes across less as a gazpacho than a green vichyssoise. Poured into a bowl holding trout roe, gently pickled radish wedges and a mound of lemon balm foam, it is inarguably delicious. This recipe did not come out of the Brooklyn farm-to-table playbook. That’s true of most of the dishes Mr. Baxtrom has devised. For a cocktail snack, he’s come up with riceless nigiri — a strip of raw fluke, underscored with an aggressive stripe of Calabrian chiles and set on a bed of watermelon. Earlier, the fish sat on a snap-pea pod, cut lengthwise into a little canoe. It’s very good both ways, even if the watermelon sushi is a little drippy for finger food. The carrot crepe is a strange and fascinating appetizer. Arranged under or over the big orange circle of the crepe are buttered littleneck clams, carrots in several forms and a cluster of sunflower seeds. I didn’t warm up to the whole ensemble right away, but it got into my head and now I want it again. Sweet-pea falafel, a main course, takes no getting used to. Some assembly is required, though. Into the fluffy purse of a pea-flour pita (or peata, as the menu has it) you pack some wonderfully light balls of pea falafel and dress them with puréed and whole peas, a salad of cucumbers and currants, and labne mixed with cardamom and fresh mint. You taste peas, lots of them, but you also taste summer. Before he opened Olmsted, Mr. Baxtrom cooked at Alinea, Per Se, Blue Hill at Stone Barns and Atera, where he met Mr. Rothman. You can see the influence of those kitchens in the way he treats falafel as a showcase for vegetables and carrots as a backdrop for clams. At least as impressive is one thing that Mr. Baxtrom didn’t take from those restaurants. He hasn’t locked up his thoughtful and original food inside an hourslong tasting menu. Individually, tour-de-force meals at the sort of restaurant where Mr. Baxtrom trained can be exhilarating. Collectively, what they represent is hard to cheer: the birth of a new restaurant elite that is even more exclusive than the old guard. What is particularly depressing is how many talented chefs now use what they know about ingredients, visual composition and other areas of expertise to devise menus that justify prices only a small number of people can afford. It’s similar to the way our best-known architects, rather than trying to make our homes and workplaces better, use their knowledge to build dazzling trophies. Even Olmsted’s least expensive main course, of course, is beyond the reach of many people in its neighborhood. But that doesn’t make it less impressive to see Mr. Baxtrom keeping prices low relative to other restaurants with Olmsted’s level of inventiveness. He cooks fish that are plentiful and, not coincidentally, cheaper. I missed dogfish’s run on the menu, but the other week I very much enjoyed the seared pollock he served with a tart cherry sauce and a panzanella made with juicy cherries and cherry tomatoes. (When I tried an earlier iteration using hake and rhubarb, the texture of the fish wasn’t as fine and the rhubarb sauce was a little sweet.) Torn scallops, bought at a discount, are threaded on skewers and charcoal grilled. They are as good and fresh as if they were whole, and I love how the pasilla chile in their dry rub nips at the sweetness of the creamed corn they rest on. There is no $100 roast chicken but there is guinea hen two ways for $24. The breast meat is shot through with a fat green vein of ramp mousse; even more appealing is the second installment, a braised confit of the legs under morels and a lush ramp hollandaise. (If you’re there when the hen’s liver has been made into a honey-topped terrine, order it.) When you don’t like something, it never seems like a good value, and that’s how I felt about a “Thai beet salad” that had too many crunchy ribbons of raw beet and not enough of whatever was supposed to make it Thai. It’s off the menu now. The kitchen backs off on the complications with dessert. Both the bowl of frozen yogurt, sweetened with whipped lavender honey, and the chocolate mousse, made by somebody who understands chocolate mousse, are simple and effective. The wine list was put together by Jeff Ruiz. He is another veteran of Atera, where a wine pairing with the tasting menu costs $195. At Olmsted, two-thirds of the bottles cost less than $60. A handful are under $40, a price range restaurants that pay attention to wine rarely bother with anymore. Olmsted is no competition to Atera and the other elite restaurants like it. But it is, in some ways, a challenge to those places, or at least to their notion that the best stage for a chef’s talent is the most expensive one.","Watermelon sushi; radish-top gazpacho; carrot crepe; English pea falafel; dry-rubbed scallops; guinea hen; frozen yogurt; chocolate mousse.

114,Agern,3 star,"Aug. 2, 2016",Pete Wells,Midtown East,Scandinavian,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/dining/agern-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/dining/agern-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Almost everyone who has lived in Manhattan has had the dream. Wandering through your apartment, you see a door nobody has noticed before. On the other side, you find that you have been living all along with extra rooms: enough space for an office, a guest bedroom, a painting studio, a walk-in closet, a tiki bar, a library. That sensation is what you get walking into Agern for the first time. Just off a corridor in Grand Central Terminal that you’ve probably rushed down hundreds of times, behind a set of doors locked for longer than most New Yorkers can remember, a restaurant has appeared. In the three months since it opened, Agern has made both the train station and the city’s dining landscape into roomier, more interesting places. There are no windows, and the front entrance, at the top of a short flight of stairs, is marked by a small sign that’s easy to walk past. This makes Agern (AY-gurn) feel like a quiet harbor away from the eddies and currents of commuters outside. Hours can slip away. In the modern Scandinavian dining room, pale wood, charcoal seat cushions and wall tiles in mossy Grand Central green create a calming mood. It’s like a spa with tasting menus and cocktails. The primary owner is the Danish restaurateur Claus Meyer, one of the founders of Noma, in Copenhagen, and of its New Nordic cooking style. New Nordic is not so much a cuisine as a philosophy. Its followers value traditional methods like curing and smoking, and seek out forgotten or overlooked ingredients from nearby. Mr. Meyer recruited Gunnar Gislason, the chef of the New Nordic restaurant Dill, in Reykjavik, Iceland, to run the kitchen. Mr. Gislason has imported Dill’s philosophy but not, for the most part, its Icelandic provisions, like the dried sheep droppings over which fish is smoked. Buying food raised around New York, he and his chef de cuisine, Joseph Yardley, treat the city as another Scandinavian capital: Oslo-on-Hudson. Sign on for the Field and Forest menu, a vegetarian excursion through seven courses with a salvo of finger foods (the $120 price, like all the prices at Agern, includes service), and the plants you eat are mostly those you could buy at Union Square Greenmarket. What the kitchen does to them gives them an unfamiliar and often transporting cast. There was, for instance, a potato salad that caused double and triple takes. The potatoes had a restrained but durable smokiness. They were served with shaved rhubarb, ramps and feathery red seaweed, which carried a memory of the ocean. Finally, long yellow bands of cured egg yolk had the salty, intensifying effect of bottarga. That salad has been replaced by one with lemon cucumbers and fleshy summer melon, but the cured egg remains, giving the fruit and vegetables a depth I didn’t expect. Preserved blackberries, tart and a little salty, brought a welcome sharpness to endive salad, dressed with mild and creamy havgus cheese and chopped almonds. Sweet corn and fresh chanterelles are a classic summer match, but I had no idea how wonderful they could taste with the addition of tarragon and golden raspberries. The Land and Sea menu costs $25 more. In the New Nordic spirit, the animal flesh is not supplied by overworked and unsustainable ingredients. It comes from more humble stuff. Rather than foie gras, there is beef heart, chopped into red filaments that provide ballast and iron to a salad of skinny asparagus stems and garlic scapes with tart green slices of unripe strawberries. Instead of bluefin tuna, you eat skate, cooked gingerly to keep the appealing gelatinous softness, under celery and batons of apple. Heirloom pork is not the loin but the neck, imbued (too strongly?) with rosemary and served with a crisp, simple, creamy and very good salad of green beans. The two menus are not that far apart. Sometimes they are separated by a single ingredient: A few briny spoonfuls of trout eggs get the potato salad admitted to the Land and Sea menu. From time to time, they converge on an identical dish like the unaccountably delicious potato fry bread, a fritter of sourdough mixed with mashed potatoes, or the roasted beet. The last time I ate at Agern, this had become “our famous beet.” It does seem to have been consciously designed to be talked about. It’s carved on a cart next to the table after being liberated from the salt-and-ash crust it’s baked in. The crust is supposed to give the beet the flavor it would pick up over a wood fire, but it didn’t taste smoky to me. My first bite was impossibly salty, too. But after that, its natural flavors were deeply concentrated, and the underlying beet salad, flecked with fresh horseradish and fried caraway seeds, was stunning on its own. So was the tiny loaf of sunflower-seed rye bread, wonderful with beets mashed into it and even more wonderful under a thick coat of butter. These thumb-size loaves are baked by Rhonda Crosson, and I think they are at least as good as her big rounds of sourdough, and those are exceptional. Agern’s pastry chef, Rebecca Eichenbaum, showed how resourceful she could be in her last job, at Wassail, where she spun elaborate desserts out of parsnips and carrots. She is no less inventive at Agern, but the results are a little less effortful, even as she tops ripe berries with a kombucha ice made from rose petals or doubles up on the tartness of sorrel sherbet with curls of barely sweetened rhubarb. Many of these can be ordered individually, a considerate option from a restaurant where on the wrong night the tasting menus can inch forward like the rush-hour local to New Haven. My last meal lasted more than four hours, for no discernible reason. There may be travelers, or even nontravelers, who would be happy with two courses and dessert. I’d suggest, though, that they stay away from the $68 “24-day hung beef”; whatever flavor it picked up from hanging was stamped out by horseradish cream and horseradish leaves. In Denmark, Mr. Meyer is also active in delis, bakeries, a coffee roaster and other concerns. Last year, he moved to New York, and he is adapting to his new home with the same entrepreneurial energy. In Brooklyn, he has opened a bakery and a coffee roaster under the direction of a star of the Copenhagen caffeine scene named Omar Maagaard. Mr. Maagaard’s beans are brewed into Agern’s espresso and pour-overs, which made me think for the first time that the people who compare coffee to great wine are not completely barking mad. And I say this having lived through five excruciating minutes during which coffee was brewed drop by drop atop a digital scale. (For tableside drama, digital scales run a distant third to sharp knives and open flames.) Following the buy-local spirit, most of the other drinks are grown in the United States. Chad Walsh has put together a list of domestic wines, beers, spirits, cider and mead. (Strange things are happening in mead, a beverage that is pretty strange to begin with.) As you leave, you’re handed a cloth sack or two. Inside you may find a small sourdough loaf with a jar of butter or bright, freshly cooked raspberry jam. Or a bottle of cold-brewed coffee. They could be advertisements for Mr. Meyer’s tentacular operations, I suppose, but ads rarely taste so good the next day.","Bitter salad; beef heart; potato salad; skate wing; pork neck with bean salad; all desserts. $120 for a vegetarian tasting menu; $145 for a nonvegetarian tasting menu; appetizers $14 to $26; main courses, $29 to $68.

115,Pasquale Jones,2 star,"July 26, 2016",Pete Wells,Little Italy,"American, Italian",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/dining/pasquale-jones-review-little-italy.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/dining/pasquale-jones-review-little-italy.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"As a New Yorker who wants each neighborhood to be different, each block to be like a pocket with a secret tucked inside it, I have strongly mixed feelings about gentrification. As a critic confronted with shiny new restaurants in changing neighborhoods, though, I have to admit that I often end up liking the shiny new places more than what came before. So I didn’t waste time worrying about the other Italian restaurants on the south end of Mulberry Street when Pasquale Jones took up residence there in February. Those indistinguishable Little Italy flytraps with their sidewalk hawkers, their holy-communion-ready wines, their lifeless linguine facedown in a shallow pool of clam sauce: They could stand some competition. And the wandering hordes now stand a better chance of tasting New York-style Italian food. Pasquale Jones is the second restaurant from the Charlie Bird team, led by the chef Ryan Hardy and two wine scholars, Robert Bohr and Grant Reynolds. The three of them squeeze so many of the prevailing casual New York-Italian tropes into this glass-walled dining room on the corner of Kenmare and Mulberry Streets that it’s virtually a showroom of the genre, circa 2016. There is the menu that flits from pasta to pizza to small plates to the inevitable rib-eye for two. (It’s $125. If you try it, tell me how it is.) There is the wine list that roams outside Italy and tries harder than it needs to. And there are wood-burning ovens where most of the food is cooked, which you can see from the tightly organized tables or from a perch at the kitchen counter. At Pasquale Jones (as at the French-Italian L’Amico and the California-Italian Upland, among others), pizza is not a single-minded pursuit but a menu category. The crust is crisp and airy, speckled black around the rim. The kitchen didn’t get much mileage out of squash flowers by wilting a few on a bed of mozzarella, with some cherry tomatoes and dribbles of pesto. It sounds like a straight shot of summer breeze, but the flavors didn’t ride along. I did have fun with the pizza that had four big white clumps of burrata, one for each tomato-slathered and oregano-seasoned slice. I’d like to thank the server who suggested folding the triangle like a taco, which kept the soft cheese from cascading into my lap. One pizza that rises above toppings-on-dough status to cohere into a memorable whole is the clam pie. A little cream extends the flavor of juicy chopped littlenecks marinated in garlic. That could get Pasquale Jones run out of New Haven, but on Mulberry Street, it’s a great idea. The pastas are also more sideline than specialty, with just three on the menu most nights. The fresh noodles are particularly good. They keep their firm, egg-dense snap, like the strands of tagliatelle in a soft-spoken rabbit ragù or the thin tajarin with corn, cream and a cotton-candy puff of shaved summer truffle. Dried spaghetti from the Martelli family’s tiny factory in Tuscany is a constant, too. One night it was dressed with very fine bits of blue crab in a sauce that was so full of vitality I wanted to shoot it into a vein. I could have done it, too, with what was left at the bottom the bowl. The inevitable small-plates section is a catchall category for vegetables, seafood and the odd detour into offal (stewed tripe that still has a pleasant, octopus-like bounce in its chile-enhanced tomato sauce, or a breaded and fried ball of head cheese, gooey and alluring). Charcoal-grilled curls of cuttlefish with green tomatoes and mint were impressively meaty and sweet. On another night, squid had stayed on the coals too long, although I enjoyed the wild chickpeas that came with it. They were yellow and flattened, as if somebody had pinched them one at a time. A main-course portion of striped bass, though, left the oven at precisely the right time, with all the juicy mild sweetness still under the skin. The plate was minimally adorned with wilted escarole, a few crisp green olives and dabs of olive sauce: a textbook case of knowing when to leave a good piece of fish alone. If you’ve heard anything about Pasquale Jones, you have probably been told to order the pork shank for two. That advice is solid. So is the shank itself, a golden knot of meat that shines with melted lardo. One dessert a night is the rule. Usually it is fruit that’s been slipped into the wood oven and arranged around a simple ice cream, although one night I happily ate uncooked strawberries and whipped cream. Tiny elderflowers had been strewn on top, and while they didn’t add much flavor, they did provide the momentary suspicion that the kitchen had been taken over by fairies. This long and restless menu gives Pasquale Jones a master-of-none quality. Several pizzerias have more finely tuned doughs or dynamic toppings; other kitchens reach much deeper into the pasta canon. There are a lot of little reasons to eat at Pasquale Jones. For big reasons, you have the clam pizza and pork shank, maybe, and the wine. No maybe about the wine. Like Charlie Bird, the restaurant has a wine list that is longer than Donald Trump’s speech last week. It starts with a “seasonal short list” of, at last count, about 65 bottles. Then it really gets going. France and Italy dominate, with a few passing glances at other countries. Under the major regions are entire subsections of bottles from producers whose names make wine freaks and big spenders get sweaty and bug-eyed: Raveneau, Tenuta San Guido, Conterno, Coche-Dury, Chave and a little upstart Champagne maker by the name of Dom Pérignon. Who is buying these bottles? At least their prices have the effect of making everything else on the list seem incredibly cheap. I ordered a bottle of what Mr. Reynolds called “the house Champagne,” a nonvintage brut reserve from Bérêche et Fils that he recommended with pizza. It costs as much as four pizzas. O.K., not cheap, but reasonable as restaurant Champagne prices go, especially for one this layered and energetic. Pasquale Jones is right that bubbles go well with pizza, but it doesn’t have as many affordable options as it could. (The award for best inexpensive sparkling wine selection in a New York pizzeria goes to Marta.) Reds, whites and rosés under $65 are easier to find on the short list. Whatever you spend, your wine is poured into a crystal glass with a stem as thin as a lollipop stick. They weigh almost nothing, these glasses. Lifting one takes so little effort that the wine arrives at your mouth before you’ve had a chance to think about it. The first time this happens, it’s startling. Then you never want to drink from any other glass.","Littleneck clam pie and other pizzas; pastas; roasted fish; pork shank for two; roasted fruit desserts.

Mimi barely ruffled the waters of the crowded pond of New York dining when it materialized on a quiet Greenwich Village block last fall. The partners had never owned a restaurant before. The chef, Liz Johnson, was 25 years old. Although she had been cooking for a decade, it was hard to draw a bead on her busy work history. The critics waddled in gradually, giving the people at Mimi the rare luxury of time to find their rhythm. Each was more enthusiastic than the last, culminating with Brett Martin of GQ, who in May put Mimi on his list of the country’s best new restaurants. Mimi looks like an updated version of the French bistro New Yorkers dream of finding in the Village. In the front is a little parenthesis of a bar that ends at a sheet of white marble with dark Rorschach veins. The bar’s surface is stainless steel, not zinc, but you still get the idea. The tables are small and lined up one after the other, which brings you close to the people you’re eating with and to people you weren’t planning to eat with. So what. There are classical little cocktails and bluesy cocktail jazz to go with them, just what you want to hear at a fantasy bistro. The Mimi I encountered in early spring, though, seemed unprepared for national attention. Ours was the first table seated that night, and already the kitchen was out of the monkfish liver. This was unexpected, because it had been written on the menu by hand below that day’s date. After we ordered, our server came back to say that the lobster we’d wanted was gone, too. We still ate well. Ms. Johnson took marvelous ingredients and led them toward luxuriousness with a little imagination and a prodigal use of butter. To start, we shared firm pieces of raw madai in brown butter with lemon curd. Snails in a crater of puff pastry tasted clean and meaty, and the unannounced sweetbreads were a welcome surprise. There was also a long, rich, generous slab of tuna belly paved with a dark-green mash of shishito peppers — an odd idea and a good one. Other dishes could have used more precision. Five excellent, sweet scallops sat on creamy blots of bottarga sauce over black rice that had been swirled with more butter than it needed or could hold; the butter pooled on the plate. At dessert, the keen taste of rhubarb couldn’t quite break free from an over-thickened rhubarb gel on a blancmange. Over the next two months, while good reviews rolled in, I waited for Mimi to come into focus. It was even more blurry the next time I went. About half the meal was delicious in ways I rarely experience in other restaurants. Very gently crisped eel and fleshy yellow peaches went with a strong mustard sauce that sent fumes up the back of my nose, and the combination made neural pathways begin firing that had never seen action before. Less daring, more elemental, was lamb cooked until the fat melted into the soft pink flesh. The sauce was a rough pesto of nettles, nothing fussy about it, with a creamy brick of pommes dauphinois. But the rest was seriously undercooked. Most of the bottom crust on a rhubarb tarte Tatin was pale and doughy. Parts of a grilled turbot were still translucent. When the soufflé for two was pierced with a spoon, batter oozed out the top. In each case, a quick look in the kitchen (or at the table, in the case of the soufflé, which cost $22) would have been enough to tell that more time on the heat was needed. It was as if Ms. Johnson had two kitchens, one in which superb ingredients lined up and did exactly what she told them to do and another in which the clocks were broken. The last time I went to Mimi, all the food came out of the same kitchen: the good one. True, and as usual, some items had already been eighty-sixed before the sun went down. Mimi may be the first restaurant in which servers greet tables not with “Do you know what you’d like?” but “Do you know what we’re out of?” But I’d arrived early, so I got what I wanted. I finally tried the two desserts everybody loves. One is a very dark and fluffy chocolate tart, so pleasurable it must have been a reward for some good deed I’d done by mistake. The other is a baba au rhum that is more lavishly creamy than most. It’s also less boozy, though that can be treated by the bottle of Venezuelan rum the server leaves behind. At the start of dinner there were crisp spring peas in a creamy and stealthily spicy sauce. Above this were three raw spot prawns, as good as I’ve had in any sushi bar. Their heads had been fried and lined up on a plate like helmets at a biker bar. This was one of the stranger meetings of French and Japanese cuisines I’ve tasted, and I liked it very much. A hunk of foie gras had been sautéed with peaches, and then the contents of the pan had been more or less dumped onto a plate. Many chefs swaddle and spoil foie gras as if it were a high-strung show dog. Ms. Johnson seems to understand that it performs better when it’s allowed to roll around and get messy. Which is essentially what two guests and I did when an entire Dungeness crab was plunked down in front of us. It looked like the centerpiece of a Chinese banquet. The legs, bright red and wet with snail butter, radiated around the body, which had been excavated and backfilled with crab meat that had been enriched into a form not too far off from lobster thermidor. We ate a lot of crab. We ate a lot of butter. Finger bowls appeared, and we rinsed our hands in them again and again. Ms. Johnson may still be figuring how much food to order. She probably needs somebody to tell her when a plate doesn’t look right. But she’s got something any number of more experienced chefs don’t: a clear and personal vision of French food as a celebration of appetite, an occasion to eat with joy and lust. Turn left at the bottom of a staircase to the basement and you come to the kitchen. Turn right and you find the restrooms. The walls are painted with wavy red curves. The curves form hips and arms and breasts. There’s a framed drawing of an undressed woman with a Louise Brooks bob who lies on her belly, toes pointing at the ceiling. Smoke from her cigarette curls toward the words NO SMOKING. Never has a sign undermined its own message more attractively.","Pork rillettes; madai in brown butter; slow-roasted lamb; roast chicken; chocolate tart; baba au rhum. Appetizers, $15 to $21; main courses, $26 to $39."
117,Nix,2 star,"July 5, 2016",Pete Wells,Greenwich Village,Vegetarian,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/dining/nix-restaurant-review-greenwich-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/dining/nix-restaurant-review-greenwich-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"There’s a lot of heavy eye contact going on at this restaurant. One of the most strenuous competitors is a guy at the next table who’s staring down the woman across from him while giving her a ferocious, what-big-teeth-you-have grin. I’d call his expression carnivorous, but we’re at Nix, and there’s nothing to eat here but vegetables. Not long ago, vegetarian restaurants in the United States were the last place you’d expect to see people who looked as if they couldn’t wait to go home and have non-tantric sex. The mood in their dining rooms could be tranquil, convalescent, earth-motherly, doctrinaire or ascetic, but rarely did it ripple with the energy of hookups in progress. The crackle in the air at Nix and other recent meatless restaurants is what you get when you liberate vegetables from vegetarianism. Stripped of ideology, Nix is freed up for hedonic pursuits. Sure, plants contain nutrients. But the people drinking Nix martinis probably aren’t doing it because they hope the oils left on the vodka’s surface by a thyme branch will boost their supplies of omega-3 fatty acids. Nor are the anti-inflammatory benefits of crucifers likely to be top of mind as they eat the cauliflower tempura. More likely, they are flashing back to the last time they sat on the floor eating Chinese food out of a takeout box. The fried cauliflower has been submerged in a sauce that tastes like spicy ketchup. Poppy seeds on top make a small but real contribution when one of these orange grenades of crunch and heat is stuffed, along with a pickle slice, into the soft, white half-moon of a steamed bun. The chefs lobbing those orange grenades at this four-month-old restaurant in Greenwich Village are Nicolas Farias and John Fraser. Mr. Fraser’s meatless menus at Dovetail, his home base on the Upper West Side, are much talked about. Stronger demonstrations of his wit and resourcefulness, his ability to treat vegetables like meat without seeming to be pulling a scam, are the spit-roasted beets and the coffee-laced carrots Wellington at Narcissa, his more casual restaurant in the Standard East Village hotel. One of Mr. Fraser’s collaborators at Narcissa is James Truman, a partner at Nix. That’s him in the pressed suit and rumpled hair at the end of the bar. He recognizes me, too. Before he got into the restaurant business, we used to run into each other at the parties of friends we have in common. As an editor at Condé Nast and later its editorial director, he used to worry about helping magazines see around corners. This approach informs Nix, which among other things is an attempt to locate the future of vegetable-centered dining. The white walls and other interior features, designed by the architect Elizabeth Roberts, have a low-key simplicity, and candlelight gives them a bit of mystery. The details don’t scream to be noticed. You have to look closely to see that the lamp bases are the twisted roots of old junipers. Understatement is, of course, flattering to the observer who picks up on it, which may explain why Nix seems to draw the upper crust of the downtown creative class, people with interesting jewelry and significant haircuts. I was hypnotized like a cobra by the patterns in the vintage dresses purchased for the hosts; the dyed cotton smocks designed by Paul Marlow for the female servers; and Mr. Marlow’s print dresses, one for each night of the week, worn by the wine director, Andrea Morris. But lavishing all this care on the women’s costumes while the male servers slink like ninjas in simple dark shirts and jeans can border on the fetishistic. Ms. Morris’s wine list also avoids the obvious. She has an Alsatian Chasselas, an Edelzwicker from Oregon and a lithe Pelaverga from the Piedmont, which Mr. Truman sold me one night as the product of a “banished grape.” (In fact, it has D.O.C. status in the Verduno area of the region.) Staying away from name brands has another benefit: keeping the prices on almost every bottle under $100. More like this, please. Editors occasionally follow their instincts right out the window. I think Mr. Truman has done this with the restaurant’s name. It comes from an 1893 Supreme Court decision, Nix v. Hedden, which held that tomatoes were a vegetable and thus subject to an import tax that did not apply to fruit. Mr. Truman also liked the look of the word with its “three strong letters.” What seems not to have entered the calculations, although it will occur to parents of school-age children and to any search engine, is that these three strong letters are also used by an over-the-counter delousing treatment. Now let’s eat! I highly recommend starting with a wheel of flatbread baked in the tandoor, and a cup of raw young vegetables or one of the dips. The red-pepper walnut spread is a wonderful take on muhammara, while the crushed avocado with mint and chai curry powder is fun because it looks like guacamole and isn’t. In the part of the menu labeled “lighter,” I like the little carrots baked in parchment with spices and bulgur very much. Tomato water, buzzed with fresh green chile rings, is so entrancing that it even made the mung beans bobbing in it taste good, although its higher purpose is to perk up a charred half of an avocado. In one salad, spears of Persian cucumber are splashed with a jerk sauce that’s coaxed back from the brink of too-muchness by crumbled goat cheese and, in an inspired touch, sliced kumquats. In another, jicama is shaved into what the menu calls ribbons. They’re more like seatbelts, and the dressing of blood oranges and Fresno peppers can’t quite get a grip on them. The menu’s third section is called “bolder.” Here you will find the fried cauliflower buns and shiitake mushrooms sauced, very effectively, as if they were pasta cacio e pepe and spooned over creamy, rough-grained polenta. There’s a bowl of stir-fried brown rice that, once it’s stirred up with nori, chanterelles and a runny egg, reminds me of bibimbap. Very occasionally, I wished the vegetables had been allowed to relax a little. Artichokes shouldn’t have to compete with broccoli rabe, tomato sauce and ricotta. Puréed sweet potato gets the right sauce, a pumpkinseed mole, but the line of reasoning that led the kitchen to pack the purée into rubbery balloons of tofu skin should be re-examined. Servers tell you at the outset of the meal that if you want to finish with the quartered pineapple roasted for 20 minutes in the tandoor, then brushed with tamarind glaze, you should order it early. This is sound advice. They won’t tell you that if you finish the whole thing, you may never make it to the rest of Italivi Reboreda’s dessert menu, including the dark and tender chocolate cake that is wrapped, jelly-roll-style, around chocolate mousse. But I will.","Tandoor bread; dips; avocado a la plancha; carrots en papillote; cauliflower tempura; shiitake “cacio e pepe”; brown rice stir-fry; charred asparagus with creamy morels; tandoor-roasted pineapple; chocolate mousse cake. Prices $12 to $24, apart from bread and dips."
118,Freek’s Mill,2 star,"June 28, 2016",Pete Wells,Gowanus,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/dining/freeks-mill-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/dining/freeks-mill-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Standing on a drawbridge one night early this month, a man and a woman stood close and kissed, blind to everything around them, even the motionless toxic porridge of the Gowanus Canal below their feet. About to cross the span, I stopped to give them their space. The Union Street Bridge in Brooklyn is not the Pont Marie in Paris. But romance can bloom anywhere, even on a Superfund site. Around the corner on Nevins Street, I’d just had an unusually enjoyable dinner at a restaurant that has been busy constructing its own Gowanus romance. Called Freek’s Mill, it is named after a pre-Revolutionary War gristmill powered by a race that emptied into the Gowanus, when it was still a creek. “The name Freek’s Mill references a time when people in the area not only knew where their food came from, but also where it was processed,” the restaurant’s website explains, adding, “The food we serve, clearly not from the canal or its long gone farms, comes wherever possible from the growers we know and love, who cultivate food based on taste and sustainable cultivation practices.” Scratch this story with your fingernail, and you quickly uncover a highly idealized view of the past. A century before Freek built his mill, Dutch colonists forced African-born slaves to turn the Gowanus marshes into farmland and dig the first millponds. The white settlers were lured by the Dutch West India Company, whose ships moved ingredients and other goods around the globe. It seems unlikely that most 18th-century grocery shoppers knew precisely where their cinnamon came from or where their molasses was processed. Fables of agrarian life are hardly unique to Freek’s Mill. They help form the narrative of the farm-to-table movement. In this case, they are also being used to recast the image of a neighborhood best known for pollution that makes the Flint River look like an Adirondack stream. Like most marketing, this should not be taken too seriously. Freek’s Mill is hardly a return to preindustrial living. But after two months in business, it is already a swell place to spend a night in a postindustrial zone where gentrification has moved as slowly as the fluid in the canal. There are smiles at the door on the corner, whether you walk in with or without a reservation. Servers wear gingham shirts, standard attire in restaurants broadcasting their affection for farms. Windows on two walls let the early-evening light into a spartan dining room with wide floorboards and a cheery bar. In the back are more tables across from a kitchen counter that faces a domed oven, a wood fire burning inside. Freek’s Mill, in short, looks not very different from other young, ingredient-minded Brooklyn restaurants from Greenpoint to Park Slope. But there is a little more air between the tables than usual. And there’s a little less attitude among the servers, even when they hit you with the news that nearly every white wine is a chenin blanc and that gamay is involved in almost all the reds. They’re cheerful about saying this, as they should be. Alex Alan, one of the owners, built the list to show how much range these grapes have. The wines are also flexible, wrapping themselves around whatever you happen to be eating. This is lucky, because so many things on Chad Shaner’s menu are worth trying. With half-grown chefs around the country getting attention for the two weeks they spent fondling beets at Noma, it’s something of a relief to learn that the highlights of Mr. Shaner’s career were jobs at Union Square Cafe and BLT Prime. Neither place has been in the vanguard of culinary innovation recently, but somewhere along the line, Mr. Shaner learned to cook food that really tastes good. The more you eat of his striped bass ceviche, the more interesting it becomes, as green chiles and tart, unripe strawberries meet the softening influence of basil crème fraîche. Mr. Shaner had the smart idea of turning veal Oscar sideways; asparagus, the traditional garnish, goes to the center of the plate. The crab meat and hollandaise go on top, with a sprinkle of Old Bay seasoning. The veal? There isn’t any, and you don’t miss it at all. The goal with fried soft-shell crabs is usually a delicate crust. Freek’s Mill goes the other way, giving it a very crunchy, thickish batter that you sometimes see on the fish half of fish and chips. You’d expect to find citrus in this dish, and you do, but it’s a cool surprise to taste lime juice mixed into the cashew butter swiped against the side of the bowl. I never met any bad dishes at Freek’s Mill, and only a few I wouldn’t try again. Chicken livers in a dandelion salad dotted with hard-cooked egg crumbs were cooked until they were dark and chewy. There’s precedent for this style, but I wished they’d been creamier. And barbecued kohlrabi served over grits just made me think about all the other things that could be barbecued and served over grits. We are, you won’t be surprised to learn, in the realm of small plates. Value can be hard to assess in this genre, and at Freek’s Mill, it is more complicated because service is built into the prices. (This is a no-tipping restaurant.) A big, smoky hunk of fat-streaked pork jowl with pickled vegetables and mustard sauce was a relative bargain at $19. For four rosy slices of dry-aged duck over a hard-to-resist mash of refried cranberry beans sweetened with rosemary honey, $24 didn’t seem out of line. But $25 was pushing it for three seared scallops with roasted lemon and asparagus, even if the scallops are strikingly fresh and sweet. And for $20, you may hope for more than a single short length of blackened octopus leg with potatoes and a chorizo vinaigrette. With dessert, the choices narrow. A slice of bread pudding in rhubarb syrup was just too wet, and an ice cream sandwich that’s meant to be a homage to Thin Mints, the Girl Scout cookies, wasn’t as much fun as it could have been. I suggest the strawberry clafoutis drowned under fresh cream that bubbles when it hits the iron baking dish. After dinner one night, I was standing across the street from Freek’s Mill reading emails when a bright light blinded me. “Do you live around here?” the driver of the police car demanded. “Am I doing something wrong?” “Well, you’re standing by yourself in a desolate area,” he said. Desolate? The officer wasn’t feeling the Gowanus romance yet.","Striped bass ceviche; wood-roasted oysters; soft-shell crab; Swiss chard agnolotti; asparagus Oscar; stracciatella with snap peas; roasted pork jowl with mustard; dry-aged duck with refried cranberry beans; stuffed quail; strawberry clafoutis.

119,Le Coq Rico,2 star,"June 14, 2016",Pete Wells,Flatiron,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/dining/le-coq-rico-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/dining/le-coq-rico-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I’m almost always the one who gets the chicken. For review meals, I try to let my guests choose their own food. Then I pick something nobody else wants. Often, this is the chicken. I think this can be explained by a remark a friend made recently. “I never eat chicken in restaurants,” he said. “I can make chicken at home.” So can I, but every time I go to a new restaurant, I hope the kitchen may know things about poultry that I don’t. Every once in a while, I’m right. At Le Coq Rico, a three-month-old restaurant on East 20th Street, I was right. In fact, I think I have finally found the perfect restaurant to take people who think they can make a better chicken at home. We’d ordered an old New England breed of chicken called Plymouth Rock for $95, along with a guinea fowl that cost a dollar more. Carved and fit back together, each bird was placed in the center of the table in its own iron roasting pan. Our eyes locked in on the bronzed skin and tapering curves of drumsticks with fixed and purposeful stares that, if we had not been humans looking at poultry, I would call lust. The meat had all the things I wanted and none of the things I didn’t. It was moist but not drippy or briny; compact and muscular but not tough; long on deep, rounded flavor that didn’t seem to rely on salt or sugar. Some of my guests preferred the chicken, calling the guinea fowl “sinewy.” It was a bit stringy at the joints, but once disentangled, the flesh had a flavor I found highly persuasive. Even the white meat tasted like dark meat. The menu suggested that one bird would feed up to four people. We nearly demolished twice as many, along with a macaroni gratin and a bundle of stout, dark fries that we dunked into a small pitcher of jus. After we were too full to go on, we noticed an untouched chicken leg. One of my guests ate that, too, down to the bone. True, he did it on a bet. But I suspect he would have done it for nothing. The chef and owner is Antoine Westermann. His distillations of the cuisine of his native Alsace at Le Buerehiesel in Strasbourg were widely praised before he handed it over to his son and moved to Paris. One of the places Mr. Westermann opened there is the original Coq Rico, a theme restaurant of sorts. Poultry (eggs, organs, broth) turns up in almost everything the kitchen makes, most spectacularly in the whole chickens that are first braised in chicken stock and then threaded on to a rotisserie. He gave Le Coq Rico a subtitle that is both irresistible and accurate: “The Bistro of Beautiful Birds.” By March, when he opened a Manhattan branch a few doors down from Gramercy Tavern, he had spent several months scouting for beautiful American birds. Mr. Westermann is particular about how long they spend pecking and strutting before they land on his rotisserie. The menu lists the age at slaughter — our server seemed to prefer “harvest” — for each breed on the menu, from 90 days for the Plymouth Rock to 130 days for the guinea fowl. “The industry standard is 40 days,” the server said, apparently used to fielding questions about these numbers. (Two more chicken breeds listed on the menu, New Hampshire and Cornish, weren’t available when I went; they are still enjoying country living.) A whole Brune Landaise (110 days), a French breed with milder flavor than the Plymouth Rock, is simmered in a clay casserole with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, artichokes, stock and a bottle of riesling. This, Mr. Westermann’s version of an Alsatian baeckeoffe, was terrific, with bewitching undercurrents of spice in a sauce that had body but no visible fat. The price, though, $120, made me queasy. A roasted quarter of the same breed, for $24, is Le Coq Rico’s offering for the solo chicken eater. The half-breast and thigh I tried were moist and flavorful but slightly inert, as if warmed over. If I came back alone, maybe to sit at the counter facing the kitchen in a narrow alley off the main dining room, I’d want the squab. Unwrapping the cabbage leaf around it, cutting into the handsomely roasted bird surrounded by foie gras stuffing, and dipping slices of excellent house-baked baguette into the glossy dark sauce is a sure route to Francophilia. Shopping for chickens, Mr. Westermann found eggs. Some go into Matthieu Simon’s desserts, one of which is awe-inspiring: the floating island, a single grapefruit-size ball of meringue with a crackling sugar glaze on top, resting in a pond of crème anglaise. The rhubarb soufflé is another good, if more routine, showpiece for egg whites. I’d choose either over the double-wide raspberry mille-feuille whose puff pastry wasn’t crisp enough to shatter. A Coq Rico meal could start with eggs, too — or, as the menu calls this group of appetizers, “Eggz.” It’s rare to find oeuf en meurette, in all its rich, spoon-coating, lardon-studded glory, made this well in Manhattan. Served with a heap of mâche and spicy pink hummus, sautéed chicken livers were glorious, combining the rich creaminess of a soft cheese with the metallic tang of organ meat. I expected great things from the chicken gizzards served with artichokes à la Barigoule, too, but their flavor seemed to have leaked out somewhere. From his days at Le Buerehiesel, Mr. Westermann has brought along the recipe for foie gras terrine baked inside a soft pastry crust. I’m not convinced this single slice of terrine is worth $32, but I don’t know anywhere in New York to get a better, cheaper version, either. The architect Pascal Desprez has slotted Le Coq Rico into a somewhat awkward U-shaped space. By the entrance is a bar where the cocktail menu promises, somewhat menacingly, “the dark side of Le Coq Rico.” There always seemed to be mild confusion at the host podium, and each time I was led to my seat, I was afraid I’d be deposited at one of the tables crammed into the narrow passageway. This hall opens in the back into a stylishly monochromatic dining room. Unless you have been to the Paris original, also designed by Mr. Desprez, the only things about the atmosphere that will strike you as French may be the peculiar pop music and, on some nights, Mr. Westermann himself, with wire-framed glasses on a head full of thoughts about chicken.","Oeuf en meurette; chicken liver salad; duck rillettes; seared foie gras; foie gras terrine en croûte; whole roasted chickens, guinea fowl and duck; squab in cabbage leaf; baeckeoffe; macaroni gratin; floating island. Appetizers, $12 to $32; individual main courses, $24 to $34; whole birds, $72 to $120."
120,La Sirena,2 star,"June 7, 2016",Pete Wells,Chelsea,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/dining/la-sirena-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/dining/la-sirena-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Somebody’s always on the move at La Sirena. Trotting up the steps to the entrance above Ninth Avenue. Getting up to say hi to a fellow prowler of the Chelsea galleries. Breezing across a full dining room to exit through a glass door to the terrace. Descending from a room in the Maritime Hotel upstairs and settling in for pancakes made with mascarpone and crushed almond cookies after the kitchen opens at 7 a.m. Casing the bar at night. Backing up to frame a picture that will prove they ate at Mario Batali’s new restaurant, his first in New York City since Eataly came along. The perpetual motion that supplies a lot of La Sirena’s energy — the rest comes from the dressy trattoria cooking overseen by Josh Laurano, the executive chef and a partner — is a function of geography and scale. There are matching north-and-south dining rooms, one near 17th Street and the other over by 16th Street. Each seats about 120 people. In between is a bar with the approximate dimensions of a jet runway. On warm, unrainy days and nights, another 150 or so chairs dot the terrace. It’s been easy to forget the excitement of eating in huge, kinetic restaurants lately because so many of them don’t offer much beyond that. The whole genre has gone out of fashion as modest little chef’s lairs have grabbed all the attention. Operations on La Sirena’s scale sometimes get knocked as “big-box restaurants,” as if any place seating more than 40 people were the equivalent of a Best Buy at the strip mall. Some of us hear “big” and think, “No, thanks.” And of course, Mr. Batali and his business partner, Joe Bastianich, preside over several restaurants that exemplify the charm of tight downtown rooms where the cooking can get close attention and the menus can have a targeted point of view. The one at La Sirena offers a little for everybody except, maybe, the person curious for fresh insights into Italian cuisine. The ground it covers is mostly the middle one. There’s orecchiette with tripe but no lambs’ tongue Jim Harrison (Casa Mono) or pajata finta (Lupa). What you notice are not dishes you’ve never seen before but ones you have: hulking meatballs, soft and pale inside with melting grated cheese; braciola, interpreted as braised rolled short ribs in a simple, ripe-red tomato sauce; clams baked under bread crumbs and oregano, jolted with a dab of chopped chiles in oil and a sweet slice of lemon. There is, in other words, very little breaking news, but what Mr. Laurano does, he tries to do with care and vigor and enough flourishes to keep your mind from wandering too far. Given the length of the menu and the sheer number of open mouths, though, it was probably inevitable that some dishes would have a certain numbness. In one appetizer, pickled anchovies sprawl over variations on fennel: shavings of the raw bulb in lemon and olive oil, other slices browned to a crisp, and fennel pollen, which carries its licorice sweetness around the plate. In another, fat roasted asparagus spears under grated smoked ricotta are piled over a cushion of cacio whipped with egg. Both are generous in size and flavor. Lasagna is layered with al dente wheels of waxy potato and a pesto as vibrant as if the basil had been picked 10 minutes ago. Tomatoes braised with spare ribs make a compelling sauce of ridged mini-torpedoes of cavatelli. Bucatini with bites of octopus, right on the border between firm and tender, have a tomato sauce with that low murmur of chile heat Mr. Batali’s restaurants are so adept at delivering. Servers like to recommend a half-portion each of two different pastas for $24. Take them up on it, and don’t be alarmed if they offer an opinion on whether your two choices work together. Mine always did. Mr. Laurano gives the main courses layers of complexity that go beyond standard trattoria cooking. The approach pays off for the lamb chops with a sweet-sour pomegranate molasses sauce and round chickpea-flour fritters, and for the grilled swordfish in a Sicilian tomato sauce with capers, olives, pine nuts and currants. When main dishes falter, it’s not because they’re too simple. It wasn’t pickled fennel that kept me from finishing a pork chop Milanese. It was the breading, thick and dense in a way that made me think of the apron you wear when you get your teeth X-rayed. The problem with porchetta alla Romana wasn’t the generous seasoning but the blubbery wrapper of under-rendered pork belly. And some fine, creamy white beans couldn’t disguise how little flavor there was in a baton of rabbit fried in bread crumbs. This kind of difficulty was rare among the pastas, although linguine with clams was pure Mulberry Street, a mop of bland noodles come to rest in a slosh of thin, salty sauce. In Michael Laiskonis’s desserts, there’s nothing but sophisticated pleasure. The baba is a citrus-soaked spongecake turned pink with Campari. The semifreddo looks like a baked alaska, a hedgehog of browned meringue around blood orange sorbet with a frozen core of honey nougat. Many servers in neckties and long black aprons traverse the multiple chambers of this restaurant. On a night when my table seemed to be the focus of special attention, I looked and saw neckties and aprons at the other tables, too. The staff never stood still, it seemed, until I got up and walked to the south dining room. Half a dozen servers stood idle in the middle of the room, as if on a smokeless cigarette break. It’s hard to keep all the billiard balls in motion at once. Even when they’re moving, it’s not easy to make them roll in the right direction, as Mr. Batali and I discussed in an email exchange after somebody on his staff served breadsticks to my son, who, we’d explained to two of our servers, has a serious sesame allergy. La Sirena’s bread is covered with sesame seeds, and the breadsticks were offered to him as a substitute. This was a well-meaning gesture, but they contained sesame seeds on the inside, as my son figured out after his mouth started to itch. This was a serious mistake, and dining room managers compounded it when they expressed concern without trying to find out exactly what had happened. Mr. Batali emailed me later that night. After I described the episode and let him know that the reaction had subsided before it got serious, he replied that he was apologetic and frustrated. His company, B&B Hospitality Group, has a full-time specialist in safety and environmental concerns who instructs all the food handlers on allergy protocols. After the incident at my table, Mr. Laurano also met with the staff to review procedures. As a parent, I was happy with that response. As a critic, I’ll keep an eye on the tendency toward entropy of large organizations. On a later visit, without my son, our server spent a long time going over the menu and taking our order. Two minutes later, he was back from the kitchen, looking a little embarrassed. “I forgot to ask,” he said. “Are there any food allergies at the table?”",Marinated anchovies with fennel; short rib carpaccio; Bucatini La Sirena; cavatelli with spare ribs; lasagna with pesto and potatoes; grilled lamb chops with panelle; grilled swordfish; beef braciole; baba al Campari.
121,Ruffian Wine Bar & Chef’s Table,1 star,"May 31, 2016",Pete Wells,East Village,"French, Wine Bars",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/dining/mr-donahues-ruffian-wine-bar-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/dining/mr-donahues-ruffian-wine-bar-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Keeping good small restaurants to myself is not what I’m paid for. Sure, I’ve enjoyed finding empty seats every night I’ve eaten at Mr. Donahue’s and Ruffian Wine Bar & Chef’s Table. Yes, I worry that both places would capsize under the strain of a party of six, let alone a full crew of hungry New York Times readers. But I didn’t take a newspaper job to keep secrets. I did it for the company stock. The smaller of the two is Mr. Donahue’s, although this is like a contest between a lentil and a chickpea. There are four chairs at two tables. Very nearby at the counter are five stools. Sitting at one, you see dime-store jars of hard candy, a lamp with a fringed pink shade, a Depression glass vase under a cloud of baby’s breath. You see a wicker monkey hanging by one arm above a window into the kitchen, where chickens make leisurely circles on a rotisserie. Most of these items were bought by the couple who own the restaurant, the chefs Ann Redding and Matt Danzer, who also own Uncle Boons. But the way they’ve put it together, everything just seems to have gradually accumulated over the decades. It’s as if you’d stepped into one of the little lunch counters with unpremeditated décor that used to be found in this part of town before it was called NoLIta. Five main courses and about twice as many side dishes are spelled in white on a letter board that has a blue-and-red Pepsi logo at the top. You pick two sides and a sauce at no extra cost. They will be served next to your main course on a sectioned china or glass plate, each in its own well, another tune from the past. We’re not supposed to want to eat this way anymore. Maybe that’s why, when I got my chicken-fried pork cheeks with Swiss chard and crab imperial, I was filled with gratitude. The chard was cooked with a little garlic and lemon and bread crumbs. The crab tasted of mayonnaise and Tabasco and had been browned and warmed inside a heavy foil dish in the shape of a crab shell. I spread it on saltines from a crinkly cellophane wrapper and ate it with the sensation of having found something I’d lost such a long time ago that I’d forgotten about it. Under rough whorls of golden batter, the cheeks were more tender and juicy than chicken-fried steak ever is. I ate them with a fine sauce of button mushrooms and Marsala, not too sweet. The romesco sauce — unorthodox, with more spicy red oil than usual — was very good with a whole porgy or the broiled steak of steelhead trout that replaced it. Honest-to-goodness gravy, rounded and meaty-tasting, is what you want with the heroic slab of roast beef. The beef was thoroughly rosy except at the edges, where it had a salty, crunchy, herb-flecked crust. The rotisserie chicken tasted like rotisserie chicken. With so few voices in the room, you almost always hear the music, which is soft and sounds as if it were coming from a tube radio that is still picking up an AM show that was broadcast a couple of years before the Beatles played Shea Stadium. It’s all big bands and crooners singing sweet words that are sad underneath, like “I’ll be seeing you in all the old familiar places.” (The only place he’ll be seeing her is in his head.) Cheap nostalgia hands you a fake past to make you smile. True nostalgia is mixed with pain because it conjures a past that was real and isn’t coming back. The nostalgia Ms. Redding and Mr. Danzer bring to Mr. Donahue’s is the second kind. Every detail shows their longing for the bygone world of Mr. Danzer’s grandfather Frank Donahue. He was a detective. His police cap sits on a shelf. For dessert, there is a root-beer float, if that’s what you want. Me, I’ll probably keep ordering the banana pudding forever, or until this mirage on Mott Street goes under and joins the past.  Just west of Tompkins Square Park in the East Village, Ruffian Wine Bar & Chef’s Table has more seats but not much more space. There’s barely enough room to squeeze your way to an empty stool at the concrete counter. The ones who are really in a tight spot, though, are the two chefs, Josh Ochoa and Andy Alexandre. Jammed behind one end of the counter, they arrange cheeses with house-made jam, warm some marinated olives that are as smoky as bacon, toast sliced baguettes for a knockout tomato chutney, plate some crisp, young radishes with bagna cauda, spread out sliced cross sections of fennel bulbs marinated simply and deliciously with sherry vinegar and fennel seeds, and plunge an immersion blender into batters that will go into the tiny convection oven and emerge as three-inch soufflés. The cheese soufflé, almost like a tower of soft scrambled eggs, makes a lush spread for toast darkened with a swirl of balsamic vinegar. The last time I went, it had been replaced by an equally good one with crab. I expected to like the beef tartare, but its sherry vinegar dressing made it too soupy and sour. I had no expectations of lentil salad, but it’s one of the best things on the menu. A variety of lentils and other legumes are firm, separate, not at all mushy, seasoned with dried chiles and curry leaves, swirled with yogurt sauce, and sprinkled with crisp threads of sev, the chickpea-flour snacks. Suddenly, dull old lentil salad is an exciting Indian street festival. (Mr. Ochoa and Mr. Alexandre met Patrick Cournot, an owner and a sommelier at Ruffian, when they all worked at Tabla.) There is usually a savory pie, either a big and imposing thing to be carved into wedges, or a small turnover filled let’s say with a well-seasoned mince of rabbit meat. The profiteroles are odd and overelaborated, with an acidic cream of mandarin oranges. The chocolate soufflé is better, if you have time to wait. In this kitchen, the only way to cook is one dish at a time. But of course you have time; you’re here to drink wine from a list that evidences Mr. Cournot’s open-minded curiosity. Like every other wine bar in town, Ruffian stocks some stars of the natural wine movement. It’s also picking up on the Georgian signals coming out of the Caucasus. But other choices show an independence from the latest trends, like a violet-scented pinot noir from Chile. Elena Hull Cournot, Mr. Cournot’s wife, has given this tight alley a surprisingly light, almost airy design, although the detail I remember most is the portrait of a horse on the back wall. She painted it with it a garland of orange flowers around its neck, like a lei. It has kind eyes and a nonjudgmental expression, fine traits in a portrait that hangs in a bar. A friend who has a lot of horse sense said, “The horse looks wise.” Horse, I’ll be seeing you.",Chicken-fried pork cheeks; roast beef; Swedish-American meatballs; crab imperial; steamed artichoke; pickled beets; banana pudding. $16 to $26 for a main course and two sides; cash not accepted. 
122,Indian Accent,2 star,"May 24, 2016",Pete Wells,Midtown,Indian,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/dining/indian-accent-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/dining/indian-accent-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The emails from New Delhi began last spring. A new one arrived every few months, informing me that a branch of a restaurant in that city named Indian Accent was about to open in Midtown, and urging me to check it out. “Dear and Most Revered Mr. Pete,” one began. “Just wanted to let you know about the greatest Indian restaurant in the World.” Another praised the original location’s kulchas, or stuffed flatbreads, particularly one filled with duck and hoisin. “It’s as Indian as Padma Lakshmi,” my correspondent wrote. “But definitely more delicious.” These notes were my first exposure to the cult inspired by Manish Mehrotra. Since opening Indian Accent in a small hotel on the outskirts of New Delhi in 2009, he has become one of the most admired chefs in India. Mr. Mehrotra’s style is lightened by modern influences from abroad (he has trained in other Asian countries and worked in London) but anchored by the culture he grew up in; at his New Delhi restaurant, a scoop of kulfi may be served in a toy pressure cooker, an appliance roughly as common in Indian homes as microwaves are in American ones. In India, Mr. Mehrotra’s cooking feeds a desire to see traditional food bent, twisted and played with until it tastes new again. New York could use more of that, too. Junoon and Tamarind Tribeca are on the short list of comfortable, modern Indian restaurants where you can get dressed up for food that looks pretty on the plate. But surprises, ladled out by an active imagination working in an Indian mode, have been scarce since Tabla closed in 2010. Indian Accent, which finally opened in February at the foot of Le Parker Meridien Hotel, has surprises. It also has all the comforts of a restaurant where the prix fixe menu offers three courses at $75 (or $90 for four). Except for one gold wall at the far end of the restaurant, the interior stays away from anything that may play into preconceptions of how Indian restaurants are supposed to look. At the sharp-edged marble bar, cocktails are infused with tea and spices and made with a care that overcomes goofy names like Transcendental Medication. Tables are set with stiffly pressed napkins and thin-stemmed wineglasses — a cue to pay attention to Daniel Beedle’s list, which is well stocked with aromatic whites and savory reds that know how to get along with layered spices. Mr. Mehrotra shares the title of chef with Vivek Rana, who will eventually take charge of the kitchen. Duck kulcha isn’t on their menu, but the kulcha stuffed with pastrami and mustard helped me see why my New Delhi informants had been so excited. “The chef got the idea for this dish from Peking duck,” our server said as he set down a long wooden tray with a copper pan of shredded lamb at one end, a stack of thin griddled flatbreads called rumali roti in the other, with cucumber spears and four kinds of chutney in the middle. One of those was hoisin sauce subcontinentalized with tamarind, which did bring Peking within shouting distance. But as I folded a roti around some soft spiced lamb and spooned on one chutney or all four — they were great separately and great together — I kept thinking about tacos. Letting China, Mexico and the Carnegie Deli barge into an Indian restaurant without having the dinner turn into a chaotic grab bag is an impressive feat. And fried squid sprinkled with puffed rice and chickpea-flour threads to turn up the crunch factor? Well, why not, especially when the squid is dusted with a spice blend that could make a tongue depressor taste good. I don’t know how to categorize the “sweet pickle ribs.” They are not, in fact, pickled, but, in their tart mango sauce with strips of dried mango on top, these tender baby backs are so good I’d eat them under any name. The soy keema is a marvelous thing, too. This version is less like the original keema, a stew of ground lamb and peas, than it is like an energetically spiced filling for a vegetarian sloppy Joe. I’m seeing a takeout window with lines outside on 57th Street. It’s possible I got the whole idea from the delicious tiny rolls, perfumed with lime leaves, that accompany the keema on a skewer, looking like marshmallows ready for a campfire. Mixed in with the outstanding dishes are some that won’t inspire many international emails. Kolhapuri chicken, a chile-fueled curry from western India, appears as an appetizer of cold chicken salad that you could feed to the least adventurous eater you know. Fried shiso leaves looked impressive standing upright in a pile of potatoes and water chestnuts drizzled with chutney, but the batter was too thick for the herb to have much impact. Indian Accent is a young restaurant, still learning to transplant an approach that worked in New Delhi to Manhattan. It can take time for chefs to sort out their suppliers in a new region. Fillets of sea bass glazed with tamarind had a muddy, bottom-feeder taste that we don’t usually seek in wild saltwater fish. The menu is less confusing than it was at first, although the crossbreeding of a prix fixe setup with à la carte supplements can still be awkward. The lamb, for instance, costs an extra $38. The price is fair enough for a platter that is bigger than many main courses around town, but I wish it didn’t have to be stapled to the already considerable cost of a meal. The complexity of deciding what or how to order is one reason servers are prone to waitsplaining. Dinner requires a lot of patient listening and smiling in these early months. True, the menu is paved with terms some New Yorkers will trip over. I was happy to learn that the sweet potato shakarkandi are tender cubes stacked over shaved kohlrabi in one of the best small starters. But I’m always impatient to start eating, especially if what’s on the way is a dessert as wonderful as the makhan malai. Traditionally a street snack, here it is a fluffy mound of aerated saffron milk sprinkled with rose petals, almonds and palm sugar. The fun of the dessert is in the way these crystallized toppings transform the unsweetened saffron milk once everything meets inside your mouth. It’s the kind of happy collision that few restaurants in town can deliver as well as Indian Accent.","Kulcha; ghee roast lamb; sweet potato shakarkandi; soy keema; sweet pickle ribs; soft-shell crab koliwada; pork vindaloo; makhan malai; treacle tart.

123,Momofuku Nishi,1 star,"May 17, 2016",Pete Wells,Chelsea,"American, Italian, Korean",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/dining/momofuku-nishi-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/dining/momofuku-nishi-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Searching for money, for love and for food, we strike bargains. We may be content with one for years until we begin to be shadowed by the suspicion that the terms aren’t working out in our favor anymore. That doubt nagged me at Momofuku Nishi, which the chef David Chang opened in Chelsea in January. Early in his career, with Momofuku Noodle Bar and Momofuku Ssam Bar, Mr. Chang and his customers struck a deal that made decades of dining tradition look obsolete. He and his cooks could make Asian ingredients bend in new directions. The cooking could be gloriously unwholesome or willfully esoteric or stunningly precise, but it was never quite like anything else out there. In return for tasting these new sensations, Mr. Chang’s customers gave up amenities that used to be automatic at restaurants hoping to be taken seriously. When it comes to inflicting discomfort, Nishi still holds up its end of the bargain. You can make reservations, but not for a table, most of which are long and low; you’re likely to share yours with strangers. Instead, you reserve a chair, which, strictly speaking, is a seat built like a hard, flat crate. Ssam Bar has similar seating, but the lighting is more seductive and the noise level is less throttling. At Nishi, highly sensitive microphones seem to be placed directly above all the loudest people, picking up and amplifying their every screech. Mr. Chang told the Eater restaurant critic Ryan Sutton in March, when Nishi was two months old, that the acoustics “have to get better.” Reading that, I stayed away for six weeks, hoping for improvements. When I returned, the only obvious change was that more sound-dampening tiles had been affixed to the ceiling. If they helped, I couldn’t tell. In a phone interview, Mr. Chang told me he is “going crazy about the sound, but we are working actively to do the best we can.” Nishi is still as loud as the opening face-off of Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals. Temporary soreness of the butt and throat were always potential downsides of a Momofuku meal. Back when we first agreed to the bargain, though, the food was so distractingly original and good that you wouldn’t have minded eating it while leaning up against a Dumpster in an alley sharing your chopsticks with GG Allin. At Nishi, you mind. The strongest dishes are exquisitely controlled plates of cold vegetables or protein that could easily fit into the lineup of a marathon menu at Momofuku Ko, the tasting counter where Nishi’s executive chef, Joshua Pinsky, cooked for more than five years. Shavings of watermelon radishes and raw beef veined with white fat are sprinkled with ponzu-enhanced dashi and a Spanish olive oil that really stands out. Threads of celery curl around raw mackerel, given a breath of char and bathed in a soy analogue fermented from rye, with a precise flicker of yuzu. Sea scallops dusted with salted, dried kelp rise from a green juice that tastes like cucumbers, peppers and herbs — or maybe it’s just wheatgrass? These dishes and others like them are extraordinarily good because the ingredients are allowed to speak quietly. But when the kitchen reaches for the throttle, the results can be muddled or muted. Snails and anchovies seemed to be straining to keep a $55 prime rib from seeming ordinary and slightly dry. Where was the salted crust? Where was the invitation to give in to fleshy temptations held out by Ssam Bar’s rotisserie duck or its pork shoulder? Mackerel was almost perfectly cooked, but nothing about it made me want to come back for more, not the lukewarm daikon hiding under it nor the barbecue sauce spread on top, a blend so complex and balanced it canceled itself out. Allegedly, Nishi is Mr. Chang’s foray into Italy, although that’s not at all apparent until you dip into the noodles. The clams grand Lisboa is, I guess, a twist on spaghetti alle vongole. The fun of it is the way skinny chow mein noodles have been toasted before cooking, so you get some soft strands and some crackly ones in the same bite. Footnotes on the right side of the menu provide cryptic references to source materials. The one for the chitarra points toward the chef Mark Ladner’s pasta with crab meat and jalapeños. That dish is memorable. The Nishi version is not. Mr. Ladner’s bright clarity is replaced with a confusion of dried squid, XO sauce, fermented chiles and chile paste. One time it was spicy but too sweet; another time it was less sweet but not spicy enough. The dish everybody talks about is called ceci e pepe, a takeoff on cacio e pepe made with chickpea hozon, a fermented paste made and sold in tiny amounts by Momofuku. Hozon does taste a bit like cheese, but not like the pecorino used in a classic cacio e pepe — it’s missing that wild pasture flavor of sheep’s milk. The dish is also missing a few degrees of heat; like some of the other noodles, ceci e pepe has a habit of arriving lukewarm. A homage this far off the mark would be fine if the goal were to avoid animal fats, but butter slips around the strands of house-made bucatini. I don’t know why this dish exists, except to find a use for a proprietary Momofuku product. Too much of the cooking at Nishi is self-referential, inward looking and so concerned with technique that you can’t help being conscious of it. In his early days, Mr. Chang served the kind of food chefs like to eat: intense, animalistic, O.K. with messiness, indifferent to prettiness. Nishi serves the kind of food chefs cook to impress one another. As Mr. Chang’s operation has grown into a global concern with branches in Australia and Canada, his restaurants started to offer amenities that were once unimaginable. The cocktails at Nishi, like the margarita with an absinthe rinse, are clever in the right way. There is satisfying range on the wine list, too; the nuanced Farrside pinot noir from Australia is a far cry from the sparkling shiraz that was one of the only bottles Ssam Bar carried in its first year. If dinner in Changland now includes intelligent drinking, why can’t it also encompass seating and acoustics that won’t leave your lower back in knots and your eardrums in shreds? When we made our original deal with Momofuku, we were all kinds of swept away by the rush of flavors we had never encountered before. Now that Mr. Chang has a dozen years’ worth of protégés and copycats, now that he even seems to be copying himself, now that the rest of us have cooler heads and other options, it’s time to take another look at that bargain.","Diver scallop; beef crudo; shaved vegetables; fried whole shrimp; clams grand Lisboa; grilled sweet potato and anchovy; bitter greens and vegetarian XO; pistachio Bundt cake.

124,Café Altro Paradiso,2 star,"May 10, 2016",Pete Wells,SoHo,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/dining/cafe-altro-paradiso-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/dining/cafe-altro-paradiso-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Over the 11 or so weeks Café Altro Paradiso has been open, I’ve taken some photographs that are as awful as the food is good. The restaurant’s carpaccio is simple and marvelous, a single piece of raw bison pounded so thin that when it is laid over small, newly fried potato chips and a mound of arugula salad, it drapes like purple silk. My picture, though, could be a close-up of a skinned knee, or an aerial shot of a dormant volcano made out of flesh. One night, a whole turbot was roasted on the bone until its skin neared blackness. Its upturned mouth and fan-shaped tail hung over the edges of a plain white plate. On the side was an off-white gob of mayonnaise in a small white dish, which did nothing to improve my picture but did taste very good on the edge of a forkful of sweet, slightly sticky fish. If you added a sprig of curly parsley, the restaurant’s lamb chop could come from a 1950s supper club. A meat with two sides, it’s barely photographable, and I’d eat it again in a minute. First, I’d go after the white shell beans cooked to the brink of collapse. Then I’d take a strip of Calabrian chile with a forkful of the chop. I might skip the slices of roasted shoulder on the side of the plate — a little tough — but not the thin curve of meat and fat that, left on the outside edge of the bone, crisped up like bacon. I’d save it for last, like an after-dinner chocolate. This can’t be an accident, the inverse relation between prettiness and deliciousness at Café Altro Paradiso. The kitchen — Aidan O’Neal is the chef de cuisine under the direction of Ignacio Mattos, the chef and an owner — seems to be trying to strip food down to the bare elements of flavor. Dressing it up again would be like tacking vinyl siding to the concrete front of the Met Breuer, where Mr. Mattos plans to open a restaurant this year. Refusing to decorate its plates doesn’t seem to have hurt business. There’s been a steady flow of curious diners who know or know of Mr. Mattos’s first restaurant, Estela. His partner in both is Thomas Carter, a front-of-house specialist with a concentration in wine. Neither man was especially well known when Estela opened in a low-ceilinged and stubbornly noisy space a few steps above Houston Street, but Mr. Mattos had an instinct for cooking that was direct and idiosyncratic without seeming forced, and Mr. Carter put together a list so full of accessible discoveries that Estela could be seen as an unofficial wine bar. The place quickly achieved cult status. (After President Obama took his wife there for a dinner date in 2014, the cult went global.) For their second act, Mr. Mattos and Mr. Carter seem to have fantasized on the theme of a simple Italian cafe. Servers at Café Altro Paradiso wear proletarian button-up jackets of navy blue cotton as they carry amaro and tiramisù on silver trays to the bare wood tables. The high ceilings and the vast windows facing the peeling trunks of plane trees in a cobblestoned SoHo park suggest that eventually the dining room will be a fine place to enjoy a tranquil and possibly solitary breakfast or lunch. Only dinner is served now, and it’s far from tranquil, although the partners have clearly learned a thing or two about acoustic panels since they opened Estela. The greater comfort of this casual spinoff is a paradox, though not one anybody is going to complain about. A second paradox deserves a moment’s pause, though. In keeping with the small-plates regimen followed at Estela, most of the portions at Café Altro Paradiso are deliberately small. Servers make a point of telling you that the pasta is not the size of a main course. This could be a problem for people who walk in under the impression that they are in a normal Italian cafe. Say you were in the mood to sit at the bar with a glass of Lugana from Cá Lojera, a Lombardian white with fresh tropical-fruit overtones, eating ramp pesto over very flavorful whole-grain spaghetti for dinner. Would you be delighted to find that you could transfer all the spaghetti in your bowl into one cupped hand? But for now, just play the kitchen’s game and schedule pasta as a midmeal diversion. Eat the slow-cooked chicken ragù brightened with briny green olives and tossed with skinny, chewy tubes of garganelli and you should be happy. Have the near-transparent sheets of cannelloni rolled up around a light, unsoggy filling of ricotta flecked with greens, and you should be even happier. Before pasta, there is grilled bread with cut-up anchovies, chile oil and parsley on a bed of butter; or pale fennel shavings with orange zest and soft curls of good provolone; or a pink and juicy Italian sausage with fruity mustard and chopped broccoli rabe; or the carpaccio. All of it sounds ordinary but is far from it. After pasta, you might investigate that supper-club lamb chop, or the polenta and stewed onions under a lobe of calf’s liver, so creamy inside it’s like a pink organ-meat custard. I’d sidestep the thickish pork Milanese, no thrill especially when served with unsalted peas and favas. Sometimes Mr. O’Neal and Mr. Mattos manage to push simplicity in directions that seem novel. Other times, they don’t push quite hard enough, and it’s hard to tell Café Altro Paradiso apart from the hordes of other restaurants where you can have cheese and salami followed by a so-so pork cutlet. Like the portion sizes, the interestingness quotient may need fine-tuning as the restaurant grows up. This seems well within the grasp of Mr. O’Neal, who in his last job, running the kitchen at M. Wells Dinette, helped bundles of spaghetti transition into sandwich form, among other exercises in the art of channeling chaos. And it should be old hat for Mr. Mattos, whose cooking at Isa a few years back was at times interesting to a fault. One very encouraging sign is how perceptively the pastry kitchen has located the sensuous side in some traditional Italian-cafe sweets. The dark and bittersweet chocolate-walnut torta is intense without congealing into fudge, and the rhubarb crostata has a crust that’s a pleasure on its own. Even the gelato is a nice surprise. There’s a rich and unusual one with honey and chestnuts, and another with dried figs and vin santo. It reminds me of the classic French ice cream made from prunes and Armagnac, but without the booze on its breath.","Spicy anchovy crostini; carpaccio; spaghetti with ramp pesto; garganelli with chicken ragù; calf’s liver; swordfish; chocolate and walnut torta; fig and vin santo gelato.

125,Chaiwali,1 star,"April 26, 2016",Pete Wells,Harlem,Indian,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/dining/chaiwali-review-indian-food-harlem.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/dining/chaiwali-review-indian-food-harlem.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Greeting us when we walked into Chaiwali, the Indian restaurant she runs on the first two floors of her brownstone in Harlem, Anita Trehan had two tables to offer. All the others were taken. It was a busy Friday night. “I have this long wood table here,” she said. “Or,” she continued, extending one arm toward the foot of the staircase leading to a second-story dining room, “I have this beautiful little marble table right there.” She sounded as if it were a prize she had been saving for the first people she thought would appreciate it. Now, this table sits in a tight corner. Its edges are deeply scalloped, so once our samosas and smoked eggplant arrived, it became clear that the marble surface was even smaller than it looked. But by that point, it didn’t matter. The owner, who is also the chef, the decorator and the occupant of the house’s upper stories, had proudly seated us at a piece of furniture she had bought and placed there because she liked the way it looked. What were we going to do but settle in and see what else she wanted to share with us? This must be one reason large, diverse crowds have descended on Chaiwali since it opened last year despite its fairly low profile outside the neighborhood. So many restaurants that draw more publicity seem interchangeable: Nobody would notice if they traded menu items, light fixtures or any employees short of the chef. Chaiwali does not always have their caliber of professionalism; servers are genial but may forget dishes, and when it’s time to clear the table, they may disappear into the vapor. But it does have its own way of looking at the world. Ms. Trehan seems to have built the restaurant on the belief that the things she likes will make the rest of us happy, too. You see this in eccentric bits of decoration, like the stuffed peacock that perches on the upstairs bar. The whole second floor is a bit of a peacock; there’s also a taxidermied antelope head and a flamboyant mural of a tigress and butterflies. A wall of glass looks out over Lenox Avenue, but the real scenery is inside. The downstairs dining room is calmer, with an intricate pattern traced on the exposed brick walls and a row of windows facing the garden, where a big communal table sits inside what looks like a giant birdcage. Maybe the peacock used to live there. The menu feels personal, too. It reminds me of the relaxed, light-handed, modern food that Americans with roots in India, like Ms. Trehan, may cook at home. Her recipes probably aren’t her grandmother’s, but she pays attention to the quality and balance of saffron, fenugreek, ginger and coriander. What comes out of her kitchen looks attractive, but it hasn’t been whipped into stiff peaks of fine-dining artiness. I could imagine being invited to a dinner party where Chaiwali’s smoked eggplant dip, full of garlic and juicy black olives, was put out with hot sheets of flatbread while everybody limbered up over cocktails. “Just Samosas,” as the menu calls them, might appear next. They have a potato-pea filling with a decidedly peppery bite. It’s a treat to find samosa wrappers as thin and greaseless as these in a restaurant. In the winter, the first course could be Chaiwali’s silky carrot soup, intensely flavored with saffron and a few fried curry leaves that float on the surface. In summer, maybe the appetizer would be the Goa shrimp ceviche, sweetened with little cubes of mango; the host would tell everybody to dump the little saucer of puffed rice and fried threads of chickpea flour over the top for crunch. Then, if you were in luck, she might carry vindaloo lamb chops to the table, having marinated the meat with vinegar for tenderness and ginger for flavor. Chaiwali makes vindaloo with complexity and nuance, nothing like the aggro-curry the color of a rusted tailpipe served in generic Indian restaurants. It comes with potatoes softly roasted with whole mustard seeds, a recipe that I am going to steal. Other main courses can expose the kitchen’s vulnerabilities. The small pieces of black pepper chicken were dry both times I tried the dish. The pool of lightly curried tomato gravy helped, though, and I enjoyed the nutty and firm red quinoa served in place of the traditional rice. The okra fries served with the excellent sautéed fish, seasoned with mustard seeds and herbs, then dredged in a delicate rice-flour batter, sounded great in theory. In practice, their crust was going soggy one night, and while it was quite crisp and hot on another, some of the long green pods, cut lengthwise, were a little stringy. Still, I’d order either dish again, which I wouldn’t say about the Desi pasta, which changes night to night but which, when I met up with it, was tossed with a shiitake-cream sauce. I remember nothing about it except the color, which I’d call off-mustard. The clever veggie burger, a tall fritter of kale pakora with avocado, lettuce and tomato on a bun, made a more appealing meatless dinner. Desserts find a happy medium between too basic and too complicated. The one called Alice’s Jamaican rum and biscuit pudding tastes something like a tiramisù spiked with booze. Mango whipped with yogurt and goat cheese is like a lassi turned into a mousse. (There’s an actual mango lassi on the drinks menu, and it’s good, too.) The one dessert that scared me was the one I liked best: the curry cumin cookies. These little ginger-spiked bites, crumbly like shortbreads, are refreshing and bright, with a black pepper finish that took me by surprise in the best way. The cookies worked a small miracle that nothing else has ever accomplished: They actually made me want a cup of chai. But the chai at Chaiwali is not the lukewarm broth of dirty milk in a paper cup that you get in coffee shops. It is a potent mocha-colored drink, like a cortado made with strong black tea and spices. It was Ms. Trehan’s desire for a cup of chai made the Indian way, the way she used to enjoy it in Delhi, that drove her to open Chaiwali. Of the many reasons people have for starting a restaurant, the desire to serve something they themselves want to eat and drink is one of the best.","Goa shrimp ceviche; samosas; Delhi smoked eggplant mash; vindaloo lamb chops; shrimp and chickpeas; masala fish; mango mousse; curry cumin cookies.

126,The Spotted Pig,1 star,"April 19, 2016",Pete Wells,West Village,"English, Italian",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/20/dining/salvation-burger-spotted-pig-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/20/dining/salvation-burger-spotted-pig-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman’s newest restaurant, inside the Pod 51 Hotel on East 51st Street, is called Salvation Burger. I can’t say that the first word of the name filled me with hope. The last time this chef and her business partner offered us salvation in a Pod hotel, they gave us Salvation Taco, a thronged taqueria designed for, and seemingly run by, people who don’t know what a taco is. That second word was promising, though. Ms. Bloomfield definitely knows what a burger is. There are many good things on her menu at the Spotted Pig, the first restaurant she opened with Mr. Friedman. But each time I ate there recently to see how it was settling into its second decade, it was Ms. Bloomfield’s burger I saw on almost every table, high and proud next to a tumbleweed of shoestring fries. And it’s her lamb patty under feta and onions at the Breslin that is most likely to tempt diners away from the other meaty, fatty delights. At Salvation Burger, she zeros in on what the people want and dispenses with almost everything else. Three of the five main courses are burgers, and all five come on a bun. She also knocks out bar snacks like popcorn and beef jerky, along with salads and pies, but nobody will accuse Ms. Bloomfield of padding the menu. The beef burgers come in two forms, highbrow and lowbrow. Representing the former is the Salvation Burger itself, a tall, tender half-pound patty of ground beef with cheese and mushrooms on a sesame seed bun. Servers like to say this is “cooked like a steak,” but not many restaurant steaks are grilled over a wood fire. Maybe they should be. This burger combines a dark crust that has the specific flavor of charred beef with a soft interior evenly cooked to medium-rare so when you bite down, it surrenders its warm pink juices. Slumped in a dirty tank top in the lowbrow corner is a double-decker burger called the Classic. If the Salvation Burger tastes like a steakhouse, this one tastes like America. The two patties, pancaked to a blackening crunch on the griddle, sprawl beyond the borders of the bun, running with “special sauce” and yellow cheese that works as a second sauce. Pickles are hiding inside, good ones, but everything on this burger comes together in a single impression that bypasses analytical thinking and goes directly to raw, thumping want. The Salvation and the Classic would seem to cover the twin poles of burger lust, but for those who aren’t moved by beef, Ms. Bloomfield makes a vegetarian patty of carrots and lentils threaded by clear vermicelli of sweet potato starch. The spices are Indian and the effect is excellent; it is not a meat substitute but a very flavorful concoction in its own right. Whether you want the fried fish sandwich depends on whether you can be content with the taste of tartar sauce while everyone around you is wiping beef fat from their lips. That the sauce is whipped up in the kitchen probably won’t be the deciding factor either way, just as knowing that Ms. Bloomfield is turning Cheddar into a facsimile of American cheese won’t be a huge consideration for those who want the Classic. (The kitchen’s motto could be “simple food the hard way.”) The house-baked buns, on the other hand, do make a difference. The top-split roll with a Parker House flavor is a major contributor to the all-around excellence of the oversize hot dog that runs with juices like an Italian sausage when you break its seared skin. Buried under a spicy confetti of giardiniera, the hot dog is this restaurant’s sleeper. At $14, will it become a hit? The $25 price on the Salvation Burger doesn’t seem to have hurt it, even though fries cost another $7. (These sagged with oil the first time I tried them, but stood up straight as Popsicle sticks on later visits.) I couldn’t warm up to the incongruous combination of sweet cocktail sauce and garlic butter on the wood-roasted oysters, but I’d come back again just for Salvation Burger’s rich and bittersweet chili, made with the shanks from the sides of beef that are broken down and aged in the kitchen, on their way to burgerhood. For dessert, what else but pie? The standard pies still need work. The crusts are both too thin and too soft, and the ones with a thick dairy layer, like the banana cream pie with translucent banana chips stuck into its surface like armor, aren’t as creamy as they should be. Far more appealing are the fried pies, golden rectangles filled with apples or blueberries. All they are missing is a wax-paper envelope to pick them up with. They taste better when you eat them with your hands. Even with dessert and a wait for a table, a meal at Salvation Burger won’t swallow your entire night. This isn’t the case at the Spotted Pig. The crowds haven’t thinned appreciably since the place opened in 2004, and you still can’t reserve. Once you’re finally seated, a three-course dinner can take a couple of hours. After my most-recent dinners there, I left thinking that there had to be more rewarding ways to spend the evening. One time, my party of four was quoted a 90-minute wait. We passed the time at an extremely pleasant cocktail bar down the street, Orient Express. When no text had come through after an hour and a half, one of us went back to check. “You’re looking at another 45 minutes,” a host said. No apology, no smile. In fact, we were seated much sooner than that, but our moods were scuffed. Another night, another cooling-off period, another what-do-you-want greeting: Our server, when she finally noticed our table, stood next to it and said nothing. This was a little tense. Finally one of us blurted, “We’re ready to order some stuff.” “Some stuff or all the stuff?” she asked. The servers at Spotted Pig give the impression that they are going to get up to something at the end of their shift that’s more interesting than whatever I’m going to do. This can be charming except when they seem in a hurry to get there. When they finally let you eat, the food can be wonderful. The smoked haddock chowder is a creamy bowl of winter solace, and when it was succeeded on the menu by a minted sweet pea soup with soft shredded ham hock, I cheered for spring. I loved being reunited with an old Pig standby, the bitter green salad with lobes of lemon pulp and pigs’ ears fried to a crackerlike lightness, and I have a new appreciation for the plump mussels in a lightly sour curry that tastes of toasted spices. But there can be a haphazardness to the cooking that wasn’t always part of the bargain. The much-praised sheep’s milk gnocchi can be gummy and dense, the chicken liver toasts can be oversweetened with reduced Port and Madeira, and a big slug of horseradish cream was so cold it cooled the skirt steak it was plopped on top of. When the Spotted Pig was last reviewed in The New York Times, in 2006, Frank Bruni added up the pleasures and subtracted the inconveniences to come up with a one-star rating. Ten years later, the equation is slightly different, but the sum is the same.",Chili; Salvation Burger; the Classic burger; fish on a bun; veggie burger; hot dog; fried pies. Prices $5 to $25.
127,I Sodi,2 star,"April 12, 2016",Pete Wells,West Village,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/dining/i-sodi-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/dining/i-sodi-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Medium-rare is how I ordered my tagliata, a grilled sirloin that is, like almost everything else at I Sodi, prepared the way it would be in Tuscany. Right away I changed my mind and asked for it rare. I wanted the sliding smoothness of nearly raw beef. The server thought I had it right the first time. “We cook the steak on the lighter side,” he said. “Medium-rare here is like rare in the rest of America.” Although it has been in business on one of Christopher Street’s less rollicking blocks for eight years now, I Sodi seems not to have fully assimilated into the United States. It exists in its own extraterritorial jurisdiction, like the headquarters of the United Nations. To eat there is to abide by the laws of eating that Rita Sodi, the chef and owner, brought with her from the farm north of Florence where she was raised. These private laws dictate a menu that is rigidly Tuscan. In its only previous review in The New York Times, an unstarred notice in 2008, Julia Moskin reported that I Sodi offered one risotto, two pastas, three main courses and “a couple of salads.” The menu has grown since then, but it has not wandered into other regions of Italy. And if you are inclined to pop your head into the kitchen to ask for fettuccine Alfredo topped with grilled shrimp, you may want to make sure that Ms. Sodi does not have a knife in her hand. The laws also require cooking that is mercilessly yoked to the season. When artichokes are good, they will appear on the menu under antipasti (sliced into a clean and guileless salad of pale, papery shavings that squeak between your teeth, dressed with shards of Parmigiano-Reggiano and a peppery young olive oil); contorni (fried until their young leaves are curled, crisp and bronze); and primi (layered with béchamel into a green lasagna, as plump and yielding as a featherbed, with so many thin and tender pasta sheets that I have never been able count them all, though I should say that I am usually preoccupied with eating them). Above all, the laws demand that Ms. Sodi dedicate herself so thoroughly to the Tuscan ways of stewing meat sauce, crimping ravioli or squashing Cornish game hens under an iron weight that her own ideas almost completely disappear. She does have ideas, of course. But they do not scream for attention, and neither does she. In her cooking, her ego disappears into her pride in where she comes from. This, along with the slightness of her opening menu and some early trial and error, may be why Ms. Sodi waited so long for recognition. A small squall of publicity finally rained down on her in 2014, when she opened Via Carota with the chef Jody Williams. (The two were married last year.) But I Sodi is still known, by the New Yorkers who know it at all, more as a neighborhood beacon than as a chef’s turn in the spotlight. The current food scene rewards egotistic gestures of novel techniques or ingredient pairings above rigorous devotion to tradition like Ms. Sodi’s. But there can’t be any doubt that she is one of the city’s great pasta practitioners when you eat I Sodi’s square little chestnut-filled chestnut-flour tortelli in a sauce of butter and grated cheese, or butter-slicked ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach under fried sage leaves, or spaghetti cacio e pepe, noodles that twirl up into your mouth with a wiggle, carrying a black-pepper bite that lingers on and on. In I Sodi’s kitchen, main ingredients are prohibited from hiding. Chicken is fried inside the thinnest shroud of crust imaginable, one that fuses with the skin into crunch without substance. The baked branzino is sweet, dense, naked except for olive oil; it doesn’t need even a drop of lemon juice. I used to believe that beef tartare needed to be blasted with lightning bolts of salt, mustard and other seasonings until I heaped some of I Sodi’s on a long slice of grilled bread. It tasted like raw beef — filet mignon in firm pieces the size of a blueberry — and extra-virgin olive oil. It did not taste salty, although it must contain salt. Salt is allowed to hide. Sugar is, too. This makes some desserts more implacable than they should be, like the crostata spread with a layer of orange marmalade so thin that viewed from the side it would disappear. But it’s nice to have the natural sweetness of cream and milk in the panna cotta left mostly alone. As for the laws governing customers at I Sodi, they are lenient. If you want to eat at one of the eight or so tables that are draped in white cloths, make a reservation. If you want to eat on one of the 16 backless leather seats at the bar, show up early. The dining room is spartan, tight, untheatrical and almost always packed. According to some stalkers of Italian flavor, you should stay away from I Sodi’s risotto, for which other regions are better known than Tuscany. Certainly the underseasoned and gummy mushroom risotto I left on my plate recently couldn’t compete with any of Ms. Sodi’s pastas. There is no penalty if you don’t drink one of the seven Negroni variations, only rewards if you do. Drinking two, at $13 to $15 each, will be cheaper than a bottle of wine. There are some real treats on the list, many from exactly the region you’d expect, but very few cost less than $70. It is the only aspect of the restaurant that makes me wish Ms. Sodi were more willing to compromise.","Steak tartare; artichoke salad; pasta; coniglio in porchetta; pollo frito; whole baked fish; panna cotta.

128,Lilia,3 star,"March 29, 2016",Pete Wells,Williamsburg,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/dining/lilia-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/dining/lilia-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"My one-sentence review of Lilia for the too-long-didn’t-read crowd: Missy Robbins is cooking pasta again. That is all you need to know before you begin plotting a night at this casual Brooklyn restaurant with Manhattan-level underpinnings. Lilia’s menu has many other very good things, but pasta made by Ms. Robbins is a direct route to happiness that has been shut off to New Yorkers since she left the two A Voce restaurants in 2013. Slip a fork into the pappardelle with veal Bolognese. Shiny with just enough herb-flecked sauce that one noodle peels away from the rest as you lift, they are rolled so thin that they’re almost weightless. Taste them, and you notice their delicacy along with the naked simplicity of the chopped veal gently cooked into tenderness with dark and meaty dried porcini. There is no milk in this Bolognese and no tomatoes apart from some juice, but nothing is missing. Stab an agnolotto, bring a parcel of sheep’s milk ricotta and feta in gorgeously supple yellow dough to your mouth. It’s been rolled in melted butter with honey and saffron threads. The perfume is subtle but insistent, and when it threatens to be too much, you bite into a soft dried tomato. Why did everybody turn against dried tomatoes? At the right time, they’re wonderful, and this is one of those times. The ricotta gnocchi are tender cheese dumplings that seem to be held together by nothing but the force of Ms. Robbins’s will. Their sauce is a crunchy pesto of broccoli and pistachios, spring-green and exciting. The ruffled edges of long belts called malfadini carry melted butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano with the peppermint tickle of pink peppercorns. Some sources call this shape “mafaldine” and say it is named after a Princess Mafalda. Our server said the word meant “badly cut,” but this can’t be right. There is no badly made pasta at Lilia. Like Barbuto in the West Village, Lilia inhabits the shell of an old garage. This one, in Williamsburg, is full of bleached wood and white furniture that seem chosen to reflect the sun coming through the windows and skylights in the early evening. And as with Barbuto, the food is Italian, confident and coursing with energy. The intent of every dish seems to be making you glad you’re there. Ms. Robbins gets across her points using only a few ingredients that haven’t been contorted out of shape. She has the assurance of a chef who has been at it long enough that Barack Obama was a fan of her cooking at Spiaggia in Chicago before he was the president. Now proprietor of her own shop, she stands each night at a bend in the counter separating Lilia’s dining room and kitchen. To her right is a wood-burning grill that runs as hot as a forge. The cooks stationed in front of it look as if they are baking in their jackets, like potatoes. They gulp water from plastic quarts, enduring the heat while out at the tables, eyes go wide over the flavors coming off the flames. One night, there was a quietly smoky chicken leg under spicy olives mashed with capers and brightened with mint leaves. There were thin stems of broccoli rabe, too, tasting unusually sweet against the olives. You could eat this once a week, and it would not stop tasting new. Another night brought a flank steak of veal wearing fresh herbs and olive oil. It had been grilled to the soft pink of medium-rare pork, but its flavor was more precise and nuanced. I wish more restaurants would find veal of this quality and cook it so simply and well. But meat is a minor motif. Grilled seafood is a major one, second in importance only to pasta. The menu separates it into “little fish” of appetizer size and “big fish,” which aren’t all that big; they’re normal main courses. One of these, grilled black bass with exceptional little roasted potatoes, was spread with a really energetic salsa verde that got extra lift from tarragon. Raisin- and sage-fueled Marsala (remember Marsala?) had the right amount of sweetness and zip for a juicy white hunk of swordfish. Under little fish, my favorite turned out to be sardines given a semisweet and citrusy cure, then laid over grilled crostini spread with soft butter. Sardines and butter are a great combination, and here they got along even better than usual. Some grilled scallops got a bit lost in an excess of yogurt-walnut dip. But tender grilled baby squid held their own on top of whole sweet tomatoes, cured and marinated, and so did tiny grilled clams in a tangy dressing of Calabrian chiles. The antipasti don’t always look like antipasti. Most of them are vegetables, some presented like salads (grilled fennel with blood oranges) and others like side dishes (roasted squash with a sticky caramelized surface bathed in brown butter). The bagna cauda, vegetables crowded around a warm dip that, excellently, contains a huge dose of anchovies, is a more traditional antipasto. So is the prosciutto listed under “Cocktail snacks.” You drape it on bread that you spread with butter that’s been creamed with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Then you dab it with pickled mustard seeds soaked in balsamic vinegar. Then you shake your head a little at how smart Ms. Robbins is about augmenting classic Italian flavors without stepping all over them. Desserts follow that template. The olive oil cake is luxuriously rich, with a satisfyingly browned crust. A tart of crisp sliced apples is excellent, too. I wasn’t expecting much from soft-serve gelato with mix-and-match toppings, but a swirl of vanilla under a spoonful of walnuts preserved in lemon syrup tasted exactly right. Lilia is the first and, for now, only restaurant owned and operated by Ms. Robbins. This makes it something of a rarity: the sole focus of a midcareer chef who has the maturity to stay away from trends and novelties, the experience to know what will be delicious, the managerial skill to pull it off, and the time to make it work. It’s hard to begrudge her peers’ decisions to leverage success into sprawling empires. Then when you eat at Lilia, it’s hard not to wonder if the rest of us are losing something in the bargain.","Cacio e pepe frittelle; bagna cauda; cured sardines; grilled squid; black bass with salsa verde; swordfish with Marsala; all pasta; grilled chicken; olive oil cake.

129,Insa,2 star,"March 15, 2016",Pete Wells,Gowanus,Korean,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/dining/insa-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/dining/insa-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"From the first soft bite of blood sausage, I knew I would like Insa.  Just seeing the word “soondae” on the menu of this new Korean restaurant had been enough to get my hopes up. Purplish links of coagulated pigs’ blood bound by rice and an arterial network of springy, skinny cellophane noodles, soondae does not tend to travel far from Korean neighborhoods. Insa sits between a moving company and a mechanic’s garage in an industrial patch of Brooklyn near the Gowanus Canal. The area is not crowded with Korean restaurants or, for that matter, Koreans. Soondae here? If nothing else, it suggested that Insa had plenty of confidence. I dragged one dark, purplish slice across a line of salt laced with ground chile and perilla seeds. The seared skin crackled between my teeth: the sign of an animal-gut casing. Blood sausage can sometimes be dry, but Insa’s soondae spilled with tender crumbs that were almost juicy, moistened with braised pigs’ snouts and ground belly meat. The noodles gave it a little bounce but didn’t get in the way of the deep, galvanic taste of iron. It was wonderfully well made, and not quite like any soondae I’d tasted on 32nd Street or on the kimchi belt along Northern Boulevard in Queens. Insa was opened before Christmas by Sohui Kim and her husband, Ben Schneider. He is the designer, woodworker, decorator of the themed karaoke rooms in back, and propmaster of the retro lounge that’s dressed in David Lynch red. She is the chef. Mr. Schneider was raised in Manhattan. Ms. Kim moved from Seoul to the Bronx when she was 10. The couple also owns the Good Fork, about two miles away in Red Hook, Brooklyn, where the menu dips its toes into Korean cuisine. The one at Insa dives straight into it. Chefs trying to get American eaters to fall for another country’s cooking often toss essential flavors out the window. The restaurant crosses over, but the cuisine becomes roadkill. Insa is a rare crossover that limits most of its tweaks to externals. Traditional Korean recipes may be altered, in texture for instance (soondae is not usually pan-seared), but their spirit is largely left intact. For customers who did not grow up with Korean food, Insa puts extra clarity into the way the menu is written and explained by servers, most of whom are lavishly tattooed. Almost nothing on it qualifies as fusion, though. Even the seafood corn dog has antecedents in Seoul, although Insa hasn’t yet copied the impressive Korean idea of incorporating French fries right into a corn dog. Officially, Insa is a barbecue restaurant. Gas burners are punched into the centers of the long mess-hall tables lined up between buffed wooden benches. The tables are about as wide across as a rowboat. This made conversation a challenge — one of my guests, who has a voice that could wake sleeping livestock, later said he wanted to borrow a karaoke microphone to make himself heard — but we needed the space when the rest of the food came. As soon as the blue flames jump up, little dishes (banchan) start to circle the ring. Good banchan signal seriousness in a Korean kitchen, and the ones at Insa are really flavorful, made with care: cabbage and daikon, pink with chile paste and fermented on site; chewy black beans in salty syrup; peanuts with silvery dried anchovies; chewy bands of cuttlefish with time-release flavor. Barbecue was rarely my favorite thing on the table, though. The very fresh-tasting squid and octopus grilled up beautifully, but I missed the scent of charcoal, and Insa’s gas flames seemed too low to give the marinated short rib strips or thinly shaved brisket the crisp edges I like. The dishes I look forward to eating again are those cooked in the open kitchen off to one side. Insa’s yuk hwe is one of the most suave versions of beef tartare any Korean restaurant has served me. The chopped eye of round is chilly and firm, crunchy with Asian pear and fried capers, and deliciously shiny with sesame oil. I would have lapped it up with a spoon, but it was, no doubt, better on gnarled curls of shrimp chips. Insa’s tteokbokki are terrific, too: pudgy little fingers of rice stick blackly seared on the bottom for crunch. They are tossed with tender ovals of seafood sausage and smacked with chile paste. The heat was not incinerating, but it was warm enough. At other times, Insa didn’t supply the burn I’ve come to love at other Korean restaurants. The bibimbap in particular seemed afraid of getting noticed. Spice doses can be recalibrated, though. What sets Insa apart is a modern chef’s sensitivity to technique and ingredients. (The squid that are so good on the grill are just as welcome in the thick and unusually fluffy seafood pajeon.) The chef de cuisine, Michael Stokes, came up with the soondae, and the sous-chef, Yong Shin, is responsible for the seafood corn dog, a fine snack to eat at Insa’s tiki bar. There, no outrigger dangles from the ceiling, and an animated underwater video screen stands in for the tanks of live fish at torchlit palaces like the dearly departed Kahiki Supper Club in Columbus, Ohio. But the bartenders wear aloha shirts as they reach for coconut mugs and Fu Manchu cups for their modernized Polynesian drinks. A tiki bar! Exotica from Polynesia, a land so vaguely defined in the American imagination that it was able to encompass piña coladas, egg rolls and teriyaki chicken, clearly has no business in a serious modern Korean restaurant. But bastardized cocktails are preferable to bastardized cuisine. The cocktail menu looks interesting. To tell the truth, I never made it past the mai tai. The first one I tried was dominated by “local almond milk syrup” (orgeat cooked up in Red Hook from nonlocal nuts), but in my second, the lime juice was prominent, the way it should be. It wasn’t a Trader Vic’s mai tai, but it was all right in its own way, I decided, as I finished my fourth. By that time, I was in the jungle room, clutching a microphone for dear life as if that would be enough to give me the extra octaves I needed for “Blue Bayou.” I hadn’t meant to sing. But one of the servers had opened the door on a room swaddled in orchids and tropical leaves and artificial turf. Then somebody keyed a Dolly Parton number into the karaoke machine. “There’s also a deep-sea room, a space room and a psychedelic room,” the server said, discreetly closing the door. I’d like to describe all the others. To tell the truth, I never made it past the jungle room.","Gogi mandu; soondae; yuk hwe; tteokbokki; seolleongtang; doenjang jjigae; barbecued squid and octopus; kimchi bokkeumbap; japchae.

130,High Street on Hudson,2 star,"March 8, 2016",Pete Wells,West Village,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/dining/high-street-on-hudson-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/dining/high-street-on-hudson-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"High Street on Hudson is an adventurous and often exciting restaurant trying extremely hard to pass for an ordinary West Village cafe. “Philly spinoff providing house-made breads & pastries, elevated sandwiches, coffee & cocktails,” is Google’s capsule summary. The description is factual to the last ampersand, yet it doesn’t go past the camouflage this place wrapped around itself when it sidled into town in December. What is missing, what you may miss at first if you came for breakfast or lunch, the only meals High Street on Hudson served in its first few weeks of life, is the high level of intelligence the kitchen applies to everything it does from morning through evening. The chef, Eli Kulp, is unmistakably trying to make his mark in New York after making his name in Philadelphia. (He was traveling between the two cities last year when his Amtrak train derailed, leaving him with serious spinal injuries.) At dinner, the time when chefs make their big statements, the menu turned out to be full of small oddities and unexpected ripples of flavor when it was finally unveiled in January. Yet his restaurant doesn’t just put on a show at night and wait for you to be impressed. Mr. Kulp and his business partner, Ellen Yin, understand that coffee and a great pastry can be just as meaningful before noon as an artfully plated duck breast is after dark. Restaurants that aim to be useful and interesting all day long are becoming more common in Los Angeles and other cities; New York could use more of them. The view into the windows from Hudson Street says bakery: You can see bread on shelves, a squarish seeded rye and a round buckwheat loaf with dried cherries inside. Baked by Alex Bois, they have the roughness and flavor of whole grains, the complicated taste of slow-rising dough, and the kind of dark, thick, crackling crust you want to feel between your teeth. In a glass case by the door are a few of Samantha Kincaid’s pastries, fewer as the day goes on. The neighbors are especially fond of carrying off the round doughnuts rolled in spiced sugar and filled with salty cider caramel. Unlike Sadelle’s, which also has a retail bakery up front, High Street on Hudson puts virtually all of its pastries on the daily menus. An ideal breakfast could be made of coffee and the witty red-eye Danish, a flaky golden swirl with warm country ham over a bull’s-eye of bittersweet pastry cream made with espresso. Or it could revolve around a black bialy. This oddball creature, dark with squid ink and strewn with sesame seeds, is soft and chewy, with pickled peppers and a mound of tart, uncreamy whitefish salad pressed into its divot. Cooking at breakfast takes the form of egg sandwiches. My choice of these is the Bodega, an incongruous name for a countrified affair of flattened sage sausage and Cheddar on a biscuit with a mule kick of black pepper. Like the other sandwiches, the Bodega arrives alongside a grilled hot pepper on an irregular block of wood. This is both affected and counterproductive; a boring old plate would do a better job of keeping food off the table. (What’s going to happen to all these fancy boards once they stop being cool and everybody admits what a pain they are?) I am tempted to jump from breakfast straight to dinner out of cowardice. I would rather not have to say that lunch is the weakest meal of the day. The sandwiches are the trouble. The pastrami is a buzz kill, an inert mass of cold pink meat sliced too thickly on too much rye. Another is called the Best Grilled Cheese Ever. It isn’t. (Granted, calling a sandwich the Best Grilled Cheese Ever is like naming your child Jesus Buddha.) If a place is going to go to the trouble of baking those first-rate breads, it should keep a closer eye on the laws of contrast and proportion that mean success or failure in the sandwich universe. Sandwich engineering is a skill of its own, or maybe an instinct. When it gets dark, High Street on Hudson doesn’t entirely pack up the bakery. One of Mr. Kulp’s more clever moves is to integrate dinner into the overall program with a few breads and some of the regionally grown grains they’re made from. Vollkornbrot, a dark German rye riddled with sunflower seeds, is a wonderful thing to eat when it’s buttered and griddled and spread with rutabaga hummus, which could double as vegetarian chicken-liver pâté. Slices of anadama, a venerable New England cornmeal loaf sweetened with molasses, are topped with very rich, very tender, very smoky eel. I was happily surprised that sunflower seeds cooked into a creamy mock risotto could be so appealing. A less pleasant surprise was the portion size, too small to be served as a separate course to our table of four. Apart from the breads, the menu is a longish list under a single category, “To Share.” The kitchen decides what to send out when, and it doesn’t always make the right call. Tempura-style broccoli is at the start of that list and, ideally, at the start of your meal. Impressively crisp, it gets a refreshing assist from pickled wood-ear mushrooms and an exhilarating dribble of spicy chowchow relish. Halfway down the menu you come to the pastas. Do not, for any reason short of an allergy, ignore the bucatini with squid and mussels. Mr. Kulp, who was chef de cuisine at Torrisi Italian Specialties before he moved to Philadelphia, knows what he is doing in the pasta department. The bucatini are flavored with seaweed, a terrific idea, and the plate is finished with lobster bottarga shaved into rose-colored petals, an even more terrific idea. It may be the finest use of lobster coral anybody has come up with. Toward the bottom of the menu are what used to be called main courses. Arctic char is sauced with a very smart remix of a gribiche; the eggs are pickled for extra snap. And while the phrase “soured grains” does not make the heart go pitter-pat, I could work up some affection for the thing it described, a tart, almost refreshing porridge served under fat slices of duck breast with especially flavorful skin. You may expect a place serving soured grains to go salty and savory with its desserts. And you’d be correct. I like them, mostly, but I’d rather have a piece of the spiced kabocha cake, or the cream puff, with its soft spill of Meyer-lemon cream, followed by a cookie offered on a tray by a smiling woman at the door.","All breads and pastries; crispy broccoli; razor clam strips; grilled squid; seaweed bucatini; grilled Arctic char; Long Island duck; orange rye dessert.

131,Little Pepper,2 star,"Feb. 23, 2016",Pete Wells,College Point,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/dining/little-pepper-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/dining/little-pepper-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Little Pepper began life a dozen years ago in the competitive Chinese nucleus of downtown Flushing, Queens. Five years ago, Cheng Ying Wu and her husband, Gui Ping Huang, the owners, moved it northwest to College Point, where its nearest rival is a graffiti-scrawled storefront across the street selling takeout chop suey and chow mein. Little Pepper is not entirely free of American Chinese food, but its pork lo mein is not one of its chief attractions. The reason to drive to College Point Boulevard (by far the easiest way to get to Little Pepper, about a 20-minute bus ride from the nearest subway stop) is to eat undiluted Sichuan cooking, like silken tofu with scallions. Little chilled blocks of tofu will be covered with scallions and chopped peanuts turned the color of bricks by chile oil. Woven through the burning heat of the oil will be the unmistakable, medicinal hum of Sichuan peppercorns. The crunch and burn and throb of the sauce crashes against the soft and passive tofu; the contrast enhances both. Or the kitchen may take another slab of silken tofu and do something else. This time it will be warm, in bigger chunks that cleave into two pieces at the touch of a spoon. The dressing will be tangy bits of ground pork in black vinegar and a shimmering gloss of chile oil. The dish, of course, is ma-po tofu. At Little Pepper, it combines power and nuance to make other renditions around the city seem heavy-handed. Some New Yorkers grade Sichuan food by its firepower. When their tongues have been reduced to smoldering ruins, they declare themselves (through sign language) to be in a great restaurant. Little Pepper is capable of inflicting great pain when needed. Its Chong Qing chicken, which weaponizes capsaicin in just about every known form and should not be faced without a full glass of water or beer at hand, is proof of that. But what sets Little Pepper apart from the many other good Sichuan restaurants in the city is its skill at bringing spicy forces into tense alignment with sweet, sour and salty ones. It’s possible that the chefs at Little Pepper cook with extra precision because real estate is cheaper in College Point than in Flushing, allowing the owners to spring for the roomy, shipshape kitchen in the back. This at least is what I tell myself as I’m driving past the exit for Flushing and Little Pepper is still another 15 minutes away. I’ve always found a parking space within sight of the front door, which doesn’t often happen in downtown Flushing. Inside, there is art everywhere: a mural of oversize peonies in red and pink; small canvases of an empty, wrinkled red plastic bag and a still life with Spam; a larger painting of a crushed Coke can over the round table where in quiet moments the employees top and tail a heap of beans for the excellent dry-sautéed string beans. English is not one of the restaurant’s core competencies. In the middle of my last lunch there, a waiter handed the phone to one of my guests. What did he want? It was unclear at first. Eventually an odd relay game began; my guest talked to a customer who was trying to place a takeout order, then looked for each dish on the menu and pointed. Finally the waiter wrote it down. It took about five minutes. When the customer walked in to get his food, it was like seeing a minor celebrity. I don’t recall what he ate, but everything I had is bright in my memory. First, super-crisp scallion pancake wedges dunked in a black, tangy, syrup-thick sauce. Then thin, chewy slices of beef tendon in chile oil, classic and great. Thin-skinned dumplings of juicy, sweet pork followed, resting in a pool of vinegar and chile oil. Sautéed snow pea leaves were next, and too salty. At last a big main course: “lamb with hot and spicy sauce,” also known as cumin lamb because that spice dominated the intensely fragrant dry rub clinging to the tender strips of meat. (There was no sauce to speak of, just stir-fried onions and green chiles.) And a whole fish hidden below fiery ground pork sauce, lip-smacking and deeply flavorful, like a Bolognese by way of Chengdu. The fish at Little Pepper often tastes muddy. The sauces, though, are so transporting that it doesn’t matter very much. And while not every dish on the menu is the best in town — the shredded potatoes with green peppers are pretty bland — the overall energy and variety of the cooking more than makes up for it. With so many peppers whiplashing around, the mouth needs something mild for balance. Tea-smoked duck dripping with warm fat is a fine and soothing appetizer. Cold smashed cucumbers with garlic are turning up in non-Chinese restaurants now, but few improve on the ones at Little Pepper. Corn kernels stir-fried with pine nuts are strangely easy to get along with. Fried rice, cooked with so much finely minced scallion that it turns the color of a Shamrock Shake, is a superb mop for fiery sauces. On some days, I have gone giddy for the eggplant, as soft as pudding and slick with garlic sauce. On others, I’ve been sweetly captivated by the riddle of preserved eggs with green peppers. The riddle is not how the egg whites turn dark brown and transparent, while the yolks go creamily soft and ash-colored; that’s explained by the chemistry of a pH shift. What I can’t figure out is why the eggs’ mild whiff of sulfur is so appealing when they are eaten together with chopped mild green chiles and decidedly unmild red chile oil. But this is nothing compared with the enigma of Little Pepper’s “fried potato in hot sauce.” These are crinkle-cut French fries that, as far as I can tell, come out of a bag stored in the freezer. They are dark and ragged with a dry spice mix of coarsely ground cumin, roasted dried chiles, Sichuan peppercorns, salt and maybe MSG. The questions torture me. How did crinkle-cut fries get into a Sichuan restaurant? How can I be so helplessly, irretrievably crazy about them? Why, when they cool and lose their allure, do I want to ask the waiter to drop them back into the fryer again? Is something wrong with me? What is this wild desire? And where is the hot sauce?

132,Pizza Moto @ John Grace Bakery,1 star,"Feb. 16, 2016",Pete Wells,Red Hook,Pizza,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/dining/pizza-moto-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/dining/pizza-moto-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"David Sclarow built his first wood-burning pizza oven so he could feed guests at the wedding of two cheesemakers. They were getting married some distance from Brooklyn, where he lived, so he layered the bricks and concrete on top of a flatbed trailer that he could hitch to the back of his Volkswagen Doka. The next time he took his mobile pizza oven for a spin, it collapsed, but by that point, he liked it so much that he rebuilt it. It was the second oven in which he started baking small, irregular, alluringly blistered margheritas at the Brooklyn Flea in 2008. It caved in, too. This time Mr. Sclarow got serious, engineering a steel-hulled model shaped like a Quonset hut. The third Pizza Moto oven was stolen last year, but he still has three others designed along the same lines. Clearly Mr. Sclarow is one of those chefs for whom half the fun is playing with fire, not to mention building the fire and a heatproof structure to contain it. When he was ready to open a stationary pizzeria in Brooklyn, a defunct Papa John’s where pizzas were made in a gas oven would not seem to have held much appeal for him. Then he and his business partner, Anna Viertel, looked at the site, on the grim, shadowy, underpopulated borderland between Carroll Gardens and Red Hook. Behind the back wall was a large white-tiled oven from the late 19th-or early 20th century, sealed up and long forgotten. Would it take more than two years of restoration and modification to make the oven work again? Yes. Would Mr. Sclarow and Ms. Viertel undertake most of the masonry, plumbing, welding and electrical work themselves? Absolutely. Would there be a lot of red tape to cut through before the city would grant permits, and the restaurant would open in October? You bet. A perfect location, in other words. In the new restaurant, given the unwieldy full name Pizza Moto @ John Grace Bakery, Mr. Sclarow has room to stretch out. He has an imaginative bunch of appetizers that aren’t bound by the conventions of pizzerias or even Italian restaurants. Most are pretty good, but there’s more joy in the pizzas, which go well beyond the limited varieties of single-serving pies that sustain the outdoor operation. Those are without a doubt the best brick-oven pizzas a New Yorker can find in a schoolyard or park. But the pies at the new restaurant don’t need any such qualification. Despite minor variability, the pies coming out of the old bakery are already among the top tier of New York brick-oven pizzas. The pizzas have grown to a 14-inch size you can share without scowling, and there are more of them. The clam pie is something like a flat clam chowder: It’s topped with sliced potatoes and profoundly smoky bacon. But what makes it hard to put down is the flavor of clams cooked in cream and white wine that suffuses the whole thing. Another tomato-free pizza is a complex and compelling duet for cheese and fungus. It starts with a restrained application of ricotta, fontina, pecorino and mozzarella, which are covered with juicy, springy roasted mushrooms and feathery shaved raw ones. Tomato sauce underlies the very good pepperoni pizza (it’s actually chorizo, slightly hotter, and tangy) and the “eggs in hell” pizza, which has bacon and mozzarella arrayed around the cyclopean eye of a single sous-vide egg. Chile oil makes the eggs in hell a more engaging bacon-and-eggs than the carbonara pizza, a special whose four cheeses melded into a single, not very interesting white blanket. The crust is in the modern Brooklyn-Neapolitan family exemplified by Franny’s and Roberta’s. Other doughs have a more complex flavor, but the one at Pizza Moto is far from bland. The highest bubbles on the sizable outer rim are starting to go black, and there are patches of char on the base. The crust is sturdy, but not brittle or tough. It crackles upon meeting your teeth, but its white interior is delicate, filled with small air pockets. Crackle is the entire point of the nonconformist pie that’s sprinkled with salt, pepper and rosemary, and shellacked with bacon fat. Essentially a hot-pork-drenched cracker, it makes a superb appetizer if you can get over any narrow-minded hangups about eating two courses of pizza. At any rate, it’s a better opening move than the freebie the kitchen sends out, a fried lasagna noodle coated with powdered cheese, tomatoes and pizza seasonings. It sounds more interesting than it is. But a similar frilly noodle, hand-pulled and boiled, was involved in the guinzaglio, one of the most fascinating and delicious appetizers I ate at Pizza Moto. Tossed in beef shank ragù, seasoned with fermented black beans, shiny with bone marrow, dressed with fried shallots, scallions and warm batons of celery, it managed to taste Chinese and Italian at the same time. Fried broccoli is about as crisp as fried broccoli can get, but it’s supposed to be swiped in yuzu-kosho curd that is too cloying; it needs more spice. I would have liked the Caesar salad with smoked trout more if it hadn’t struck me as a lesser version of the majestic herring Caesar at M. Wells Steakhouse. Toast spread with smoked swordfish whipped into a smooth brandade was lovely, though, perked up with pickled onions and dotted with poppy seeds. The restaurant currently won’t take reservations for parties of fewer than five. This isn’t an unusual policy, but here the result is that smaller groups, even when they arrive early, can end up staring at the two big empty tables and the wall art — lightboxes made from vintage pinball playfields — for a long while. Cocktails, which have stiff spines, can make the clock tick faster; so can the fine domestic beers. The two Italian wines I tried were less focused. One night as I waited to be seated, I was parked at a table in the kitchen, under a collection of high-minded cookbooks. The table has a great view of the oven, and the real estate agent who rented the space was sitting next to me, which is how I heard the story of its discovery. Another night I idled at the bar on a leather stool with legs of bent chrome-plated pipe. I had never seen ones quite like them. Later I’d learn that Mr. Sclarow had cut and welded the pipes from some old school desks he had found, matching their height to the bar of soapstone tiles he had pulled out of a Dumpster. Are there easier ways to open a pizzeria? Sure. Would any of them have resulted in anything resembling Pizza Moto?

133,Llama Inn,2 star,"Feb. 9, 2016",Pete Wells,Williamsburg,Latin American,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/dining/llama-inn-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/dining/llama-inn-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"A wedge of light burns in the night on one of Williamsburg’s less picturesque intersections, just below the dark rumble of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Down the block is an old-school Brooklyn-Italian dining room serving linguine, veal parm and clams casino. All around, there’s hipster bait: fried chicken, pedigreed pizza, cans of Narragansett, tacos from a truck in a bar’s backyard. Behind the windows on this triangular lot, the Llama Inn is something different. There are skewered beef hearts under a red mash of salsa that rattles with the heat of rocoto peppers. Bites of goat neck, thickly seared and braised until tender, are dark under a glaze that gets its mouthwatering tang from chicha, a beer brewed from Andean corn. Together with a fresh cilantro sauce, it makes the goat so compulsively good that we were all clamoring for the last forkful. Chilly and firm pieces of fluke ceviche, starting to go opaque in the acid of a smoky dashi, are wonderful to eat with soft bits of fried sweet plantain and crisp chips of green plantain. Ripe persimmon flesh and strips of raw sea bream under frizzled yuzu threads sit in an instant marinade. The liquid is pale orange, tart, a little fruity, spicy at the edges and generally delicious. You pick up a spoon reflexively to slurp the sauce, even if you don’t know this is the way Peruvians eat tiradito. What’s been happening inside the Llama Inn since it opened in November is not just different but very welcome. A careful kitchen is interpreting the cuisine of Peru, whose vast catalog of ingredients and wild juxtapositions of influences have not been especially well displayed in New York, beyond a few ceviches and a lot of roast chicken. Llama Inn does both, with excellent raw materials, a free hand and a conviction that all of this should be fun. The restaurant’s logo, a debonair llama dressed in black tie, sets the tone. The heart of the dining room, which is uncluttered and geometric in a loosely midcentury way, is occupied by a bar island. Inside it, bartenders mix drinks that are worth starting with and often sticking with. A kind of sangria made with pisco and kept on tap made me smile three times: when I saw three frozen grapes on a toothpick serving as a garnish, when I tasted the cloves and cinnamon in the red wine, and when I asked for the drink by name: the Llama Del Rey. The cocktail called El Chapo combines tequila and vermouth in case you want to know why they’re not combined more often. But the tall, icy, honey- and ginger-flavored Matador Swizzle has to be the nicest thing that’s happened to amontillado in this part of Brooklyn. It and a good number of other sherries are served by the glass, well chilled. “Our Peruvian clientele likes it that way,” my server said when he caught me warming the glass in my palms to help the flavors uncoil. Past some low-lying booths and banquettes is a long counter behind which the 16 items on the menu are prepared. The chef, Erik Ramirez, worked at Eleven Madison Park before running the kitchen at Raymi in Manhattan. His parents took him on trips from New Jersey, where he grew up, to Lima, where they had. But as an adult, he fell out of touch with Peruvian food. He had been cooking professionally for several years when an employer suggested it was time to pull up his memories of ceviche. Sometimes Mr. Ramirez borrows an ingredient or two from Peru. For his surprisingly good beet and goat cheese salad, he takes a minty herb called muña and tart yellow gooseberries, native to the Andes. The most unusual thing about the fluffy drift of quinoa tossed with avocado, bacon, cashews and caramelized bananas is that Mr. Ramirez has come up with a quinoa salad that isn’t depressing. It’s actually kind of lovable. At other times, he lifts and twists entire recipes. The roast whole chicken, with smoke in its meat and blackened chile rub on its skin, isn’t so much an alteration of the Peruvian standard as an intensification. The bird comes with three sauces, each spicy in a different way. One, the creamy yellow salsa huancaína, is also squiggled over a daunting heap of fried potato wedges that comes with the chicken. I would enjoy meeting regularly with this chicken, but it probably won’t happen until Mr. Ramirez starts selling it in smaller portions. Available only as a whole bird for $40, Llama Inn’s chicken is another symptom of the sickness plaguing restaurant menus under the heading “large format.” Sized and priced for more than one person, large-format dishes attract eyeballs online and in the flesh. They can look cynical, though, when they could be scaled down to smaller, cheaper portions as easily as Llama Inn’s chicken or its take on lomo saltado. This jumble of onions, tomatoes, cilantro, French fries and thick, soy-marinated beef tenderloin slices makes a voluptuously good taco when pinched inside a thin, crisp-edge scallion crepe. But it’s sold in a regal $48 platter that takes two or three people to handle. The simplest dessert is hard to argue with, three hot bracelets of fried dough called picarones soaked in a raw-sugar syrup. My server lobbied for a different one with lucuma and chocolate made from Peruvian beans specifically for the restaurant, but it never arrived after I ordered it. I wouldn’t mention it except that an order went missing every time I ate at Llama Inn. The first night this happened, we were presented with dessert menus and we pointed out that the chicken we had asked for still hadn’t been served. When I later told one of the people who had been with me that it had happened again, he said, “What do they have against their own magnificent chicken?” With any luck, they’ll get their orders straight before summer, when the door at the top of a staircase in the dining room will open to the roof deck. It would be nice to sit there with a chicken, or maybe a half-chicken, and raise a Llama del Rey to the trucks on the expressway.","All anticuchos; beets, muña and goat cheese; quinoa, banana and avocado; tiradito; ceviche; goat neck; roasted chicken; beef tenderloin stir-fry; picarones.

134,Benoit,2 star,"Feb. 2, 2016",Pete Wells,Midtown,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/dining/benoit-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/dining/benoit-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Like many New Yorkers, I have convinced myself that a rickety fire escape platform is a terrace and that a segment of the Empire State Building’s antenna seen through a sliver of window constitutes a panoramic skyline view. The same capacity for wishful self-delusion must be what keeps us going to bistros that are nothing like anything in France. The chalkboards in painstaking cursive that misspell half the menu; the sad frites and scrawny mussels and refrigerated cheeses; the old-guard dishes put through modern contortions until they end up looking like Gérard Depardieu wearing Jeggings — we put up with these signs of forgery because we want the real thing so badly. To get it, we need to go to France. But right now, the most perfect substitute bistro in New York is Benoit. It took Alain Ducasse, who owns the century-old original in Paris, a few years to get its Midtown incarnation right. “It’s odd the way Benoit does some dishes so well but misses the bull’s-eye with mainstays that should get the most finicky attention,” Frank Bruni wrote shortly after it opened in 2008, pinning one star on his review in The Times. A year later, in an unstarred update, Julia Moskin found a menu that was coming into focus but still carried an occasional “hint of airline food.” She also wrote that the servers “seem to hope that dinner customers will leave early and stay away forever.” Philippe Bertineau isn’t cooking airline food. He is the restaurant’s third chef. With any luck, Mr. Ducasse won’t need a fourth for a long time. The menu works like a season at the Metropolitan Opera. A core of preposterously old-fashioned classics is rounded out with a few modern compositions to keep everybody on their toes. To understand the point of keeping rafter-rattling war horses in the repertoire, all I had to do was eat Benoit’s quenelles de brochet. These two little footballs of happiness are improbably smooth, almost but not quite fluffy, filled with the freshwater richness of pike. Each one is enveloped in a thick brown gravy of Nantua sauce that is 10 times richer, made from crayfish and lobster. I tasted it, and the whole chorus marched out on the stage at once, the orchestra pounding and the fat lady throwing her head back and letting it rip. A standing ovation would have followed if Benoit’s quenelles hadn’t made me feel a bit like the fat lady myself. Even more inimical to hopes of mobility was Mr. Bertineau’s cassoulet. A gleefully debilitating arsenal of duck confit, duck sausage and cured pork, it is also a magnificent pot of tender baked beans soaked in garlic and fat. Either the meat or the beans could slow your speed. Together they act like an anchor. The calf’s liver, an oblong lobe shaped like Argentina, was seared to a dark gold in the copper sauté pan that escorted it to the table. A step beyond the medium-rare the server had suggested, it was still very good. It had no overcooked livery flavor, just the ripe tang of organ meat that dissolved into very soft Lyonnaise potatoes and onions. To begin, there is darkly concentrated onion soup, choked with melted Gruyère that seems never to run out. Snails in the divots of a heavy glazed dish have a wafer of parsley crust on top that’s almost as fun to eat as a rag of bread dunked in their garlic butter. Obviously, like so much of Benoit’s menu, these appetizers predate the electrocardiogram. It is possible to start with something lighter. Regulars often tick off choices on the hors d’oeuvres list, a separate sheet of paper that comes with a golf pencil: a poached and oil-marinated sardine; crisp sticks of celery root in rémoulade that may need more mustard; ham with flageolets and a handful of other dried beans, each cooked until just tender; the egg mayo, on the menu since opening day. Five of these little dishes served together make an excellent $19 lunch, a kind of Lyonnaise bento box. The greatest bistros in France are magnetic because they are invariable; you know the classics will be made the same way they were 15 or 45 years ago. Benoit is not always this kind of bistro, though this may be a symptom of its distance from Lyon. The pâté en croûte, from an 1892 recipe, can be dry and underseasoned. The filet mignon au poivre can be dullish, although the pepper-cream sauce puts up a strong fight. In compensation, though, Mr. Bertineau cooks almost as well outside the bistro canon as inside it. He shows this with seafood especially. One night, my guests, elbow deep in a wild boar stew, threw me looks of pity: poor guy, stuck with king salmon, butternut squash and black-trumpet mushrooms. I didn’t let on, but I was perfectly content. The fish, roasted gently, was crazily tender and the white-wine sauce so appealing that I spooned way more than I needed from the sauceboat left on the table. (The right French sauce can be a dish in itself.) The baba is not as spectacular at it was at Alain Ducasse New York before that restaurant closed. The cake’s halves can be too sober, depending on whether the server applies the Armagnac as if he’s putting out a house fire or baptizing a baby. But other vintage desserts can restore the faith of any New Yorker who’s been brought down by bland mille-feuilles or watery crème caramels or confused tarte Tatins. The servers on my recent visits showed no impatience with lingerers; they simply went about their business with that straight-spined, matter-of-fact French-waiter style. This is sometimes mistaken for rudeness but is closer to pride and a confidence that everybody, including the customers, knows how to act. It’s strange that it took Mr. Ducasse to give New York its most convincing version of this very un-cheflike style of cooking. That a highly traditional bistro survived while the other, more inventive restaurants with which he hoped to conquer Manhattan did not is peculiar, too — a missed opportunity for the chef and New Yorkers, who love French food even when it doesn’t love them back.","Hors d’oeuvres; tarte flambée; foie gras terrine; onion soup; escargots; quenelles de brochet; cassoulet; foie de veau; chocolate soufflé; vanilla mille-feuille; tarte Tatin for two.

135,Achilles Heel,1 star,"Jan. 26, 2016",Pete Wells,Greenpoint,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/dining/achilles-heel-resto-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/dining/achilles-heel-resto-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"In its more peaceful hours, Achilles Heel, a revived waterfront bar with a painted stone facade in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, reminds me of McSorley’s Old Ale House. At both places, you can rub the winter out of your hands near a hot stove (fueled by coal at McSorley’s, firewood at Achilles) whose feet are propped on beat-up floorboards. Neither spot is in any hurry, and time there moves at a pace that is decidedly prehashtag. Their light has a faraway, amber quality you could call cheerful gloom. They are among the most soothing places in the city to cradle a glass while the day shortens and slips into the night. One area where the two diverge is food. John McSorley, who founded his East Village saloon in 1854, liked to eat whole raw onions like apples. Possibly for this reason, the kitchen at McSorley’s has always taken a rough-and-ready approach. At Achilles Heel, the short menu is something else: thoughtful, engaging, subtle and intimate. It’s less saloon cooking than wine-bar food. You can knock back some Muscadet and oysters with, instead of a garden-variety mignonette, a few thick, concentrated drops of a dressing that is intensely lemony but not sour. Or you can chase a mouthful of oloroso with a soft bite of a sheep’s milk cheese called Puits d’Astier, wrapped in a charred leaf of cabbage and griddled. It’s a wonderful way to eat cheese. As at a wine bar in France, there are tartines, which everybody in New York decided one recent day to call “toasts.” Fried bread showed through beneath sheets of sweetly melting lardo, uncannily good and flecked with Sichuan peppercorn. Toast jutted out of a bowl of fleshy, delicious black trumpet mushrooms in their own broth. Excellent, densely seeded bread came alongside fluke with pickled chiles; I’d expected raw fluke, but it had been cured in salt and then restored, like bacalao, into an intensely flavored mash. The chef, Lee Desrosiers, cooks on induction burners in a space that looks just big enough to slice a baguette. In fact, it’s the kitchen of a bar that was not supposed to have one. Andrew Tarlow, who restored Achilles Heel decades after the dockworkers who used to drink there heard the final last call, had the spot retrofitted last summer, in its third year of operation. From his butcher shop, Marlow & Daughters, he plucked Mr. Desrosiers, a meat cutter who had restaurant experience. His menu isn’t especially meaty, but Mr. Desrosiers will use his knives in ways that the longshoreman who used to drink here probably didn’t. Minced pork rib became a meditation on the Thai dish larb, with balls of sticky rice and a sauce of fresh green herbs. Early one night, Mr. Desrosiers put a plate of guinea hen galantine down on the bar. “Here,” he told the bartenders, “I want you guys to try this.” They took exploratory pecks at the thick wheels of pale pink meat broken by white windowpanes of fat, then they set upon the plate like vultures. I did the same when I got mine, swabbing it in a purple blob of chopped pickled radicchio and a circle of liver sauce on which he’d laid a slice of the bird’s heart. Having casually slouched into its role as a restaurant, Achilles Heel won’t be everyone’s idea of a dinner destination. Narrow-minded eaters may have a hard time with the limited, highly changeable menu. As the night goes on, the music becomes enveloping and the room fills with people who don’t have food in their thoughts. If they start to crowd you out, finish your smoked ice cream with grapefruit sections and make your way out as you ask, where has the time gone?  For those of us who had greedily dismantled Koren Grieveson’s robust, emphatic cooking at Avec in Chicago, her move to New York a couple of years ago was promising news. She landed at Claudette, on lower Fifth Avenue, and while some of her Provençal dishes were excellent, she seemed slightly miscast and left after a year. Last summer, she took over as the chef of a nine-year-old restaurant on East 29th Street called Resto. It is nominally Belgian, but its covert theme since its opening in 2007, the year Frank Bruni gave it a two-star review in The Times, has always been the glories of animal flesh and fat. This seems to suit Ms. Grieveson, whose cooking there has some of its old Avec swagger. Lamb ribs, a Resto fixture since the days of its first chef, Ryan Skeen, were deeply compelling in a dark, intense honey glaze with rosemary; lime juice gave them a lift that was unexpected and just right. A vadouvan aioli brought subtle harmonies to another bar snack, pink and juicy meatballs fried in bread crumbs. You don’t often meet up with winter salads as dynamic as the one Ms. Grieveson puts together out of endive and celery root with mint, slivers of dried apricots and long twists of lamb bacon; the orange vinaigrette tasted like the sun coming out after a blizzard. Piled on thick rafts of bread, brandade turned out the way I always hope it will, often in vain, but not this time: fluffy and dense at once, with very tender and silky chunks of salt cod. I was really impressed by the Puy lentils served with crisp-skinned dorade; Ms. Grieveson had wonderfully cooked these earthy legumes with sweet and fruity black garlic. Other seafood dishes could be underwhelming; there wasn’t much flavor in tiny remoulade-dressed shrimp served in a scooped-out November tomato, and hard little nubs of mussels undermined all the effort Ms. Grieveson put into steaming them with harissa, fennel, brussels sprouts and spaghetti squash. Desserts can seem like an afterthought, and one night I skipped them entirely because the other courses had taken forever to emerge from the kitchen. Ingredients that once walked on the land were a safer bet. Beautifully roasted duck and grapes were accented with gin underscored by juniper berries. Beef tongue braised in beer had a satisfying sear on the edges and a little extra crunch from flakes of sesame brittle. Nearly everything, whether cooked in beer or not, gets along nicely with it; the wonderful, often obscure bottles and drafts are Resto’s strongest link with Belgium.","Frequently changes, but oysters, cheese and charcuterie are reliable. Prices $12 to $19."
136,Per Se,2 star,"Jan. 12, 2016",Pete Wells,Upper West Side,"American, French",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/dining/pete-wells-per-se-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/dining/pete-wells-per-se-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The lady had dropped her napkin. More accurately, she had hurled it to the floor in a fit of disillusionment, her small protest against the slow creep of mediocrity and missed cues during a four-hour dinner at Per Se that would cost the four of us close to $3,000. Some time later, a passing server picked up the napkin without pausing to see whose lap it was missing from, neatly embodying the oblivious sleepwalking that had pushed my guest to this point. Such is Per Se’s mystique that I briefly wondered if the failure to bring her a new napkin could have been intentional. The restaurant’s identity, to the extent that it has one distinct from that of its owner and chef, Thomas Keller, is based on fastidiously minding the tiniest details. This is the place, after all, that brought in a ballet dancer to help servers slip around the tables with poise. So I had to consider the chance that the server was just making a thoughtful accommodation to a diner with a napkin allergy. But in three meals this fall and winter, enough other things have gone awry in the kitchen and dining room to make that theory seem unlikely. Enough, also, to make the perception of Per Se as one of the country’s great restaurants, which I shared after visits in the past, appear out of date. Enough to suggest that the four-star rating it received from Sam Sifton in 2011, its most recent review in The New York Times, needs a hard look. With each fresh review, a restaurant has to earn its stars again. In its current form and at its current price, Per Se struggled and failed to do this, ranging from respectably dull at best to disappointingly flat-footed at worst. Dinner or lunch at this grand, hermetic, self-regarding, ungenerous restaurant brings a protracted march of many dishes. In 2004, the year Per Se opened, the price for nine courses was $150 before tax and tip; last week, it went up to $325, with service included. Eli Kaimeh, the chef de cuisine, changes the menu all the time, but he leaves a few pieces of heirloom furniture in place: the salmon tartare and crème fraîche fitted into an ice cream cone the size of a triple-A battery; the “oysters and pearls,” a savory tapioca pudding under caviar and warm oysters; the cinnamon-sugared doughnut holes with a froth-capped cup of cappuccino semifreddo; and when it’s in season, lobster poached in butter. These dishes, all of which Mr. Keller made famous years ago at the French Laundry in Napa Valley, show his rare combination of American playfulness and rigorous finesse. One could argue that it’s a little lame that Mr. Keller is still trotting them out. The name Per Se, after all, was chosen to suggest that New York would not simply reflect California’s glory; this would be a landmark restaurant in and of itself. My quarrel with these greatest hits, though, is that they make Per Se’s new material look random and purposeless. The classics would suffer if you changed one element. With the notable exception of some desserts that Elwyn Boyles, Anna Bolz and their pastry team elegantly wove together, I couldn’t say that about many other recent dishes. The kitchen could improve the bacon-wrapped cylinder of quail simply by not placing it on top of a dismal green pulp of cooked romaine lettuce, crunchy and mushy at once. Draining off the gluey, oily liquid would have helped a mushroom potpie from turning into a swampy mess. I don’t know what could have saved limp, dispiriting yam dumplings, but it definitely wasn’t a lukewarm matsutake mushroom bouillon as murky and appealing as bong water. It’s a bit of a mystery what pickled carrots, peanuts and a date wrapped in a soft crepe were supposed to do for a slab of Dorset cheese from Consider Bardwell Farm, but a good first step would have been allowing the washed-rind cow’s milk cheese to warm up to a buttery softness; served cold, it was rubbery and flavorless. Even canonic dishes could be mangled. One time the sabayon in “oysters and pearls” had broken and separated, so fat pooled above the tapioca. Mr. Keller wrote in “The French Laundry Cookbook” that poaching lobster in butter “cooks it so slowly and gently that the flesh remains exquisitely tender — so tender some people think it’s not completely cooked.” There was little danger of anyone’s making that mistake on two occasions when the lobster was intransigently chewy: gristle of the sea. The first time, it was served with a sugary Meyer lemon marmalade and a grainy chestnut purée that tasted like peanut butter to which something terrible had been done. Subsequently, it was paired with a slick of cold oatmeal. Along this gravel road, there were some smooth stretches. Lubina, the European sea bass, was sheathed in handsome golden scales of potato and bewitchingly sauced with a reduction of red wine and port swirled with butter. Bulging agnolotti filled with butternut squash and mascarpone were fat envelopes of pure pleasure. The flavors and colors of roasted sunchokes, vinegared beets, peeled Concord grapes and puréed pistachios came together in vivid harmony. The type of daring — where did that come from? — thrill that you hope to get at a restaurant like Per Se appears rarely, but it was there in a majestic pile of osetra caviar over deeply savory bonito jelly and cured fluke that had been pressed between sheets of kelp, a flavor-enhancing trick known in Japan as kobu-jime. More familiar, but just as transporting, was the risotto, supersaturated with brown butter and creamy Castelmagno cheese. A server appeared with a wooden box and a shaver, and the plate momentarily disappeared under a rain of white truffles. A few minutes later, even more truffles poured down. Both dishes, though, came at an extra charge: $75 more for the caviar and $175 for the risotto. The supplements at Per Se can cause indignation, among other emotions. When my server asked, “Would you like the foie gras”— $40 more — “or the salad?,” the question had an air of menace. When the salad turned out to be a pale, uncrisp fried eggplant raviolo next to droopy strips of red pepper and carrot, it felt like extortion. Some of those prices came down slightly when the baseline cost went up. With or without supplemental charges, though, Per Se is among the worst food deals in New York. Mr. Keller was a leader in the service-included model of pricing, although he muddies the waters by leaving a line for an optional gratuity on the check. Just what kind of service is included? The people who work in Per Se’s dining room can be warm and gracious. They can also be oddly unaccommodating. When one of my guests didn’t like a sample of a red being offered by the glass, the sommelier decided to argue, defending his choice instead of pouring something new. When I asked to see the truffle being shaved over somebody else’s plate, it was whisked under my eyes for a nanosecond, as if the server were afraid I was going to sneeze. I know what truffles look like; what I wanted was to smell it. Wine glasses sat empty through entire courses. Once, the table was set for dessert so haphazardly that my spoon ended up next to my water glass instead of my plate. Sitting down after a trip to the restroom, one of my guests had his chair pushed back into place with a hard shove. Has the dance teacher been replaced by a rugby coach? Servers sometimes give you the feeling that you work for them, and your job is to feel lucky to receive whatever you get. As you leave, you’re handed a gift bag. It’s small, but still too big for its contents, two chocolate sandwich cookies for each person and an illustrated booklet called “Per Se Purveyors.” No doubt this will make useful reading some sleepless night, but it feels like the swag that’s given out after a free press lunch. Except Per Se isn’t free. It’s possible to pass an entire meal in this no-fun house without a single unpleasant incident apart from the presentation of the check. The gas flames in the glass-walled hearth are a cheerful sight, and the view of Central Park’s tree line past Columbus’s marble head is an unbeatable urban panorama. But are they enough? Is Per Se worth the time and money? In and of itself, no.","Choices are limited to a vegetable tasting or a chef’s tasting menu with few options. $325 for nine-course tasting menus, with large supplemental charges for caviar, foie gras and truffle dishes. At lunch, a five-course $215 menu and a seven-course $255 menu are also offered."
137,Sadelle’s,1 star,"Jan. 5, 2016",Pete Wells,SoHo,"Eastern European, Russian",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/dining/sadelles-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/dining/sadelles-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Sadelle’s is one restaurant by day and another, completely different restaurant by night. Dinner is calm, unhurried, basted in candlelight. The relatively short menu is inspired by the luxe comforts of czarist Russia, from delicate little veal pelmeni to tins of sturgeon caviar on ice, served with latkes, lavishly buttered pancakes and rye toast on a three-story platter. Breakfast and lunch, on the other hand, can be chaotic. The menu sprawls all over the place, although at its core it’s not so different from Barney Greengrass’s. It strikes almost everybody as overpriced. Servers can get confused as they jostle between small, overladen tables. Right in the middle of the dining room is a small glass cage where bakers work as if they were go-go dancers in white jackets. Every so often, someone will emerge from the cage with bagels stacked on a pole, shouting, “Hot bagels!” like street vendors in a Lower East Side pavilion at Epcot. Yet the kitschy daytime clamor works, while Sadelle’s stab at evening elegance hasn’t come together yet. Open since September, Sadelle’s is the first restaurant from the Major Food Group that doesn’t feel completely worked out. Jeff Zalaznick, Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone, the men behind the restaurant group, first imagined Sadelle’s as a bakery for Melissa Weller. Ms. Weller began experimenting with bagels when she worked at Per Se and later sold them in a stall at Smorgasburg. Starting with the premise that the New York bagel had metastasized into an overrisen, underbaked balloon of flabby dough with a bellybutton where its hole should be, Ms. Weller scaled back. Her bagels are palm size, rolled by hand, slowly risen for flavor, boiled and well baked to a chewy crackle. All the varieties are worthwhile — there’s even a credible gluten-free bagel, no small feat — but my current favorite is the pumpernickel, made from rye and crushed caraway. Sit at a table for breakfast or lunch and order smoked fish, like the wonderful salmon that shines like the inside of a pink grapefruit, and two copies of your chosen bagel arrive on their own peg stand next to a crock of tangy cream cheese and a tower of garnishes. It’s showy and silly, but it’s great. The daytime menu used to offer a basket of some of Ms. Weller’s finest work, including a slice of chocolate babka, some unusually tender rugelach and one of the best oatmeal cookies in existence. Now the basket is gone, replaced by Ms. Weller’s sticky buns. These are phenomenal, swirls of laminated brioche dough under a brown-sugar glaze, but the baked goods sold at the retail counter up front deserve a whole category on the menu. It’s as if Ms. Weller’s partners don’t quite realize what comes out of her ovens is more distinctive and memorable than what comes out of Deegan McClung’s savory kitchen, and more consistently delicious, too. Everything about the matzo ball soup was likable, from the bits of chicken that tasted like chicken, not wrung-out stock fixings, to the golden broth swirled with dill to the single big, fluffy matzo ball. The tomato soup, though, was so acidic it was almost lacerating. A disc of softly cooked eggs and salami set over brown mustard, with crunchy fried shallots on top, had a terrific savory punch. But the grilled cheese — Muenster, American and Swiss on an everything bagel turned inside-out so the cut sides face the griddle — might have come out of a Betty Crocker children’s cookbook. To me, it tasted like somebody else’s nostalgia. At least it wasn’t somebody else’s order. We waited a long time before anyone asked what we wanted to eat. We waited some more before we were brought food meant for the people sitting next to us. More time passed, followed by another attempt to deliver the wrong food. The disarray increased when the right plates finally showed up and we tried to make room on the tiny table. Despite the disorder and the high prices, I’d come back to daytime Sadelle’s for fish, bagels and eggs. I’m not sold yet on the after-dark version. Sadelle’s makes a valiant effort to transform itself to a refined dinner destination from a busy appetizing restaurant. Liquor bottles replace bagels at the front counter. Fat candles flicker on the walls, and tall dripping tapers sit on the tables. The long marble slab of a communal table in the center of the room is set at night with flowers and cut-glass bowls that glint softly in the light cast by candelabras. It all looks provisional, though, like a loft hastily made over by caterers for a charity benefit. That impression is reinforced if you order the pigs in blankets, whose flaky pastry sheaths leave your fingers shiny with butter. They’re out of place alongside sophisticated appetizers like vadouvan-sprinkled lobster in its shell or tight, icy oysters with pickle mignonette and splinters of horseradish. Butterflied trout with brown butter and shredded pickled beets suggests what Sadelle’s could become if the kitchen really committed to suave Eastern European cuisine. So do the seared salmon steaks with a gently creamy mustard sauce and dill threads. Steak tartare, though, is slightly overthought, mixed with so many alliums that the flavor of the beef recedes. Chicken came with a lake of smoky paprika vinaigrette that turned a mound of kasha salad into a dripping, oily mess. It was hard to be unhappy spooning up dense, sticky clusters of Kaviari’s Kristal sturgeon roe with crème fraîche, chives and light, tender pancakes brushed with melted butter. It was also hard to imagine another occasion when I’d pay $400 for the smallest serving, a 125-gram tin, let alone $1,950 for 500 grams of another variety. Not when bliss comes in simpler forms, like the pull-apart loaf of fantail bread, delivered warm before the appetizers, which reminded me that honey and black pepper are a great combination. Or the supremely moist ginger spice cake with juicy raisins and a slouching landslide of whipped cream. But why are there only three desserts? Whenever you go, the music is a peculiar distraction, an unimaginative collection of old songs by the same few artists, over and over. By day, it’s Barbra Streisand, Neil Diamond, Billy Joel, Paul Simon. By night, more gentiles are invited, and we get Led Zeppelin, the Stones, Eric Clapton, Zeppelin again. This is a minor complaint that wouldn’t register if Sadelle’s were put together by anybody other than Major Food Group. As it is, Sadelle’s is packed with more ideas and more good things to eat than we get from most other restaurants. But, like the average New York bagel, its growth needs to be reined in.","All baked goods and desserts; smoked fish; salami and eggs; matzo ball soup; pelmeni; trout Franceska; mustard salmon. Breakfast and lunch items, $12 to $48; dinner appetizers, $18 to $45; dinner main courses, $25 to $37, with a few outliers like a $100 fish tower."
138,L’Amico,1 star,"Dec. 8, 2015",Pete Wells,Chelsea,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/dining/sessanta-lamico-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/dining/sessanta-lamico-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"They prowl the city searching for nourishment and members of their own species. Often, they can be recognized by their feeding grounds. Birds of dignified plumage sit two by two in dim bistros and trattorias of upper Madison Avenue. Great beasts of prey stalk their gazelles at the teeming watering holes of the meatpacking district. Furtive, solitary woodland creatures, camouflaged in forest-floor colors, creep after dark into coffee shops all over the city. Then there are the shiny, slender creatures who stream up and down Manhattan in schools of four or more, usually grouped by sex, eyes darting to see who is swimming nearby. They like to feed on Italian food in crowded hotel restaurants, for reasons naturalists don’t fully understand. This fall, they’ve been fluttering their fins at Sessanta, inside the Sixty SoHo, and at L’Amico, south of Herald Square on the ground floor of the Eventi. So successfully do these two restaurants attract this breed that they may have been built for that purpose alone. For other uses, they are not as reliable. Their cooking can be very rewarding at times, but not quite consistently enough to attract creatures who are mainly interested in food. Servers in both places can suddenly fade away; if you were dating, you’d call it ghosting. These are restaurants for nights when company is the point, and if you manage to order a bottle of wine in less than 15 minutes and a few things on the table happen to be excellent, so much the better. Sessanta is the more stylish of the two. Martin Brudnizki Design Studio’s dining room and lounge have a crisp midcentury-Italian confidence, with space left between the tables for added comfort and better sightlines. The aesthetic is polished and urbane, more negroni than Chianti. Jordan Frosolone, the chef, draws on the cooking of southern Italy, as a server explained one night by means of an unstoppable imaginary tour. (“In the north is Palermo. Going around to the east coast, we come to Catania. …”) Recognizably traditional dishes from that region seem more rare than when Sessanta opened in June, but Mr. Frosolone still brings out ingredients and flavors that you don’t taste at many other Italian restaurants. The struncatura spaghetti, with its intense multigrain flavor and rough surfaces that catch the sauce of anchovies in a fermented-fish paste called neonata, could have come straight out of a Calabrian kitchen. Was the sandwich of caciocavallo and thin slices of tender beef tongue a less gnarly version of Sicily’s spleen sandwich, or its own thing? Either way, it was a meaty thrill, like the roll-ups of scallions and lamb belly run through with a skewer and crisped on a griddle. The phase when you couldn’t eat out in Manhattan without running into an ambitious pork chop seems to be over, but luckily nobody told Mr. Frosolone. He cooks a hulking mahogany beast of a chop, glazed with a sour, salty and sweet Marsala sauce. Then there are dishes with flaws you may not notice if you were, like the three men identically dressed in plaid shirts at the next booth, less interested in eating than in braying about your recent adventures, as if speaking to an audience across Canal Street. Tossed with a ragù of dry, too-firm tuna were rings of anelloni, some chewily undercooked and a few almost completely uncooked at the seams where they had fused. Stringy octopus needed a longer braise, though I liked its bed of farro with dried apricots and the mild bite of fresh turmeric. An excellent hunk of swordfish, for some odd reason, was teamed on the same plate with nondescript strands of braised pork shoulder. And a pre-appetizer shot glass of apple-and-celery-root soup arrived lukewarm on a night when I probably wasn’t spotted, though it was steamy on a night when I almost certainly was. The service changed significantly, too, though I wouldn’t say having a server lean all the way across our long, high booth to refill our glasses each time we took a sip of water qualifies as an improvement. On other nights, I got used to being forgotten, waiting for dishes that seemed to arrive from the kitchen by way of Ho-Ho-Kus, or that never came at all.  L’Amico has two speeds, too. One evening, we waited by the door for almost a half-hour past our reservation time before getting a table. It was another 45 minutes before we had anything to eat; meanwhile, we had to hold the wine list in the air like a semaphore flag. Then, without warning, our cloak of invisibility dropped to the floor. Servers posted by the kitchen watched us as if we were about to steal the silverware. About 30 seconds after we got our main courses, somebody came over to ask, with an admirably straight face, “Now that everybody has had a moment to enjoy their food, I trust that it is cooked to perfection?” I wouldn’t go that far, but the food at L’Amico can be very satisfying. The owner and chef is Laurent Tourondel, once the leader of the fallen BLT empire; together with his chef de cuisine, Amy Eubanks, he works up casual Italian flavors that are not greatly innovative but occasionally glint with originality. Among pine nuts and cubes of roasted winter squash, supple, thin-rolled ravioli were stuffed with more squash, sweet and ultrasmooth. Pork sausage and bitter greens worked their way around loose corkscrews of fusilli, shiny with pork fat. Very tender meatballs of pork and veal were baked with red sauce that I happily swabbed up with a long, skinny paddle of toasted focaccia. Pizza with wilted crinkles of toasted kale over robiola and caramelized onions hid a cool surprise, the distinctive, forthright flavor of caraway seeds. L’Amico’s food can be flaccid and dull, too. Other pizzas at other meals, like the undersalted mushroom pie with truffle paste or the spicy soppressata over tomatoes, tasted flat until they had been squirted with Abruzzese chile oil. The heavy dose of iodine in bay scallops undermined otherwise fine seafood agnolotti. Skirt steak was mushy. Duck breast was overcooked under its limp, wet skin. A Bolognese with hard pebbles of veal lacked the savory intensity brought by a long simmer and patient caramelization. Few seem to mind. Between hanging light fixtures the size of kettle drums and a harlequin-tiled floor, the undraped wood tables have been jammed every time I’ve gone. Once, I sat next to four young women who entertained themselves by reading out loud long strings of text messages and brag-complaining about the impossibility of their “brunch schedules.” They jabbed this and that with forks, then slipped into Uber cars to resume their gliding circuits through New York’s wild kingdom.","Fritto misto; sorghum risotto-style; struncatura spaghetti; spaghetti A.O.P.; zuppa di pesce; roasted pork chop; cannoli; pistachio cake.

139,Vaucluse,1 star,"Dec. 1, 2015",Pete Wells,Upper East Side,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/dining/vaucluse-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/dining/vaucluse-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"A critic could run out of new ways to express disappointment in Altamarea Group restaurants if Altamarea didn’t keep coming up with new ways to disappoint. Disappointment requires hope, and there are reasons to hope for great things from the latest Altamarea production, Vaucluse. The company, run by the chef Michael White and the finance-and-operations wizard Ahmass Fakahany, has deep pockets and a loyal talent pool to match. A server escorting one of my guests to the restroom told her, “Michael White is a great chef and a fantastic human being.” Maybe she was a plant, but Mr. White does have a gift for turning Italian food, especially pasta, into a hedonistic tumble between silk sheets. He also has a talent for finding and keeping skilled cooks like Jared Gadbaw, the executive chef at Marea and at Vaucluse since it opened on East 63rd Street in late summer. This is Altamarea’s first French restaurant, another hopeful sign. For the last few years, the group’s new Italian places have been little more than remixes of its old Italian places. Costata was the Altamarea restaurant with extra steak; Ristorante Morini was the one for the northern slopes of the Upper East Side. With Vaucluse, Mr. Gadbaw gets to dig around in a fresh patch of dirt. Vaucluse does not try to give us a view of contemporary French cooking the way Rebelle or Racines NY do. Much of the menu lassos the grayest of old gray mares and drags them out for one last trot around the paddock. Some of the mares are revived by the exercise. Others, like the chocolate mousse that has been repeatedly violated by bits of baked cocoa meringue and buried under chocolate ice cream, seem as if they would rather be left alone to live out their retirements in peace. Depending on how you order, Vaucluse can be superb, quietly competent or oddly off kilter. The chilled roasted leeks are a virtually perfect appetizer, gorgeously soft and stripped of all raw-onion harshness; as counterpoints, the sprinkle of almonds and the whole-grain mustard vinaigrette, not too pungent, are just right. Chicken soup, which we usually save for nights when we need to crawl under the covers, is, at Vaucluse, a reason to get dressed up and go out. Tiny elegant gnocchi bob around in a deeply flavored, lip-smacking velouté; cream is piled on top just in case it’s not rich enough. Tournedos Rossini make a glorious comeback in the form of beefy-red roasted veal tenderloin in a truffled veal jus. The veal sits next to an innocent-looking rectangle that turns out to be sliced black truffles between slices of bread crisped in butter. On top of this voluptuous little sandwich is a lobe of seared foie gras. The pâté of pork and duck inside a soft pastry crust is impeccably traditional. As far as I know, there is no precedent in French tradition for Vaucluse’s épaulettes, double-barreled ravioli with rabbit confit and Swiss chard loaded into one barrel and reblochon in the other. They will set their own precedent, because they are preposterously good. The technical work on all these dishes is impressive, but they come to life because a light bulb went off in somebody’s head. In other regions of the menu, the wattage dims. The magnificently simple combination of red wine sauce and a poached egg known as oeuf en meurette has been complicated so much that it’s no fun anymore. The egg is trapped inside a ring of roasted delicata squash, and the sauce has been reduced to a sticky, sharp and slightly too-salty syrup. The poulet rôti grand-mère is dull enough to make you wonder if Grandmother learned to roast chickens at a hotel school, although it comes with a profoundly appealing ballotine that’s something like a chicken-and-foie-gras meatball wrapped in skin. The potato tart is a jumble of sliced fingerlings, lardons, bits of Camembert and truffles waiting for something to happen. Nothing is going to happen as long as they’re all loafing on a crackerlike crust that you could safely serve to a patient on a no-flavor diet. If all you ask of a pork chop is for it to be round, pink and wet, the one at Vaucluse will meet your requirements. Many dishes land somewhere between inspired and depleted. At the happier end of that spectrum is the duck à l’orange for two, which features a fine if somewhat over-reduced sauce and a phenomenal cap of evenly golden skin. Why two people need to order a sliced duck breast is a question I can’t answer. How the price was pegged at $92 is another; the huge gratin of turnips and broccoli that is part of the deal doesn’t quite get you to $46 a person. The pogo-stick vicissitudes of Vaucluse intensify with the stabs at classic desserts made by Alina Martell in collaboration with Robert Truitt, who oversees pastries at all the Altamarea restaurants. I would have kept sinking my spoon into the dark-chocolate soufflé until it was gone if the other people at the table had let me. It was a pleasure to see the scalloped ring of a Paris-Brest, and it would have been even more of a pleasure to eat if the pastry had been crisper. But look out. The caramelized mille-feuille was deeply uninteresting, the buckwheat crust of the mixed-fruit tart rested on a drift of crème fraîche custard as salty as feta, and one night a crème brûlée had been cooked so hard it curdled. It came with a little dish of berries with mint leaves under powdered sugar, the way Belgian waffles are served at an ambitious bed-and-breakfast. Seeing the meal crumple at the last course was the most disappointing thing of all, because the desserts I ate at Costata and Ristorante Morini were precisely turned adventures. It must be a challenge feeding the trim and carefully dressed people who fill the two handsome, proper dining rooms when so many of the recipes seem to contain the instruction “Fold the butter into the butter.” A dizzying slick of it clung to the egg noodles that came with the boeuf bourguignon and the coq au vin, each very well made and rich enough on its own. Perhaps to make things up to us, we were asked if we would like the trout Grenobloise served with the brown butter — the whole point of the dish — on the side. Vaucluse is comfortable and reassuring enough that it will almost certainly find an audience on the Upper East Side. It’s far from a bad restaurant. It’s just not, as my teachers used to say, using its full potential.","Poireaux vinaigrette; pâté en croute; velouté de volaille; épaulettes; filet de veau façon Rossini; truite à la Grenobloise; potato gratin; chocolate mousse.

140,Tempura Matsui,2 star,"Nov. 17, 2015",Pete Wells,Murray Hill,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/dining/tempura-matsui-murray-hill-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/dining/tempura-matsui-murray-hill-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"After looking over the menu at Tempura Matsui, the woman at the end of the counter made an announcement that would turn out to be catastrophic for her dinner plans. “I’m allergic to fried food,” she said. She was in trouble, and not just because she may have been the first person in medical history with an allergy to a cooking technique. Somehow she had wandered into a new restaurant serving no-choice, two-hour-long menus that climax with a volley of vegetables and seafood, swished around in batter and sent to a pan of hot oil for a final swim. The white-oak counter where she was sitting, in fact, is bent like an elbow to give all nine chairs around it a view of that oil. Above the pan stood Masao Matsui, who has been frying tempura at one place or another since 1968. Ootoya, the Japanese-based restaurant group, built this serene cloister on East 39th Street for, and named it after, this man. Dinner at Tempura Matsui with nothing fried? Asking Nathan’s for a plate of seasonal organic vegetables would make more sense. After a brief conference with the staff (“You can’t just do some sushi and sashimi?” her date asked), she was off to eat somewhere else. I stayed to see whether the tempura is special enough to build a $200 menu around it. Following the traditional order of kaiseki meals, dinner this September night got off to a light start: a small glass of dashi with spinach and bits of matsutake mushrooms, just coming into season on that week. When they were gone, I knocked back the dashi. It was cool, clear and very delicious. The server said that what came next was a bowl of tofu. My tongue said it was my destiny, the fulfillment of my earthly desires, or at least all the ones that can conceivably be fulfilled by bean curd. Eating it was like spooning up the densest top layer from the neck of a bottle of pure cream. For a few minutes, everything else went away and we were alone, the tofu and I, floating together in a void somewhere. O.K., that was weird! Three little appetizers, the best being two pieces of anago sushi about the size of Chiclets, snapped me back to the normal world. The sashimi that arrived next may have been a little too normal. The tuna belly was definitely too cold by a couple of degrees, and while the squid was exceptionally sweet and the fluke very firm, the ensemble seemed a bit unimaginative for a kaiseki meal costing this much. Then servers ducked in from the wings and moved the scenery into position for the next act, the tempura. There was a square dish for pink miso salt. Another for white salt scraped from a large solid crystal behind the counter that looks as if it will last 1,000 years. Dipping sauce came in a ceramic bowl, shaped by hand and stamped all over with stars or asterisks. A dish next to it held grated daikon, and a spoon for mixing it into the sauce. Finally, there was a squeezer just big enough for a lemon wedge. Martha Stewart has eaten at Tempura Matsui a few times since it opened in July. I’ll bet she thought about pocketing this lemon squeezer. Then, on yet another dish, was a sheet of crisply folded white paper. It is for blotting up any oil that runs off the tempura’s crust. On this night, there wasn’t going to be any. Mr. Matsui skimmed stray dribbles of batter from the pan, looked up, smiled. A few weeks after Tempura Matsui opened, an undisclosed personal matter had recalled him to Japan. Shin Kato, who was 18 when he began to study the ways of the shimmering oil at Mr. Matsui’s side, took over. Now they share the chef title. On this night, Mr. Matsui happened to be in town and was at his station, looking loose and relaxed, like Dizzy Gillespie waiting to take a solo. Two fried heads of Japanese tiger shrimp were placed on the paper, spidery pink antennas and maxillipeds angling out in all directions. They were extraordinary, like eating potato chips at first, then like tasting a plate of shrimp that had been concentrated down to a single bite. The rest of the beast showed up next, slender bodies and trimmed, edible tails in a see-through veil of batter. Mr. Matsui is a minimalist fryer. His coating was less shell than skin, and he heated it just enough to give it a golden blush. The shrimp were dizzily tender and heavy with their own sweetness. So was the fat Pacific oyster that came along a few minutes later: Warmed but not cooked, it gave up a rush of rich oceanic juices and tasted a bit like cucumber. By the time I tasted the nori-wrapped and fried scallop, still pink at the center, I was convinced that this was one of the most exciting meals I’d had this year. The exhilaration of that night was not as intense on later visits. Even that first time, I wondered about the tempura asparagus. Did Mr. Matsui have a special farmer who grew delicious asparagus in September? He did not. Neither did Mr. Kato, who was serving asparagus when he was back behind the pan again in October. I doubted a tempura chef in Japan would bother frying asparagus when pumpkin was in season. I never warmed up to the crunchy onion half both chefs served, either. And while Mr. Matsui fried a Japanese eggplant to a puddinglike sweetness, Mr. Kato’s eggplant was not as softly thrilling. His seafood choices at my last meal — two species of eel and a flaky Japanese whiting — were very fine but a little monotonous. There were eight kinds of tempura at each of my meals. Apparently, some customers expected more fried food from a tempura specialist, so the restaurant recently increased the number. I never wanted more tempura, though; I wanted more interesting tempura. After a funny little salad to wipe the palate clean — Mr. Matsui’s had seaweed with grapes, while Mr. Kato’s grapes came with pickled mushrooms and vinegared apple pulp — came a dish I could eat once a week, a fritter of cut-up shrimp over excellent short-grain rice. At Tempura Matsui, it is served with pickles and a really terrific miso soup. For dessert, I was very happy about soybean jelly with a dark-brown sugar syrup, less enthralled with the grapefruit-flavored Bavarian cream. Experiencing tempura as a serious craft is a thrill, but Mr. Matsui’s style ensures that almost all the pleasure comes from whatever is being cooked inside that diaphanously thin batter. How many people will pay $200 for fried asparagus in fall when we can eat a kaiseki meal with a greater range of truly special seasonal ingredients at, say, Kyo Ya or Kajitsu? Tempura Matsui’s chefs and owners may be underestimating New Yorkers. Many of us are free of fried-food allergies, and ready for an adventure.",Set menu; few choices.
141,Jams,0.75 star,"Nov. 10, 2015",Pete Wells,Midtown,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/dining/jams-jonathan-waxman-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/dining/jams-jonathan-waxman-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"By the early 1980s, New Yorkers knew that something major was happening in the kitchens of California. They had heard about the revolution, but most of them hadn’t tasted it until Jonathan Waxman opened Jams in 1984. Here was a report from the West Coast front lines brought by a chef fresh from Michael’s in Santa Monica and, before that, Chez Panisse in Berkeley. To put it in terms readers born after 1980 will understand, this was a bit like being the first person in town to have cooked at both Noma and Relae, but bigger. Styles in food didn’t get around as fast in those days. Jams had an open kitchen. Mesquite flared under the grill. Vegetables, in their prime, were barely cooked. Salsa, citrus and cilantro breezed in. Low-fat sauces sat beneath the meat and fish, not smothering them on top. Small portions (critics called them “stingy” and “skimpy”) were ringed by arctic expanses of white china. Mr. Waxman brought a loose, unbuttoned American spirit to nouvelle cuisine, still nouvelle at the time, and the city loved it. Andy Warhol went to the Upper East Side to eat at Jams once or twice a week, Factory apparatchiks in tow. Then came overexpansion and the 1987 stock market crash. As the decade ended, one of its most influential restaurants went down with it. I can’t blame Mr. Waxman for dreaming he would bring Jams back from the grave one day. But after a few meals at the Jams that returned to Manhattan in August, I also can’t help wishing it had stayed there. This zombie Jams, at the corner of 58th Street and Avenue of the Americas, inside the 1 Hotel Central Park, trudges ahead steadily, but it’s stiff in the joints and short on joie de vivre. Some writers have seen the return of Jams as a sign that ’80s cuisine is coming back. But anyone who shows up with a Flock of Seagulls haircut expecting to see customers exclaiming over kiwis and Jay McInerney doing lines of Bolivian marching powder in the men’s room will be disappointed. The first sign that this revival will not set any new paradigms is the design of the dining room, which looks like a reclaimed factory. You’ve been in this room before, downtown or in Williamsburg. White pipes and ducts creep along a soaring ceiling, and the walls are scraped down to the bricks and structural terra cotta. The wood tables are bare, the chairs midcentury in style. There are some flashbacks to the original, like visible flames in the open kitchen, and a handful of items branded as Jams classics on the menu. The Jams chicken, half a bird grilled over wood, is charred on the skin and juicy inside, dressed with a little tarragon butter. It won’t eclipse the roast chicken with a crackling skin that has made Mr. Waxman’s downtown restaurant, Barbuto, a landmark, but it could be the centerpiece of a fine relaxed dinner if you are in the neighborhood. Mr. Waxman does not lay the pieces of bird in a nest of skinny, golden fries the way he did in the ’80s, which is just as well because the Jams fries are soggy with oil and can be limp, too. They arrive with the Jams burger, a juiceless, saltless, flavorless flap of overcooked meat that could have come from the most influential Greek diner of the ’80s. It would have been a complete loss without the help of bacon, cheese and aioli. The Jams pancakes, pink with sweet red peppers, were starting to curl at the edges when they appeared and weren’t quite tender. They weren’t cooked four decades ago, but apparently they weren’t cooked four minutes ago, either. There were three, each topped with a twirl of bagel-shop-grade smoked salmon and just enough caviar to cover my thumbnail in a single layer. Only the summery creamed corn with flecks of red pepper spread out under the pancakes had any real flavor. A restaurant that trips over its signature dishes is as hard to trust as a person who misspells his own name. (Good thing there are only four letters in Jams.) The chicken aside, I tended to have better luck when I treated the Jams name as a warning label and ordered things without it. Toasted fregola sarda under a big heap of plump mussels in a tomato broth warmly spiced with chorizo, for instance. Or the seared gnocchi with lots of corn, a little lobster and some cherry tomatoes. Or the hunk of swordfish, gently cooked so the interior still had a tinge of pink, with a smooth and mild romesco. Desserts can be likably retro, such as the simple and very fresh apple turnover made with puff pastry, or the more complicated charlotte with toasted ladyfingers forming a soft fence around a filling of moist, fruity fig jam. Recently the menu promised a “German chocolate angel food cake”; while it was nowhere near as angelically light as the name implied, it still had its appeal. But the non-branded items can also be tricky. Rigatoni with crab in a spicy sauce was fine up to a point, that point being the rigatoni itself. Some tubes were floppily overcooked, others leathery and half-raw at the ends. The ingredients, which do a lot of the work at Barbuto, sometimes seem unwilling to lend a hand at Jams. The cooked fresh tuna tossed with aioli and piled on a bun (a sandwich sold, misleadingly, as pan bagnat) had almost no presence. A raw fluke appetizer with cubes of flavorless, brown-spotted avocado tasted like nothing except salt. Servers do their best to cope with delays between courses that can stretch up to 20 minutes even when the dining room isn’t full. They seem well trained, delivering smart wine recommendations with confidence. But some of the lines they’ve been given are odd. Mine volunteered the information that the aioli on the burger “is a garlic mayonnaise.” For a minute, it really did seem like 1984 again.","Kale salad; Jams chicken. Appetizers and pasta, $6 to $25; main courses, $21 to $37."
142,Chomp Chomp,2 star,"Nov. 3, 2015",Pete Wells,West Village,"Asian, Chinese",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/dining/chomp-chomp-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/dining/chomp-chomp-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"“Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth, whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul,” Herman Melville wrote, “I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.” I feel you, Herman. In my line of work, grimness of the mouth sets in after I’ve eaten too many things that are trying so hard to impress that they lose touch with anything that comes close to pleasure. And each time I see a roomful of people handing hundreds or thousands of dollars over to a chef who stopped caring a long time ago, my mood turns distinctly Novemberish. Whaling jobs being harder to come by than in Melville’s day, my sea voyages usually take the form of a short ride to a cheap restaurant where warm flavors from another part of the world will burn off my interior drizzle. Recently, these rides have ended at Chomp Chomp in Greenwich Village for radish cakes, noodle soups with transporting powers, coconut rice, triangles of golden beef-filled roti wet with curry sauce, and other treats from the food courts of Singapore. These are not the franchise-studded cul-de-sacs that fill American malls with hypertrophied cinnamon buns and microwaved despair. Singaporean food courts, better known as hawker centers, are lined with stalls whose proprietors make a small number of dishes, or just a single one, over and over. The appeal of Chomp Chomp, which the chef and owner, Simpson Wong, named after one of the country’s most magnetic hawker centers, is that you can eat your way from stall to stall without leaving your seat. If Chomp Chomp were an actual hawker center, I’d be an expert on finding the line for carrot cake. No carrots were harmed in making it. Daikon radish cakes, similar to the turnip cakes rolled round on dim sum carts everywhere, are fried with little shrimp, garlic chives and slivered arcs of sweet Chinese sausage. Singaporeans, some of the most food-obsessed people on earth, are extra obsessed with this dish, and for good reason. Warm, fresh oysters the size of quarters are softly cooked into an omelet, seasoned with soy sauce, fish sauce and garlic chives. Oh luak, it’s called. The omelet has been doused with chile-spiced vinegar, and there is a small pile of minced garlic on the side. Simple, unthreatening flavors, but eaten together they make it hard to stay grim about the mouth. Both of these are called snacks on the menu. So are the fried whole prawns breaded with cornflakes and curry leaves (just try it, O.K.?); the salad of cucumbers, mango, shrimp fritters and other things that you stir into a deliciously funky-fishy sambal; and the very good five-spice chicken rolled up with taro inside a tofu skin wrapper. Spider webs of light glow behind the carved wood lattices of Chinese temple doors hanging on Chomp Chomp’s walls. They are new to this dining room, but the schoolroom chairs with metal book racks under their molded seats are carried over from Wong, the same chef’s last restaurant in this space. They are comfortable enough for the first 20 minutes. It doesn’t matter much. Dinner moves quickly. Servers weave in and out from tables to the kitchen, where, behind bamboo shades at half-staff, cooks clack away at smoking woks. Noodles stir-fried with shrimp and soy sauce, called char kway teow, produce far more happiness than you’d expect from something that looks like shrimp lo mein. The appearance of another stir-fry, nyonya chap chye, is deceptive, too. Clear rice noodles jostled together with tofu and mushrooms, the dish has almost no color and a mild flavor, but the more you eat the better it gets. The Hainanese chicken rice is another sleeper; it tastes like much more than slices of soy-lacquered chicken over rice cooked in chicken broth. Many dishes are married to their own dedicated condiments. As melamine plates start to mingle around the table, these spouses can become estranged. Try keeping them together; urge them into counseling if you have to, because Chomp Chomp’s condiments are all different, some spicy, some tart, a little shrimp paste here, a little plum sauce there, and energy everywhere. There’s no separating barbecued stingray steamed in banana leaf from its spicy and wonderfully intense sambal, which is daubed thickly on top of the fish, then sinks into it. (Like many in Singapore, Mr. Wong substitutes skate to good effect, but keeps the traditional name.) How much of Chomp Chomp’s food would attract long lines in Singapore? I’m not sure. For specialists working in hawker centers, mastery becomes second nature through repetition. With around two dozen dishes on the menu, Mr. Wong’s kitchen may not get enough practice to turn out a heart-stopping version of any one of them. Flavors can go slightly out of focus from night to night. Lamb rendang was pasty, dry and a bit muffled at one meal. The next time, it was juicier and so richly curried I could almost believe it was cooked in the “million spices” advertised on the menu. A durian cream puff, which the menu once ominously advised you to try “at your own risk,” is now a special only when Mr. Wong can get fresh durian. The remaining two choices are bananas fried in a mochi-like batter or sweet potatoes and taro bobbing in a warm coconut-tapioca soup. As vegetable soup desserts go, it is excellent. A special one night, a potent glop of sea cucumber, mushroom and pork belly, reminded me happily of the wonderfully lunatic sea-cucumber Bolognese from Wong, where the chef indulged his creative impulses. At Chomp Chomp, the goal is faithful translation, and the potent glop turns out to be a genuine hawker dish. The everything’s-better-in-Queens crowd will no doubt argue that you can eat some of the same things for less at Malaysian restaurants outside Manhattan. Not quite the same things, I’d answer. Much of the menu is strictly Singaporean, and some of its Malaysian dishes have a Singaporean edge. Mr. Wong also picks his ingredients with unusual care. Try the kerabu sotong, a squid salad with a spicy Malaysian dressing. Taste how crisp and juicy the peppers and tomatoes are, how tender and sweet the squid. Not that I’d talk anyone out of eating Malaysian food in Queens. Go to Queens, go to the Village, go to sea. Go anywhere you need to go to keep November in its place.",Oh luak; murtabak; lobak; sarawak laksa; char kway teows; carrot cake; nasi lemak; BBQ stingray; Nyonya chap chye; asam fish; goreng pisang.
143,O Ya,1 star,"Oct. 27, 2015",Pete Wells,Kips Bay,"American, Japanese",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/dining/o-ya-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/dining/o-ya-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Tim Cushman, the creative and prolific chef of O Ya in Boston and its new spinoff in Manhattan, does not break the rules of Japanese cuisine. He slices them into tiny pieces, fries them to a crisp and heaps them over raw fish. Bite by bite, he gets away with it. But over the course of the two prolonged tastings that are the only options at the New York branch, one for $185 and the other for $245, the rules eventually catch up with him. Physically, the restaurant is an appealing mix of tradition and a loose American style. Attached to the Park South Hotel on East 28th Street, it has a separate entrance veiled by stands of bamboo and an upright boulder. Inside is a long counter where at least a half-dozen cooks slice fish and mold rice. At least as many people are visible in the partly open kitchen, working away at hot dishes. The front of the room is done in pale wood slats and looks Japanese, while the main seating area is a long row of tables with a red tapestry-upholstered banquette under a brick wall and an exposed metal air duct. Mr. Cushman’s chosen medium is sushi and sashimi, but the pristine simplicity of Tokyo’s edomae sushi is not Mr. Cushman’s style. With rice or without, seafood is scattered, smothered and covered with garnishes and sauces from all over, even Japan. Mr. Cushman really goes for it, and what’s surprising is that he almost never loses control. His one-bite dishes unwind into spools of flavor that you don’t quite see coming, even though a server has already told you what you’re about to eat. Turning Japanese convention around, an O Ya meal starts with sushi, then backs into sashimi. Draped over a bed of rice is a small omelet, neatly folded into a thin, soft envelope. Quietly seasoned with garlic-chive flowers, the egg tastes subtle and delicate at first, then goes very deep from the rich and savory flavor of a Wagyu beef fat that’s been turned into a fluffy white powder that looks like confectioners’ sugar. Fatty, ruby-red ocean trout gets a double-barreled blast of Vietnam from a caramel dashi and a salsa of rau ram, the herb that tastes like a minty super-cilantro. A pungent black olive purée and a raw shiso sauce punch up a buttery slice of pike mackerel. Hamachi may seem too delicate for its fiery crown of banana pepper mousse, but it’s not. Halfway through, when the rice threatens to flatten your appetite, it suddenly goes away. One night, the change was announced with a tiny volcano of golden-eye snapper erupting with crisp strands of wild ginger, sitting in a lake of white soy freshened up with yuzu. This is sashimi that resets the taste buds, preparing the way for more intensity to come. Under a dime-size shaving of Burgundian truffle was a small, very good scallop from Hokkaido, surrounded by a sea urchin-sake sauce so bright and delicious that I’d drink it from a hose, a rubber tub, an old work boot or anything else that was handy. Vietnam was revisited in kanpachi with fried shallots in a lean, light, spicy nuoc cham. With dishes like this, you understand why O Ya is one of Boston’s favorite destinations for a blowout meal. (An à la carte option theoretically allows you to get out for less than you’d spend in New York, although in practice many people have a hard time stopping there.) But the dishes are not all like this. The squid-ink foam and yuzu kosho aioli may get along well with a fried oyster sitting on a drum of rice rolled in nori, but the oyster was so overbattered and overcooked I couldn’t tell. It was like a dragon roll that didn’t work out. Three squares of seared Wagyu over coins of confit potatoes should have been a woozy treat, but weren’t. This intensely marbled beef can be very good either chilled and firm or heated and lush with melting fat. At O Ya, it was always somewhere in between: just warm enough to taste greasy. When it comes to sushi fundamentals, O Ya’s rule-breaking returns to haunt it. The rice, which should be warm and fragrant with vinegar, was usually cold and underseasoned. In some pieces, like the fried oyster, this bland rice was densely packed into a drum inside nori. (Traditionally, this would be done by gently wrapping seaweed around a loose ball of rice, but O Ya seems to roll it into a tight cigar.) Bites that began wonderfully would end with a thud. And there were small imperfections, such as the big white scale stuck to one piece of fish or the stringy sinews in a piece of tuna belly, that would cause a minor scandal at a traditional sushi bar charging these prices. Clunky rice was one reason I cheered silently each time the meal marched into the sashimi movement. Another was monotony. After a while, I’d start to wish the kitchen would let me catch my breath with a course that wasn’t more fish covered with more stuff and a sauce or two. Mr. Cushman can throw a mean changeup when he wants to. I had a great, silly time filling my mouth with a spoonful of frozen foie gras pellets and preserved lemon, and I fell into a minor trance drinking matsutake mushroom broth perked up with a squeeze of limelike sudachi. But these breaks from routine come only with the $245 menu. Both tastings downshift from savory to sweet with a remarkable bite that brings the two themes together, seared foie gras sushi dabbed with eel sauce and a bit of dark chocolate with wine-soaked raisins. Even if you have skipped the $95 or $115 wine pairings, the course arrives with a glass of sweet, sherrylike aged sake that doesn’t just complement it but completes it. Then come desserts and the respite that the meal has needed. In early fall, tapioca pudding with Concord grape sauce, cantaloupe sherbet and shiso ice made an appealingly seasonal refresher. This was followed by a ganache of dark chocolate with lightly smoky green-tea ice cream and shards of honeycomb toffee, a sophisticated way to close out. There is one last treat as you leave: a little sardine tin. Peel back the lid, and you find two colorful fish molded from passion-fruit gummy candy. By the time you taste them, you are back on the street, wondering why the whole meal couldn’t be this much fun.",Tasting menus only. Tastings at $185 and $245.
144,Bruno Pizza,0.75 star,"Oct. 20, 2015",Pete Wells,East Village,"Italian, Pizza",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/dining/restaurant-review-bruno-east-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/dining/restaurant-review-bruno-east-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Bruno has a few problems. It’s only been open since July, so maybe it will work them out eventually. I hope so. I don’t want to convict the restaurant’s chefs and owner for these problems because the real killer, as O. J. Simpson would say, is other people. More accurately, it’s a small group of people like me whose approval can lift some restaurants from the teeming primordial swamp of contenders, and whose premature praise and willingness to play down discomfort and inconvenience enable problems like Bruno’s. These enablers have given the unusual, original pizzas and visually arresting appetizers at Bruno more media attention than you may expect for a fledgling East Village pizzeria whose chefs have never run a full restaurant kitchen. In the middle of September, New York magazine’s website ran an article claiming that Bruno’s $18 plate of bread and fermented mozzarella “might just be the city’s most impressive new bread course.” This was a scoop; nobody else had written about the bread. It may well be that nobody else had tasted the bread, either. It wasn’t on the menu then. An infrequent special, it wasn’t on the menu the last time I ate there, about a week ago. Rave reviews of items that have yet to be sold to a paying customer are less rare than you may think. A restaurant that hopes to get a respectable P.R. push out of the gate will often make a few of its more striking dishes available for advance photographs and tastings. As soon as the doors open, waves of impressions from bloggers, Yelpers, Instagrammers and others begin to pound the shoreline. Two critics from Eater were among the earliest customers of David Chang’s Fuku, and their “first reactions” were posted about three hours after the first chicken sandwich was sold. There are reasons, though, for paid critics to give a new place like Bruno time to settle in. Pizza is not as simple as it appears. Getting it right takes time. Bruno’s chefs, Justin Slojkowski and Dave Gulino, mill the flour in the basement from whole New York State wheat berries, and ferment it slowly with a sourdough starter. I don’t know another local pizzeria that goes to these lengths, and you won’t taste a crust like Bruno’s anywhere else. What the raised perimeter lacks in crunch it makes up for in earthy, whole-grain flavor. But the crust has been slightly different each time I’ve tried it. Most recently, it had a uniform fluffiness, a cushiony yet chewy softness, without big air pockets or blisters. When it comes to toppings, Mr. Slojkowski and Mr. Gulino don’t play it safe, either. Their nearest approach to a classic pie is their margherita, with a sauce that incorporates sweet, juicy garlic and some fermented tomatoes. These give it a fizzy tang along with a slight saltiness. It takes some getting used to, but it interacts energetically with the white slicks of dense, rich mozzarella. Other pies verged on baked salads, with varying degrees of success. The most satisfying was the one with shavings of country ham and sliced peaches punctuated by melted blots of soft, grassy cheese made from raw cow’s milk. The most confounding started with a base of ricotta, thin rounds of zucchini and a carrot-top pesto that reminded me distantly of za’atar. A mound of raw, crunchy, long-stemmed greens interwoven with bottarga shavings was heaped on top. I studied this foliage for a way in. I tried biting a slice and munched like a cow, while leaves and stems flapped from my lips. I tried eating the greens with a fork. I couldn’t escape the feeling that I had been served at least two different dishes at once. The appetizers were more perplexing. As a lot, they looked more interesting than they were. Seared scallops got almost no assistance from a bright orange raw-carrot sauce. It didn’t have the sweetness of cooked carrots, which might have underlined the shellfish’s own sweetness. Maybe the chefs just like the color. This seemed to be the case with a salad of pink watermelon with green needles of okra. The flavors stayed stubbornly separate, the okra contributing only its interior sliminess. Inexplicably, the chefs also spurted a gray dribble of soaked basil seeds on the plate. It was a real goo party. Then there was the squid, nested above roasted Hatch chiles inside little cups of charred onion. Nothing blended. The undercooked onions were too crunchy, the peppers too dominant. The squid cups looked cool, though, which seemed to be the whole point of this and other dishes. Bruno is one of many new places where building flavor seems less important than composing an image that can rocket straight to the digital billboards. It’s hard to explain how great something tastes, but easy to show how great it looks, and in the short run, contemporary food media rewards the latter. Uncomfortable restaurant seats have become an accepted signifier of edgy seriousness. Seating at Bruno is divided into a long row of tables with chairs and banquettes, and a counter where you sit on upended whitewashed crates that offer no footrest or back support. After squirming on one of these, I knew why prisoners forced to kneel for hours will confess to anything. “The dishes will come out as they’re ready,” our server on another night had said, which sounded like a good thing: lots of food at once! But what he had meant was that it would trickle out slowly, one plate at a time deposited in the middle of the table. One of my companions wanted only her pasta, sitting out the other dishes. It came out last, after a 15-minute pause, only it wasn’t what she had ordered. There was another long wait for the right dish to show up. I’ve put up with this style of service in other restaurants, but the absurdity of it finally hit me here because this was supposed to be a pizzeria. Mr. Slojkowski and Mr. Gulino first came to attention serving tasting menus by night inside an East Village coffee shop. What the critics who lavish praise on tasting menus, including me, never tell you is that it is one of the easiest ways to run a kitchen. Serving a full restaurant where everybody orders different things at different times is much, much trickier. It takes speed and organizational skills that seemed to elude the chefs at Bruno on this night. No doubt this will come with practice. The chefs may eventually prepare plates that taste as interesting as they look. They might start by eating their own cooking blindfolded. The rest of us, the critics and bloggers and Yelpers, might try the reverse. Maybe it’s time to take off our blindfolds.","Margherita pizza; mushroom pizza; country ham pizza; delicata squash agnolotti. Appetizers, $12 to $20; pizza and pasta, $15 to $23."
145,Momofuku Ko,3 star,"Oct. 13, 2015",Pete Wells,East Village,"Asian, French",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/dining/restaurant-review-momofuku-ko-east-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/dining/restaurant-review-momofuku-ko-east-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"If you lived in New York in 2008, taking in an adequate supply of oxygen and any quantity of food media at all, you knew two things about a new restaurant called Momofuku Ko. One was that its owner, chef and chief iconoclast, David Chang, had imposed a reservations website that frustrated everybody except coders who wrote programs to snatch up some of the 12 seats the instant they went online. (Among the frustrated was my predecessor Frank Bruni, who, in order to write his three-star review, “entered into groveling, Ko-dependent arrangements with tireless friends and readers.”) You also knew that Ko served foie gras in a way the city had never seen. A cook behind the counter would rub a frozen cured brick of it across a Microplane held above a bowl with pine nut brittle, riesling jelly and lobes of lychee, showering them with falling pink flakes of airborne pleasure. Mr. Chang moved Ko to an alleyway off East First Street late last year, and it’s a testament to how much more polished and accomplished the new place is that when the foie gras appears toward the end of the night, it doesn’t dazzle the way it used to. In the company of another 14 or so graceful, beautiful dishes, it is slightly flat-footed, a dancer loping across the stage in Chuck Taylors while the rest of the corps balances on pointe shoes. This is no put-down. There’s no shame in being outclassed by a firm, spiced tartare of Japanese sea bream hanging in a sparkling jelly brewed from the fish’s bones in which capsules of finger lime wait, invisibly, tiny balloons of sourness ready to pop. Or in being cast in the shade by a one-bite mille-feuille whose crisp layers of rye pastry, sprinkled with green tea powder, hold lush yuzukosho béchamel and briny little globes of trout roe. Or in being shown up by barely seared, gently smoked lobster tail with the juicy tenderness of a ripe, warm nectarine. Extraordinary on its own, the tail sits on a whorl of spaghetti squash that becomes uncharacteristically exciting as it drinks up a foamy lobster sauce. At last, we know what spaghetti squash is good for. Leading the gang of cooks responsible for these plates and others is Sean Gray, Ko’s executive chef since 2014. (Mr. Chang, often seen wedged behind the counter in 2008, now presumably lurks in an underground lair somewhere, staring at a wall map with pins marking his dominion in New York, Toronto and Sydney.) Momofuku Ko is remembered as a local pioneer of the tasting-counter format that has spread across the country, but the original ambition was bolder. Mr. Chang was leading a daring experiment that asked: If you aspired to serve food as original and refined as anything in an expensive uptown restaurant but wanted to keep prices down, exactly how many amenities could you strip out? The answer turned out to be, “Not quite that many, Dave,” but the question was the right one at the right time. With the move, that experiment officially ended. The new Ko has amenities galore and a price to match. The high degree of finesse in the $175 tasting menus must be due in part to the greater acreage and better equipment in the kitchen, inside a U-shaped counter that seats up to 18. As they did before the move, Mr. Gray and his colleagues take turns delivering dishes. The original crew on First Avenue rarely made eye contact and often appeared mildly resentful, an understandable reaction in those sweatshop conditions. Now, Mr. Gray and his collaborators look relaxed. Sometimes they even smile. They’re not the only ones whose accommodations have been upgraded. We diners can settle our tense, crooked frames into the pliant leather seats and backs of the tall stools arranged around the counter, enjoying space around and behind us. This may not sound like cause to celebrate unless you remember the old Ko, where every time somebody squeezed behind you on the way to the restroom, you had to lean forward and hold your breath. Should you arrive early to this palace of luxury, you can pause at the small and very appealing bar, where the cocktails are highly intelligent without rubbing your nose in it. After the desserts (if you are in luck, one will be a bittersweet cookie-like tart shell filled with Fernet Branca pastry cream and dark chocolate mousse), you can ask for a cup of hearty and well-rounded barley tea, a remarkable concession from Mr. Chang, who in the past seemed to regard tea as a sign of weakness. During the meal, there is wine, in uncannily delicate glasses, from some of the world’s most revered grape stompers. Jordan Salcito, beverage director for the Momofuku group, gives these winemakers’ names and faces prominent play on her 78-page list. She also tries to show stylistic resemblances by noting when one producer has influenced another. This is a more useful, up-to-date way to choose a bottle than the ancient system of memorizing vintages and appellations. It comes at the cost, though, of emphasizing cult stars over new finds whose bottles are often bargains; there could be more choices for under $75. Versatile wines do best with the quick shifts of flavor in the seafood-heavy menu. You don’t want anything to fight with the intense flavor of cured, citrus-glazed mackerel sushi under scallions and grated fresh ginger strands. The skin is quickly blistered with the same blowtorch used to gently toast the bottom of the rice, bringing a wonderfully un-sushi-like crunch to one of the restaurant’s most delicious creations. Dud dishes are rare. There must be better places for exceptionally soft Osetra caviar than in a tomato-and-basil salad, for instance. (There are, and on another night the roe was spooned over an amazing, near-liquid potato purée.) Soy milk chawanmushi and a dark blotch of intentionally burned applesauce would have been puzzling with sea urchin even if the urchin hadn’t tasted metallic and iodine-heavy. This was more surprising because I’d been served exceptional sea urchin on other nights, laid alongside a swoosh of chickpea purée that incorporates fermented chickpea paste. If I told you fermented chickpea paste tastes a little like cheese, you might not want to try it, but you should. Eaten together with the urchin, two soft and orange blobs finding each other inside your mouth, it’s like a door cracking open to a new world of flavor. A few failures don’t necessarily derail a meal that aims this high. But you might, if you were feeling philosophical, point out that the menu’s sensibility could be more unified. Mr. Chang once called tasting menus “chefs’ novels, their big ideas, their statements of purpose and intent.” The menus at the new Ko are more like collections of short stories, not all by the same author. Quills of trofie dressed with Tasso ham, poblano peppers and Mimolette cheese make an odd traveling companion for the mackerel sushi. Elysian Farms lamb with green tomatoes and Calabrian chiles might turn up in any number of restaurants, and so could the excellent sourdough bread. Nobody would say that about the daring chickpea and sea urchin duet. The unifying theme of the original Ko was: “Forget your ideas of fancy dining. Here’s something new.” It was built by and for young, hungry, probably insomniac rebels who chased their craziest ideas. The new Ko was built by a mature chef for customers who have grown up, and it reflects all the comforts and resources and security and extra padding we accumulate in the middle of our lives. Those things can hem us in, putting the 4 a.m. howlings of youth out of reach, or at least making them seem counterproductive. If the new Ko has a message, it is: “Yep. This is what fancy dining is like now.” But those youthful howlings are still in its bones.",No choices. Prices $175 for a tasting of around 15 courses.
146,Wildair,2 star,"Oct. 6, 2015",Pete Wells,Lower East Side,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/dining/restaurant-review-wildair-on-the-lower-east-side.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/dining/restaurant-review-wildair-on-the-lower-east-side.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"When serious, reputation-making restaurants run out of room on the walls to hang all the awards, chefs open a cheaper, more casual restaurant nearby. Like a dutiful younger brother, the second restaurant is supposed to work harder, please more people, make fewer demands, be more pragmatic and smile as the firstborn sucks up all the attention. There is rarely any confusion about these roles. Bouchon Bakery & Café doesn’t try to waylay customers toddling toward Per Se’s blue door and tempt them into having a quiche and salad instead. Sometimes, though, younger siblings who follow the rules can still pull off some quiet subversion. This summer, the chefs Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske opened a wine bar two doors down Orchard Street from their showcase restaurant, Contra. The new place, called Wildair, plays its part exactly as written. And somehow, in a subtle and charming way, the kid upstages his big brother. Contra does laid-back refinement as well as any downtown restaurant, and the two chefs pack an impressive amount of nuance into its six- or seven-course set menus. Wildair is the one I want to go back to, though. I want to camp out at a high table, taste everything new on the menu to see whether it clicks and pillage the stash of natural wines like Genghis Khan. Format matters. Contra’s is a concise tasting menu, and tasting menus are the parchment scrolls on which chefs inscribe their Magna Cartas with goose-quill flourishes. Wildair borrows its format from contemporary European wine bars such as Manfreds & Vin in Copenhagen and Le Dauphin in Paris, places that extend a hand inviting us to try something new, drink a strange gamay bottled by an ornery old hermit, eat a little of this and a little more of that while we catch up, unwind and make plans. You visit Contra. Wildair is a restaurant you can live in. The food isn’t necessarily better, but it’s often more inventive. You wouldn’t guess that from scanning the menu, reading down from oysters and cheese to fried squid and steak. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske are serving familiar, likable food. But instead of tying them down, this seems to have given them permission to lift off with extra altitude. The squid is fried along with sliced lemons and sections of green onion. Everything is contained in a golden shell that is implausibly light and crunchy, with no hint of sogginess. Potato flour mixed with masa is the secret of the batter. A garlic-powered squid-ink aioli gives the dish some staying power. The secret of Wildair’s white shrimp with celery is probably the shrimp themselves, netted off the coast of Georgia. But the kitchen augments their unmistakably wild flavor by patiently stewing them in garlic-pimentón oil, heads and all. On my first two outings at Wildair, I passed up the pork rillettes, suspecting that they were outsourced. They are not. They are beautifully made on site, smooth and pinkish and creamy in a glass bowl sealed with a white blanket of fat. I spread the rillettes on thin toast and took a bite, letting the fat and its warm, holiday flavor of ginger and other seasonings melt on my tongue. I almost skipped the lettuce, too, suspecting that it was lettuce. I was right about that but wrong about skipping it. With squiggles of butter-and-caramelized-lettuce dressing insinuated into its folds and some chopped pistachios on top, the sweet Little Gem lettuce makes for one of those ideal salads that is as complicated as it needs to be and no more. The dream date for that lettuce would be the dry-aged Wagyu steak, slick with melted beef fat and so tender it doesn’t seem entirely real. It might have made me dizzy if I hadn’t already been reeling over the price, $70 for roughly 25 ounces of meat, sliced from the bone, that two companions and I ate while luxuriating in the oak-and-steel embrace of Wildair’s stools. (The discomfort is more acute at the narrow counters on either side of the dining room.) For the average mortal’s budget, the beef tartare is a more accessible lettuce partner. Chopped into bits that are big enough to chew, the meat is crunchy with toasted buckwheat, hot with fresh horseradish, and sharp with gratings of tangy smoked Cheddar. Though the two chefs seem liberated by cooking for a simple wine bar, this freedom sometimes leads them off the path. Wet blobs of below-par sea urchin had no business glopping up an excellent potato cake I ate in the early summer. The texture of whole clams and flabby cubes of lardo over griddled bread with spinach wasn’t as appealing as the flavor. The kitchen may also want to cut the squid and green onions into smaller pieces; you want to eat them with your fingers, but they’re so big you almost need a knife and fork. Mr. von Hauske is the baker of the two. The dense white sourdough with the fantastically crisp crust that he makes at Contra is sold at Wildair, too, this time with a dish of salted olive oil that catches nicely in your throat. For dessert, he has come up with a very likable panna cotta; the sweetness comes from soft shavings of watermelon granite and a crumble of caramelized milk. There’s also a chocolate-peanut butter tart that tastes exactly the way I’ve always wished a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup tasted. One sign of how well Wildair works is that nearly everybody I know who has dropped in has a story about discovering a new wine. The central character in most of these stories is Jorge Riera, the wine director here and at Contra and a soft-spoken but ardent advocate for winemakers who believe in letting nature have its way. I owe him for introducing me to a biodynamic fino sherry from Andalusia and an elegantly honeysuckle-scented grenache blanc from Catalonia, among others. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske named their wine bar for a prizewinning racehorse that lived in the neighborhood before the Civil War. Mr. von Hauske believes it should be pronounced “willed air,” but almost everybody calls the place “wild air.” Maybe everybody is wrong, or maybe this is just a case of a younger sibling claiming its own identity.","Bread and olive oil; pork rillettes; Little Gem lettuce; Georgia white shrimp; scallop crudo; beef tartare; fried squid; Wagyu steak; desserts.

147,Houseman,2 star,"Sept. 29, 2015",Pete Wells,Hudson Square,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/dining/restaurant-review-houseman-in-hudson-square.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/dining/restaurant-review-houseman-in-hudson-square.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Houseman is a new restaurant where you can get, among other good things, an excellent roast chicken. “Big whoop,” you say. “I can get excellent roast chicken at a place in my neighborhood.” Well, no, you probably can’t, unless you live across the street from Barbuto. But let’s not argue. Let’s talk about Houseman. It’s on Greenwich Street in Hudson Square, on a block that the rest of the city forgot about after the Holland Tunnel was built and then suddenly remembered a few years ago. Across the street is a glass-and-steel apartment house by the architect Winka Dubbeldam. It looks like a venetian blind that got tangled up with the building next door. If I lived there, I would have been happy in July when the lights came on inside Houseman, illuminating the white brick walls and pale wood tables and chairs. By now, I’d know the hosts who stand in the doorway or on the sidewalk. And one of my daily routines would be checking out the changes on the menu, which is laid out like a newspaper’s front page. Print lives! The date runs at the top to the left of the restaurant’s name. A weather report is on the right. (“Gray. Cooler!”) In the middle is a cryptic drawing; one night it looked like a pumpkin with some dangerous ideas. All around the page are boxes. One suggests an inexpensive wine, and another proposes a cocktail made with ingredients you’ve heard of. The rest are occupied by things that I am always very interested in eating. Since the chicken is the above-the-fold story, let’s start there. In fact, it is half a bird, with parsley salad scattered on top and a thick slab of grilled bread spread with roasted garlic on the side. But in every other way, it is a classic Sunday night roast chicken. In restaurants, I manage to get a chicken like this roughly once out of every 50 attempts. At home, my average is closer to one in 12. I tasted Houseman’s on three nights, and it was equally irresistible every time, juicy in every flap and joint. Ned Baldwin, who owns the restaurant and, with Adam Baumgart, runs the kitchen, said they weigh each bird before calculating how much salt to rub into its skin. However they do it, this is a roast chicken that you want to settle down with and take apart piece by piece. Most of the food at Houseman is like that. You don’t taste it in politely appreciative nibbles. You throw yourself at it until there’s nothing left. No menu layout can convey this quality, but when you find a restaurant that has it, you come back. The kitchen grinds sausages and grinds them well. One night, they were made from goat. If the words goat sausage conjure up a dry and wrinkled meat pouch, these were the opposite: pink, broad, juicy and gently spiced, offered up as a main course with a jammy tomato sauce and a bracing salad of dandelion leaves. Another night brought sweet pork sausages grilled then simmered, Portuguese style, with steamed clams, and very good. Houseman had an ideal late-summer dinner in its swordfish salad, a salade niçoise by other means. Hunks of fish, poached and then packed in olive oil and sitting on a mat of tuna mayonnaise, were surrounded by little potatoes, string and shell beans, and some cherry tomatoes roasted so they collapsed on your tongue. The menu is top-heavy with appetizers. Like that swordfish main course, they lean on seasonal produce given a Mediterranean cast. Roasted peaches were yielding and honey-sweet alongside chopped hazelnuts, crumbs of feta and crinkles of grilled pancetta. Drippingly ripe tomatoes, real September beauties, were submitted to a fantastic Middle Eastern treatment of sesame seeds, cumin and parsley, underscored by the tingling sourness of sumac. A long, skinny eggplant, its grilled skin stripped off to expose its pale flesh, was dressed with bright-green basil oil and sat on a swirl of uncannily smooth and lemony tahini. Can tahini be luxurious? This was. Even the snacks, often pandering little throwaways, are worthwhile at Houseman. Salted fried favas, as brown and crunchy as a nut, are a cocktail-hour treat with a Pat Flynn (a rum and Coke you can drink without losing your self-respect). A soft-cooked egg, split and topped with capers, anchovies and fried leek threads, is a fine idea, too. Houseman’s dining room, which has an upright, right-angled, vaguely New England look, provides enough traditional comforts that the scarcity of main courses on the menu seems out of character. Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Baumgart may offer so many more appetizers because they expect a lot of customers to make a meal of them. But when there are typically just four or five main courses, and one of these is a burger, the margin of error is small. Sometimes, Houseman falls outside it. That burger — two flat patties under melted cheese and a mushroom-onion topping — deserves a better bun than the flavorless and somewhat dry one it gets, especially at $17. (Crisp but preposterously salty fries cost an extra $2.) When a fillet of striped bass poached in court bouillon with clam juice is sold at $85 for two people, it shouldn’t be as overcooked as mine was. The dessert menu, which comes to the table written on an abacus chalkboard, runs into the same trouble. One of just three slots was thrown away on a scoop of lackluster blackberry sorbet in a nest of broken-up celery sorbet. The celery was more intense than the blackberry, which did not make it a better dessert. It’s lucky the other two choices were so good: a peanut tart that’s like pecan pie without all the goo, and a sundae of wonderful malt ice cream with cherries in syrup. Houseman is still a young restaurant, with room to grow. A better hamburger bun should not be hard to come by. Already it gives you something that a lot of places never do: a sense that almost everything was cooked for a reason. Until recently, Mr. Baldwin was the chef de cuisine at Prune, which gives you the same sense. Prune’s owner, Gabrielle Hamilton, was underrated as a chef for years because, I think, she never seems to invent anything in the kitchen. She isn’t big on shotgun marriages of ingredients. But she understands the pleasure, part animal and part something else, that we take from food that is direct and honest. Many chefs have ideas about how to cook. The really good ones have ideas about how to eat. Ms. Hamilton does, and so do the two chefs at Houseman.","Fried fava beans; heirloom tomatoes; roasted eggplant with sesame sauce; spicy seafood salad; roasted chicken; malt ice cream with cherries.

148,Gabriel Kreuther,3 star,"Sept. 22, 2015",Pete Wells,Midtown,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/dining/restaurant-review-gabriel-kreuther-in-midtown.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/dining/restaurant-review-gabriel-kreuther-in-midtown.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"When the chef Gabriel Kreuther left the Modern in 2014, he seems to have packed up virtually everything except Picasso’s goat in the sculpture garden. He named the place he opened in June, across 42nd Street from Bryant Park, after himself, but it could just as easily be called the Modern in Exile. He took along the Modern’s pastry chef, Marc Aumont, a virtuoso of desserts and breads who worked at his side for the restaurant’s first nine years. He replicated its two-in-one structure, too. In the bar, where gooseneck streetlamps crane out over low tables, he has an approachable menu, some of it Alsatian, like rustic tartes flambées and the greatest liverwurst in the five boroughs. Things get far more elaborate once you enter the dining room, behind a ring of rough timber beams pulled from a Vermont barn. In that space, Mr. Kreuther imported the four-course $98 prix fixe format that was in place when I gave the Modern’s dining room operation three stars in 2013. He has reproduced much of his last restaurant’s tone, too, with formal but cheerful servers raising bell-shaped glass lids from main courses in synchrony and quickly running a silver sweeper over every crumb that falls on the white tablecloths. Mr. Kreuther did not make off with the Modern’s wine cellar, but he charged Emilie Perrier with building a new one that is only slightly less impressive. There are treats from all over, but the excellent bottles from Alsace are a special pleasure. And of course, Mr. Kreuther brought his recipes. Here is the palm-size tart of smoked sturgeon and sauerkraut under a dandelion-colored mousseline with a gleaming black eye of caviar. There is the cushion of foie gras between two firm pieces of squab breast, trickling with red juices, all bundled up inside savoy cabbage and a papery shell of brik pastry. Both are as marvelous as I remembered. Like much of the cooking at this new restaurant, these dishes make an irresistible case for the power of classical European techniques, all the blade-flicking and stock-skimming tricks that Mr. Kreuther swings around so easily. A native of Alsace, his skills forged by the martial discipline of French, German and Swiss restaurants, Mr. Kreuther makes no effort to hide his old-school training. Rising up from a pool of cantaloupe sauce (an idea as cool as the chilled sauce itself) was a foie gras terrine. Any foie gras from Mr. Kreuther’s kitchen is pretty much guaranteed to be wonderful; this one was molded into a dome studded all over with purplish cubes of duck prosciutto, each no bigger than a pinhead. A smaller brunoise may be technically possible, but it would require lasers. Fried frog meat in the lightest sheath of batter was bunched up at the end of a leg bone pared as clean as a toothpick; you dunk these drumsticks in a lemony garlic bouillon so bright and focused that you can almost see the worried face of the cook who watched the pot. Two things about this fine-grained precision. First, it is about as fashionable as acid-washed jeans. Younger chefs are scattering ashes over whole leaves, splashing buttermilk in a bowl and calling it a sauce, and trying to hide signs of human manipulation. Mr. Kreuther’s dishes look as unmistakably man-made as a skyscraper, and his sauces were obviously produced in a stockpot, not an udder. Second, Mr. Kreuther uses technique with purpose. The point of cutting duck ham into microcubes is that you taste some with every bite of foie gras smashed on toasted brioche. So before dismissing this grand Midtown dining room as a horse-drawn carriage in the age of Uber, sit down and see how exciting a little knifework can be. Notionally, dinner is made up of four courses. In reality, new things stream out of the kitchen in an endless slot-machine cascade. Before the first course, three miniature dishes arrive at once. Each is a distinct event. The last time I camped out at a table, I wanted to pocket my guests’ cracker-and-sweet-potato sandwiches. A new bread from Mr. Aumont’s oven shows up every few minutes, each with its own spread. The parade starts with a warm, savory kugelhopf, still in its ceramic mold, with chive fromage blanc. It is so good that one of my guests nibbled on it while telling our server that she didn’t eat gluten. A few minutes later, she was given a plate of the best gluten-free bread I’ve ever met. I don’t think Mr. Aumont can make a dessert I wouldn’t like. He is always toying around with forms and shapes; the high point, so to speak, of his great chocolate-and-cherry dessert is a towering dark-chocolate cone that melts while you watch. But his games never interfere with the flavors, which stay clear and direct. Pineapple carpaccio is hidden under a tuile and a spoonful of herb sorbet (lime leaf, Thai basil), but you’re never in doubt that the fruit is carrying the melody. The savory courses don’t always have the same focus. Mr. Kreuther has a lot to say, but at times you wish he wouldn’t say it all at once. A sweet, charred whole tomato was overcome by its seasonings, especially garlic and black pepper, and by the cup of dark gazpacho that tasted like an unspicy virgin Mary and didn’t add any clarity. Far more distracting, though, is the crazily gaudy collection of tableware. Gabriel Kreuther would be a more elegant restaurant if the simple, well-designed service pieces from the Modern had come along for the trip. Servers place a different set of elongated forks and spoons on a black blotter before every course, and at moments balancing food on the end of one of these feels like a game from a small child’s birthday party. Some courses arrive on crystal dishes with a spike on the bottom; you’re told you can hold it by the spike or nest it into a kind of crystal inkwell, but what you can’t do is eat the food without thinking about the thing it’s sitting on. This pointless eccentricity goes on and on. Tableware salesmen must have scratched a symbol on the door that means “easy mark,” like a hobo sign. At first the interior, designed by Glen Coben, also struck me as too frantic. Mr. Coben juxtaposes those barn pillars with copper panels, glazed tiles and wallcoverings boldly printed with storks and flowers. It’s a little loony, but somehow all these elements together bring warmth and energy to a room that has at its core a deeply comfortable and rewarding white-tablecloth restaurant.",Langoustine tartare; foie gras terrine; sturgeon and sauerkraut tart; frogs’ legs; baked dorade royale; truffle juice broiled quail; squab and foie gras croustillant; all desserts.

149,Casa Mono,3 star,"Sept. 15, 2015",Pete Wells,Gramercy Park,Spanish,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/dining/restaurant-review-casa-mono-gramercy.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/dining/restaurant-review-casa-mono-gramercy.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Casa Mono has a lot to answer for. Founded by Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich in 2003, it was among the earliest and most influential restaurants to twist the Spanish tapas idiom into what New Yorkers learned to call small-plates dining. The Casa Mono style has spread far and wide, leaving in its wake a trail of cluttered tables, unpredictably sequenced dishes, and diners reduced to asking pathetically, “Will that be enough food?” All of this might earn Casa Mono the historical notoriety bestowed on early tremors of annoying or inconvenient trends, like the first spam email, if it weren’t the case that almost everyone agrees that Casa Mono has always been very good. To that I’ll add a contention of my own. The pleasures of eating there are both richer and more varied than in 2004, when this tiny, perpetually crowded restaurant was last reviewed in The New York Times. (Marian Burros gave it two stars.) Andy Nusser, the executive chef and an owner, kept the tapas fairly uncomplicated in the early days. Roasted piquillo peppers filled with juicy braised oxtail were on the menu then, are there now, and probably will be forever. The seared skirt steak, served with sweet stewed onions and a romesco that crunches with coarsely chopped almonds, is still one of the most elementally satisfying one-course meals near Union Square. It’s even better if you eat it alone at the bar, which may be your only option on those nights when reservations are impossible. But over the years, the kitchen has branched out into cooking that a Catalan tapas-bar proprietor might squint at before deciding that tapas do not always need to be interpreted with a strict-constructionist approach. In this era of sea urchin overload, there is still a wild thrill to be had from the sweet and briny orange lobes at Casa Mono, stirred with chopped walnuts and lime zest into very soft scrambled eggs that have been splashed with colatura. The menu calls this condiment “ancient anchovy oil.” How ancient I have no idea, but from the looks of happy disbelief around the table, I’d say just ancient enough. Or take the section of the menu called “Whole Organic Animals.” You may ask how a small plate can hold a whole animal larger than a quail. What the menu is trying to say is that Casa Mono buys entire beasts that once browsed on Hudson Valley pastures, then carves them up and serves them in portions that in Spain would be called raciones. Casa Mono’s drive into meatier terrain is largely the doing of Anthony Sasso, named chef de cuisine in 2008 when Mr. Nusser shifted most of his attention to other Batali restaurants. Mr. Sasso learned to swing a cleaver at Fleisher’s, the nose-to-tail butcher shop in Kingston, N.Y. This is one butcher-chef who does not try to hand you a dripping bouquet of snouts and spleens. Most of his “whole animal” dishes are ones that even cautious carnivores may try. And try they should, because the reward will be flavors whose depth and complexity are still too rare in American meat. Streaky lamb belly, rolled around tomatoes and raisins, had an extremely alluring balance of chewy lean and tender fat; the quality of the meat made the splash of mint salsa verde seem like a new idea. Lamb leg, with its more untamed flavor, was braised in cider and cinnamon, then folded into a sweet and nutty mole, with a memorable trace of bittersweetness that came from dark Spanish chocolate. A slab of goat confit, patiently simmered in olive oil, had a clear, clean flavor. Goat responds well to extra richness, which it got from guacamole strengthened by goat cheese, and from half an avocado cured in sugar. Bricks of meaty and very tender pork belly came with fried plantains, thin slices of honey-cured ham, pickles, garlic and a honey-banana mustard whose sweetness didn’t go over the top. As loaded with surprises as it was with flavor, this was Mr. Sasso’s tribute to the Cuban sandwich. Seafood is a major theme on the menu, too, and usually a rewarding one. Four razor clams cooked on a plancha and sloshed with olive oil would have been great if one of the four hadn’t been nearly raw. But baby octopus from the same plancha were tender inside and lightly crunchy along their suckers; they were served with shaved fennel and lumps of pink grapefruit, as they have been since Mr. Nusser dreamed up the dish a decade ago. The crema catalana hasn’t changed, either. Burned sugar still tops the custard like thin black ice. It still comes with bay leaf fritters. You still eat these by pinching the stem, biting down and stripping the sweetly scented dough away from the leaf with your teeth. Other desserts have added layers of polyphony. The most rambunctious of all involves bite-size churros, their crisp ridges pressed into chocolate ganache. A scoop of crème fraîche ice cream is painted maroon by a sauce based on Spain’s demented and inspired spritzer, red wine and Coca-Cola, fortified with cherries. It’s a perfectly controlled dessert that seems to be on the verge of total, wanton collapse. Mr. Batali’s other restaurants treat the Hudson Valley as if it were a lost region of Italy. Casa Mono does something similar, using the Greenmarket down the block as if it were the Mercat de la Boqueria in Barcelona, Spain. A softball-size heirloom tomato is dotted with popcorn-flavored aioli; pickled hot peppers are tossed over a voluptuous blob of burrata that sprawls across anchovy toast. The wines, of course, make a longer trip. In a miracle of space management, this micro-restaurant keeps what has to be the deepest, most pleasure-packed trove of Spanish wine in the city. The sherries alone, many bottled by the young, treasure-hunting Equipo Navazos firm, could see you through a solid month of meals. Titans like Pingus and Palacios are available for those who can pay for them, but Rachel Merriam, the wine director, has filled the list with well-priced discoveries, too. I found plenty of them with the help of sommeliers who seem to know instinctively when to stick with tradition and when to go off road. A request for something that would drink like cru Beaujolais was answered with a soft red Txakolina that had a bittersweet finish. And despite the crowds, the sommeliers always had time to talk. If you have questions about fractional aging, as we did, Casa Mono is the place for you. The sommeliers are so attentive that I didn’t feel neglected one night when I couldn’t quite figure out which server was in charge of our table. Service can be a little diffuse at times. In a place this size, though, help is never far away. Only three items (including a rabbit, in multiple parts) are listed at more than $20 on the menu, which runs from noon to midnight. The dining room, with glass doors on 17th Street that swing open in warm weather, is at its most charming in the slack hours between lunch and dinner. Even when packed, though, the little room has pockets of, if not privacy, then at least intimacy. The mosaic tile floors are now so worn down they look like Roman ruins. It’s hard to remember when they were new.

150,Superiority Burger,2 star,"Sept. 1, 2015",Pete Wells,East Village,Vegan,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/dining/restaurant-review-superiority-burger-in-the-east-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/dining/restaurant-review-superiority-burger-in-the-east-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"We all know restaurants where the menu changes daily. Last week at Superiority Burger, a vegetarian medium-fast-food outfit in the East Village, it changed in the middle of my meal. I was eating a tofu wrap and a salad of tender red-veined chard with pickled onions and juice-heavy blackberries at one of the six seats. These have swing-down desktops that remind me of college lecture halls and the old Prime Burger that used to sit across 51st Street from St. Patrick’s Cathedral. You can occupy an individual burger desk in a popular restaurant for only so long before the urge to let somebody else sit down becomes overpowering. So when I got back in line to place a second order at the counter, I asked for takeout. The chard salad, served like most of the vegetables in a paper boat, was no more. Taped to the spot on the white-tiled wall where its name had been written on a white card in black marker was something new: juicy green heirloom tomatoes with chopped corn. I wondered if one of the cooks had just tried out a new dish on Brooks Headley, the chef and owner, and he’d said, at 7:30 in the evening, “Let’s do it.” That was not far off, it turned out. “We’ve come up with a lot of our specials during little lulls in service,” Mr. Headley, who was the pastry chef at Del Posto until he opened Superiority Burger in June, told Lucky Peach recently. “Everybody runs down to the basement and picks up a project.” New ideas fly through the kitchen so quickly, you can almost hear them buzz by. This is what elevates Superiority Burger above what it appears to be at first glance, a Shake Shack for vegetarians. And it’s why going back regularly, as I’ve been doing, is an adventure. The avid experimentations of Mr. Headley and his cooks remind me of what was going on in the first year at Momofuku Noodle Bar, when David Chang and Joaquin Baca were on the edge of giving up and came back by cooking as if it were their last chance. Nothing at Superiority Burger contains meat, and most dishes can be made without animal products on request. Some of them you can be sure of finding every time, including the veggie burger that was famous from pop-ups before the restaurant opened. Others arrive out of nowhere and disappear a day or a week later. When it is among the specials taped to the wall, a meatless analogue of the Philadelphia cheesesteak interests me keenly. Shaved steak had been traded in for strips of yuba, the immortal Cheez Whiz for a smooth, subtly flavorful species of cashew cheese. The yuba mostly worked as texture; the flavor, which was strong and lasting, burst out of a spicy swirl of soft, deeply browned onions and green peppers. That sandwich did not mimic the flavor of a cheesesteak but conjured up enough of the sensations touched off by a cheesesteak to be an honest variation, not a fake. It was both heartfelt homage and its own, craveable thing. It wasn’t on the wall last time; I look forward to our reunion one day. The same goes for the ice-cold smashed cucumbers that seemed to have collided, in one of those fortuitous you-got-chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter accidents, with what tasted like spicy rice pudding. (Personal and confidential to the roasted fingerlings and eggplant last seen wearing capers and pine nuts in a radiant lemon vinaigrette: Please come back. I won’t ask where you’ve been if you don’t ask me about the chard salad.) When it comes to Mr. Headley’s gelati and sorbets, I try to adopt a Buddha-like state of nonattachment. These appear in a different two-scoop duet each night, one sorbet of ripe fruit straight from the market sharing a small paper cup with a dairy-based gelato. Last time, it was peach sorbet under gelato made with toasted hamburger buns; there were roasted peaches between them and a powder of the toasted buns, soaked in milk and dried, dusted over the top. When my Zen intentions weaken and I find myself wanting it again, I meditate on the impermanence of life as represented by a seductively lush nectarine sorbet I tasted a month ago. Wearing the paper cap of an old-time burger flipper or soda jerk, Mr. Headley takes care to serve his ice creams just cold enough to slide when they touch your tongue. But they won’t be melting; if you have ordered it with dinner and sat down at one of the burger desks, he’ll wait until you’ve finished before he picks up the scoop. I can’t think of a better, more meticulously put-together $4 dessert in the city. To my taste, it outshines the sandwich for which the place is named. The Superiority Burger is indeed superior to many other veggie burgers, but truly loving it may require a built-in desire for veggie burgers that I lack. Filling out its small Martin’s potato bun, layered with melted Muenster, iceberg lettuce, roasted plum tomatoes, brown honey mustard and pickles, the patty is seared to an energetic crackle and has a satisfyingly tender bulk. The buildup is almost too convincing, because the patty itself, which tastes of mashed beans, nuts and grains, breaks the illusion. For a ground-beef fan, the Superiority Burger takes you almost all the way, then stops. Among the sandwiches on the permanent roster, I prefer the Sloppy Dave. This is, of course, a meatless sloppy Joe, a sesame-seed roll filled with tofu in a marvelously spicy tomato sauce, with fried onions on top. I should say “usually filled with tofu”; the sandwich was almost all sauce on a first encounter, but it had more substance on subsequent tries. The menu’s nicest surprise is the Superiority Wrap, a whole-wheat tortilla encasing tofu and brown rice. A similar item is a staple of earnest vegetarian restaurants, where it typically tastes like a paper-towel tube packed with pulverized drywall moistened with Morrissey’s tears. The Superiority Wrap is a much more rewarding proposition. The rice has an excellent nutty taste. Shredded cabbage has a refreshing effect. A streak of bright tahini whirred with roasted sweet and hot peppers cuts through the tofu like a searchlight. And I loved the playful sweetness provided by a vein of candied sunflower seeds. The aesthetics of Superiority Burger are half-White Castle, half-punk. The menu board and signs borrow the stencils and ransom-note lettering from rock’s safety-pin-and-spit era. Music swerves from Wire and the Clash to proto-punks like the yé-yé singer Karina. The prices, which peak at $9 for the wrap, are as democratic as it gets. Mr. Headley, a hard-core-band drummer, leads his restaurant with the collaborative spirit of a musical style that gave up peacock guitar solos for blitzkrieg-bopping ensemble playing. He’ll tell anybody who asks that the cucumber salad isn’t his, but the work of a sous-chef, Julia Goldberg, and his menu is loaded with shout-outs to other chefs and restaurants. The chard salad had “Zuni pickled onions,” and raspberry sorbet came with “CF cream cheese gelato.” “Does CF stand for cruelty free?” a customer asked. “No, Claudia Fleming.” Another name you may hear, if you go more than once, is your own. The woman at the counter surprised me one night by remembering not just my fake name but the real one of the last person I had brought. This was more than standard critic-spotting. She showed me a stack of yellow Post-it notes with the names of repeat customers. “I’m trying to learn them all,” she said.",Superiority Wrap; Sloppy Dave; charred broccoli salad; dessert; vegetable specials.

151,The Clocktower,2 star,"Aug. 25, 2015",Pete Wells,Midtown South,"English, French",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/dining/restaurant-review-the-clocktower-in-midtown-south.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/dining/restaurant-review-the-clocktower-in-midtown-south.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"If you hope dinner at the Clocktower will get you a backstage view of the ticking cogs at the top of the former Metropolitan Life Tower, forget it. The restaurant is on the second floor of the New York Edition hotel, which opened in the skyscraper at the foot of Madison Avenue in May. Marriott and Ian Schrager, who run the place, brought in the restaurateur Stephen Starr to operate the Clocktower. To get there, you can take the elevator from the lobby, or you can disappear up what looks like a big white cocoon into a tight spiral staircase. Upstairs, burning candles in glass lanterns flank the floor of the elevator bank. Somebody, maybe you, will notice this too late and kick one over. “Don’t worry, it happens all the time,” a host says, not all that reassuringly. She leads you past the billiards table upholstered in felt the color of grape jelly and into the bar, where you rescue a female friend who has been sent there to wait for the rest of your party. She has been there just long enough to stand uncomfortably while every man in the room checks her out. The Clocktower plays a familiar game, the private club that has accidentally let you in. There are three small, connected dining rooms. Yours has a dark green marble fireplace big enough to roast a goat. Above the wainscoting of book-matched burl and below the wedding-cake crown moldings, original fixtures ordered up by some long-dead insurance executive, hang framed photographs in black and white, one above another, gallery style. They show celebrities from the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s, dozens and dozens of them. When you ask about one, a server brings you an explanatory booklet printed on heavy paper stock. Your waiter wants to talk about the menu. Seafood is listed under Seafood and salads under Salads. You nod. Orders placed, you get a small round loaf of bread, cut in quarters, steaming. “I.P.A.-rye sourdough with buttermilk and butter.” The crust shatters on impact; the crumb has a prickle of tartness. In five minutes, you want another loaf. When the seafood-under-Seafood arrives, you know the bread was a preview of what’s in store. There’s citrus-marinated shaved fennel, so bright that it tingles, over the chilled lobster salad served in its shell. A sweet king crab leg with cucumber-pickle curls and dashi jelly rides high on chipped ice spread out over a silver pedestal. Cubes of raw scallop and hamachi are spread over a chunky pesto that’s surprisingly right. This chef can cook. Who is he, anyway? His name is Jason Atherton. You’ll read later that he was raised in an English resort town on the North Sea, where his parents ran a small hotel. That he spent five years working for Gordon Ramsay. Like Mr. Ramsay, he now has restaurants in London and around the world. Unlike Mr. Ramsay, he is not a magnet for controversy, which may be why his landing in New York has been less bumpy than his former boss’s. Also, there is very little egotism in Mr. Atherton’s cooking. He seems to have the peculiar idea of cooking to make other people happy, not to reflect his own glory. You’ve heard that he serves contemporary English food at the Clocktower. It doesn’t taste much like England to you. There are exceptions, like the suave and gentle Lancashire hot pot, a traditional mutton stew that Mr. Atherton makes with rabbit, to excellent effect. It’s so good that you ignore the other, fancier half of the dish, a pastry-wrapped bullet of spongy rabbit loin and slightly overcooked foie gras. How to describe the rest? It’s festive and generous, and it looks exciting. Classic sauces and techniques are used, but they don’t feel like old hat. Mr. Atherton’s cooking is not pretentious, but it has the celebratory elegance that traditional hotel dining rooms promise to deliver and rarely do. A beurre blanc, taking its gentle heat and berrylike flavor from pink peppercorns, is genuinely exciting over gleaming braised halibut; so is the carrot purée that’s somewhere between a sauce and a vegetable. You’re even happier with the roasted king salmon that gets along wonderfully with its sauce of chives and chopped oysters. Of course, there is Dover sole, and you appreciate the time-honored treatment of brown butter, lemon and capers. You admire the duck à l’orange, too, the chew of the breast pieces, the concentration of the confit and the way the sauce conveys the fragrance of oranges without the sweetness. These sauces are spooned or poured when the dish is served, a formal gesture that the Clocktower pulls off without stuffiness. Maybe the stage business ought to stop there, you think. While one server points out each variety of raw oyster, another stands off to one side holding a tray of condiments. He stares into space, no doubt wondering where on the small table he is supposed to put all this stuff. A terrific piece of smoked thigh that comes with chicken breast, nicely roasted with herb stuffing under the skin, is served in a drawer that slides out of a little box. Some of this hyperactivity may fall away as the restaurant matures. Perhaps somebody will also toss out half the bottles at the bar; a lot of the cocktails have two or three more ingredients than they need. You took a few sips of a cloying pineapple-rum concoction garnished with glow sticks and a temporary tattoo, then ran for the sanity of the wine list. When the stock market stops correcting itself, you may splurge on a $400 Bordeaux; this week calls for a bottle in the $40 to $60 range. Clocktower has scores of them. Now you want dessert. You want all the desserts, in fact, so it’s a good thing you brought a crowd. The pastry chef, Sébastien Rouxel, has the same solid hold on classic technique and proven flavors that Mr. Atherton does. His pistachio soufflé, with a lump of chocolate-yogurt ice cream dropped through its roof at the last minute, is virtually perfect. You wish he would get the ice crystals out of the vanilla ice cream that comes with a tarte Tatin, but the sticky caramelized apples make you unreasonably happy, and while it’s billed as a portion for two, it’s easily enough for four. The table is still jammed, and here come some treats in a vintage McVitie’s biscuit tin. You make room because everything in that tin is good, from the crumbly-tender shortbread to the toffee brittle coated with dark chocolate and chopped peanuts. The check comes. You do the math, not just the tip, but the more subtle calculation of whether this is a fair deal. The Dover sole was more than $50, but it always is. Other main courses were in the $20s, which is rare in this style of restaurant. And there were great little surprises all through the meal. You sign your name. You’ll be back.","Lobster, fennel and apple salad; scallop and hamachi tartare with seaweed pesto; pigeon pie; king salmon; Dover sole; braised halibut; duck à l’orange; herb roasted chicken for two; pistachio soufflé; tarte Tatin.

152,Oiji,2 star,"Aug. 18, 2015",Pete Wells,East Village,Korean,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/dining/restaurant-review-oiji-in-the-east-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/dining/restaurant-review-oiji-in-the-east-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I’ll get to the heftier items on Oiji’s menu. I’ll praise the pine-smoked mackerel that a mackerel-conscious friend and I have been emailing each other about for a month now. I’ll reminisce about the bowl of buttered rice and stewed beef that seemed boring at first and then not boring at all. I’ll try to explain what makes the bubble-cluster of crust on the fried chicken so good. All in due time, all in due time. First, I need to tell you about the honey butter chips. As faithful readers of the South Korean dailies know, about a year ago the snack company Haitai introduced the country to a new potato chip flavored with “sweet, sweet honey from beehives” and “gourmet butter” from France. Mass hysteria ensued. Few stores could keep them in stock and those that did rationed one bag to a customer. The snack’s social media presence was Kardashian-esque. On eBay, two bags of the chips sold for more than $100. An anxious nation was soothed to learn that Haitai is building a chip factory outside Seoul, and disappointed to hear that it will not be completed until next year. Frustration was mounting in the East Village as well, where Oiji’s two chefs, Brian Kim and Tae Kyung Ku, wanted to pay homage to honey butter chips, but couldn’t get their hands on any. Undaunted, they took to the kitchen. The chips they came up with have not ignited a citywide panic, but they are not a joke. They come to the table straight from the fryer, translucently thin and shimmering all over with honey and brown sugar melted into butter. Cayenne keeps the syrup from overstaying its welcome. They are crisper and more lovable than wet potato chips have any right to be. The chefs grew up in South Korea in the innocent times before honey butter chips. They met in culinary school in the United States, then went off to learn their trade — Mr. Kim worked at Bouley, and Mr. Ku at Gramercy Tavern and at his family’s restaurant back home. Getting back together years later, they leased a room with a lineage, the former site of Dok Suni, the pioneering modern Korean restaurant on First Avenue. Made over as Oiji, it is a warm and orderly space of exposed brick and wood. Half the dining room is taken up by a table that looks as if it came from the reading room of a college library, with benches on either side. Oiji helps take the sting out of Dok Suni’s demise. In some ways it continues its predecessor’s mission of updating and translating Korean cuisine with respect. It may also remind you of the chef Hooni Kim’s places, Danji and Hanjan; like them, it adjusts traditional recipes for the small-plates era. Those places draw harder on Korea’s more intense flavors, while Oiji aims for a little French-style nuance. I promised you buttered rice and beef. Oiji’s braised beef is a variant on a classic banchan, but its version is less salty and soy drenched. You take your wooden spoon and stir it into the rice with half a soft-cooked egg and some low-key radish pickles. The mixture is so subtle it barely registers until the butter’s tractor beam switches on and you find yourself thinking that you could eat this every night. The mackerel that Mr. Kim and Mr. Ku smoke over pine needles may fit into your Sunday mornings. It’s soft, a bit creamy, and tastes like something Barney Greengrass might sell if it relocated to a forest in Maine. The fish comes with a soy-based sauce. You’re supposed to brush this on using a cluster of pine needles tied with a string. I liked the mackerel very much but this tiny broom made me feel as if I were having dinner under the floorboards with the Borrowers. As for the chicken, it’s a genuine achievement. Typically Korean fried chicken has a hard, crackling shell, but Oiji’s is dressed in a puffy, pale, blistered cloak that crunches like newly fried chicharrones. At the other end of the texture spectrum is the superb terrine of pigs’ feet, firm pink meat held in a thin lattice of gelatin. The terrine is underpinned by French aromatics (thyme, maybe allspice). Korea enters the picture through the precise, clear flavors of the spicy citrus vinaigrette. Mr. Kim and Mr. Ku have a spin on yuk hwe, but in their kitchen the chilled raw cubes of beef with egg yolk and sesame oil are augmented by pickled mustard seeds. It’s very good, although cooking the yolk to a soft jelly seemed like an unnecessary flourish. A hot soup of ground perilla seeds is gloopy and grainy in a way that some guests at my table never got used to. I wouldn’t put it at the top of my list, but I liked the way the chefs used oyster mushrooms to deepen the flavor of the seeds, which can taste a little flat on their own. The risk with this kind of cooking is that people who know their way around traditional Korean restaurants, where the only small plates are the free banchan, may walk away feeling they’ve paid more for less. I didn’t get as much of the tender squid, shrimp and mussels in truffled seafood broth as I wanted. And if the gochujang-braised drumsticks were twice as spicy I doubt shrieks of pain would fill the dining room. But most of the time, when I knew the Korean original, it helped me enjoy the renovations Mr. Kim and Mr. Ku have made. The cocktails aren’t quite as clunky as names like Thyme to Samba suggest. Wines are respectable, but the most rewarding thing to drink is soju. Oiji offers more styles and prices than you usually see in one place, including a garnet-colored soju made backstage with pomegranate vinegar. All but two dishes are under $20. Most can be shared by two or three people, but if you make a solo dinner of the mackerel for $14 and the house-made cold soba with pickled ramps for $10, you’ll be eating and spending well. Another $5 will get you honey butter chips and the satisfaction of finding a bargain not available on eBay.",Pigs’ trotter salad; beef tartare; fried chicken; cold buckwheat noodles; jang-jo-rim; smoked mackerel; pork belly and kimchi; honey butter chips.

153,Untitled,2 star,"Aug. 4, 2015",Pete Wells,Meatpacking District,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/dining/restaurant-review-untitled-at-the-whitney-in-the-meatpacking-district.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/dining/restaurant-review-untitled-at-the-whitney-in-the-meatpacking-district.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"If you can get past the name, a graduate-school groaner that I am supposed to underline, but won’t, there is nothing pretentious about Untitled. Untitled is on the ground floor of the Whitney Museum of American Art. The Whitney is the second major art museum in the city to choose Danny Meyer to run a big, semiformal restaurant — the Museum of Modern Art is the other — and yet Mr. Meyer is resolutely uninterested in arty food. When Eleven Madison Park began its swerve toward the conceptual, he sold it. The remaining holdings in his Union Square Hospitality Group are polite restaurants where polite people are in very little danger of being challenged or provoked. Although Mr. Meyer has worked to make his name synonymous with hospitality, what his restaurants sell above all is reassurance. Imagine his relief that the Whitney decided against installing Charles Ray’s sculpture of a naked Huck Finn, bending over next to an 8-foot full-frontal Jim, on the plaza in front of Untitled. (Next door at Santina, which plays Nicki Minaj to Untitled’s Taylor Swift, they would have rearranged the tables for better views.) The restaurant is slotted into a narrow quadrangle with glass curtain walls on three sides, designed, like the rest of the museum, by Renzo Piano. Untitled treats the architect deferentially. Too deferentially, I think: In its near-total lack of ornament, the dining room can look like an espresso shop. If Eero Saarinen’s cardinal-red chairs weren’t so comfortable, you might get antsy after an hour. An architect friend spent the night admiring Mr. Piano’s meticulous engineering, but also pointed out that interiors with curtain walls are only as beautiful as the building across the street. At Untitled, you look at a hulking industrial slab across Gansevoort Street. At least it is an improvement on the view from my old desk at Mr. Piano’s New York Times building, where I peered into the dark soul of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. All the energy and beauty at Untitled are on the plates. They throb with color. It’s not just decoration, either. The color mostly comes from fruits and vegetables so ripe they’re ready to pop. Michael Anthony, the chef; Suzanne Cupps, the chef de cuisine; and Miro Uskokovic, the pastry chef, use market produce flamboyantly, as though they were trying to get the purse-lipped farm-to-table puritans who solemnly hand you a single baby zucchini to crack a smile. A slice of the tender, rich poundcake is virtually swallowed up by ricotta, sabayon, strawberries and violas. More strawberries — and nearly every other berry under the summer sun — ring the gloriously slouching chamomile panna cotta in a great purple landslide. Around a towering ship’s-prow wedge of cake with sesame brittle and peanut-butter icing, servers pour a blueberry sauce with the spicy buzz of ginger, which rockets the dessert right out of PB&J territory. The four menu categories aren’t labeled, but it’s obvious that the third section is turned over to vegetables. A few are best as side dishes, like the spoonable potato purée liquefied with melted Cheddar, too salty for more than a few bites. Most of the vegetables, though, have enough contrast and sophistication to be appetizers or even main courses. Pickled wine-colored cherries, sunflower seeds and orange splashes of carrot vinaigrette make every bite of a kale-and-cabbage salad taste like a new dish. (If we are sentenced to see raw kale everywhere we go, every restaurant should dress it as exuberantly as Untitled does.) Earlier this summer, there were roasted and griddled leeks, as dark as roasted Japanese eggplants and almost that soft, with an intense, sweet-sour salsa sauce of citrus and pasilla chiles; I’ve never wanted to cheer for a plate of leeks before. Every taste tells you how carefully (and recently) these chefs have done their shopping. A dinner companion was convinced that some ingredient had been injected into the flat beans to make them taste so alluring, and she didn’t think it had anything to do with the baby squid, hazelnuts and ancho chile sauce on the plate. But no, these were just excellent beans, grilled quickly so they still had some snap and juice. You can tell that the rotisserie chicken had great flavor down to its core before it took its turn on the spit. If you’re not sure, try the fried chicken that comes on the same plate. Under the airy, crackling crust that owes something to Japan and Korea, there’s very fine meat. If every dish were this good, Untitled might rank up there with Gramercy Tavern, where Mr. Anthony and Mr. Uskokovic hold the same titles they do here. But the kitchen isn’t there yet. One night I’d brought along a native of Owensboro, Ky., the smoked mutton capital of the world. But it didn’t take a barbecue authority to know the smoked pork ribs were tough and undercooked, and coated in a paste that didn’t taste of anything but salt. It was the only real disaster. In other dishes, the worst you could say is that the cooks packed too much into their shopping bags. The flavor of swordfish steaks disappears into a mashed eggplant that was a little too sharp and salty, and the taste of sea scallops can’t hold its head up in a bowl of sweet watermelon gazpacho with lemon cucumbers and peaches. At times the plates had so much going on that they left you with only a blurry impression of deliciousness. But as blurry impressions go, that one is hard to beat. At the end of one dinner, Mr. Anthony stopped by my table. (I’d been spotted long ago.) He was enthusiastic about how the gray limestone floors and white-oak counter catch the light during the day. He was slightly less enthusiastic about the kitchen, which is as narrow as a scallion. When he said he and Ms. Cupps were taking inspiration from the overflowing planters up on the High Line, I understood the botanical profusion of their plates. Maybe the wine director, Eduardo Porto Carreiro, can find some inspiration up there, too. Native plants grow on the High Line, and American art fills the Whitney, but Untitled’s wine list genuflects toward Europe. You can drink very well without spending a fortune, but it could get interesting if Mr. Porto Carreiro took his cues from the location. Untitled is not really meant for museum visitors, who are much more likely to recuperate with an avocado toast at Mr. Meyer’s Studio Cafe on the eighth floor. Instead, the restaurant is one of the attractions the museum is peddling, part of its multipronged campaign to be seen as a neighborhood hot spot and not just some boring shed where there’s nothing to do but look at art. Sometimes I miss those boring sheds, though I don’t miss the school lunchroom smell of their cafeterias. And at least the Whitney’s urge to pump itself up with crowds has given us Untitled.","Kale salad; corn flatbread; pole beans, calamari and hazelnuts; golden tilefish with curried squash; roasted and fried chicken salad; strawberry ricotta poundcake; blueberry-peanut butter crunch cake.

But the people at the next table were stumped when they saw it on the menu of Noreetuh, which has been offering tastes of Hawaii in the East Village since March. “What’s poke?” one of them asked, rhyming it with Coke. After a silence, a man sitting with her spoke up. “It’s a fish,” he said. Pause. “A kind of tuna.” This exchange suggested some of the challenges facing Noreetuh’s chef, Chung Chow, along with his partners, Jin Ahn and Gerald San Jose. Island seafood and produce fill the walk-ins at contemporary Honolulu restaurants like MW or the Pig and the Lady, but they rarely reach the island of Manhattan. A knowledgeable audience can’t be imported, either. While islanders can be counted on to know exactly which local dish Alan Wong is playing around with, the average New Yorker has almost no idea what the residents of the 50th state eat. Don’t they like … Spam? Sure, among other things. Mr. Chow, who was raised in Hawaii and cooked at Lincoln Ristorante and Per Se, goes out of his way to treat Hormel’s arrestingly pink canned meat product as if it were an heirloom ingredient. Stuffed into supple agnolotti and accessorized with hon-shimeji mushrooms; semi-juicy, soy-cured spring almonds; and a mob of bonito flakes (waving their hands in the air like they just don’t care), it could almost pass for mortadella. It may be the most elegant dish on Mr. Chow’s menu, although it gets stiff competition from the monkfish liver torchon, a pink button surrounded by jellied passion fruit. Lightly pickled pears soften the passion fruit’s brassy tendencies. Mash the fruit and fish liver together on a sweet dinner roll from King’s Hawaiian bakery, and you have one of the most exciting tastes to wash up on Manhattan’s shores this year. With prime ingredients, carefully organized plates and nonviolent menu prices, Mr. Chow seems intent on making Hawaiian classics presentable for their introduction to New York. Four or five garlic shrimp stand side by side on a long column of rice, offering the same pleasurable assault of garlic-flecked butter that you’d get from a big messy pile slopped onto a paper plate by one of the shrimp trucks of Oahu. And however you pronounce it, Mr. Chow’s poke is classical, generous and slightly Japanese-leaning, made from firm, cool bigeye tuna, diced and slicked down with sesame oil. Frills of seaweed carry the heat of tobanjan, the spicy Japanese bean paste. Neatness counts for only so much, though, and some dishes are more fastidious than flavorful. The pork in panko-crusted croquettes isn’t very emphatic, and the katsu sauce on the side needs more kick, too. A different poke, with octopus and fingerling potatoes, has only a flicker of the tuna’s personality. White asparagus looks very nice alongside crumbled Chinese sausage and chopped eggs, but the combination doesn’t go very far. Noreetuh has plenty of dishes for a successful first visit. Dinner will be particularly fun for wine lovers because Mr. Ahn has compiled an overachieving list of German rieslings, Burgundies in both colors, grower Champagnes and more far-flung treats. Better still, the prices are low; just by sticking to your budget, you can drink at a higher level than usual. Noreetuh may have a trickier time converting new diners into regulars, though. The two dining rooms, while tasteful enough, don’t have anything you could really call atmosphere. Noreetuh means “playground” in Korean, and the owners seem to want to give a party. But where did they find their DJ.? A Motown hit parade is followed by “Yellow Submarine,” and then by Taylor Swift, Natalie La Rose and, gosh, is that really Taylor Swift, twice in one night? At the moment, there’s something a little cautious about the whole enterprise. But the last time I went, I ate a bowl of spaghetti, new to the menu, that points in the right direction. Richly oily smoked butterfish was folded in among buttered noodles, bright orange with fiery little capsules of spicy cod roe. This wasn’t a polite exercise in cultural diplomacy; it was a shut-up-and-eat dish, and if a third Taylor Swift song had played right at that moment, I wouldn’t have cared.  Another small, modest looking restaurant called the Eddy sits right around the corner, on East Sixth Street’s disappearing row of interchangeable curry spots. The Eddy is so small and modest looking, in fact, that after it opened last spring, I almost decided not to review it at all, on the theory that when a restaurant has just over 30 seats and doesn’t seem to have any trouble filling them, there isn’t much point in driving more people there. The chef is Brendan McHale, and I wasn’t always sold on his cooking. I would have liked some of his dishes better if they hadn’t reminded me of slightly better things I’d eaten elsewhere, like the burrata served, as at Estela, in an herbaceous puddle of chlorophyll. Others, like the strangely bloated gnocchi or the dull, spongy lamb loin served with pellets of teff spaetzle that looked like rabbit feed, were easy to forget. But other dishes were wonderful. There were unimprovable roasted potatoes with strips of rib-eye whose dry-aged intensity was amplified by the low-key funk of melted Brie. And the soft-shell crab with a peppery arugula pesto that I kept eating after the crab was gone. And the jiggly, just-set cardamom panna cotta with crystals of rhubarb granité on top. And the airy chips of fried beef tendon, spread with Greek yogurt and dotted by smoky trout roe. Like Mr. McHale’s bacon tater tots, which wear little bright-green berets of puréed sweet peas, the tendon puffs disappeared with a crunch and left behind a strong desire for more. I would say that both hors d’oeuvres were smart cocktail party food, but I have never been invited to a cocktail party this smart. And then I thought about how extremely pleasant everybody is at the Eddy, starting with the bartenders, who look up and smile each time a new customer walks in, as if they lived in the opening credits of a sitcom. I remembered the drinks they made, which are as good as the ones at a dedicated cocktail bar. I recalled the compact well-priced wine list, and how I never picked a bottle that I didn’t enjoy a little more than I’d expected. When I went back to the Eddy, I noticed how quickly the people I brought settled in and got comfortable under the timbered rafters and low ceiling that make the dining room look like a well-kept old tavern. And how easy it was to hear one another, even when the place was crowded. The Eddy, in other words, is one of those restaurants that gets so many little details right that your main course can be a little shaky and you can still walk out happy. That’s a rare thing, no accident when it happens, and the reason all those seats are so often full.",Silken tofu; bigeye tuna poke; monkfish liver torchon; mentaiko spaghetti; pineapple-braised pork belly; mochi waffles.
155,Blanca,3 star,"June 16, 2015",Pete Wells,Bushwick,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/dining/restaurant-review-blanca-in-bushwick-brooklyn.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/dining/restaurant-review-blanca-in-bushwick-brooklyn.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"When Blanca opened in 2012, a 27-course tasting menu served at a counter behind a pizzeria in Bushwick sounded like the setup to a joke. (Second prize is 30 courses.) The restaurant does have its sense of humor, but it quickly proved that about cooking for maximum pleasure, it was unswervingly serious.  Carlo Mirarchi, the chef and an owner of Blanca and its sprawling mother ship, Roberta’s, was a rigorous miniaturist, combining a few ingredients at a time into two- or three-bite compositions that were utterly complete, even if they left you wanting more. At 31, he already had an impressive sense of what to put on a plate and what to leave off. What he didn’t have yet was a repertoire deep enough for the length of the meals he served. My early dinners at Blanca were marked by dishes that seemed like placeholders, and there were moments when the kitchen’s reach exceeded its technical grasp. It was as if Mr. Mirarchi were giving you a tour of a mansion he’d bought before the contractor had finished the punch list. Most of the place was spectacular, but there were rooms where you would not want to spend the night. Being a critic, I had a suggestion, hinted at in my two-star review that year: make the meal shorter and cheaper. Being a chef, Mr. Mirarchi ignored me and kept refining his marathon tastings, very gradually. “The menu changes so slowly that for us it’s like watching your hair grow,” Leslie Vinyard, Blanca’s welcoming and gracious service captain, remarked one night from behind the countertop. So it may have taken a while, but every time I’ve settled into one of the padded brown-leather captain’s chairs recently, nearly everything I’ve tasted has been remarkable in one way or another.  One dinner this spring got rolling with a fat little Pacific Northwest oyster. Sharing its deep cup-shaped shell were juicy round cells of finger lime that popped in my mouth like citrus caviar, and a pool of green juice pressed from roasted asparagus, an ingenious combination that teased a mild cucumber flavor out of the oyster.  At the end of the night, asparagus came back. Samantha Short, the pastry chef, had made a sort of coconut semifreddo, silky on the tongue, which hovered over a spoonful or two of white asparagus soup seasoned with sugar and salt. Sweet and savory, tropical and vegetal flavors crashed together and bloomed into something daring and great. The desserts after some mega-tastings are gradual diminuendos. This was a mike drop.  Over three meals since October, I’ve experienced all sorts of flavor detonations: a streaky fold of raw pancetta with a burst of black peppercorns; a salt-roasted Japanese sweet potato with an unexpectedly dreamy dressing of macadamia milk and ground espresso beans; a crunchy wedge of tart apple carrying a small, remarkable payload of garlic, olive oil, anchovies, fried bread crumbs and cardoons cooked in apple juice.  I have also started looking forward to sunchokes, a vegetable that has a hard time getting more out of me than grudging acceptance. Blanca caramelized them deeply, steeped them in soy milk, then whipped them into a cream. A ragged leaf of toasted sea lettuce supplied a bottom note, and the crumb of beeswax and honey at the bottom of the dish made my eyes go wide, every time. Then there are the agnolotti parcels that are like Freshen Up gum from the dark side. They burst when you bite down with an oozing, inky-green liquid made from melted taleggio and phytoplankton. The flavor is like a distillation of spinach, seaweed and squid ink. It’s a totally disorienting sensation, and while I love it, not everyone will. I think of this course as the one guest-directed by David Lynch. It is when the dwarf starts to dance. One of Mr. Mirarchi’s sillier conceits in the early days was making you wait more than two hours for an ordinary slice of filone, presented as its own course. You still wait, but now it’s worth it. The breads made by Nina Subhas may include a soft Hawaiian sweet roll with pineapple juice in the dough and black salt on top, and a flaky garlic knot that’s like a savory Danish. Or you may be given a chunk torn from a squat round loaf made from Roberta’s pizza dough. Brushed with olive oil, this steaming-hot pizza bread doesn’t need the house-made butter, not that I let that stop me. Once, grilled snow crabs were served with a deliciously funky crab-innards sauce. Now the steamed legs of very recently living king crabs come with a saffron-colored slosh of melted butter sauce whipped with shaved bottarga. The sauce is an upgrade, less likely to step on the sweetness of the shellfish, and I’ve never again been served gelatinous, half-raw crab legs as I was in 2012. This has become one of New York’s essential dishes, along with the ’nduja raviolo, an explosion of spicy pork lava, the one item that has been on the lineup since opening night.  Mr. Mirarchi’s notion of what al dente means seems to have softened. So has the pasta, slightly, but I’ll deal with the extra-chewy core of tightly hand-rolled noodles to taste his creamy, yolk-rich carbonara with lamb fat and cured lamb breast.  Beneath the body of Blanca’s menu is an Italian chassis, so after pasta come the meat courses. There may be a few rosy slices of roast duck placed beside a slow-burning beet mole, followed by porchetta with chimichurri. The servings are never very large and never as hot as I’d like, but the meat is always juicier and more concentrated than almost any other restaurant can manage.  When you say “savory desserts,” some people look for the exits. None of these people have tasted Ms. Short’s intermezzos and finales. She can make the heat and the vegetal taste of poblano peppers seem like sensible, delicious additions to a cake. One night, her parting shot was a chocolate-Parmesan ice cream with shaved white truffles. It was another mike drop. One could, and come to think of it one will, complain that Blanca offers no wine bottles under $80 and no glasses under $18. Customers who have torn a hole in their budget to afford the $195 for dinner, before tax and tip, shouldn’t have to drink beer all night. Not that this would be a terrible fate; Blanca’s beers are as varied and full of character as the sakes and wines. A course-by-course wine pairing can be had for $95, but Shanti Carson, the sommelier, excels at working with people who aren’t that thirsty.  Ms. Carson is also the one who placed the vinyl on the turntable when I decided to prove to the other 11 people at the counter that “New York Groove” isn’t the only good song on Ace Frehley’s first solo album.  The record collection, which Mr. Mirarchi may well have lifted straight from the garage of his childhood home, is one of the ways Blanca deflates high-end dining’s gassier pretensions. His aim has always been to run a restaurant that is both a luxury and a weird adventure. The entrance tells you everything. You walk into a cinder-block bomb shelter of a pizzeria, past the crowds eating pies with names like Lamb of God. You turn left at the bar, go out the door, take another left at the radio studio and a right at the tiki bar. Keep going past the shipping containers and the outdoor oven, walk down a couple of steps, through the door, and you’re inside Bushwick’s first three-star restaurant.",Tasting menu ($195) only.
156,Mission Chinese Food,2 star,"June 9, 2015",Pete Wells,Lower East Side,"American, Chinese",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/dining/restaurant-review-mission-chinese-food-on-the-lower-east-side.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/dining/restaurant-review-mission-chinese-food-on-the-lower-east-side.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"When it appeared on Orchard Street in 2012, Mission Chinese Food was slightly unreal. It didn’t seem to follow the rules, or even know that there were rules. The health department and other city agencies knew, though, and after just 18 months, they pulled the plug on Danny Bowien’s hallucinatory all-ages chile-pepper party. At its new address on East Broadway, there is a host behind a lectern instead of a dude handing out plastic cups near the beer keg. While the old space looked as if it had been built by Mr. Bowien and his friends with two-by-fours, a staple gun and a paper dragon, the new two-level dining room with half-moon booths of brushed red velvet under bistro mirrors was inherited from an earlier restaurant that seemed to have employed a licensed architect and a professional designer. Now there is a well-appointed kitchen in the basement, not Orchard Street’s narrow galley behind plexiglass, where the heat and flames were so ferocious that Mr. Bowien seemed intent on turning himself into the nightly special, grilled chef. He still wears shorts on his trips to the dining room, but now it looks like a fashion choice, not a matter of survival. While very few items on the old menu couldn’t be knocked together by one person with a wok in less than five minutes, many dishes now speak of ample counter space and many hands, including those of Angela Dimayuga, the executive chef. (Mr. Bowien is the chef and owner.) Of her many contributions to Mission Chinese Food, the one everybody wants to talk about is Josefina’s house special chicken. Josefina is Ms. Dimayuga’s grandmother, a Filipina, and her chicken is no short-order stir fry. The bird is roasted with a stuffing of fresh chorizo, raisins, olives, sweet pickles and butter. It is carried to the table on a silver platter, feet splayed out, head tucked in. When the torso is cut into thick slices, the center of each one has the white-and-yellow ring of a hard-cooked egg. Everything about Josefina’s chicken is great. The recipe is most likely of Spanish descent. This should make it an idiosyncratic fixture in a Chinese restaurant, but idiosyncrasy is to Mission Chinese Food what the Bloomin’ Onion is to an Outback Steakhouse. In the original San Francisco incarnation, as well as in the first New York location, most of the idiosyncrasies looped around Sichuan cuisine. Many of the old dishes, marked as much by Mr. Bowien’s freethinking approach as by the burn and tingle of chiles and Sichuan peppercorns, have migrated to the new restaurant: the kung pao pastrami; the galvanizing lamb ribs with sweet, gooey dates; the Chongqing chicken wings so acutely spicy and flavorful they make Buffalo wings seem as dangerous as an animal cracker. But this kind of scorched-tongue cooking has become a minor motif in Mr. Bowien and Ms. Dimayuga’s menu, which goes on for pages. Fewer than a third of the items are marked by red flames blazing from what looks like a pair of cheeks, and not the ones you kiss your grandmother on. The rest is not just less fire-spewing but more varied than before, drawing from regions beyond Sichuan and countries beyond China. Some of it is even nuanced. Splashing around in a gentle, aromatic pool of chamomile, almond milk and saffron, the steamed Napa cabbage has more in common with a chai latte than with Mr. Bowien’s pork-drenched mapo tofu. There is a startlingly well-calibrated, nori-sprinkled salad of red cabbage in a Caesar-esque vinaigrette of soy, miso, sesame and anchovy. Konnichiwa, Caesar! Another salad waves toward Vietnam, with green papaya threads, roasted peanuts, sliced banana blossoms and shreds of lightly smoked chicken. The perfume of dill, mint and basil rises up from a bowl of cellophane noodles in deeply aromatic lamb soup. Grassy, astringent matcha is sprinkled over green-tea noodles with scallions and ginger. Fried rice with sweet and tender lumps of lobster is fragrant with coconut oil. Whole dorade can be cooked two ways: roasted in the wood-burning oven with turmeric and pickled chiles, or deep-fried and plopped down on a sheet pan over fat noodles and hunks of purple taro, with an armful of fresh herbs thrown on top. All of these are smart, layered and vibrant enough to win over anybody who shows up thinking that Mission Chinese Food is still in the business of knocking your head against the wall until you smile or pass out or both. It’s easier to taste the quieter flavors now. With the extra space and staff, the kitchen pays some attention to the order in which dishes arrive, so it can keep the more antisocial ones in solitary confinement. Nobody is going to mistake Mission Chinese Food for a rarefied tasting room, though, not when you can get a pepperoni pizza. Mine was too soupy, but the same sourdough starter is the base for two different puffballs of bread, both tossed into the wood-fired oven, both with a natural-yeast flavor that rewards slow, appreciative chewing. One makes a fine platform for smoky pickled chiles and excellent oil-cured anchovies straight from the can, but my favorite way to eat it is to swipe it through a little dish of softened kefir butter in its own buttermilk. On Orchard Street, the throttlingly loud music, the elbows-in-your-ribs seating, the chile-induced sweats and the improbably low prices (nothing cost more than $15 when I gave the restaurant two stars in 2012) conspired to cover the kitchen’s lapses. You registered the bumps, but as on the Cyclone, they were part of the ride. They matter more now that the menu is rich with check-goosing banquet dishes and the restaurant aims for a degree of finesse. There is a wine list now, stocked with semi-obscure natural wines. In the five months the restaurant has been open, servers have memorized a few stock phrases, like “it goes well with our food” (imagine that), but have not learned which part of the corkscrew will remove a metal bottle cap, or when to stop pouring an unfiltered wine to keep sediment from sliding into the glass. I liked taking a hammer to a clay brick to reveal a whole duck confit stuffed with sticky rice and chestnuts, and liked the rich and oily meat I tore from the legs, but I didn’t love the dry breast meat, and I wouldn’t mind taking a hammer to the $100 price tag. I also won’t be handing over another $150 for a smoked prime rib topped with a king crab leg, a garnish that just seemed like bait for the hedge-fund crowd. For far less money, the celery with hazelnuts that was so nicely stir-fried one time was nearly raw the next. I might have loved the just-cooked black kale with pickled plums if not for the overpowering brininess. But these are normal lapses for what has become, against the odds and to almost everybody’s benefit, a nearly normal restaurant.

157,Aquavit,3 star,"May 26, 2015",Pete Wells,Midtown East,Scandinavian,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/dining/restaurant-review-aquavit-in-midtown.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/dining/restaurant-review-aquavit-in-midtown.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Time to cheer for Aquavit and its power to defy the forces of gravity.  Time drags down restaurants in New York. It turns hot spots into castoffs and grand dining rooms into whispery museums. Hakan Swahn opened Aquavit in 1987. Over the last 27 years, it made the reputation of one Marcus Samuelsson and transferred from a light-drenched atrium with a defining waterfall to a more prosaic space in a pink-granite tower in the East 50s.  The move happened a decade ago, but Aquavit still seems to be struggling to find the right tone in its dining room, which still isn’t as comfortable as it could be. Its kitchen is soaring, though. Emma Bengtsson, who took over as executive chef last spring, is cooking modern Scandinavian cuisine as delicious as any I’ve ever had in this restaurant.  In three-course prix fixe menus as well as five- or eight-course tastings, she juxtaposes flavors and textures in ways that are both complex and finely tuned. Even more crucially, her ideas are fresh without aping fashionable Nordic tropes, which would have been the wrong way to bid for relevance. Ms. Bengtsson sprinkles enough sea buckthorn around to show she’s perfectly aware of what’s happening in Copenhagen, but she is in no apparent danger of disappearing inside a cloud of hay smoke. She is her own chef. Almost every dish is denoted by a pair of ingredients, but there is always more to the story. For “scallop and radish,” slices of raw scallops are given extra depth by white soy and fish sauce, and shaved breakfast radishes are tucked around them. Unannounced, but pivotal, is a brightly flavored froth of ramps. This green fluff has been sprinkled with puffed buckwheat kernels, whose slightly earthy crunch completes the picture.  Ms. Bengtsson builds contrasts of color and shape that underscore ones of flavor and texture. She pairs creamy white buttons of delicate asparagus panna cotta with crisp ribbons of raw asparagus. Against both forms of the vegetable she pits salty-sweet gravlax in ravioli-esque pink bundles, sheets of cured salmon draped over chopped mounds of it.  When a fillet of grilled Spanish mackerel shows up, you can see its slashed black-and-silver skin through a glossy apricot-colored sheath of jellied gooseberry. The gel is also tart enough to offset the mackerel’s rich oils, a clever way of adding acidity without a sauce. There’s a hint of sweetness in the candied pistachios and in the lacy umbrellas of fennel flowers, and more tartness in the poached red gooseberries strung along the plate with cauliflower florets — some raw, some pickled and lightly charred.  When Sam Sifton wrote the last Times review of Aquavit, in 2010, Marcus Jernmark was the chef and Ms. Bengtsson was in charge of breads and desserts. (Mr. Jernmark is now cooking at Restaurant Frantzen in Stockholm.) It’s tempting to see a pastry chef’s training at work in Ms. Bengtsson’s dynamic handling of color, her appreciation of things that go crunch, her use of fruit in savory dishes, and her sense of sugar as a seasoning, on full display in the caramelized walnuts and drops of birch syrup with curls of an aged Swedish cheese called havgus.  But it’s foolish to push that argument too hard. I don’t blame her background in the sugary sciences for the one savory dish of hers I could not force myself to like, a pâté of calf’s liver encased in unnervingly sweet cucumber jelly. It looked like an expensive paperweight and tasted, to me, like a Jell-O salad concocted by a deranged ’60s housewife. But I suspect it wouldn’t seem nearly as strange to somebody raised in Sweden, as Ms. Bengtsson was. No matter which menu you get, there are extra treats all along the way, from a traditional potato dumpling in smoked lingonberry broth to intensely flavorful rye crackers. I was so happy spreading soft brown butter on the seed-packed Danish rye that I probably wouldn’t have minded had the meal stopped right there.  The climax of the eight-course menu is a stunning imitation of nature that sets yolks of sea-buckthorn curd inside eggs made of goat cheese parfait; snowflakes of yogurt foam dust a bird’s nest of honeyed tuile strands. Eating the dessert called “chocolate and texture” is like sneaking into a box of leftover chocolate cake and quietly spooning up all the crumbs and frosting before anyone notices.  In short, Ms. Bengtsson’s food is wonderful. I only wish there were a little less stiffness involved in eating it.  Aquavit is, among other things, a showroom for the graceful curves of Scandinavian design, from Erik Bagger’s elegant flatware to Arne Jacobsen’s swooping egg chairs. But one night, as the meal rounded the corner into its third hour, my lower back began to understand that the spindly armchairs were not necessarily conceived with the rigors of 21st-century tasting menus in mind. My dining companion was perched in an uncomfortable yoga pose because her banquette cushions were too far from the table for her to sit back and relax. Lumbar support wouldn’t be a major issue if Aquavit were not so eager to push the longer menus. The choices on the three-course prix fixe are limited, and servers like to say that the eight-course menu provides the fullest expression of the chef’s creativity, or something like that. Whatever the exact words, they were always spoken as if the meaning of life were about to be revealed.  At times the servers had the somber expressions and postures you’d see at a funeral — on the pallbearers, if not the deceased. This becomes unnerving when they stand in a row at the back of the dining room, all dressed in black. Once I could have sworn I heard a captain snap his heels together as he stood at attention, like Colonel Klink. My preliminary diagnosis is Michelinitis, an excessive stiffness caused by a desire to get or keep Michelin stars. Aquavit has two now, and I worry that if it ever gets to three, the servers will have been replaced with wax figures. But life still breaks through often enough. Sarah Blau, the beverage director, is natural and confident, and she sifts through an abundance of fine choices on the wine list. And the lounge, one of the most civilized harbors in Midtown, has a relaxed tone that the dining room could stand more of. I’d almost suggest turning the bar into a tasting-menu counter if it weren’t such a fine place to chase Swedish meatballs with one of the many so-called aquavits that are really house-infused vodkas. Both have been fixtures for years, holding steady in a restaurant that in many ways seems to be getting younger all the time.","Matjes herring and quail egg; gravlax with asparagus; Arctic char with nettles, shrimp and peas; suckling pig with radicchio, apple and mustard; grapefruit and lemon dessert; “chocolate and texture” dessert."
158,Javelina,0.5 star,"May 19, 2015",Pete Wells,Gramercy Park,Tex-Mex,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/dining/restaurant-review-javelina-in-gramercy-park.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/dining/restaurant-review-javelina-in-gramercy-park.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I like Texans. I love their food and their music and their boots. I admire their ability to tame landscapes that are hostile to human life. I respect how quick they are to stick up for their state and its culture. In fact, I may be slightly afraid of Texans. I have no desire to mess with them. I can read the bumper stickers. Reviewing Javelina, which bills itself as “New York’s first authentic Tex-Mex restaurant,” may have presented me with an unusual conflict of interest. My interest in telling the truth about this establishment could come into conflict with my interest in not having my butt kicked by angry Texans. What if something I didn’t like at Javelina turned out to be the very thing that Texans most love about authentic Tex-Mex? It may get in the way of my earnest desire for my next trip to Texas to be a safe and peaceful one. Lucky for me, I have only good things to say about Javelina. Javelina, near Union Square, is a godsend for anybody who loves to eat before 6 p.m. or after 9:30 p.m.; since opening two months ago, the restaurant has been talked up so much in the press that those are usually the only reservation times available, even if you book a week or two ahead. You may worry that at those hours the dining room would be depressingly quiet, but that’s not the case. Javelina’s 58 seats always seem to be taken by large groups of people shouting with youthful animation. It always sounds as if somebody were telling a woman at the far end of the table that he had just found $1,000 under the menu, and the woman were shouting back that Ryan Gosling had just texted and he’s coming to the restaurant in, like, five minutes! How anybody gets drunk enough to act this way is one of several fun Javelina mysteries to keep you entertained. Fresh or frozen, the margaritas have a slight chemical taste that I was thankful for because it tended to keep my own alcohol intake to near-Mormon levels. I also stayed alert and sober when faced with the Tijuana Manhattan, made with tequila in the place of whiskey and served in a rocks glass with no ice at all, even though it was the temperature of a freshly killed snake. While bartenders elsewhere have become insufferable bores on the subjects of ice and proper shaking techniques, the ones at Javelina are refreshingly free of such pretension. Even the water is sometimes served at room temperature.  One night, the bar made me a Paloma in a pint glass, while a woman at my table got her Paloma in a much smaller glass. Everybody knows women drink less than men, so we appreciated the thoughtfulness. To avoid making her self-conscious, I suppose, the restaurant even charged us both the same amount, $13. At most restaurants, you are served what you ask for so routinely that your eyes glaze over with boredom. Javelina does not fall into the trap of dull predictability. One night after I left, I realized the guacamole I’d ordered had never arrived; it’s not every restaurant that gives you something to think about on your way home. Meanwhile, people at the next table were presented with a dish they insisted they hadn’t asked for. “You didn’t order brisket?” the server asked, keeping up the playful spirit.  One of Javelina’s calling cards, queso, is usually suggested by the servers when taking orders. Occasionally this Tex-Mex cheese fondue is served hot, but more often it arrives lukewarm, which prevents trips to the emergency room. The cooler temperature offers the added benefit of allowing a latex-like film to congeal on top, which provides an interesting contrast in texture with the liquefied cheese below.  Queso is short for chile con queso, so named for the hot peppers that are stirred into the melted cheese. Javelina’s traditional yellow queso is supposed to be flavored with serranos, while a white version is said to come with both jalapeños and roasted poblanos. But spicy food can be hard for many people to digest, so I am relieved to report that both colors are quite bland.  A premium queso called the Bob Armstrong does have some flavor: It tastes like ground beef, which in fact it contains, along with guacamole and chopped tomatoes. The menu said that another loaded queso, the Mag Mud, was supplemented with black beans. I didn’t see them, so I probed the cheese with tortilla chips, digging way down to the bottom. Black beans shouldn’t be easy to lose in a bowl of white cheese. Where were they? About five minutes later, a server placed a bowl of beans on the table. “This is supposed to go with the queso,” he said. Mystery solved! The chef is Richard Caruso, and his menu looks unmanageably long, but fortunately only a few items on it are worth getting. Puffy tacos, a San Antonio specialty, come out well, with bits of pork shoulder and other taco toppings piled into a deep-fried corn tortilla, crisp outside and soft in the middle. The steak enchiladas are good, too, with a mouthwatering sour-cream sauce all around them. The cilantro-cream gravy around mahi-mahi is comfortingly thick and rich, and the fajitas are just what you’d expect them to be, with one difference: The flour tortillas are outstanding. Every time I went to Javelina, in fact, those flour tortillas were the best thing on the table. Tender, yielding, pressed in the kitchen and freshly browned on a comal, they are both thicker and lighter than the kind most places use as packing tape to seal up burritos. They are so good that if you happen to accidentally order the tacos filled with pale, cold brisket that tastes more like boiled pork than beef, you can simply tear off chunks of the tortilla and eat them on their own. Corn tortillas are used in the enchiladas de Tejas, and they really made me appreciate how good the other tortillas are, because these are as stiff as a new pair of jeans. They were filled with equally sturdy melted cheese and blanketed with a chile sauce that would make a wonderful way for Mexican cooking teachers to show students what happens when you try to toast dried chiles and end up burning them instead. There is no dessert menu, so every table is supposed to get a plate of sopaipillas, on the house. I got mine once out of three visits, just the right ratio to bring a tremor of anticipation to the end of the meal.  The best news of all, for anybody who hates waiting around to settle the tab: There is no need to ask for the check. It is dropped without warning as soon as the last dirty plate has been cleared, and sometimes even earlier.",San Antonio puffy taco; steak enchiladas; fajitas; pescado cilantro.
159,Mu Ramen,2 star,"May 5, 2015",Pete Wells,Long Island City,"American, Japanese",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/dining/restaurant-review-mu-ramen-in-long-island-city-queens.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/dining/restaurant-review-mu-ramen-in-long-island-city-queens.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Before telling you how impressed I am by the new Mu Ramen in Long Island City, Queens, I want to clear up my role in the demise of the first Mu Ramen. Last March, I wrote an article about New York’s quickly diversifying ramen landscape. One place I discussed was Mu Ramen, which had found a temporary home operating after-hours inside a bagel shop. Almost as an afterthought, I made a list of the 10 ramen bowls I had enjoyed the most during my reporting, putting Mu’s suave and creamy tonkotsu at the top.  The article and the list appeared online on a Tuesday afternoon. On Wednesday morning, Mu Ramen canceled all future appearances, saying it had been deluged with requests for reservations. Immediately, I was blamed in some quarters for killing the pop-up. One person on Twitter, accusing me of stoking a demand that the place could not handle, went so far as to call me a “herb.”  If I knew how to make money, I wouldn’t work for a newspaper. Still, I had a sense that this is not how capitalism works. Last week, Joshua Smookler, Mu Ramen’s chef and its owner, told me “the real reason” he had decamped from the bagel shop. “I was scared of the government finding out what we were doing,” he said, even though he believed it was legal, “and was afraid that would have an effect on our doing a brick-and-mortar.”  He had just signed a lease on the current site, and he and his wife, Heidy He, wanted to concentrate on getting it ready. Others can judge whether that makes me a card-carrying herb. For my part, I’m just happy to report that the new, bagel-free Mu Ramen is a great place to smooth over any hard feelings caused by its nine-month absence.  Of all the restaurants in the city where you are expected to make loud slurping noises while you eat, Mu may be the most civilized. The 22 seats half-fill a space that could easily hold more, and if you have to wait for one of them (after an experiment with reservations, the place is now first come first served, except for the tasting menus that will begin later this month), the deep built-in benches by the front door are a pleasant change from, say, the steps in front of Totto Ramen in Hell’s Kitchen. Six of the seats face a counter. The rest surround three slabs of reclaimed wood. These communal tables touch but don’t quite line up, creating little pockets of semi-intimacy, along with a sense of roominess. Running along the ceiling are thin wood slats bent into waves. They look like noodles swimming out of the kitchen. Before you face down the ramen, the appetizers may call your name; they definitely called mine. One of the best things to eat at Mu comes not from the streets of Tokyo, where Mr. Smookler has never been, but from his apartment, where he and his wife steam mussels when friends come for dinner. At the restaurant, he cooks clams instead, spooning a hypnotically aromatic saffron aioli over them. Then the dish takes a leap that makes no sense until you try it: You pick up a clam and scoop up some Vietnamese nuoc cham with the shell. Why the flowery musk of saffron reacts so well to lime and fish sauce I cannot say. Every clam was a fresh surprise and a fresh mystery. He also makes a tender, airy corn pancake, squirts some foie-gras-fortified maple syrup over it, then covers it with smoked trout. It’s wonderful, especially if you like the sneaky feeling of eating breakfast at night. The only Japanese thing about it, other than the flyingfish roe dotting the trout, is the name. Mr. Smookler calls it an “okonomiyaki” (quotation marks his). For a fuller immersion in Japanese flavors, try the chirashi variant called U&I, named for the uni and ikura that are mounded with spicy raw tuna over sushi rice. U&I is far from groundbreaking, which does not at all detract from its pleasure. But the two times I tried the fried chicken wings stuffed with foie gras and brioche, they did not stop traffic, which they are clearly meant to do. The crust and meat were superb, but the stuffing was dull, and the quince paste that might have brought it into relief was bunched up at one end of the wing.  Mr. Smookler trained in the meticulous rigor of Per Se’s kitchen, and his gift, those wings notwithstanding, is his Keller-like drive to find a better way. This usually means a harder and more costly way. When his supply of pork for tonkotsu broth suddenly dried up last year, he went to the Midwest and persuaded nearly 40 farmers who raise Berkshire hogs to start a cooperative. Then he arranged for a small slaughterhouse to butcher the four cuts of pork he wanted and ship them to Long Island City, where he would cook 120 pounds of bones at a raging boil for most of a day. This is a long way to go for a bowl of soup. (Metaphorically speaking, it is also a long journey for Mr. Smookler, who was born in South Korea and raised in New York as an Orthodox Jew.) If $15 seems a fair price for those ingredients, the conviction only grows once you start eating.  Like all of Mu Ramen’s broths, the tonkotsu has a flavor both deep and long, with extraordinary balance and a rounded profile that has no jarring, gamy edges. Without being greasy, it’s gorgeously full-bodied and almost chewy; as you wind the noodles into your mouth, the droplets that cling to them feel like heavy cream. The flavor is very good, but it’s the texture that can rock you back on your three-legged stool. Mr. Smookler pulls a similar consistency out of boiled beef bones, veal bones and oxtails for the soup he calls Mu Ramen. He drew the inspiration for the stock from the Korean dish seolleongtang. For the toppings, he went to the other side of his upbringing. He corns beef brisket, brines cucumber ribbons and shaves raw cabbage into threads that cook when they hit the bowl. The half-sour pickles are juicy and refreshing, and at the same time they transport you to your favorite delicatessen. More meetings with more farmers produced the chicken skin, feet and giblets that go into the shoyu ramen that just strutted onto the menu. The broth is another full-bodied knockout, and the chicken flavor is pure and intense.  The weightiest, richest possible broth is not necessarily the ramen ideal. Ramen Lab, on Kenmare Street in Manhattan, makes a more traditional shoyu with a chicken broth that is very pure but more restrained than Mr. Smooker’s, so it blends with the soy more willingly. Mr. Smookler’s ramen is so compelling in part because it’s an exception. My praise for it should not be taken as a signal to other chefs to try to make soups as robustly silky as his. Speaking of praise, if I had it all to do over again, would I still tell the world how much I admire Mu Ramen? Do I feel the same way now? Absolutely.",Edamame; U&I; scallion pancake with smoked trout; clams in saffron aioli; all ramen.
160,Minton’s,1 star,"April 28, 2015",Pete Wells,Harlem,"American, Southern",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/dining/restaurant-review-mintons-in-harlem.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/dining/restaurant-review-mintons-in-harlem.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The revolution ran on grits, ham hocks, ribs, black-eyed peas and biscuits. When he opened Minton’s Playhouse in Harlem in 1940, Henry Minton, the first black delegate to the local musicians’ union, knew that jazz players were frequently in need of a meal and a place to give their instruments a workout. He gave them both. Minton’s extended a tricky welcome to its jam sessions: Musicians could eat free soul food and take a solo as long as they could keep up with the house band, anchored by Thelonious Monk and Kenny Clarke. (The house band!) This gang of nonconformists delighted in bizarre chord progressions, obscure keys and melodies that ran upside down.  Their bucking-bronco tactics threw some musicians right off the stage. The ones who stayed put included Dizzy Gillespie, Coleman Hawkins, Don Byas, a Juilliard student named Miles Davis and Charlie Parker, who had a notable ability to put away fried chicken. Writing in Esquire years later, Ralph Ellison described Minton’s Playhouse as “a musical dueling ground,” and quoted a bartender who remembered when “Lester Young and Ben Webster used to tie up in battle like dogs in the road.” The radical sounds that came out of the duels at Minton’s and a few other clubs made a sharp break with the swing of the big-band era and formed a new style that would be called bebop.  When assessing the role that Henry Minton’s soul food played in the birth of bebop, it is worth keeping in mind that most of the testimonials to it come to us from hungry jazz musicians whose meals were on the house. Still, African-American music and cooking were a potent mix at Minton’s once, and this was one reason to pay attention to the revival of Minton’s as a jazz supper club that opened 18 months ago.  Another reason came along in November, when Joseph Johnson, known as J J, took over as chef de cuisine after making a name for himself at Minton’s sister restaurant next door, the Cecil. And a third, highly compelling reason takes the form of Mr. Johnson’s Lowcountry gumbo. At the bottom of the bowl are broken grains of Carolina rice, with its irreplaceable flavor. The meat is smoked chicken and the seafood is wild shrimp, as tender and sweet as you could hope for. Two shrimp lie on top, crisscrossed, and their heads are still on. The base that holds it all together tastes of shellfish and tomato, of course, but a deep, mysterious oceanic note lurks down there. It comes from dried shrimp, and it makes for a haunting bowl of gumbo. Mr. Johnson does some bold, original cooking at Minton’s. There are also dishes, particularly some appetizers, that could use more verve, and others that can go seriously out of tune when the kitchen has an off night. In the face of that unpredictability, the success of dinner at Minton’s depends on how much you like to hear jazz musicians skittering around a tune, toying with a rhythm, tying and untying knots of harmony.  If your ears don’t bend that way, you have no business paying the cover charge at Minton’s. If they do, I don’t know a better place in the city to get them reshaped while you eat. The place is extremely welcoming, and manages an old-fashioned graciousness without strain. A dress code for men urges but doesn’t positively demand jackets; the website boils the advice down to three words: “Dress Sharp Gents.”  No customer outsharps the front of the house, though. Male servers wear black bow ties and vests, while the managerial types favor tailored suits and pocket squares. One of these, spotting a recently drained cocktail glass on our table, stopped short in mock indignation. “This is empty. This is an outrage!” he said, and came back in a minute with a freshly mixed drink. The tables are lined up along walls hung with cocoa-toned curtains and framed photographs of Billie Holiday and other innovators, in black and white. At one end of the room are the stage and the only item from the original Minton’s that wasn’t ruined by water used to put out a fire upstairs decades ago: a 1948 mural of a late-night jam session in a small bedroom lighted by a kerosene lamp. On the brass bed, a woman in a red dress has passed out, face down. If she ever comes to, she may want to fortify herself with a plate of warm biscuits and whipped butter sweetened with sorghum and vanilla. Or, if she’s lucky, the kitchen will send out some hush puppies, with black-eyed peas and pickled okra mashed into the cornmeal. Black-eyed peas are a refrain in the kitchen; lightly fried, they sit alongside the crab cake appetizer, an excellent deviled version, racy with lemon juice and mustard. When she is firmly on the ground again, I’d suggest the smoked pork chop with a lightly candied glaze of pralines and a scoop of bourbon yams. Mr. Johnson works out his menus with Minton’s executive chef, Alexander Smalls. Both men are African-American, as are the restaurant’s principal owner, Richard Parsons, and pastry chef, Mame Sow. Mr. Smalls, a South Carolina native, is a particular exponent of Lowcountry cuisine, which carries lasting imprints of West African and Caribbean cooking. There are direct quotations from South Carolina, like smooth she-crab soup or the crab and shrimp on fat, fluffy grains of grits. And there are riffs on the African theme, including collards cooked so they keep some of their crunch and dressed with a spiced peanut sauce. It’s just a side dish, but I haven’t stopped thinking about it. The less said about the kitchen’s weakest night, the better. I’ll just express my doubts that octopus and unripe strawberries were meant to be joined in ice-cold union, along with my strong feeling that tiny, dense, sweet corn muffins are neither “popovers” nor a good thing to eat alongside smoked trout, and leave it at that.  What matters is that we left the table happy, an unusual outcome after a rocky meal. Ms. Sow’s desserts helped, especially her elegant baked alaska with a foundation of graham cracker cake and a filling of smoked and toasted marshmallow ice cream — s’mores with a Dress Sharp attitude. So did the young musicians working out nuanced, intricate compositions in this sophisticated Harlem room. When you hear Harlem, you picture one of two places: the great hive of African-American ideas and culture that flourished and disappeared, like Atlantis, or the modern neighborhood of wine bars, construction cranes and million-dollar apartments. The two Harlems meet at Minton’s when a serious band is onstage and gumbo is on the table.",Buttermilk biscuits; deviled crab cake; sherry she-crab soup; smoked praline pork chop; Lowcountry gumbo; shrimp and crab on grits; peanut butter collard greens; s’mores baked alaska.
161,Santina,2 star,"April 21, 2015",Pete Wells,Meatpacking District,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/dining/restaurant-review-santina-in-the-meatpacking-district.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/dining/restaurant-review-santina-in-the-meatpacking-district.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The calendar said January when Santina opened early this year. The temperature outside hovered just above freezing. That said January, too.  But almost nothing inside did. Santina’s new glass-box building sits under the High Line like an unwisely located greenhouse, but oranges grew on the branches of a little tree, potted palms sat in the corners, heliconia and other tropical flowers gushed from glazed urns above the bar. Servers wore jelly-bean-colored polo shirts and slim-waisted chinos, like Dean Martin reaching for his 9-iron at Pebble Beach.  People were sharing fritto misto, as crisp and fresh as any in town, and pulling apart multicolored bouquets of crunchy raw vegetables radiating from bowls of chipped ice. They were sipping cocktails through straws stuck into pineapple mugs, as if on a Waikiki honeymoon. Even when the front doors opened, the building is so painstakingly designed by the architect Renzo Piano (with the firm Beyer Blinder Belle) that its vestibule kept the cold winds of the meatpacking district from invading the dining room. Inside Santina, it was summer in January. It’s summer there now, and unless the landlord turns off the heat, it will still be summer when Christmas gets here.  Almost all the food at Santina pulses with the bright, refreshing flavors we crave in hot weather and, it turns out, in other months, too: jolts of chiles, sparks of citrus. Fresh herbs are tossed around frequently and enthusiastically. Chives, mint and basil turn a wonderfully gentle tomato-free minestrone garden-green; Thai basil leaves are flattened over the mint-and-parsley salsa verde applied to a juicy, sweet grilled porgy; tortellini sorrentina (delicate eggy pasta sheets stuffed with soft sheep’s milk ricotta) are surrounded by raw marinara sauce and some olive oil mixed liberally with, what else, fresh herbs. Individually, none of Santina’s tricks are really new, but the kitchen throws them all together in ways that are fun, energizing and mood-altering. Santina comes to us from Mario Carbone, Rich Torrisi and Jeff Zalaznick, busy restaurateurs who somehow find the time to endow each place they open with the thematic complexity of a Paul Thomas Anderson movie. The food, they have said, is coastal Italian, in part because the corner of Washington and Gansevoort Streets where the restaurant sits used to be shoreline.  The three restaurateurs take their concepts further than anybody else in New York, though. They have elaborated the coastal-seafood notion to the point of seeing Santina as a seafood restaurant in an Italian beach town somewhere, maybe along the Italian Riviera during the 1950s or ’60s. This gets them to the palm trees and the servers’ resort-wear costumes. It also inspires a hilarious playlist, mixing sambas and cha-chas (Remember how the same Perez Prado tune pursued Marcello Mastroianni in “La Dolce Vita” wherever he went, even at the seaside village by Fiumicino?) and period Italian pop tunes from singers including Fred Buscaglione, the gangster impersonator who always seemed to get gunned down by a vengeful woman in the last verse.  Mr. Carbone, who leads the kitchen with Dan Haar, the chef de cuisine, has said that the restaurant is named after his Sicilian grandmother. But Liguria plays a bigger role in the kitchen, providing pistou and the chickpea pancake, called a cecina, crisp on top with a soft white underbelly, ready to be spread with crushed, exuberantly seasoned avocados or an excellent salad of tiny shrimp or cold cubes of raw tuna humming with herbs and Calabrian chiles.  The Carbone-Torrisi-Zalaznick team doesn’t let its themes get in the way of a fun idea, though. The bartenders stock plenty of Italian aperitifs for their excellent run of cocktails, but they also let their grass skirts sway to the ukulele strains of tiki drinks in concoctions like the pineapple-and-banana-flavored Manganelli punch. While Italian seafood dominates the main courses, the grilled chicken comes in a sensational robust guajillo sauce that is as Ligurian as Rand Paul.  These are not the kinds of two-ingredient recipes that you would throw together when it’s too hot to cook. It’s fairly complex stuff, and occasionally a heavy hand gets the better of the kitchen and the summer sun turns oppressive. Blue crab meat with spaghetti became mired in an oily glop of tomato sauce, and excess pork fat dragged down a bowl of warm rice salad tossed with guanciale and heaps of black pepper. Sea bass Agrigento, though cooked just right and buoyed by herbs and orange sections, sank under suffocating amounts of red peppers.  Josh Ber’s desserts, on the other hand, almost seem underthought. Filling three cannoli with cream in the Italian-flag colors — green pistachio, white coconut and red maraschino cherry — is a cute idea, but the pastry tubes are limp. So is the tart shell that’s filled with a pond of dark, rich pudding to make a chocolate diplomatico; it’s thin without being crisp. All the desserts are gluten-free, a worthwhile goal, but the substitutions entail more sacrifice than they probably should. The meringue puff topped with lime custard is very good, but it could use company. By the end of the meal, though, if the noise ricocheting off the glass walls hasn’t gotten to you, you’re likely to be in a frame of mind that isn’t much bothered by limp pastry. Most of the food, particularly toward the top of the menu, is charming and playful in a way that’s hard to fight. The rice-salad concept applied to shrimp zingara is a lively, spicy hit. Beyond seafood, Santina has a very winning way with vegetables. Even when it stoops to using seasonal produce, it gives them a warm-weather brightness. Butternut squash discs, lightly scorched to char and soften their edges, get a topping of cracked pink peppercorns, pumpkinseeds and honey agrodolce that almost turns them into candy. Even the kale and sunchoke salad, with pomegranate capsules strewn around like buckshot, tastes cheerful. Santina’s eternal sunshine is a kind of rebuke to dogmatic seasonality. It feels like an answer from Mr. Carbone, Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Zalaznick to the wintry Scandinavian visions that are now in fashion; to the chefs whose bleak, gnarled plates of sunchokes look like scenery left over from one of Ingmar Bergman’s gloomier excursions. If the people at Santina ever meet Death on the beach, they’re ready to kick sand on his blanket and challenge him to a game of volleyball.",Cecina; giardinia crudité; squash carpaccio; radish and salmon; house anchovies; minestrone; shrimp zingara; guajillo chicken; swordfish dogana; eggplant sesame; spicy potatoes; grapefruit Italian ice.
162,Estiatorio Milos,1 star,"April 7, 2015",Pete Wells,Midtown,Greek,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/dining/restaurant-reviews-limani-and-estiatorio-milos-in-midtown.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/dining/restaurant-reviews-limani-and-estiatorio-milos-in-midtown.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"After a long and grueling winter, nothing lifts the spirits in springtime quite like an old-fashioned fish fight.  Limani opened in November around the corner from the Rockefeller Center skating rink. Its menu is Greek, and its strength is formidably expensive seafood, which up until the moment it is laid on the grill can be found spread out on a small mountain of ice at the edge of the open kitchen. The modern dining room subliminally evokes the Aegean and has space for nearly 200 people at tables draped with white cloths.  It all sounds peaceful enough. But four blocks away is Estiatorio Milos, which has operated on West 55th Street since 1997. It serves Greek food with a strong emphasis on formidably expensive seafood, which is displayed on a bed of ice near the open kitchen. The décor is modern and suggests the Aegean, the tablecloths are white, and there are easily enough chairs for 150.  You might write this off to an uncanny coincidence if you didn’t know that this Milos is a branch of one in Montreal and that this Limani is a branch of one in Roslyn, N.Y., whose founding manager worked in the Milos company for 16 years. The first chef in Roslyn was the original chef at Milos in New York. The owners have kept up traditions in Manhattan. Their kitchen is in the hands of M. J. Alam, who used to be the executive chef at Milos. Release the spiny lobsters: We have a fish fight.  By longstanding tradition, a fish fight needs a referee. So, to begin with the most crucial item: As a rule, the array and quality of seafood at both establishments can give a seafood lover a happy case of vertigo. American standards like red snapper, bigeye tuna and black sea bass can be had, but there are far cheaper places to eat the standards. You go to Limani or Milos for creatures that circulate in the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic and generally migrate to New York only when somebody buys them a plane ticket. Among other species, both restaurants recently had the firm-fleshed John Dory, with its false eye staring out from its flank; rascasse, or scorpion fish, mild tasting and a traditional component of bouillabaisse; lavraki, or branzino, long and silvery and delicately sweet; and barbouni, or red mullet, a small fish whose full flavor is out of proportion to its size.  Even more luxurious are the shellfish: firm and exquisitely flavored langoustines; spiny lobsters the size of a leg of lamb, with an intense taste that suggests a wild-game cousin of langoustines; live scallops, presented on the half shell with the slightly chewy, frilly band of mantle; and the heart-stoppingly sweet and supple red shrimp called carabineiros. Both restaurants serve red shrimp with a glass of sherry for the heads, although Milos suggests dunking the heads before sucking out the fat, while Limani advocates pouring the wine into the head and knocking it back, fat and all, like a Jägermeister shot.  In a perfect world, I would eat like this three times a week, with no regrets and no plaque in my arteries. In Midtown, which is still striving for perfection, a life like that would cost buckets of money.  Limani is the cheaper restaurant, both in the menu prices and in the fish, which is sold by weight before cleaning. It charged me $85 a pound for those red shrimp, or about $17.50 each. Milos gave them to me for $95 a pound. Barbouni was $43 a pound at Limani and $61.50 at Milos.  Limani is nobody’s idea of a cheap night out, but the somewhat less fearsome seafood prices are a firm point in its favor. And it was only at Milos that I was served a fish that had stayed slightly too long on the flames, a whole fagri costing just over $80. It was also Milos that let scorched oil from the grill mar the lush taste of a $270 spiny lobster. On the rest of the menu, Limani’s prices are merely expensive, while the ones at Milos read like a long series of typographical errors. The French fries are certainly worth $8, and by Manhattan standards $49 isn’t out of line for three meaty, tender, very good double-cut lamb chops. But why $32 for a Greek salad, even if it had enough juicy, red, almost-summery tomatoes and creamy feta for four? And while the signature appetizer, a stack of fried zucchini and eggplant over a mound of tzatziki, was far lighter and more delicate than Limani’s copycat version, paying $33 sucked the fun out of it. Prices seem to have doubled at least since 1997, when Ruth Reichl gave Milos two stars in its last New York Times review. Today, considering what happened to the fagri and spiny lobster, one star is more appropriate.  But here things get complicated. Limani doesn’t always duplicate its finesse at the grill throughout the kitchen. Gigante beans there were stewed in a tomato sauce that might have passed for canned soup. Desserts, except for a thick slab of yogurt with excellent honey or the fried dough balls rolled in cinnamon and honey syrup, called loukoumades, were not hard to pass up. At lunch, a tuna burger seemed determined to leave no impression at all, and a chicken kebab had me looking out the windows for the nearest halal cart. The afternoon was saved by an ideally cooked dorade royale. If money is not at the top of your pile of worries, or if you’ll move it to the bottom of the pile for red shrimp and John Dory on the grill, then the choice between Limani and Milos may come down to style.  Milos’s décor is a one-of-a-kind blend of exposed structural columns in bare concrete and weathered Greek artifacts, including amphorae big enough to hide a pair of rodeo clowns. The split-level dining room is loud, lively and full of people who act like regulars. Service is practiced, and can be charming. A few years ago, when I was seated between a pillar and a low concrete wall, a server popped up on the other side of the wall and said with a winning smile, “You have my favorite table!” Limani, which in nearly every other respect swims in Milos’s wake, darts off on its own in the interior-design department. The floor of the dining room is done in blinding white marble, and the leather seats are a softer white. In the center is an infinity pool that keeps changing from blue to violet, the colors glinting off the small metal fish on a mobile that hangs in a double helix from the ceiling overhead. Some people will look at it and see a Greek fishing town taken over by millionaires. I saw South Beach.  By now, though, readers who give any thought to their dinner budgets have no doubt decided to run screaming from Midtown and head straight for Astoria, Queens. For starters, let me suggest Astoria Seafood, which is like Limani or Milos but with no luxuries, fewer kinds of fish and check totals that don’t rival the round-trip fare to Athens.

163,Little Park,2 star,"March 24, 2015",Pete Wells,TriBeCa,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/dining/restaurant-review-little-park-in-tribeca.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/dining/restaurant-review-little-park-in-tribeca.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"It is as colorful and otherworldly as a coral reef, this row of fried cauliflower knobs in purple, ivory and marigold yellow. Wrapping each floret is a pale-gold skin of batter. It’s almost invisible, but you feel it as you bite, its soft snap reinforced by the full-on crunch of chopped almonds. Poached before it is fried, the cauliflower is nicely salted all the way down to its tender core, but it is still cauliflower, so it needs a little support. This is supplied by a lush green tomatillo, pistachio and fresh herb sauce that gets in a quick, peppery jab before it signs off. Where does this dish come from? In the proximate sense, it is from Andrew Carmellini’s latest restaurant, Little Park, inside the Smyth hotel in TriBeCa. The ultimate inspiration, though — where is that from? The batter is related to tempura, and I think I might have caught the rustle of Mexico in the sauce. Beyond that, it is hard to say. The fried cauliflower seems to be one of those dishes that happen when a chef’s imagination is allowed to roam. Mr. Carmellini once dreamed of owning an Italian, a French and an American restaurant. In less than four years, starting with Locanda Verde in 2009, he and his partners built all three. Then, after the Dutch and Lafayette, he knocked out a fourth, a drop-in pasta place called Bar Primi that seemed to come together in less time than it takes the rest of us to watch a cat video on Facebook.  Since becoming his own boss, in other words, Mr. Carmellini has cooked in and around the traditions of one country or another. At Little Park, he and his chef de cuisine, Min Kong, the executive sous chef at Carbone until last year, are working out their ideas from scratch. This may be why the best dishes there seem more fresh, natural and intuitive than what’s on his other menus and why Little Park has less in common with Locanda Verde than it does with forward-leaning places like Estela or even the modern-Mexican Cosme. It is Mr. Carmellini’s most contemporary restaurant. In a sense, it’s his first. In the modern fashion, most dishes are of roughly the same size and complexity. There are no second-class ingredients and almost no side dishes. The vegetables are as intriguing as the animals on plates, like steamed black bass with bracingly vinegared lentils or the intensely beefy hanger steak under broccoli whose thin stems had been judiciously charred.  Beets are, insistently, the point of the earthy and velvety risotto made from them, although crème fraîche and goat cheese do put extra wiggle in its walk. Flowers and shaved bull’s-eyes of Chioggia beets on top keep the shockingly red plate from looking like a crime scene. It’s a lucky carrot that ends up in Ms. Kong’s kitchen; rarely is the vegetable lavished with so much attention. Some are roasted to a smoky sweetness, some are juiced and whipped into an airy orange custard, and still more are slivered into ribbons. All are flattered by the molasses notes in sticky black garlic and by a patch of cocoa nibs and toasted crumbs. At lunch, Mr. Carmellini and Ms. Kong send a stunning little sandwich down the runway, a celery root schnitzel with creamy, incisive mustard and apple-brussels sprout slaw on a sesame-seed bun. The celery root is not the most flavorful I’ve had, but it is soft in all the right ways, augmented by generous bookends of golden breading. I ate one and wanted another. Another small marvel: the first worthwhile spaghetti squash I’ve ever met. It was baked with garlic and a stealthy dose of lobster butter and upstaged the protein it was meant to support, half of a tiny lobster tail that wasn’t warm enough to melt the herb butter slapped on top.  There was other evidence of inattentiveness, like the oily mop of oversauced whole-wheat spaghetti with cabbage and red wattle pork. (The menu calls the poor hog “red waddle.” No doubt it was a large animal, but why add insult to injury?) Little Park’s servers also push the popular contemporary con that small plates are meant for sharing. As one of my dinner guests remarked, “That’s like saying: ‘This is a studio apartment. It’s perfect for a family.’ ” I know I wanted more than one of the frilly kale-filled ravioli sitting on a sauce of sweet roasted winter squash.  In most other ways, though, servers are poised and helpful. They are quick to demystify the peculiar cocktails, like the gin sour dusted with beet powder, and the even more peculiar wine list. Josh Nadel, the beverage director for Mr. Carmellini’s restaurant group, has divided bottles by topography (“river valleys,” “lakes and slopes,” “mountains and terraces”). This is an illuminating way to learn about viticulture, but it’s a confusing way to find a red that goes with duck. Additional subdivisions into light-, medium- and full-bodied are easier to grasp. A bit of explanation may also be required with some of Jennifer Luk’s desserts. What is frozen lemon fluff? It’s a delicious white block of dense citrus meringue around which orange sections and candied ginger can happily revolve. How about cinnamon toast ice cream? It’s something like crushed Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal sprinkled over ice cream that tastes like sweet bread, and it’s as charming as it sounds. As for the “winter sundae” of apple and beer, it’s slightly more charming than it sounds, but maybe not quite enough more.  When you think of Mr. Carmellini’s restaurants, quiet and civility are not the first qualities that come to mind. Little Park has them. Desert-toned fabrics seem to soak up excess noise in a dining room designed by Gachot Studios that walks the line between midcentury chic and expense-account bland. Anyone who has faced down the unwelcoming committee at the door of Locanda Verde, or showed up on time at Lafayette only to be sent to the bar, or waited on the Bowery to get into Bar Primi, will appreciate the more hospitable greeting at Little Park.

164,Eleven Madison Park,4 star,"March 17, 2015",Pete Wells,Midtown South,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/dining/restaurant-review-eleven-madison-park-in-midtown-south.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/dining/restaurant-review-eleven-madison-park-in-midtown-south.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Can a restaurant still succeed when it fails at what it says it wants to do?  This is not a question critics ask every day. But then the place in question, Eleven Madison Park, is not a restaurant where most of us would or could eat every day.  This, in fact, is one of the sticky issues raised by the drastic changes its two driving spirits, Daniel Humm and Will Guidara, have made since its last review in The New York Times, in 2009. Back then, when Frank Bruni promoted it to four stars from three, most customers still selected three courses from Mr. Humm’s menu at a cost of $88. Today, lunch or dinner is $225 for more than a dozen courses. All but two are typically chosen by the kitchen. A few days in advance of a recent reservation, the head maître d’hotel, Justin Roller, sent an email warning, “Our tasting menu lasts approximately three and a half hours, so please plan your day accordingly.” The last time I got a message like that, it was from my doctor, shortly before my colonoscopy. Meals at Eleven Madison now cost more, take longer and offer less variety from one week to the next. As might have been predicted, this took the restaurant out of regular rotation for many locals. Perhaps to make up for the loss of actual New Yorkers in the dining room, Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara turned the restaurant into a theme park about the city. In its very early days in 2012, the result was the most ridiculous meal I’ve ever had.  Nearly every course began with a clunky, humorless history lesson about steakhouses, appetizing stores, clambakes, cheesecakes and even Times Square scam artists. The patter overshadowed and undermined the food. Notably, it had no voice, in a city full of them. “Three-card monte is now illegal, but along the same lines, we had a deck of cards made for us,” my server recited, before doing a magic trick. I never figured out how it was done, but the greater mystery was just why a restaurant charging hundreds of dollars for such kitsch would want to lecture diners about “hustlers and scammers.”  Some of this gab has been dropped, but not all. Even now, when any ingredient is grown in New York State, someone is sure to point it out. Hang on, New York has farms? And chefs can cook their stuff just like the ingredients I get at the supermarket? Wait, I need to write this down. Constantly mentioning the region only underlines the shallowness of Eleven Madison Park’s approach to it. (A server announced that the oysters grew “upstate” in Greenport, N.Y., which will be news to Long Islanders.) Mr. Humm doesn’t dig down into the natural and cultivated landscape of his region the way, say, Christopher Kostow, Sean Brock and Dan Barber do. He practices entry-level locavorism. Objections like this buzzed before my eyes so insistently that at times they blinded me to what was going on in the soaring Art Deco space across from Madison Square Park. Which was: a roomful of people almost goofy with happiness. The woman dining alone with her camera shyly accepting an invitation into the vast and gleaming kitchen for a special course prepared a few inches in front of her; the couple watching, as if seeing their first sunrise, a sommelier who removed a cork by melting the bottle’s neck with red-hot tongs; the guests at my table going limp as they tasted a crazily good braised pork collar and cheek in a dark sauce that was like pig marmalade; and finally even me, the overthinking picker of nits and finder of faults. Under the restaurant’s relentless, skillful campaign to spread joy, I gave in.  What Eleven Madison feeds your intellect can have the value of junk food, but what it feeds your mouth, stomach and spirit is something else. The restaurant tries as hard as any I know to bring delight to the table with every course. It succeeds so often that only the most determinedly grumpy souls could resist. Even the spoken intros have a role. They serve to tee up the surprises that emerge from the kitchen, which reliably turn skeptics into swooners, especially as Mr. Humm has axed some of his sillier gimmicks. (Back to Times Square with you, three-card monte.) More crucially to this restaurant’s intent, the patter opens a window between customers and staff. The dopey speeches work like pickup lines; you may smirk, but at least you respond, and once you’ve done that, a conversation can start.  Mr. Guidara, a front-of-house man who rose to become Mr. Humm’s business partner in the restaurant when it broke off from the Union Square Hospitality Group, is a creative partner, too, working to establish a loose, entertaining tone in the dining room that sets Eleven Madison Park apart from its competitors. The servers are deeply attentive to details. As a manager told New York magazine, “It takes 10 months to learn how to pour water.”  The remote formality that typically comes with punctilious service has been banished. Servers want to make you an active collaborator in the fun. As Bacall said to Bogart, it’s even better when you help. At the center of the collaboration is, of course, Mr. Humm’s cooking. He is, at heart, a neo-classicist, a master of pruning the old-fashioned curlicues from the traditional haute cuisine of his training to make the pleasures more modern and direct. This isn’t always clear when he is trying to keep up with path-blazing chefs like Grant Achatz and René Redzepi. But it’s the force that drives his best innovations, like globes of celery root braised in a pig’s bladder, inspired by the classic French dish poulet en vessie.  The white globes will be bathed in a truffled chicken reduction and set beside a circle of celery root purée that has been spooned over, guess what, more truffles. And Mr. Humm, always alert to opportunities for spectacle, knows that beyond forming an airtight vessel for steam, an inflated pig’s bladder shimmying around a copper sauté pan makes a great conversation piece in the dining room. Recently, the cheese course packed into a picnic basket was retired. A fondue has taken its place, and it is both homey and spectacular. The serving bowl is a baked carnival squash and the utensil a hot, soft pretzel stick from the protean pastry kitchen. There is no homily about the glories of the street-corner pretzel cart. You are left alone to revel in the melted cheese, to mash the pretzel against cubes of sweet squash, and to imagine anything you like. I decided to imagine that the fondue came straight out of Mr. Humm’s upbringing in Switzerland, because it worked on my senses with the deep, soulful pull of a childhood memory. There are no printed menus at the start of the meal, just a conversation led by the table’s captain. Once allergies and aversions are out of the way, two choices remain. One concerns the main course; the other is about foie gras. Mr. Humm is a virtuosic handler of fattened duck liver, so either the hot or cold version is likely to produce altered states of consciousness. He brings out foie gras’s sweet and silky traits by layering it with braised red cabbage and serving it in a chilled wedge that looks like a slice of marbled Bundt cake; its meatier and robust qualities come through in a seared slice under fried brussels sprout leaves and smoked eel.  Many people will choose no foie gras at all. I don’t know what you can give a meat-avoider to make her feel she’s not missing out as her dinner partner goes bug-eyed over foie gras, but the watermelon and goat cheese salad served to a guest of mine last fall was definitely not it. So much attention goes into the showstoppers that substitutions do not always measure up. By now, a more glamorous alternative may be in the wings. Many things are in the wings at this restaurant, which is defined above all by its fluid movement into the future. The New York theme may wind down, though I hope the manhattan cart stays, stocked with mixers for the classic cocktail and its five variants to be stirred up at your elbow. Whatever new theme rolls to the table after that may be only partly baked, like the initial New York menu, but Eleven Madison Park’s true theme will stay the same: convincing you that you’ve been lifted to some better world until the man in the top hat outside whistles for your cab.",Tasting menu only.
165,Bowery Meat Company,2 star,"March 10, 2015",Pete Wells,East Village,"American, Steak Houses",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/11/dining/restaurant-review-bowery-meat-company-in-the-east-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/11/dining/restaurant-review-bowery-meat-company-in-the-east-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I’m starting to worry about the steakhouse. It used to be a rock of stability. The shifting winds of fashion did not bend it. Its basic formula was so firmly set that you could go to a steakhouse in San Bernardino and then one in Baltimore and have the same meal without looking at the menu.  Now steakhouses are swerving all over the road. Their menus read like competitions to see who can stray furthest from plain beef and potatoes. The more desperate they grow in their attempts to prove they’re not like the staid steakhouses of yore, the more they seem to converge.  Take two examples that opened last year: Knife, in Dallas, and Bowery Meat Company, in Manhattan. Knife has duck risotto on the menu; Bowery Meat Company has duck lasagna for two. Knife has a whole roasted chicken; Bowery Meat Company has half a roasted chicken. Knife has half a roasted pig’s head with Mexican salsas and tortillas; Bowery Meat Company has pork belly Chinese-barbecue style. After a while, reading these menus is like seeing your dad twerk.  But the hey-we’re-cool-no-really menus aren’t as troubling as the way these places insist that they don’t want to be called steakhouses anymore. Knife, according to its website, is “a reinvention of the steakhouse experience.” And here on First Street just off the Bowery, the chef Josh Capon and the restaurateur John McDonald, the team behind Lure Fishbar and El Toro Blanco, have brought forth a “meat company” whose website says it is “not a traditional steakhouse, but a balanced meat-centric menu.”  Just between us, Bowery Meat Company is not, in fact, a menu, balanced or otherwise. But it does have a menu, and on it you will find seven cuts of beef and a burger, potatoes cooked at least four ways and a spinach side dish. Mr. Capon appears at certain tables presenting masses of raw beef draped on a cutting board. And while the wine list has admirable and enticing range, its foundation is a cache of broad-beamed cabernets that are obviously meant to be married off to bricks of dry-aged beef.  Is it possible that Bowery Meat Company doesn’t know it’s a steakhouse, the way Bruce Willis in “The Sixth Sense” doesn’t know he’s a ghost? The dining room, by Meyer Davis Studio, could go either way. The right angles, the horizontal grain of the glossy paneling, the broad stretches of simple geometric curtains and the collection of midcentury chairs by Eames and other designers call up the heyday of Palm Springs and gibsons and Pall Malls and, yes, steak, along with other meats.  In this retro room, prime beef makes as much sense as Mr. Capon’s swell nods to old-school Italian-American classics, like shrimp scampi, woozy with garlic and butter, or broiled oysters under slightly scorched bread crumbs, New Orleans style. His zucchini carpaccio dotted with creamed feta, chopped pistachios and fresh mint is very good now; it will be excellent when squash is in season. He also makes a terrine of chicken livers and foie gras, smooth in all the right ways and served with onion jam and toasted brioche. This is true luxury, not the mock luxury of a garden-variety deviled egg trying to pass itself off as a $25 appetizer by dressing up in caviar.  Mr. Capon is not given to rash experiments. He knows where the pleasure centers are and how to tickle them. (So does his pastry chef, Katie McAllister. Her desserts are unabashedly sweet, sometimes to the point where you lose interest, although the s’mores sundae is uncannily precise, down to the ice cream that tastes exactly like a campfire marshmallow.) So his duck lasagna is not some bold invention but a gooey casserole in which the duck ragù is essentially a seasoning and the bulk of the work is done by loads of melted caciocavallo. It is meant to serve two but could probably bring four people to a dead stop.  And there is more. Much more. In the end, I barely put a dent in the menu, though it left its mark on me.  Connoisseurs of ultratender burgers will go wild for Mr. Capon’s hefty but loosely packed version on an extremely yielding bun. I like a burger that puts up more of a fight, but I loved the flavors of the melted raclette and caramelized onions. The most imposing of the meats is the veal chop, thick and quartz-pink. It’s rubbed with paprika, coriander and fennel seeds for a whiff of the souk, but what gives it energy is the juice of a grilled orange half. That citrus-spice alchemy is a terrific solution to the boredom sometimes caused by plain broiled lumps of animal muscle.  Another solution may be a smaller chop costing less than $52, but Bowery Meat Company understands that one of the jobs of any steakhouse, traditional or not, is to help carnivores spend lavishly. There is, as you’d expect, a proprietary cut of meat from the celebrity butcher Pat LaFrieda, the $54 “Bowery steak.” (Imagine the things “Bowery steak” might have been a euphemism for 20 years ago.) A mosaic of trimmed rib-eye cap, it’s intensely flavorful, but I wish Mr. Capon would leave the garlic-heavy raw chopped herb sauce on the side. The 14-ounce New York strip is $55, is served naked except for some roasted shallots and has a fine dry-aged tang. It was missing only a rough, satisfying crust of the kind the kitchen put on the côte de boeuf, a 38-ounce marvel of careful dry-aging and extensive marbling that costs $138.  Demand for expensive beef rises with bull markets in stocks, and the current one just charged into its sixth year. The natural outcome of this is more steakhouses, but lately there have been complicating factors. Women don’t take to the traditional steakhouse the way men have. Many people have ethical and environmental concerns about beef production. The most recent challenge is the rise of the small-plates culture, which has made portions of meat larger than, say, half a pound look a bit unseemly.  This is why (he said, adopting a Viennese accent) the steakhouse has been acting so peculiar lately: It is trying to unite what’s left of its core audience with the new herd of refugees from the small-plates revolution. Maybe Bowery Meat Company and places like it should just forget about defining themselves in relation to the steakhouse. Instead, they could come up with a new name for a place where you eat an appetizer followed by six or more ounces of meat, poultry or seafood. There used to be a word for this: restaurant.",Broiled oysters; foie gras and chicken liver parfait; zucchini carpaccio; bitter greens salad; duck lasagna; lamb chops; veal chop; cheeseburger; côte de boeuf; sour cream and onion hash browns; s’mores sundae.
166,Via Carota,2 star,"March 3, 2015",Pete Wells,West Village,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/dining/restaurant-review-via-carota-in-the-west-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/dining/restaurant-review-via-carota-in-the-west-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Hanging from Via Carota’s ceiling, menacing a large farmhouse table that had been surrounded by smiling customers just a few minutes earlier, was a row of long iron spikes, bent into hooks at their ends. They’d been retrofitted with light bulbs to make a functional if terrifying chandelier, but what was their original purpose? Several possibilities suggested themselves, from medieval torture device to a particularly inhumane way of catching fish. “You’ll have to ask Jody,” a server said after admitting that she didn’t really know what the thing was either. “Every day, she brings in something else that she’s just found. She’ll say, ‘Don’t think about it, but that olive bowl is 200 years old.’ ” Jody is the chef Jody Williams. She shares responsibility for Via Carota’s Italian menu with the chef Rita Sodi, her partner in both business and domestic matters. When it comes, however, to buying antique nail barrels, china hutches, silver teapots, seltzer siphons, porcelain creamers, glazed cheese crocks, woven wood baskets, woven metal baskets and other stuff to fill a restaurant, Ms. Williams does it all by herself. Her eye for dressing a room is well known by the many people who swear by Ms. Williams’s other restaurant, Buvette, a hop and a skip to the west on Grove Street. Buvette is filled with antiques and flea-market triumphs, starting with the black Raleigh bicycle left unchained on the sidewalk, as if the owner had just popped in for a croque-monsieur on the way to buy an armful of leeks. Buvette is French, and its premise seems to be that everything about France and the French is deeply adorable. The tables, the plates, even the silverware are about two sizes smaller than normal. Many people, some of whom live in Paris, where a second Buvette is a big hit, find all this irresistible. But it always makes me feel as if I’m on the set of a Wes Anderson film wearing a large trash bag while everybody else is dressed in vintage Boy Scout uniforms. Fortunately, while Via Carota has been energetically propped, it avoids the preciousness of Buvette. There is an ambient cuteness level, to be sure, but it is balanced by an Italian severity; the spiky iron chandelier (made by the sculptor Warren Muller from a clam rake) hanging over the charming cocktail coupes. The beechwood chairs with built-in pockets for books, for instance, came from a chapel in Wales. They make you sit up straight. Best of all, Ms. Williams and Ms. Sodi are cooking deeply appealing food, without mugging.  Ms. Sodi is a stickler about classic Italian pasta, which forms the foundation of her own small restaurant nearby, I Sodi. You can tell she is a stickler because her pastas taste the way they are supposed to taste, the sauces not too complicated or heavily applied, the noodles not too tight and not too flabby.  I might have liked a little more wildness in the wild-boar ragù over pappardelle, but I could not have asked for a more rounded, balanced, mellow ragù or more supple noodles. And while pasta with black truffles may not sound modest, there was nothing ostentatious about the irregular patches of pasta called stracci (it means “rags”) turned with melted butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano and truffle shavings; it seemed, in fact, like the only sensible thing to do with a truffle. Apart from calling it a svizzerina and topping it with rosemary and whole garlic cloves, they make no attempt to prettify the chopped New York strip steak. Molded into a puck and seared on cast iron, it is both simple and amazing. Those of us who believe that the best burgers are chopped with knives, as this one is, will especially love the way the svizzerina feels in the mouth, substantial and even slightly luxurious, a quality that steak loses the minute it goes through a meat grinder.  Like most of the meat and fish dishes, the bunless, French-fry-less svizzerina stands more or less alone, Italian style. Under the very simple and very good rabbit, patiently pan-fried, you will get a slice of fried bread to take care of any oil. If you like the taste of rabbit, this is the dish for you. A stub of grilled octopus leg gets a mound of green-olive relish. If all this pasta and protein sends you looking for vegetables, you will find yourself in one of Via Carota’s strongholds. There are vegetables of all shapes and sizes, and with them the chefs give up a bit of their severity and start to play. Twiglike salsify roots were caramelized in brown butter, almost candied, and wonderful. A fennel bulb, cooked until tender, was dressed in orange pulp and orange zest. Shafts of leeks, poached and served cool, were topped with shavings of cured mullet roe and grated hard-cooked eggs; suddenly, I did not want to see leeks served any other way. Only with the grilled radicchio did they go over the top, piling on sweetness with currants and balsamic vinegar, then enriching everything with soft caprino cheese. But that kind of excess is just what Via Carota typically and gracefully avoids. Creamy stracchino cheese may seem too rich to stand in for fresh mozzarella on crostini with cherry tomatoes, especially tomatoes that have been sun-dried to a raisin-like sweetness. As things turn out, it’s phenomenal. So is the mash of walnuts, honey and lardo that the chefs spread on another crostino, one that would be just as good at breakfast or dessert, or with cheese or yogurt. It would probably be good sold from a vending machine at the Port Authority. But then you would miss the short and no-nonsense list of drinks made from as few ingredients as possible (Italian-style, again). Or the much longer but still no-nonsense wine list, which covers a lot of ground without letting the prices get too out of hand. (Do keep an eye on the bottom line, though. It’s surprisingly easy to reach $100 a person if you decide to taste something from each category on the menu.) Or the very tender crostata with a thin, sticky layer of raspberry jam.  Most of all, you’d miss the chance to see the West Village take to this restaurant as if it had been around as long as one of Ms. Williams’s olive bowls.",Vegetables; all pasta; fried rabbit; fricassee of sweetbreads and artichokes; grilled octopus; chopped steak; raspberry crostata.
167,Shuko,3 star,"Feb. 17, 2015",Pete Wells,Greenwich Village,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/dining/restaurant-review-shuko-in-the-east-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/dining/restaurant-review-shuko-in-the-east-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"“You like spicy?” Jimmy Lau asked from behind the counter at Shuko, the new restaurant just below Union Square where he and his partner, Nick Kim, prepare an elevated and memorable species of Japanese food. Before I could answer, he handed me a spicy tuna roll that would casually knock over my ideas about spicy tuna rolls, and spice, and tuna. Pickled red Thai chiles sat on top of the roll, chopped to bits and ready for action. The tuna underneath was soft sinew cut from the belly of a bluefin. It was grilled until the fat ran, until it soaked through the rice in its crisp nori wrapper and dripped out the bottom of the roll and into my palm. “Actually, it’s not too spicy,” Mr. Lau said. Ten seconds later, Mr. Kim leaned over and said almost the same thing: “Actually, it’s not that spicy.” Actually, gentlemen, it was really pretty spicy. In run-of-the-mill sushi bars, the spicy tuna roll is a cheap firecracker of questionable provenance. Nobody who has had Shuko’s version, though, is going to forget it. The heat comes in gusts that keep getting stronger until you can’t do anything but hold on. The chiles scour your tongue, cauterizing it. The melting oils from the tuna belly blanket your entire mouth, trying to restore the peace. The two sides, almost evenly matched, fight for control, and you are the battlefield. Mr. Lau and Mr. Kim were last seen sharpening their knives at Neta, a few blocks away. It was their first perch after leaving the truffled nest of Masa Takayama, who put Mr. Lau in charge of the kitchens at Bar Masa in New York and Las Vegas and made Mr. Kim head chef of Masa itself. Neta, though excellent, had a well-defined comfort zone right from the start. Compared with Shuko it looks like a restaurant on training wheels. Meanwhile, Mr. Takayama’s operations, particularly now that the overpriced and underperforming Kappo Masa has been added to the fold, have begun to look like assembly lines where golden hooks are baited with two- and three-figure delicacies to dangle before whales. (Would you like the truffle maki roll topped with caviar or the caviar roll topped with truffles?) Those and other guaranteed bell-ringers do put in appearances at Shuko. Fat-streaked tuna belly, prone on a bed of rice, was one in a long volley of sushi pieces chosen by the chefs, at a cost of $135. Toro appeared again in the $175 kaiseki meal, a string of mesmerizing little plates followed by a shorter sushi recital. This time it took the shape of a homage to Mr. Takayama, a pure and tightly chilled tartare under a green-gray hump of Osetra caviar. During the five minutes or so it took to smear this on toasted milk bread and eat it, no force on earth could have stopped me short of hot lava flowing under the front door, and even then I would have made a guess at its speed before deciding to get up from the counter. What’s impressive about Shuko, though, is how many times the chefs ring the bells without resorting to clichéd indulgences. One of the most memorable pieces of nigiri in my sushi omakase was an intense, livery, chewy bite of squab cartilage with sansho pepper. Another was a slab of Mediterranean dorade so rich and fatty it reminded me of shrimp. Another was simply a grilled shiitake cap folded around a pinch of warm rice. On the kaiseki menu another night, finely shredded Japanese mountain yam, burdock and carrot had been flattened with slivers of scallop beard to make a crisp, airy, hand-held latke. Toward the middle of both meals, a chef began to lay down pickle slices, silently, one after another, like a blackjack dealer. Shuko had piled these carrots, radishes and so forth into wood barrels to ferment when they were still in season, not just to save their flavor but to expand it. New York State produce preserved by traditional Japanese methods makes a fine emblem for Shuko’s blending of cultures. Another may be the facade on East 12th Street, where the windowless wall is finished with sand and particles of hay, and the door is marked only by a handful of dried flowers tied with a string. It could be an ancient house in Tokyo, if not for the classic New York cast-iron column running right down the middle. Open the door and you enter what could be downtown’s latest version of cocktail hide-outs like Angel’s Share or Milk & Honey. And in fact, once you sit down at the long and carefully buffed ash bar, a bartender in a beard and necktie will offer to stir up a drink for you. This is an offer worth accepting. Another server, in ripped bluejeans, pours house-made sparkling water. The music is very slightly louder than in most sushi bars and spans the decades from Debbie Harry to Sky Ferreira. Ice Cube is having a good day, but Lorde is over getting told to throw her hands up in the air. Some purists may feel that all this desecrates the temple of sushi. They can go eat in a temple. Mr. Lau and Mr. Kim, both young and fluent in several cultures at once, have taken all the preciousness out of omakase and kaiseki dining and replaced it with a relaxed, sophisticated cool. They were already moving in this direction at Neta, but with Shuko they’ve arrived. Everybody seems to feel comfortable here. (Some feel a little too comfortable; one night, a couple who seemed to have been married for several centuries carried on a long and inscrutable argument, while a young tycoon at the opposite end of the bar rattled off his company’s revenue figures for the last five years.) Both menus offer an in-depth look at how good these two chefs are at bringing out flavors without appearing to be doing much to them. My sushi omakase, but not my kaiseki meals, included a flight of sea urchin, starting with pale, creamy blobs from Santa Barbara, Calif., then moving to Monterey, where the lobes were more compact and had a cleaner sweetness, and ending with uni topped with a lacy swirl of shirako tempura, the hot and buttery seminal fluid of a cod. The kaiseki doesn’t delve as intimately into marine biology, but in recompense it offers a slightly wider variety of surprises. One of them is an ending too good to give away, a dessert that is so unluxurious and un-Japanese and wonderful that the chefs seem to be smiling to themselves every time it’s served.",Tasting menus only; no choices.
168,Cosme,3 star,"Feb. 3, 2015",Pete Wells,Flatiron,Modernist,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/dining/restaurant-review-cosme-in-the-flatiron-district.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/dining/restaurant-review-cosme-in-the-flatiron-district.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"A woman I once worked with had a facility for languages that was matched by her self-assurance. The rest of us had a hard time keeping track of her various proficiencies, and one time we asked her to remind us whether she knew Chinese. “Oh, I would love to learn Chinese,” she said. “But I just don’t have eight weeks to spare.” Too bad she isn’t a chef. Very few have eight weeks to spare these days, but that doesn’t stop them when, in pursuit of empire building, they decide to learn some other nation’s food. By the time the news releases are ready, a week’s vacation has become a research trip, and a snack bought with pocket change has become a $13 appetizer. Mexico is a favorite destination for these immersion courses. This has led to the illusion that New York is enjoying a boom in serious Mexican cuisine, when in fact what the city is experiencing is a handful of restaurants that present, some more convincingly than others, a chef’s south-of-the-border fantasies. Before he opened Cosme on East 21st Street in October, the chef Enrique Olvera reversed the process. He already had a pretty good handle on the cuisine of Mexico, having grown up and now owning a flock of restaurants there, including the globally acclaimed Pujol. Mr. Olvera’s research trips were to Manhattan instead. He studied its dining rooms, its menus, its cocktails and its customers. He was clearly taking notes, because he shows an uncannily state-of-the-art instinct for what New Yorkers want when they go out for dinner. Cosme is cool, but isn’t trend-chasing. It’s crowded and lively, but isn’t painfully loud. It’s comfortable, but isn’t coddling. Most of all, the cooking is a thrill, largely because it sails right over ideas like tradition, authenticity and modernity. Many underpinnings come from Mexico, while a lot of the ingredients were bought locally. The flavors are here and now, though; you connect with the dishes right away. In the style of places like Estela, many seafood and vegetable dishes turn out to be salads, or something like a salad, approachable, simple-seeming assemblages with a jolt of the unexpected. White ayocote beans, which look like cannellinis and are as creamy as any bean I’ve tasted, are surrounded by mixed greens and sliced radishes, all looking innocent enough; it’s the habaneros and charred cucumbers in the dressing that get you. The raw hamachi dabbed with lime and jalapeño sounds like another crudo variation, but the jalapeños are fermented and the limes dried until they turn black; together their flavor is so intense it could walk through bricks. Scallops and poached jicama, cut into white discs that you can’t tell apart until you bite down, are dressed with lime juice and cucumber; it seems like a traditional aguachile, but the sneaky, sideways heat comes from grated wasabi. Mr. Olvera doesn’t use heat and spice as weapons; he uses them like a pen, to sharpen and define the outlines of a dish. Dried ground chiles provide some backbone to a sweet pineapple purée served with firm, flavorful cobia and warm tortillas, for making an exhilarating seafood version of tacos al pastor. Whenever a stack of fresh tortillas arrived, I would pull one from its folded napkin, hold it up to my face and inhale. It was a motion I hadn’t made since grade school, when I would bring the purple-smudged handouts still warm from the Ditto copier up to my nose to breathe in their sweet, forbidden, chemical smell, like rubbing alcohol mixed with danger. The aroma of these tortillas was completely wholesome — like flowers, bread straight from the oven, and a baby’s cheek at the same time — but I still wanted to fall headfirst into it the way I did with Ditto solvent. There are no tortillas remotely like this in New York. Cosme makes them downstairs in the kitchen from old strains of blue, yellow, purple and white corn grown in Mexico. The tortillas are one of the few reminders around if you forget for a moment that Cosme is a Mexican restaurant. Many of the kitchen’s innovations probably shouldn’t be copied, because they depend on Mr. Olvera’s deep knowledge of Mexican food together with his understanding of what’s being cooked in Copenhagen, Chicago and Lima. But one idea that I hope other Mexican restaurateurs steal is the decision to go without all the props (sombreros, grinning calaveras) that say, “Hola, amigos, have a margarita!” The furthest Cosme goes in that direction are the small potted succulents on every table. Yana Volfson, Cosme’s drinks mastermind, reacted as if we’d stepped on her foot when we asked if mezcal (she has quite a collection) would be poured into rustic clay cups; no, she said, it goes into clear, modern glasses. The dining room hangs in a pool of darkness, where black ceilings and walls recede while shafts of light beam down onto the tops of the tables. You see what you’re eating and whom you’re eating it with; that’s about it. The menu is not built around familiar Mexican signposts like enchiladas, either; it’s just a long list of dishes, all of roughly the same size, running down the left side of the page. In the lower right corner, by itself, is guacamole. It’s the one landmark every customer is sure to recognize, and it is literally marginalized. Mr. Olvera might as well train the servers to roll their eyes like April Ludgate if anyone orders it. The menu, in fact, isn’t a lot of help when it comes to suggesting how to put together a meal. Servers will suggest sharing about three dishes for each person at the table. Follow this advice, and you will not go hungry; unlike many chefs, Mr. Olvera takes the trouble to plate food so that it divides easily. But you will pay for the experience. Cosme is an expensive restaurant, where dinner for two with dessert and wine can easily creep beyond $300. A few dishes leave you wondering momentarily if it’s worth it, like the stodgy, compacted eggplant-lard tamal. And while there is an absolute classic on Jesús Peréa’s dessert menu, the cracked meringue made with burned and pulverized corn husks and filled with corn mousse, the rest of them tend toward a blandly pleasant sweetness. There aren’t many problems like that, though. More often you get something like the fried pork skin, as big and brown and open as a catcher’s mitt, covered with sliced radishes and avocados. It doesn’t sound like much, but it’s sensational. So are the duck carnitas, slowly braised in the meat’s own fat with orange and Coca-Cola (the Mexican one, no corn syrup). Or the lobster paired, boldly and unerringly, with fresh chorizo and refried black beans. Almost everything you taste at Cosme seems new without being forced or mannered. It isn’t the kind of Mexican cooking that can be learned on a vacation. It has to be lived, and for that there are no shortcuts.",Uni tostada; chicharron; scallop aguachile; smoked raw sepia with salsa Mexicana; cobia al pastor; white ayocote bean salad; burrata and salsa verde; half-lobster pibil; broiled garlic-rubbed New York strip; duck carnitas.

Regular spikes would indicate the orderly arrival of restaurants, with just a few aberrant tremors here and there: the closure of Tabla and, very rarely, a change of chef.  But since the summer of 2013, one quake after another has jolted the needle. The chef of the Dining Room and the Bar Room at the Modern stepped down. Then the same thing happened at the two Blue Smoke locations. Then North End Grill. One at a time, replacements were named. Recently came word that when Untitled moves downtown with the Whitney Museum of American Art, it will get a new chef, too. This cluster of seismic activity could be a coincidence. Or it could mean that pressure was building for a while; suddenly, the tectonic plates moved. What is clear is that a company with a healthy respect for loyalty and stability has taken advantage of the turnover. The new chefs are far from cautious caretakers; they’ve moved decisively to refresh menus that, in some cases, had begun to stagnate.  Today I’ll take on Blue Smoke and North End Grill; the Modern is a complicated case of two restaurants, each holding three stars from The New York Times, and is best saved for another time. Even fans of Blue Smoke would not have described it, before Jean-Paul Bourgeois took over the kitchen last March, as a beacon of innovation. From its birth in 2002 on East 27th Street through the opening of a Battery Park City location 10 years later, Blue Smoke tried to replicate every major American barbecue style. This guaranteed that its meat would be compared to Texas brisket, Carolina pulled pork and St. Louis ribs, and also guaranteed that the verdict would not favor Blue Smoke. Mr. Bourgeois has tried to extract himself from that trap by dropping the regional aspirations from the menu, which now offers “seven-pepper rubbed beef brisket” and so on. It’s a start, but today Blue Smoke also faces competition from local pitmasters who produce great barbecue more consistently than it does. At their best, Blue Smoke’s pulled pork can run a close second to the one at Mighty Quinn’s Barbeque, and the brisket isn’t far off the one at Hometown Bar-B-Que, which has gotten better and better. On off days, you may get a pulp of gray, lifeless, smokeless pork or a tough, stringy sparerib. But while Blue Smoke’s barbecue lags, as ever, a few paces behind the front-runners, when it comes to contemporary Southern cooking in New York Mr. Bourgeois’s menu is at the head of the pack.  An appetizer called the Preservation Plate recently gave a survey of his range. He had used the smoker to turn a duck breast into very fine ham. His kitchen had put up pickles in the warm weather, string beans and red grapes tasting of cloves. He’d made a blackberry and root beer mustard to go with chicken liver pâté on toast, and tender, juicy pickled shrimp. This is a platter that summons thoughts of Frank Stitt or Hugh Acheson. Mr. Bourgeois is a native of Thibodaux, La., and some of his best dishes have been yanked, still wriggling, right out of the bayou. You know he means to do things the right way when you see the soft French bread that comes with oysters roasted in smoked garlic butter under crackling bread crumbs. His seafood boil is outstanding, every ingredient cooked the way it should be: the little potatoes, the crisp baby carrots, the fat, wonderful gulf shrimp and a head of boiled garlic that is delicious spread on Saltines. The comeback sauce goes with all of it, just as the chunky and aromatic tomato sauce goes with the very fresh pan-seared red snapper, gulf shrimp and crab meat to make a Cajun court bouillon, or coo-bee-yon.  Over two visits at each location, it became clear that missteps can occur at either, although the worst service I’ve ever had at one of Mr. Meyer’s restaurants took place in the Flatiron branch. My table repeatedly seemed to disappear for 20 minutes at a time. After one long absence, our server seemed to think we should have been finishing our desserts. “How are your ...” he began. “Oh, you still have your menus.”  Blue Smoke’s desserts themselves seemed to have dropped behind a fog of oblivion until very recently. Two months ago, banana cream pie had lost its custard or pastry cream, so scraps of brown banana sat naked on a pie shell; the kitchen tried in vain to hide them under whipped cream. Late last year the pastry chef Emily Isaac rode in to the rescue, and while she is only beginning to introduce her own desserts, the recipes she inherited are already greatly improved.  It’s less clear that North End Grill needed a course correction. I gave the restaurant two stars in 2012, but even then I thought Floyd Cardoz’s menu was hard to pin down: It had an egg section, but also lots of fish, and meat cooked on the wood grill seemed to be important, too.  Eric Korsh, who started last spring, has a more unified approach, one tilting toward France. The level of cooking may not be different now, but Mr. Korsh hits more high notes, and hits them more often. His charcuterie is worth a visit all by itself, whether for the slippery, salty and gelatinous torchon of trotters or the thin slices of lightly pickled beef tongue with gribiche sauce, tangy and smooth. And he served a loup de mer the way I’d like to see it done at La Grenouille, with a terrific lobster sauce, a tangle of simple spinach and a huge glittering knob of caviar. I loved the way Mr. Korsh had seared and deeply scored the skin side of a raw Spanish mackerel, leaving intact the rest of the slab; to lighten the oily fish he had brought together pink grapefruit, hot chiles, cucumber and radishes. I admired how precisely each piece of seafood in his bouillabaisse was cooked, although I thought the broth tasted a little too much like clams. And he seems to get the most out of the wood grill. Smoke and char bring a primeval thrill to a splayed-open, nearly rare squab; now that I think about it again, my pulse is racing. And the Berkshire pork, said to serve two but enough to subdue at least four, is a piece of meat for the ages; it could do for the pork chop what Peter Luger did for the porterhouse. Desserts, now by Tracy Obolsky, still weave sophisticated threads into classics, like chocolate cake with crunchy malt or the tribute, in ice cream, to the Almond Joy. Try it, even if you think the original can’t be improved. Change is good.",Cornbread madeleines; brisket beef jerky; smoked sausage and pimento cheese; roasted oysters; fried chicken and biscuits; Louisiana shrimp boil; beignets.
170,Upland,2 star,"Jan. 13, 2015",Pete Wells,Kips Bay,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/dining/restaurant-review-upland-on-park-avenue-south.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/dining/restaurant-review-upland-on-park-avenue-south.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"“Go to Upland” is my current answer to anybody who asks for a good new place to eat in Manhattan. It will probably remain my answer for some time. The recommendation is the same for fetishists who unwind by reconstructing recipes from the court of Catherine de Medici as for parishioners in the Church of St. Rachael. It holds for drinkers who are on the lookout for unexplored grapes and for those who call all white wine chardonnay. The only diners I would not send to Upland are the ones who categorically refuse to take any meals along Park Avenue South. Their loss. Upland’s owner and impresario in chief, Stephen Starr, has opened jostling, thumping, nightclub-slash-restaurants such as Morimoto and Buddakan, as well as intimate stages for chefs like Serpico in Philadelphia. Upland occupies the middle ground, a big restaurant where the set dressing feels like an event but doesn’t compete with the food.  For the kitchen, Mr. Starr recruited Justin Smillie, whose intensely flavorful spins on Italian cuisine at Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria won him national notice. Upland’s 88-seat dining room and vast menu would make some of his peers, serenely accustomed to arranging brassica specimens at tasting counters the size of egg cartons, collapse in a swoon. Lucky for us, Mr. Smillie is made of sturdier stuff.  His menu splashes around in the gentle, sun-dappled river of classic California cuisine, with special attention to its junctions with the Jonathan Waxman and Jeremiah Tower tributaries. (Upland is the name of the town in San Bernardino County where Mr. Smillie was raised; Mr. Waxman was a mentor.) Mr. Smillie’s pizzas, built on a tender crust with puffy lips, are freewheeling, like the very good one with pears, arugula and soft stracciatella cheese underscored by aged balsamic and a pesto that crunches with chopped pecans. His pastas can be tried and true, like the firm and well-peppered bucatini slick with tangy pecorino or the long, star-shaped tubes called estrella tossed with a just-right sauté of chicken livers with rosemary and sage. Or they may surprise you, like the spicy spaghettini that get their potent oceanic flavor from invisible baby sardines. Either way, they’re further confirmation that Mr. Smillie is one of the city’s pasta savants. As he showed in his last kitchen, he’s something of a vegetable sage, too. Celery root never struck me as a showstopper, exactly, until I tasted the one at Upland, slowly roasted into an intense and creamy globe and brushed with black truffle butter. Everybody at my table always wanted to try his deep-fried hen-of-the-woods mushroom, and everybody was always happy swiping it in herbed Cloumage, a charming cousin of ricotta brought down from southern Massachusetts. And a main course of Tasmanian sea trout was made memorable by its vegetable side, a section of sweet, ivory-colored cone cabbage permeated by smoke.  The burrata purist at my table was dubious about the heaps of trout roe and frizz of fried leeks Mr. Smillie piled on top of the near-liquid cheese, but the rest of us spooned it up, wishing we had a toasted everything bagel to complete the picture. When it was gone, we weren’t sure we would have the energy for the plate of duck wings, like confit with a bone handle. But the sparks of heat and citrus in the yuzu kosho vinaigrette on the skin kept us going until we began to think that Upland deserves a place in the annals of poultry wing cookery alongside the Anchor Bar in Buffalo. Among the main courses, the grilled branzino with a scallion-heavy salsa verde was solid if unsurprising. The pork chop, though, half-moons of sweet persimmon and hot red peppers on top, was a sensation. I thought about Mr. Smillie’s gift for building flavor upon flavor as I chewed on the tiny squares of crackling that wrapped around the bone. His menu rambles a bit, and it’s no surprise that not all of the 30 or so dishes glide with swanlike grace. Chilled and decidedly al dente farro spaghetti seemed like an odd choice for a cold sea urchin sauce, and the whole notion is unlikely to melt anyone’s heart in the dead of winter. Wads of spicy grated radish smothered the sweetness of just-shucked raw scallops. And the short rib with walnuts and unruly curls of shaved celery that was roasted on a rotisserie at Il Buco Alimentari hasn’t fully acclimated to being cooked in an oven on East 26th Street; there seems to be less of the deeply caramelized meat around the edges, and it’s less satisfying to chew on, while the bite of the peppercorns is more bullying than I remember. And I wondered about the size of the dining room when two out of three pastas showed up lukewarm one night. After some early critical grumbling about the desserts, a new pastry chef from Thomas Keller’s fleet, Sébastien Rouxel, was installed shortly before Christmas. I hope he sets the whisks and rolling pins in order quickly because I’ve yet to meet a dessert at Upland that I’d come back for, let alone one that suggests the easy rapport Mr. Smillie has with his ingredients. For now, there is more excitement to be had in slaloming around Chantelle Pabros’s wine cellar. She has assembled one of the most accessible, least dogmatic lists in town, with dozens of bottles under $50, as if that were the way all wine lists worked. (It isn’t, but it should be.) New Yorkers can challenge their parochial disdain for California wines with classics like Chateau Montelena and leaders of the modern style like Cathy Corison. Or they can dip into one of several affordable Bordeaux, so unfashionable, so delicious. There is more than a token sampling of reds from Portugal, and three Canadian Chardonnays, patiently waiting for America to notice.  The interior is lined by shelf after shelf of preserved lemons in jars, each one illuminated by three tiny LEDs until they become something like citrus lamps. When their marmalade glow hits the copper trim around the dining room, it gives off a light warmer than anything I’ve seen in a restaurant before. The tables in the dining room are generously large, the seats the kind you want to stay in all night. Not so in the bar, where two of my guests, arriving early, were deposited on hard-backed wood benches near the after-work mob. When I appeared, there was a whispered conference by the coat room. “I’m sorry,” a host finally said to my guests, “I forgot to ask if you’d like to sit in the dining room.”  If she forgets to ask you, too, tell her I said the dining room is the place to be.",Whole crispy mushroom; slow roasted celeriac with truffle butter; burrata with trout roe; herb-crusted octopus; duck wings; estrella with chicken livers; spaghettini with caviale di Napoli; cioppino; slow-cooked lamb neck; crackling porcelet.

Restaurants owned by the chef Masayoshi Takayama, who has spent his career charging more for Japanese food than anyone else in the United States: five. Restaurants the two men own together: one, Kappo Masa, in the basement below Mr. Gagosian’s Madison Avenue gallery. The dining room, furnished with teak tables and seating upholstered in buttercup-yellow leather, wraps in an L shape around the large, well-populated kitchen. Mr. Takayama is known for sushi, but Kappo Masa presents a general overview of Japanese cuisine, so in addition to the raw-fish counter, there are stations for grilling, frying, simmering, steaming and assembling marinated seafood plates and cold salads. He runs the kitchen himself, but I failed to spot him. Now three months old, Kappo Masa is not the most expensive restaurant in New York. That distinction belongs to Mr. Takayama’s home base, Masa, in the Time Warner Center. (Price of dinner for one before tax, tip and drinks: $450.) Still, it is expensive in a way that’s hard to forget either during or after the meal. The cost of eating at Kappo Masa is so brutally, illogically, relentlessly high, and so out of proportion to any pleasure you may get, that large numbers start to seem like uninvited and poorly behaved guests at the table. Price of a maki roll of chopped fatty tuna wrapped in rice with caviar piled on each of the eight pieces: $240. I could never bring myself to order it, or two dishes filigreed with white truffles: the fried rice with mushrooms ($120) or the Ohmi beef tataki ($150). So I can’t tell you how any of them taste, but I can tell you that by the time I spotted something for less than $80, it struck me as a steal. Amount I spent for 5.5 ounces of grilled steak raised in Australia: $78. The beef had a species of tenderness that I associate more with bluefin tuna than steak. It tasted something like teriyaki without the sugar. I liked it very much, but mostly I thought, “Why $78?” In fact, Mr. Takayama charges similar prices across town at Bar Masa. But the food and service allow Bar Masa to pass for an à la carte version of Masa itself. Kappo Masa is nowhere near as good. The raw ingredients may well be the same, but they are often handled carelessly, seasoned indifferently and served inattentively. Price of bland, watery cauliflower florets with maitake mushrooms that were grilled over far too much heat so their insides were raw and woody while their exteriors was burned to a char that peeled off in blackened flakes: $28. Price of yellowtail collar left on the grill until it lost the silky, puddinglike richness that is the whole point of this cut: $28. Price of noodles extruded from ground shrimp, a gluten-free invention of Mr. Takayama’s, sloshing around in a greasy pond of way too much melted butter and not enough of the serrano chiles that may have given the dish a little spark: $24. Price of four tiny, cold flour tortillas filled with roast duck, floppy matchsticks of uncrisp duck skin and batons of overcooked foie gras: $26. Every once in a while, something genuinely remarkable would arrive, as if from another kitchen. Cubes of superb raw tuna ($34), seasoned with soy, sake and minced wasabi, were served polar-vortex-cold on a chilled white ceramic drum designed by Mr. Takayama. Butterflied grilled octopus ($24), soft and a little smoky in its dressing of sesame oil and lime, was something like Japanese shrimp scampi, a terrific surprise. There was “baby dancing shrimp,” in a shattering, exquisite batter dusted with ground chiles ($26), and a sea urchin risotto with springy grains of rice, some very fresh chanterelles and almost enough urchin to silence any protests about the price ($48). If the whole meal were like this, Kappo Masa would be a fantastic splurge. It’s not, though, and those prices start to seem like very expensive lottery tickets. They got into my head in other ways, too, warping my normal sense of value. Menu price for cress with wasabi dressing: $18. Amount I paid: $38, making this the first restaurant where I have actually looked over the check before paying and missed a $20 overcharge for a salad. I hadn’t been drinking that night, either. If I had, I might have become even more numbed to gouging. Approximate retail price of a bottle of 2012 Napa Valley chardonnay from Far Niente: $55. Price of the same bottle at Kappo Masa: $190. This was typical. The markup that New York restaurants customarily add to retail wine and sake prices is about 150 percent. The average markup at Kappo Masa is 200 percent to 300 percent. And I don’t need to shop around town to know that a cocktail of unnamed vodka infused with pineapple, even if it is as fresh tasting as Kappo Masa’s, should not cost $25. It doesn’t seem possible that Mr. Gagosian and Mr. Takayama just made up these prices out of thin air, diabolically chortling like Batman villains, late one evening at Masa. (Number of times each month Mr. Gagosian eats there, by his estimate: two.) And yet if you are one of those people who suspects that Manhattan is being remade as a private playground for millionaires who either don’t mind spending hundreds of dollars for mediocrity or simply can’t tell the difference, Kappo Masa is not going to convince you that you’re wrong. Superficially, the servers seem to belong in a restaurant offering casual luxury. They can act out a solemn, respectful greeting or a deep genuflection of apology. What they don’t always do is care. Servers who rushed to our side and fluttered about and acted distressed after one of them bumped a votive candle off the table’s edge: three. Servers who asked if anyone had been hit by the candle or checked to see if we had wax on our clothes: zero. Also, bowing at one side of the table holding a cocktail menu open may have broadcast a desire to please, but it made the text impossible to read. When I asked which “long-stem mushrooms” came with the grilled asparagus, the server very obligingly promised to ask the kitchen but never returned with the answer. One night the standard finger napkins didn’t appear until halfway through the sushi course. A restaurant of Mr. Takayama’s that forgets how to serve sushi seems unthinkable, but then the sushi itself was no prize. The rice was a gummy clump (though, on another visit, it was close to perfect). Kappo Masa provides a pantomime of service without the substance, and the restaurant itself is an imitation of luxury, not the real thing. Stars I might have given Kappo Masa if the prices were, say, 20 percent lower: one. Stars I am giving it: zero.",Wasabi tuna tartare; baby dancing shrimp; grilled langoustines; sizzling octopus with parsley verde; garlic soy steak; uni risotto; nabeyaki udon with shrimp tempura.
172,Dirty French,2 star,"Dec. 9, 2014",Pete Wells,Lower East Side,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/dining/restaurant-review-dirty-french-on-the-lower-east-side.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/dining/restaurant-review-dirty-french-on-the-lower-east-side.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"A new restaurant from the chefs Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone and their partner Jeff Zalaznick tiptoed onto the Lower East Side in September, demurely announcing its name with two eight-foot-high neon signs in peep-show pink. DIRTY, says one. FRENCH, reads the other. Diners who have reservations for Dirty French, secured with a credit card and a gentle warning of a modest $50-a-person cancellation fee, will find a dining room inside the Ludlow hotel that is decorated with a few shoestring-budget items, like a wall-length antique carnival mirror shipped from France. A few weeks ago, the partners had the artist Rashid Johnson, a frequent guest, throw oozing slicks of wax blended with West African black soap against the mirror’s glass. (Around the same time, one of Mr. Johnson’s wax-and-soap works sold at auction for just under $200,000.) Across from the mirror, over the bar, is a wide French flag that Julian Schnabel splotched with ink. Down on the tiled floor, in another humble little gesture, servers lope around in squeaky-fresh limited edition Air Jordans from the ’80s, some of which probably cost more than I paid for my first car. Ever since Carbone and its neighbor, ZZ’s Clam Bar, came along, swagger and money have been to Torrisi-Carbone-Zalaznick establishments what blinking lights and sitars are to Sixth Street’s Curry Row. If the word for flaunting cash and art-world connections like this doesn’t occur to you immediately, look at the strutting crowd of ceramic roosters that Mr. Zalaznick spray-painted in screaming pink: Dirty French is one cocky restaurant. It can also be an immensely enjoyable one. That sounds contradictory, but the same self-confidence that can get on your nerves also allows this crew to mess around with French cuisine with a hugely energizing lack of respect. In unnatural crossbreeding experiments, they force bistro cooking to mate with haute cuisine. To make dinner less stuffy and formal, they bring back stuffy formalities like cut-glass wine carafes and frilly oyster plates. They smudge the pages of Escoffier with strange foreign spices. It may sound like run-of-the-mill fusion, but it is a top-to-bottom remix, and nearly every weird mongrel idea leads in the direction of more flavor or more fun. Chefs more deferential to custom may not have ditched the hallowed basket of levain or baguette à l’ancienne in favor of a flatbread inspired by the mahjeb Mr. Torrisi ate, one loaf after another, in a North African neighborhood of Paris. It’s no innovation, this bread, just pita dough griddled in plenty of olive oil, buried under Provençal herbs and sent out with a snowbank of fromage blanc, but people tore it up with greedy, greasy fingers at every table, mine included. Not that the chefs hide their training. (Mr. Torrisi worked for years under Daniel Boulud and takes the lead in this kitchen.) The mille-feuille is a technical showstopper, an accordion of ribbon-thin king trumpet mushroom stems folded over and over. It looks like pastry but pulls apart like buttered noodles, and when you drag them through a pool of green curry, the scene shifts to Thailand. It’s a disorienting dish, and makes your head spin in a wonderful way. The restaurant creates a parallel world where French pastry turns into Thai curry; it’s as if the chefs have imagined an alternative history in which the leading kitchens of France turned left instead of right several decades ago. What if nouvelle cuisine had embraced maximalism instead of minimalism, full-frontal abandon instead of lean precision? And what if, instead of teaching Americans to make puff pastry, the country’s chefs had taken cooking lessons from the rest of the French-speaking world? For one thing, they might have come up with Dirty French’s glorious lamb carpaccio. Brushed with a slow-burning raz al hanout oil, sprinkled with tart sumac powder and fresh herbs, dotted with sheep’s milk yogurt and preserved lemon and wheels of roasted eggplant, the slices of lamb loin are saddled with as much flavor as they can reasonably be asked to carry. Or, though this probably needed a push from the roast-chicken gold rush started at the NoMad, they might have hit upon Dirty French’s $72 poultry feast. First to arrive is the sneakily rich (translation: you can’t see the foie gras) white meat in mustard-herb sauce. Then the bird’s hindquarters show up on a cutting board. They’ve been soaked in a Vietnamese marinade of soy, fish sauce and lemon grass, slowly cooked in melted chicken fat (oh yes they have), then grilled and freshened up with lime zest. The chicken comes with crepes, irrelevantly; just pick up a drumstick and get to work on that burnished skin. The chefs have an instinct for the right kind of too much, but some dishes trip into the wrong kind. A deeply aromatic and fairly traditional bouillabaisse was thick with octopus, mussels, monkfish and one small, whole, wonderful red mullet. Cuttlefish ink took the broth to the outer edge of intensity, but the medicinal taste of fresh marjoram in some spoonfuls went beyond it. And while duck heart kebabs unloaded at the table added brawn to a frisée and lardons salad, the blast of mustard in the dressing was an excessive use of force. A programmatic rollout of the formula — Something Clearly French Under Heaps of Post-Colonial Exotica — doesn’t guarantee a sprinkling of magical pixie dust on every plate. Baked clams seemed perplexed by their thick jackets of almonds and Ethiopian spices, and so was I. A beautifully cooked trout meunière was speckled with sesame seeds and herbs, a mix that came across as an oddly neutered za’atar. Still, you can eat extraordinarily well by calling your shots and rolling with the loose, genial decadence of the place. The mood is set when a server comes over and says, in as laid-back a tone as anyone can manage while lugging an enormous 19th-century sterling silver punch bowl filled with ice, “I wanted to let you have a look at tonight’s oysters.” Oysters: Why not? It continues when Lelañea Fulton, who assembled a wine list that is all French, and fun for all kinds of budgets, shows up dressed like one of Charlie’s Angels working undercover as a sommelier. Old Châteauneuf-du-Pape? Sure. It goes on through dessert, under the assured hand of the pastry chef Heather Bertinetti, who gracefully threads her way through the French-exotic conceit with a delicately architectural coconut-passionfruit Napoleon and a very short but very good pineapple tarte Tatin, rum-raisin ice cream on top. Mr. Torrisi, Mr. Carbone and Mr. Zalaznick, cautious and retiring as ever, plan to open three original restaurants next year while continuing to build new Parm locations. The question is whether this will leave them the energy to keep refining their mongrel bistro on Ludlow Street while rolling out its breakfast and lunch menus in the coming months. Dirty French needs time to grow into its ideas, and maybe to grow out of a few of them.",Mille-feuille of mushrooms; salmon maison; carpaccio of lamb; terrine of foie gras; bouillabaisse noire; lamb saddle boulangère; duck à l’orange; chicken and crepes; lemon tart; pineapple tarte Tatin.

It is food for the fifth night of vacation. And now the chef Nick Anderer has come to make this lesser stop on Rome’s culinary pilgrimage route the main event of his new pizzeria, Marta. For the last five years Mr. Anderer has been a faithful custodian of the more famous Roman landmarks at Maialino, in the Gramercy Park Hotel. Marta, opened in September, is a continuation of that project, a spinoff that might have found a space next door if Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group had not decided to place it about a half-mile away in the soaring, stately lobby of the Martha Washington Hotel. Marta has Roman appetizers and entire Roman dishes repurposed as toppings for pizzas with thin crusts in the Roman style. Hold on, you say. Thin-crust pies are wall to wall around here. It is the house style of New York, a city to which people actually do travel for pizza. The style came from Naples with America’s earliest pizzaioli more than a century ago, and it’s been rejuvenated by modern obsessives who precisely calibrate their flour blends. What do we have to learn from Rome? Let’s keep local pride in check for a minute. Marta’s crusts are even thinner than what we think of as thin. Cooks in gray baseball caps press the dough flat with rolling pins on a marble counter. Slipped onto the floor of one of the hulking ovens whose black-tiled chimneys disappear into the hotel’s second floor, the pies bake next to flickering stacks of firewood. The crust at first-rank Roman pizzerias like Da Remo in Testaccio is often compared to a cracker, but crackers crumble. This doesn’t. It is more like the crust on a loaf of peasant bread from which all the soft crumbs have been stripped. It is durably crisp, unbendingly flat, and when you hold a slice by the edge, the rest of it juts out above the table like a cliff. Because everything I know about cliffs was learned from Wile E. Coyote, I kept waiting for the tip on each Marta slice to give way, but it never did. The pleasure of biting down on this pizza is both physical and auditory. The noise detonates along the jaw and plows right into the inner ear. Every bite sounds and feels like that. There is no soupy middle of steamed dough under wet tomatoes. It’s pure crunch, all the way. What you lose with this style is the soft, springy, baguette-like curls at the edges of a Neapolitan pizza. The outer crusts of a Marta pie don’t puff up; they stay hard and round, like grissini. When a pizza crust is all crackle, what’s on top has to bring the flavor. This is where you see Mr. Anderer thinking like a cook. He has a great pizza-fied version of carbonara, with dots of egg and grated pecorino over crumbled, starchy potatoes and baconlike curls of guanciale. For a while, he was doing an enjoyable two-dimensional trippa alla Romana, too, spreading the rich, chile-boosted tomato sauce around the pie and arranging tender, not too chewy bands of tripe on top. In a more classical vein, the margherita, spread with flavorful tomatoes that are more pulp than sauce and punctuated with mozzarella, is superb. At $16, the buffalo mozzarella, richer and with a faint taste of the barnyard or wherever it is water buffaloes pass the time, is worth the $4 upgrade from the cow’s milk variety. And if $18 seems high for a funghi pizza, note that the funghi in question are quartered chanterelles and frilly hen-of-the-woods, seasoned with thyme and just enough salt. Like almost all the toppings, the mushrooms are beautifully cooked with an insinuation of smoke; only the shoulder ham, layered between fontina and arugula, seemed to want more time in the oven, or maybe it needed to be sliced thin, so the edges could crisp and curl. Few pizzerias invest heavily in atmospherics, because pizza and the people who love it come and go in a few minutes. Still, it’s a surprise just how little atmosphere the Union Square Hospitality Group has tried to conjure at Marta. The dining room, with its majestic high ceilings and blocky fluted columns, has the cold, empty monumentality of a 19th-century bank. There’s some energy at the counter that faces the ovens, but very little in the rows of square tables behind it. The restaurant is open to the hotel lobby, and after a while, the comings and goings can make you feel as if you’re eating in the waiting room of a train station. Lingering over a long series of courses is not advised. Marta works best when treated as a pizzeria, not a restaurant. Main courses are available, but they are not as trustworthy as the pies. Pork ribs managed to be both charred and undercooked, while a slow-roasted short rib needed a more potent infusion of flavor than gremolata could give it. The mixed grill of lamb chops, ribs and sausage was a magnificent exception, but in general the larger plates are best for those who can’t eat pizza. (Marta does not make gluten-free dough.) A quick appetizer while the pizza bakes is absolutely recommended, though. Wood smoke wraps around rabbit meatballs, heavily peppered and herbed. The kitchen does fine work with hot oil, swathing vegetable fritters or seafood fritto misto in a translucently thin, light-gold batter and gently browning the bread crumbs around green supplì shaped from very good basil risotto. After pizza, there is an affogato that is exactly right, an ice cream sandwich that’s harder to like than it should be (the salted chocolate cookies could be thinner or softer, the pistachios crisper) and a cup of tiramisù that’s bracingly drenched in espresso. It costs just $5, which is helpful because pizza and fried food both need bubbles. Marta has a few Italian sparkling wines, but the real action is in the stockpile of nearly 40 Champagnes, from a $66 Roger Pouillon Cuvée de Réserve to some $300-plus vintage treats. Nobody goes to Rome for Champagne with pizza, either, but this isn’t Rome.","Supplì; fried vegetables and seafood; rabbit meatballs; margherita, Roman-style tripe, potato alla carbonara and mushroom pizzas; lamb mixed grill; affogato; buckwheat tart."
174,Bar Bolonat,2 star,"Nov. 25, 2014",Pete Wells,West Village,Middle Eastern,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/dining/restaurant-review-bar-bolonat-in-the-west-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/dining/restaurant-review-bar-bolonat-in-the-west-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Some restaurants hit the ground at full tilt. This review concerns one of the others, a place that stumbled at the start, as ungainly as a day-old giraffe, and only recently found its footing.  Bar Bolonat opened in the West Village in March in what seemed an auspicious location, a corner spot looking out on Abingdon Square Park through yards of windows. Two months in, Einat Admony, the chef and owner, was on the verge of closing it, she said in a phone interview. Nearly half of her 54 seats had been taken away after the city ruled that one wing of the dining room was an unpermitted sidewalk enclosure. The disputed area was quarantined behind a velvet rope, although it was hard to imagine a crowd lining up for admission to this patch of bare cement floor. This put a strain on revenues, no doubt, and made the place look pretty weird. Even with reduced capacity, Bar Bolonat was afflicted by suboptimal acoustics. When I ate there early in the summer, the screeching in the dining room could have crushed scrap metal. It nearly crushed my desire to come back, too, but I held on because Ms. Admony was up to something original in the kitchen.  The  daughter of an Iranian mother and Yemenite father,  she was combining the flavors of contemporary multiethnic Israel, where she grew up, with the idioms of modern restaurants in New York, where she has been cooking since getting a job in Bobby Flay’s kitchen at Bolo in 1999. I’d never tasted anything exactly like her shrimp in a Yemenite curry, with a fiery shot of green zhug and a small round of fried bread called malawach to soak up the spicy, turmeric-gold coconut milk. I wanted more food like this in my life, but I wasn’t in a big hurry to face the decibels again. Now, with sound-absorbing tiles up above, Bar Bolonat is a quieter restaurant, though it’s not entirely library-like. (One small section of ceiling, without tiles, is angled like the soundboard of a grand piano, with a similar effect.) It’s also bigger. In September, Ms. Admony finally appeased the bureaucrats and returned all her seats to active duty.  While fixing up the space, she made other changes, replacing executive chefs until she found Molly Breidenthal. When I ate there this month, the cooking was more assured than it had been, the spices applied more fearlessly. The giraffe is on the move. Energetic seasoning drives Ms. Admony’s cuisine at Bar Bolonat, as it does at her exemplary falafel shops, Taïm, and to a lesser extent her Mediterranean comfort food restaurant, Balaboosta. One of Bar Bolonat’s most likable dishes since the unsteady early days has been the lemony grilled baby artichokes with a creamy band of pistachio yogurt under a pale-green powder of dukkah. That blend of chopped nuts and herbs can get tired if it sits around too long, but Bar Bolonat’s is extremely fresh, the pistachios still sweet and bright green. A swipe of corn purée takes its seductive, toasty flavor from turmeric, cardamom and ground cloves, Ms. Admony’s version of a warming spice blend called hawaij that Yemenis stir into soups. Together with the creeping heat and sweetness of a red pepper sauce, the spiced corn makes something exciting out of a grilled octopus leg.  Nearly everybody orders the Jerusalem-style sesame bagel, so light and fluffy it’s almost an anti-bagel. Nearly everybody is right about this. What makes this racetrack-shaped bread so hard to pass up is the spoonful of really fragrant and complex za’atar that you dunk each piece into after giving it a preliminary bath in peppery olive oil. When dishes were underwhelming, as several were one August night, timid seasoning could be to blame. “Za’atar ravioli,” stuffed with smoky eggplant, might have been interesting had it included some actual za’atar. On the other hand, Bar Bolonat’s zabzi, an Iranian fresh-herb stew served with soft specks of fresh couscous, was fantastically vivid, and it could have become one of my favorites if the short rib in the stew had not been tough and dry. The dishes at Bar Bolonat are meant to be shared — everybody sing along — and come out of the kitchen as they’re ready. Or so the servers say. The menu is split into small, medium and large plates. As common sense would tell you if the servers weren’t telling you otherwise, the bigger ones, like the lamb neck braised with dates and chestnuts until it is pull-apart tender, are a lot easier to split than the few mouthfuls of fluke ceviche with dried pomegranate seeds and juice. The kitchen could do more to help by, say, carving the pomegranate-glazed poussin instead of sending it out whole with a serrated knife.  The bit about the dishes’ showing up at random times is misleading, too, but in a good way. My table was never laden down with more plates than it could hold. This ought to go without saying, but in restaurants these days nothing does. Apart from one or two unscheduled leaves of absence one night, the service was generally excellent, with a professional bearing that signals Ms. Admony’s intent to have Israeli cuisine taken seriously. The white napkins, polished stemware, sheer curtains and understated modern furniture are all a determined bid for the kinds of diners who would steer clear of anything resembling a hummus hut. For dessert, Ms. Admony makes a homey, from-scratch version of Milky, a chocolate pudding brand so central to Israeli life that it became the symbol of a protest this fall against the high cost of living. The halvah crème brûlée tastes more like butterscotch than sesame, but it is worth getting for the tuft of halvah floss on top. The most entertaining and probably the best dessert is a fried envelope of baklava with ice cream sealed inside, although the ice cream should be colder and the pastry hotter if Ms. Admony wants to live up to the high standards once set by the fried ice cream at Chi-Chi’s. Having fought City Hall and the screaming demons of dining-room noise, she’s probably ready for a new challenge.

175,Dumpling Galaxy,1 star,"Nov. 11, 2014",Pete Wells,Flushing,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/dining/restaurant-review-dumpling-galaxy-in-queens.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/dining/restaurant-review-dumpling-galaxy-in-queens.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"When I am on my way to a big dinner at a restaurant in Flushing, Queens, I like to limber up by eating a dozen of Helen You’s dumplings.  For the last eight years, Ms. You has been the chef and proprietor of the Tianjin Dumpling House, which is not so much a house as a narrow shaft of elbow room behind a sneeze guard in the basement of a Chinese food-vendors’ market on Main Street. The first dumpling of hers that I tried had a sea-bass stuffing cut with minced ginger, which gave bracing clarity to the few drops of broth sealed inside. It was so satisfying that at first I felt no need to branch out.  The dumplings were irresistibly priced, though, at about $5 a dozen, and I began to experiment with new ones: lamb and chopped zucchini humming with Sichuan peppercorns, maybe, or pork with threads of fresh dill. These were wildly good, too.  One day, I noticed a sign inviting me to pick my own custom dumpling fillings from a grid of 24 ingredients. This paralyzed me. Ms. You clearly had a kind of genius for creating miniature worlds of flavor. Who was I to tell her what she ought to fold into her circles of dough? It was as if somebody had handed me a box of feathers, bones, beaks and flesh and said, “Here, build a parrot.”  What I wanted was more of Ms. You’s recipes, not mine, and I got my wish earlier this year when Ms. You opened Dumpling Galaxy a few blocks from her original stall. Dumpling Galaxy sits back from the street, inside a shiny new mall it shares with a Korean-French bakery and a purveyor of sparkly false eyelashes. Ms. You designed the striking, modern interior herself, splashing bold Chinese red across walls with a basket-weave relief and building deep semiprivate booths, each with its own TV screen showing highlights of the 100 dumplings on the menu.  The Dumpling Channel goes heavy on cross-section shots that reveal the central core of filling. Take a good look, because this is a sight you should never see if you want to get the most out of a meal at Dumpling Galaxy. Resist the exploratory nibble. Dip one side in black vinegar and soy, and paint it with chile oil if you like, then pocket the whole thing in your mouth. It won’t gush with a waterfall of broth. It will, however, hold a few drops of liquid shed by the filling as the dumpling boiled. Those drops belong to you. Sometimes those juices taste like fresh green herbs, as when Ms. You mixes cilantro with minced lamb, or dill with excellent softly scrambled eggs. Sometimes they combine those qualities with a whiplash of heat, as in the head-twistingly good spicy beef dumpling, seasoned with scallions, fresh red and green chiles, and searing dried chile sauce.  As a young girl in Tianjin, China, Ms. You was taught to cook by her mother and grandparents. Her dumplings are sturdy, knobby, domestic creatures in the Northern Chinese tradition. Sometimes you see the ghostly outline of the fillings through the shiny white skins, and sometimes you can’t. But her dumplings are stuffed to order, and Ms. You fine-tunes them with the sensitivity of a natural cook who listens to her ingredients. Mixing shrimp with two varieties of celery, the more bitter and self-assured Chinese and the sweeter, shyer Western kind, and using both stalks and leaves, she builds exhilarating harmonies.  It would be a miracle on Main Street if all 100 varieties at Dumpling Galaxy were equally lovable. They aren’t. The one with shrimp, scallops and crab meat didn’t deliver the sweet seafood luxury it promised. Steamed har gow were less juicy than those wheeled around on the best dim sum carts. My strategy is to seek out the proprietary blends, which justify prices that can be slightly higher (as much as $7.95 for six) than those at other places in Flushing, including Tianjin Dumpling House. I’ve eaten entire meals that delivered less flavor than a single one of Ms. You’s dumplings stuffed with terrific little meatballs of duck and shiitakes. And if those hadn’t cheered me up, the fried dumplings would. Ms. You pours watery cornstarch into the pan, which bubbles and browns into a shatteringly thin, dumpling-studded pancake. Cracking that crust, I felt like the happiest guy in the galaxy.  That feeling wavered whenever I had to lean out of my booth with one arm extended for minutes at a time to ask for water or the check or for empty dishes to be cleared. It was like hailing a cab on Broadway at 5 p.m., but less effective. As time dragged on, I wondered why nobody had invented Uber for waiters.  Looking at the tables of Chinese families, I noticed that their dumpling consumption was considerably less piggish than mine. They might share a single order, a mere six dumplings, before moving on to the dishes from Northern China, Hunan and Fujian on the rest of the menu. (One cook specializes in each region.) I came to see the wisdom of allowing fish and vegetables to supplement all the boiled flour I was ingesting. The Hunanese preserved pork stir-fried with stubby lengths of pickled long beans was superb, both fiery and tart. Triple delight vegetables (green chiles, barely tender potato and eggplant so creamy it may as well be pudding) was an unusually good version of the Dongbei standby. Whole fish with spicy bean sauce was a hit at my table, even if we did use the marvelous sauce to obscure the fish’s slightly muddy flavor. You can find these dishes elsewhere, but no other kitchen offers such an embarrassment of dumpling riches, including dessert. Some sweet dumplings are pinched in dough like the savory ones, such as tart dried hawthorn berries with white wood ears, or pear with eight treasures, which I now think of as fruitcake pirogi.  Others, called tang yuan, are tinted orbs of dough that are springy and chewy, like mochi. My favorite was the pumpkin-flavored globe with a sugary paste of black sesame at the core. These orange globes arrived, not on a plate like the others, but bobbing in a thick, clear, steaming soup. I could stare at ingredient lists all day and never come up with a parrot like this. ","Dumplings (pork and chive; lamb with green squash; lamb with cilantro; spicy beef; duck with mushroom; chicken with broccoli; cod with roe; squid; dried octopus and chives; shrimp and celery; wood ear and cabbage; dill and egg; pan-fried dumplings; eight treasures and pear sweet dumpling; pumpkin with black sesame tang yuan.

176,Tuome,2 star,"Nov. 4, 2014",Pete Wells,East Village,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/dining/restaurant-review-tuome-in-the-east-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/dining/restaurant-review-tuome-in-the-east-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Look inside the head of a bright young chef and you’ll see a beehive of swarming ideas, a few of them just hatched and others that buzzed in from somewhere else. It can take time to sort out which are borrowed and which have the sting of the new. Thomas Chen, fresh from the trenches at Eleven Madison Park and Commerce, opened his first restaurant in August, called Tuome. Like so many other places in the era of Noma, it is tastefully spartan in appearance. Its two small dining rooms are furnished with small tables set with small menus printed in small type. The wood chairs and metal bar stools are unsoftened by fabric or cushions. The lights are dim — not flattering, first-date dim but I’m-too-young-to-be-going-blind dim. In terms of glitz and glamour, Tuome falls somewhere between a yoga studio and Thoreau’s cabin. I’ve eaten in plenty of rooms like this over the last few years. And I’ve seen any number of dishes resembling these: the Nike swooshes of ultra-blended vegetable purées; the green leaves the size of chipmunk ears arranged just so over a deviled egg; the row of scallops all crouched together as if hiding from some scallop-hating predator on the other side of the plate. Clearly Mr. Chen and I have been following the same Instagram feeds. That egg, though. Wait a minute. This is something different. There is half of a hard-cooked white, deep-fried in panko. Spooned into the divot is a dot of deviled yolk, sharp with pickles and Dijon mustard. On top of that is a spoonful of fried garlic and dried chiles in their spicy red oil. It’s fun to feel the temperatures and textures, creamy and crackling and slippery, meet in your mouth, and to taste the strange collision of church-picnic-style eggs with a Chinese condiment. How can half an egg do three or four things at once? Later, a server points a siphon into the crook of an octopus leg. Out comes a suede-colored snowdrift. He says it’s brown-butter-and-potato espuma. I say it’s foam and I say the hell with it. I focus on the octopus, which crunches emphatically and has a rounded, slightly fruity flavor. With it is a chewy, chunky, lightly gingered XO sauce. Chopped caramelized pork and Chinese sausage give it the sweetness of bacon; fish sauce and dried shrimp take it broader and deeper. I can’t get enough of it. The foam will not be ignored forever, though. While it is not the most original notion, it does add something, unlike most foams. What it adds is a fluffy wave of toasted butter, like the frosting on a caramel cake minus the sugar and the heft. The dish is peculiarly good; it makes an extraordinary indulgence out of the octopus. And it shows off the clear and fresh point of view Mr. Chen brings to his cooking, particularly when he interprets Chinese flavors. Before working at Eleven Madison Park and Commerce, Mr. Chen was an accountant. The idea was to stay as far from restaurants as possible, and it came from his parents. After moving from China to New York City, the Chens operated a Chinese restaurant outside of the city. They wanted something higher for Thomas (he was Tommy at home, but on his parents’ lips the nickname came out “tow me,” which is how Tuome is pronounced), but after shepherding balance sheets by day and attending culinary school by night, he came to see cooking as the higher calling. A little more than two months in, Tuome is already starting to feel mature. The one-page wine list is seriously eclectic, but it’s not too cool for a Napa Valley cabernet and an Anderson Valley chardonnay. The servers take their jobs seriously, although I’m not sure the point has to be underlined by forcing them all to wear tailored T-shirts the color of wet cement. Mr. Chen doesn’t need to make his staff look like a modern dance troupe to tell people Tuome isn’t your average East Village spot; his cooking does that for him. (And the East Village average is getting higher every year.) He has terrific control over salt, spices, texture and contrast, weaving them together until you ask, why hasn’t anyone done this before? Adding slick duck fat to packets of Cantonese sticky rice steamed in lotus leaves seems like an obvious good idea. So does the extra crackle he puts into the Chinese sausage bits to save the rice from gummy monotony. But they aren’t obvious until you taste Mr. Chen’s version. A few dishes show off Mr. Chen’s technical command more than his originality. The scoop of chicken liver mousse with maple syrup pooled in a hollow on top, like the gravy on mashed potatoes, is exquisitely done, but feels familiar. Another dish fell out of focus between meals, when the carrot-miso purée accompanying seared scallops lost its savory, salty depth and became merely sweet. And there’s one I’d like to forget, a dully sweet squash soup impaled with frogs’ legs that were both mushy and stringy. But a striking number of dishes at Tuome are memorable for the right reasons. Serving sous-vide chicken on soupy rice cooked with garlic chives and shiitakes, Mr. Chen doesn’t try to sex up his homey inspiration, congee; he just makes it more layered and modern, surrounding the chicken with a dark basil jus, and lets the flavors quietly win you over. I wish he would take the same approach with pork belly instead of forcing it to do double-duty as a marketing event. Right now it’s called the Pig Out (a name meant for hashtagging), and it marches to the table as a $49 feast for two, 10 bite-size squares of pork belly riding on a slate shingle with a parade of sauces and bowls of spicy-peanut noodles following behind. The crashing cymbals can’t disguise how easily the dish, and its price, could be divided in half. But Mr. Chen has done something amazing to this pig. His inspiration may have been Cantonese roast pork, but these compressed, intensely flavorful squares of well-rendered belly partake of Peking duck, too. After I’d topped the reflective pane of skin with ginger-scallion sauce and a few drops of sambal from a squeeze bottle, I wanted to tuck the pork into a steamed bun or a crepe, and then chew and crunch and chew and crunch some more. Forget the gimmick. There are fresh ideas in this dish, and they are all Mr. Chen’s.",Deviled egg; oxtail spring roll; octopus with pork XO sauce; chicken with charred lettuce; Berkshire pork belly; brussels sprouts; rice with kale and Chinese sausage.
177,Blue Hill,3 star,"Oct. 28, 2014",Pete Wells,Greenwich Village,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/dining/restaurant-review-blue-hill-in-greenwich-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/dining/restaurant-review-blue-hill-in-greenwich-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Halfway through dinner at Blue Hill, my server presented me with two squashes. One was the common football-size butternut that weighs down shopping bags at this time of year. The other had the same shape but was about as big as a sparrow. I held it in my palm. It felt good in there. Without thinking about what I was doing, I began petting it. The couple at the next table asked if they could see my tiny squash, and I let them stroke its smooth, cool skin. Before things got too weird, our server took my pet squash back to the kitchen.  When it came back, it had been roasted and cut in half. Specks of white pepper and strands of grated chestnut lay against its dark orange insides. It was sweeter than a normal butternut, but what I mostly noticed was that it tasted squashier, as if all the flavor had been compressed. Selective breeding was responsible, our server explained. Dan Barber, Blue Hill’s executive chef and a co-owner with his brother, David, had asked a Cornell agriculture professor to design a squash for him, making it as small and tasty as possible. The result is the 898 squash, served exclusively at Mr. Barber’s two restaurants, Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., and this one, just off Washington Square Park. Mr. Barber opened the one in Manhattan first, in 2000, with the idea of using local seasonal produce, including some from his family’s farm in the Berkshires. This put him in the company of, oh, several hundred other chefs. A few years later, though, he was chosen to lead an ambitious project at Stone Barns that combined a farm and a restaurant with research and education programs. It turned out that he was born for the job. Patient, intense, curious, enthusiastic, articulate, Mr. Barber has become a dirt poet and kitchen philosopher whose time outside with the pigs and the beans has had a deep, lasting effect on the way he cooks. Today no other chef has the information he keeps in his head (how to make pure carbon out of a cow’s femur) or the vegetables he puts in his ovens (sparrow-size squash).  To get the Full Barber, you have to go to Stone Barns for a $198 menu-free, open-ended meal that may include, if you’re lucky, a tour of the manure shed where hot compost is put to work as cooking fuel. The original Blue Hill sits in the English basement of a townhouse in Greenwich Village, a historically tolerant neighborhood whose tolerance does not extend to manure sheds. The city doesn’t afford the time or space for the leisurely unfurling of Mr. Barber’s complete vision of how our appetites should fit into the land and the climate. The low-ceilinged space is too much like a saloon, the tables too close together, the restaurant’s many ardent admirers too accustomed to treating it as a place to catch up over an excellent weeknight dinner.  If Blue Hill had as many cooks and servers as its more favored sister upstate, they would probably iron out wrinkles like the long, stranded layovers between courses; the wineglasses that sat empty and were finally cleared with no offer of fresh ones; and the $23 glass of Rully poured ice-cold, so it was clenched and astringent. It also seems far out of character that this intensely local restaurant sells just two New York wines on its Francophilic (and not very value-minded) list, and that its only cider comes from California when there is a cider revival going on in Mr. Barber’s own, apple-rich state.  But while it may give you only a Half Barber, Blue Hill is still an exceptional restaurant. Mr. Barber’s long search for flavor out of town pays off downtown, where you find yourself thinking, again and again, that each new ingredient may well be the best example of its kind you’ve ever tasted. For this reason and others, Blue Hill is one of the few New York restaurants that seem to get better and more original as time goes by. This was true the last time it was reviewed in The New York Times, in 2006, when Frank Bruni brought it from two stars to three, and it is true now. Dinner at Blue Hill can go in one of two directions: a four-course, $85 menu that you choose, or a longer, free-form “farmer’s feast” chosen by Mr. Barber or his chef de cuisine, Shingoon Hong, for $98 or $125, depending on how hungry the farmer is. Either way, the night will include a couple of surprise cameos by fruits and vegetables that drop in like the kooky neighbors in a sitcom.  A meal in September started with wispy young fennel stalks that had a clean and pure licorice sweetness and ended with firm, green-skinned, yellow-fleshed plums on ice. Both made me happy I had come to Blue Hill then, not a week sooner or later, which is the effect that certain fruits and vegetables can have when they’re picked at the right time. In a more recent meal, the kitchen sent out a raw hakurei turnip as big as an apple. In fact, it had been pushed through an apple slicer. I picked up a white wedge, swiped it through a pool of tarragon vinaigrette and braced for the harsh turnip aftertaste that never came. I won’t tell you that I ate the whole thing, or that it was as sweet and juicy as an apple, but it came much closer than I would have thought possible. When it comes to actual cooking, Mr. Barber’s approach is to intensify ingredients that are pretty intense already. Looking at the saturated orange color of fat slabs of roasted carrot “cutlet,” I could tell it was going to taste richer and rounder than any carrot I had met before. The approach works on things that once had a pulse, too. Grass-fed, dry-aged veal, carved into a sampler of cuts, some fattier, some leaner, was ruddier and more bloody-tasting than most veal, but it still had a focused, refined taste that set it apart from beef. The caramelized outside edge of a slowly roasted neck from a Blue Hill Farm goat had a profoundly satisfying chew; the meat hiding under it was astoundingly tender and juicy. It had some of the primal pleasures of barbecue, and I wanted to tear into it with my hands. In the early days of Blue Hill, I respected the cooking but didn’t want to wallow around in it the way I do now. The whole complicated web that Mr. Barber oversees has many purposes, spinning off in all directions, but if you just sit down to dinner, you can believe that the point of the entire operation is to provide you with one delicious taste after another. And maybe it is.",Menu changes daily.

The concrete tops are polished smooth with beeswax, and the sides are edged with copper. The shapes look irregular, but the sides are slightly bowed so that a pair of two-tops can spoon against each other and become a four-top. “That’s the idea, anyway,” our server said. “But they don’t all fit together.” Blenheim is like that, too. A tremendous amount of thought and effort has gone into the food, drinks and design, but they don’t always connect. This seems to have been an issue since the beginning. The first chef left about three weeks in because of what the owners called “irreconcilable differences.” In July, they hired Ryan Tate, who had been the chef at Le Restaurant in TriBeCa until it suddenly closed. I admired the $100 set menus he served there enough that I happily gave the place two stars in a review last year. Mr. Tate has set his ambitions even higher this time. Besides a sizable à la carte menu, he offers a $115, nine-course tasting loaded with extra dishes. At times, his cooking is as thoughtful and transporting as it was at Le Restaurant, but with a higher degree of intricacy. At other times, the kitchen is obviously struggling to keep up. Meanwhile, the service runs the gamut from charming and slightly lost to nonexistent. On my first night there, the disparity between the two was the widest I had ever seen in any restaurant. That is not the only disconnect. When tables are set up outside next to the cobblestone streets, Blenheim looks as if its only desire is to be your drop-in-and-hang-out corner tavern. The dining room, with an antique tree saw, a wooden yoke and a whole array of carpentry tools on the walls, looks like the historical society of some upstate village, where it would be the only tourist attraction. Underlining the point, servers tell you right away that this is a farm-to-table restaurant, that ingredients are trucked in from Blenheim Hill Farm in Schoharie County, southwest of Albany, owned by Mr. Sohlberg and his wife, Min Ye. You might reasonably expect pork cutlets, creamed corn, maybe pie. Mr. Tate has other ideas. Terrific ideas, often, even if they have as much business in a rusticated farm-to-table tavern as white tie and spats. The stream in Schoharie County where tilefish and sea urchin splash around together hasn’t been discovered yet, but at Blenheim they swim happily side by side on one plate. The tilefish falls into big, sweet white flakes that taste of shrimp. The urchin is whipped into a creamy, slightly briny sabayon that is like a richer, more luxurious taramosalata. Also on the plate are fat blueberries and carrots roasted in coffee bean oil. I can’t explain why blueberries taste so good with sea urchin sabayon, but they do. Alaskan king crab meat had been made almost as sweet and tender as some tropical fruit, but the midnight funk of squid ink sauce brought it back to the sea. With dense roasted chanterelles and wands of naturally pickled sea bean scattered around the plate, this was an appetizer you could go quietly crazy over. And it would take a crazy person to complain that Alaskan crab and sea urchin are insufficiently farm-to-table when they’re cooked this skillfully. Not that Mr. Tate turns his back on the owners’ land entirely. The carrots and the chanterelles come from Blenheim Hill Farm. So does the pork loin, which is slowly roasted until it drips with juices and then sent to the table with a cast of cool Southern characters: pickled peaches, okra charred to a crisp husk, and sorghum syrup, like molasses cut with espresso. Those are Blenheim lettuces and crunchy chips of smoked Blenheim ham in the gloriously crisp and fresh salad, and that’s creamy Blenheim pork fat spackling the side of the bowl. The lemon balm, thyme and pineapple sage in a sensational group of herb sorbets: Blenheim-grown. The gap between the farm-to-table ethos and Mr. Tate’s style is minor compared with the gulf between the restaurant Blenheim could be and the restaurant that currently sits at 283 West 12th Street. The same dish can be stunning one night and a contorted mess on another. The first time I had the roasted king mushrooms with spaetzle and sauerkraut, the mushroom stems had something like the flavor and texture of weisswurst. A German-inspired vegetarian main course with mushrooms standing in for sausages is a fantastic notion, and I couldn’t wait to taste it again when I returned. But when I did, the stems were watery inside and rubbery outside, like a steamed hot dog wrapped in a balloon. An unusual dessert soup of cooked barley and Champagne grapes in a chilled barley-jasmine tea went out of whack between visits, going from fascinating to weird. And there were glitches that were surprising in such a technique-focused kitchen. The grapefruit pearls with cured Tasmanian sea trout were meant to burst with juice, but they had solidified. Eating them was like chewing on the drippings of a grapefruit-scented candle. On Blenheim’s better nights, I might have ranked the food among the most exciting and interesting I’ve eaten in the last year. But it came to the table so very, very slowly that it was hard to stay excited or interested. It took more than three hours one night to order and eat appetizers, main courses and desserts. I wondered if the kitchen was overwhelmed. I was sure our server was. We had to flag him down to ask for more of the soft, warm and yeasty rolls made with Cheddar and Marmite. They never came. It took two tries and about 20 minutes to get a second glass of wine. We were left alone with menus for three-quarters of an hour before we waved like drowning sailors and begged him to take our order. “There are some additions to the menu tonight,” he began. Additions? When the kitchen can’t send out more than one course an hour, the menu needs subtractions. And Blenheim has no business offering nine-course tastings unless it is ready to provide pajamas and sleeping bags. Maybe its pieces would fit together better if there weren’t so many of them. I hope so, because I’d like to see it transform itself from a puzzle to a restaurant.",Roasted beets with black-currant bavarois; Blenheim salad; pork loin with charred okra; tilefish with sea urchin sabayon; herb sorbets; corn cremeux; chocolate ganache.

They’ll call us.” This was the grim report from inside the latest East Village restaurant to have turned its no-reservations policy into a viral marketing campaign. A small, hungry mob was gathering on the sidewalk. Hoping to find a pleasant place to drink and snack until the phone rang, I herded my group to Huertas, a new Basque-leaning tapas place a few blocks away. The room smelled like garlic and smoke. A cured pig’s leg sat at the end of the bar, its ankle held tightly in a clamp. A sharp knife had exposed its interior architecture of meat and fat and sinew. Later, we ordered a few slices of this Iberico ham, and as it melted on our tongues, warm and salty, we all traded looks. We did it again when we ate crumbly shards of aged manchego that tasted of brown butter and caramel. The looks meant: This kitchen knows where to get the good stuff. That applied to many things we ate that night. Jonah Miller, Huertas’s chef, has written a concise menu of Basque-inspired tapas, not all of which could be called cooking and a fair amount of which is canned. I am not revealing any secrets here. Some food is still in its can when it comes to the table, like the dense mackerel in olive oil, which we ate, happily, on sliced baguettes with pimentón aioli. “All the best Basque seafood goes straight into cans,” our server told us, and she was so convincing that we asked if she knew a store that sold these marvelous cans. She did. She also knew where we could buy the manchego, which she was as excited about as we were. From the front door to the table, our service had been proactively friendly and enthusiastic. In New York, servers who learn that night’s menu are rare enough; here was one who seemed to know everything about every ingredient. She told us about a restaurant in San Sebastián, where the chef had come out of the kitchen to point out the most delicious parts of a turbot, showing her how to scoop out his favorite part, the cheeks. Then she took a deep breath and said: “Spain, you guys.”  It wasn’t all cans and hams in Mr. Miller’s kitchen, not that I would have minded. We asked for something called Huertas rotos, which turned out to be the Basque dish huevos rotos interpreted as a kind of pasta dish. Skinny threads of potato were cooked al dente and tossed with chorizo and its oil, with a soft-cooked egg on top. It was gone in 30 seconds. We drank vermouth, made on site, while every few minutes somebody came around with a tray of small bites straight from the kitchen. There was egg salad on a slice of baguette, with a sweet red shrimp on top; a golden croqueta of rice with creamy mushrooms in the center; and sweet roasted piquillo peppers stuffed with a cheesy, porky froth of fresh sausage whipped into goat cheese. These came in single servings that you could take or decline, depending on how good they looked and how hungry you were. Each plate you took was marked down on a card, dim-sum style, by servers.  Huertas calls these items pintxos, a Basque term for snacks smaller than tapas and pinned together with a toothpick. In Spain, pintxos do not circulate like dim sum. (Mr. Miller got the idea from State Bird Provisions in San Francisco.) Yet we felt much closer to the Spanish tapas-bar spirit than if we had ordered 10 or 15 “small plates meant for sharing” at once, passed them around the table and called it dinner. This is rarely a satisfying way to eat, but it’s how many Spanish restaurants in New York deal with tapas. The Huertas modified dim-sum approach was perfect for people like us, who want to start with drinks and see how the night goes without being forced to turn tapas into dinner.  The way this night went was that by the time the other restaurant called, we didn’t want to leave.  I went back to Huertas a week or two later. I had made reservations for the small, square back dining room, where Mr. Miller serves a set menu for $55. In the front room, the plates are unconnected episodes, and you supply the narrative yourself. In the back, you settle in while Mr. Miller tells a story in five courses. He started with a nod to the front room, a plate of little bites. There were gildas, found in every tapas bar in San Sebastián, sharp, clean and salty skewers of white anchovy threaded with spicy green pepper and an olive. There was a blistered mound of Padrón peppers and garlic shrimp on toothpicks, too, not the sweetest or firmest I’d ever eaten. This was an anomaly; in general, the cooking at Huertas stands out for its pure, fresh flavors. Then a separated egg. The white, fried, lay under a jumble of corn and tomatoes cooked quickly with crisp-chewy pimentón-cured bacon. The yolk, raw, sat on top and served as sauce.  Next was skate, sweet and still a little juicy inside, with roasted turnips and a pale-green, herbaceous sauce of puréed turnip greens and fennel. The seasonal Greenmarket aesthetic was familiar to me. Would any Basques recognize the dish? They would know the next course, wonderful garlic-and-pimentón-scented lamb hot dogs called chistorra, even though they would be used to seeing chistorras made with pork or beef. Alongside these house-made sausages, Mr. Miller had a wonderful succotash of late-summer beans. Dessert was a dream, a round and closely packed little goat-cheese cheesecake with a topping of candied almonds instead of a bottom crust. More tangy than sugary, the cake took beautifully to a sauce made from ripe nectarines. This night and a later one made it clear that dinner in Huertas’s back room ranks among the best deals in town, up there with the how-do-they-do-it bargains at Contra and Delaware & Hudson. Mr. Miller shapes his menus so skillfully that it’s hard to imagine wanting more. Still, once the familiar conventions of the modern tasting menu kicked in, I did steal a few looks at the front room, where a tray of hot croquetas always seemed to be going around. Maybe I wanted more spontaneity. Or maybe I just wanted a croqueta.","In front: Tapas; passed pintxos; meats; cheeses; canned seafood. In back, the menu offers no choices, but restricted diets are accommodated."

To know where we are, do you need to see the smeared pitchers of schmaltz on every table? Smell the chopped garlic on every steak? Hear the yip of the small child whose head hits the ceiling as he is hoisted on a chair by adults drunk on “Hava Nagila” and Stolichnaya? Did you think the person commanding the imaginary visitors from North Korea to get up and dance the hora was the maître d’hôtel of Per Se? No, the only possible setting is Sammy’s Roumanian Steakhouse, the most wonderful terrible restaurant in New York. What happens at Sammy’s doesn’t happen at other restaurants, and vice versa. The rest of the Lower East Side can obsess over filament light bulbs and salvaged barn beams; Sammy’s, virtually unchanged since opening in 1975, will be ready when fluorescents and drop ceilings make their triumphant return to fashion. Inside the dining room, lighted like a bail bondsman’s office in Detroit, are hundreds of faded business cards, yellowed newspaper clippings and curled snapshots taped and tacked to every surface. Outside on Chrystie Street, scaffolding obscures the faded red and yellow painted signs in front of the building, which looks as if it has been marked for demolition. Like a Mississippi juke joint, Sammy’s seems to have been put together under the theory that nobody is likely to stay sober long enough to inspect the décor. (Known for selling vodka bottles encased in ice, Sammy’s is New York’s original bottle-service restaurant, and still the only tolerable one.) Other steakhouses can drive themselves crazy over internal temperatures. At Sammy’s, the meat will be cooked. If you have something more specific in mind, if you want it medium or black and blue, then write your request on a sheet of paper, tear it into small pieces and throw them into the air when the piano player sings “Happy Birthday.” Two times I asked for garlic-smeared skirt steak, called Romanian tenderloin at Sammy’s, cooked medium rare. One steak arrived medium well, and the other time a single steak ranged from well done to bloody, and every degree in between. I wasn’t asked how I wanted a broiled veal chop. It was seared on the outside and raw inside, the way other places serve tuna. When nobody asked how I wanted sweetbreads broiled, I feared the worst. Another surprise: Scored and blackened on top, they were close to perfect. The servers follow a template unique to this restaurant, too, dressed in Sammy’s T-shirts and jeans with a dishrag swinging from one pocket. Speed trumps ceremony. Standing over a metal bowl of chopped liver, they pour a cascade of schmaltz from on high, go at the liver with forks to mix in the shredded radishes, fried onions and lumps of fried chicken skin, and do not necessarily notice the stray bits that escape the bowl and land on the table. The ritual ends, not with “bon appétit” or “enjoy your meal” but with, “O.K., start eating.” The classic style of waiting tables at Lower East Side Jewish restaurants, by turns cranky, funny and crankily funny (discerning one from another could take decades of practice) probably died with Ratner’s, but flashes of it still surface at Sammy’s. One night, when we kept asking our server if we’d ordered enough, he rolled his eyes, checked his watch and said, “Tell you what: If you’re still hungry, the Chinese food will be here at 9:30.” Hungry we weren’t. As always at Sammy’s, I walked out feeling as if I had eaten a football stuffed with chicken fat and beef. The kitchen, so unpredictable when it comes to meat temperatures, is absolutely consistent in its ability to produce starch that detonates inside the stomach. The fried kreplach are grenades of dough with a tiny core of chopped meat that tastes like dough, too. The latkes are flavorless and textureless, but not weightless. Better than either, the kishke could stand some gravy and some salt. In fact, with the exception of the grandmotherly sweet-and-sour stuffed cabbage, almost everything at Sammy’s needed salt. Once it was added freely, the chopped liver was beyond reproach, the skirt steaks and lamb chops were excellent, and the fried silver-dollar potatoes were worth talking about. I can’t figure out why Sammy’s is cutting back on sodium after all these years, unless it is suddenly trying to atone for decades of treating schmaltz as a dietary supplement. The menu is less distinctively Romanian than it once was. The last review of Sammy’s in The New York Times, written by Mimi Sheraton in 1982, praised the Romanian salad of whipped eggplant with green peppers; the broiled brains; the mush steak; the pitcha, a seasoned gelatin made from calves’ feet and garlic; and the baked unborn eggs. The recent menus, stapled inside manila folders as they have been since the Koch administration, haven’t offered any of these specialties. This is how a culture disappears. But if Romania has faded, Sammy’s is still loudly, raucously, endlessly, embracingly Jewish, a permanent underground bar mitzvah where Gentiles can act like Jews and Jews can act like themselves. One night, I went with a woman who had spent the summer in Europe, as synagogues and Jewish-owned shops burned in one city after another. In Sammy’s basement, when strangers joined their hands in the air and danced between the tables, eyeing our food as they passed, I could see her grow less tense every minute. “It feels so good to be back in a place where I can be out,” she finally said. And if this is not your heritage — if you aren’t quite sure what is happening when the man at the keyboard belts out “Sing us a song, you’re the schmatte man” — the entertainers at Sammy’s will still get to you. Dancing and singing along to some dumb old tune being played by a musician in the corner: This is how people had fun in the Old World, by which I don’t mean just the parts of Europe where the Lower East Side’s Jews came from, but also the world before amplifiers and apps and first-person-shooter video games and all the forms of entertainment that drive us into ourselves. Sammy’s forces you out of yourself; I don’t think there’s another restaurant in New York where people talk to strangers as readily as they do here. “Would you like me to take your picture?” somebody at the next table asked one night. “Do you want our seltzer charger for your egg creams?” another asked us. As a table of about two dozen people filed out, a woman in the back called to them, “Thank you for dancing with us!” Is this a three-star restaurant, as Mimi Sheraton thought in 1982? By today’s standards, of course not. It is closer to one. But if you need stars to tell you what to think of Sammy’s, I’m not sure I want to share my seltzer charger with you. I’ll give it to those nice North Korean Jews instead.",Pickles; roasted green peppers; chopped liver Sammy’s style; stuffed cabbage; broiled sweetbreads; Roumanian tenderloin; do-it-yourself egg creams.

Today, that seems less like the end of an epoch than a salutary cooling-off period.  If you are having trouble getting a reservation at a new place this year, odds are high that the menu is speckled with accents grave, acute and circumflex. Dirty French is turning away customers at the door. Keith McNally sent frogs’ legs marching to the rescue at Cherche Midi after his pizzeria there fizzled. And just north of Washington Square Park, at an address that had started to look like a certain restaurant-killer, the doors at a new Provençal spot called Claudette have been thrown open to reveal closely packed rattan chairs, none of them empty. Claudette’s charms are many and begin with those doors, which replace the woebegone sidewalk enclosure that used to make it look as if nobody were home. Losing a few seats has made reservations harder to land, but the reward is that the doors have let in the atypically cool breezes all summer, along with a view of lower Fifth Avenue’s wide, leisurely sidewalks, where somebody is always walking a bichon frisé.  Inside, Claudette looks like an expensive summer rental that is being used as a French street-corner cafe. (Rattan connects the two motifs.) The beach rental aesthetic is supplied by the whitewashed tables, throw pillows and shelves lined with books that are arranged by color and separated by anonymous knickknacks. Contributing to the cafe look are the compact bar and the winning cast of aperitif cocktails, which all seem to be named after Roger Vadim’s wives. Small, gentle and very appealing, the Brigitte and her cohorts cheerfully buck the trend toward potent, convoluted cocktails that don’t know how to behave at the dinner table.  Claudette’s food follows the example of the aperitifs; it is light, approachable and unlikely to impair your ability to stand up at the end of the meal. If you are in the mood for an intelligent salad, Claudette has plenty: green beans and vinegared hearts of palm with heaps of fresh mint; a nest of freshly shredded zucchini, still crisp under its anchovy vinaigrette; a crunch-fest of raw radishes and snap peas tugged in an unexpected, intriguing direction by cumin.  Even less expected was the cinnamon-laced raz al hanout spice blend dusted on the bistro-style fries. More brushes with North Africa lay ahead. Claudette makes an unleavened, layered flatbread, similar to traditional kesra, that is good when hot from the griddle, especially with a thick smear of pistou. (I couldn’t see the point of another spread, the bland and expensive hummus with chopped truffles.)  Gradually, it becomes clear that Claudette’s chef, Wade Moises, and chef de cuisine, Koren Grieveson, have made a smart decision about Provence. Rather than treating it as if it were frozen in time and sealed off from the world — Peter Mayle’s “A Year in Provence” repeated forever — they cast a few glances at the North African immigrants who live and cook there.  Claudette’s owners, Carlos Suarez and Mark Barak, were traveling in Provence when, like many English-speaking tourists, they fell under the sunny spell of Lourmarin. They had a charmed meal in that town at a restaurant founded by Claudette Sammut, a Frenchwoman who lived in Tunisia until the 1950s. Before it was over, they had asked her family if they could take her name back to Manhattan.  They brought her bouillabaisse, too, an eccentric white version that has a puff-pastry hat and lemon juice but no tomatoes and an undetectable quantity of saffron. I was not as smitten by its tenaciously sour broth as they were. As a sauce for the monkfish, baby octopus and shellfish, it might get by, but as a soup, it lost its appeal after a few spoonfuls, and even sooner the time it was oversalted.  A somewhat more successful souvenir from Lourmarin is the pieds paquets. Traditionally an all-day stew of sheep’s trotters and tripe, it has been de-trottered for New Yorkers. Or, as a server with an oratorical flair put it, “we absented the feet for cleanliness of flavor.” What we get instead are tripe-wrapped bundles of pork shoulder braised in white wine and tomatoes. Tender but polite, they are upstaged by the grilled bread, fantastic when dunked in the expanse of rust-colored sauce. As the absented feet suggest, Claudette’s exploration of Provence can be undercut by its impulse to play it safe, to water down the pastis. Braised chicken thighs on a bed of nutty toasted bulgur arrive in a tagine, but they aren’t cooked in one. When servers lift the glazed lid, the mint and other aromatics don’t rush into your lungs the way they would in Tangier. The tiny dab of harissa doesn’t go far, either. But the chicken is moist and well browned, the sauce gets sunny Mediterranean sweetness from oranges, and for complexity and originality, the dish leaves the other main courses in the shade.  After making its opening moves so gracefully, Claudette grows oddly clumsy at the end. The most reliable dessert is the pistachio cake sandwiching a layer of citrus cream, smartly accompanied by candied orange peel. But a chocolate pot de crème with harissa was grainy, and a supposed bread pudding of chocolate-almond croissants looked and tasted exactly like a stack of stale pastries.  Most of the time, though, the kitchen does what it sets out to do, even if it seems to be holding back. If Mr. Moises and Ms. Grieveson choose to dive a bit deeper into their vision of an African-tinged Provence, they could make the Gallic revival more interesting by cleaning the dusty windows of nostalgia through which New Yorkers like to view French cuisine.

182,Barchetta,1 star,"Sept. 9, 2014",Pete Wells,Chelsea,"Italian, Seafood",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/dining/restaurant-review-barchetta-in-chelsea.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/dining/restaurant-review-barchetta-in-chelsea.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"You can count on one hand the chefs in New York who serve bluefish. Narrow the list to those with the confidence to serve it raw, and you’re probably down to one finger and one name: Dave Pasternack. The challenges of bluefish are formidable. If it isn’t iced right after it’s hooked, if it isn’t killed and chilled properly, if too much time goes by before it arrives at the table, bluefish has a habit of tasting and smelling like discount cat food. Its flavor is strong but its flesh is soft, and when it is raw, a dull, unsteady knife can reduce it to a bruise-colored pulp.  Of course I had to have it when I spotted it under the crudo section of the menu at Barchetta, which Mr. Pasternack opened in Chelsea in April. And of course it was immaculate: firm slabs of bluefish, standing at attention on a cold plate with olive oil, a few drops of lemon juice and inky green shreds of caper leaves. The rich oils melted while I chewed, and I was convinced that this particular specimen must have been slashing through the Atlantic while I had been brewing that morning’s coffee. In 14 years as the chef at Esca, Mr. Pasternack has proved to be one of the city’s most resourceful and skillful seafood cooks. It goes without saying that Barchetta, where Mr. Pasternack’s partner is John Meadow and his chef de cuisine is Christian Goerner, is a seafood restaurant. It is a very good one at times, but not at all times. There were encouraging nights, including the one that started with raw bluefish, when I was sure that Barchetta would become one of the first places I’d send people who really love the taste of fish. And there was one when it seemed mired among all the also-rans. Inconsistency in a seafood restaurant presents a quandary. Great ones are rare enough that seafood lovers will feel a strong tug to check out Barchetta and hope for the best, but they’ll also be tempted to stay away out of fear that they’ll hit it on an off night. This is not a problem that plagues diners who simply want a grilled pork chop. Fish cooking tends to be an all-or-nothing game, though. An extra day between the ocean and the table or an extra minute in the sauté pan can mean the difference between a memorable dinner and a wasted evening. The chefs who understand the factors that make that difference, and can navigate them, are in shorter supply than bluefin tuna.  I knew I was in the hands of one of those chefs on my first and second meals at Barchetta. Monkfish liver was treated like foie gras, darkly seared on the outside but as wobbly as pudding within. On the side were figs roasted into a jam-jar sweetness. The idea was both obvious and inspired.  The crudi were just the way I remembered them from Esca. Each fish was carved with a sushi chef’s sensitivity to fish anatomy, then given only as much added flavor as it could handle. To bring out the minerality and sweetness of pink snapper, there were plum-red grains of sea salt blended with Long Island merlot. Subtle, supple halibut belly was splashed with sunflower oil that was so mild it almost wasn’t there. Golden spotted bass, slightly more forceful, was given a light application of olive oil and lemon, while bluefish got a similar treatment but in the stronger dose that it needed. Main courses like wonderfully rich grilled kingfish steak, a roasted whole black sea bass and a bread-crumb-crusted hunk of pumpkin swordfish were pulled from the heat precisely at the moment their thickest sections had firmed, before they had a chance to seize up into a tough fist that would chase away their sweet oceanic juices.  On the night when the kitchen seemed to fall behind the beat, though, the skin on a grilled Spanish mackerel was too severely charred and the flesh had been heated a few degrees beyond the ideal. Toasted cracked hazelnuts and orange sections helped make up for it, and the dish wouldn’t have raised eyebrows in most other restaurants, but it lacked the finesse that I knew by then Barchetta is capable of. A handsome, thick cut of cobia had been left on the grill until it had the first signs of squeaky overdoneness and the grate had burned the bread-crumb coating. Raw blackfish dotted with pine-bud syrup was tougher than the crudi had been on other nights. Some greens in a relentlessly dull salad were showing their age. A bowl of pasta with mullet bottarga was swimming in olive oil that took the crunch right out of the toasted bread crumbs. A few excellent dishes surfaced from the murk, like the gently fried spearing and the appetizer of velvety marinated herring with raisins and cauliflower. The evening’s most memorable dish was a grilled lamb porterhouse, though, which says less about the lamb than about the kitchen’s struggles landing its catch. When dinner is less than transfixing, you have time to notice how incoherent Barchetta’s dining room is. Gone are the nightclub intimacy of Bette and the Riviera sparkle of Bistro La Promenade, the last two tenants. In their place is a mishmash of ideas: old nautical flags hanging beside new art from Chelsea galleries; Danish modern chairs mixed with tan simulated leather banquettes that would suit a Midtown coffee shop. On good nights, you’re more likely to notice how thoughtful the service is. Setting the tone is the outstanding rosemary focaccia that shows up while you’re still scanning the menu. Assistance with the wine list, about half Italian and priced to sell, is quick to arrive, too, and unusually perceptive. The general manager and wine director, George Hock, always seemed to know what my table wanted, translating a few vague adjectives and a not-so-vague price limit into a bottle that was just what we were looking for and then some.  At a fairly casual restaurant like Barchetta, wine service of this caliber is a gift. The total check, of course, is no gift, but it is very fair for fish at a place that never stoops to flabby farmed salmon. Barchetta could still turn out to be the seafood restaurant that downtown needs. If a nautical flag were flying over Barchetta’s door on West 23rd Street, it would be the one that means “Proceed, but exercise caution.”",Crudi; charred octopus; grilled and roasted fish; lamb porterhouse; fingerling potatoes with garlic; fruit crostata.

I’ve always argued that a good chef won’t let that happen, but I have to admit that it does seem true for a lot of Italian restaurants, at least in New York City. There are exceptions, of course, but as a general rule, it’s all downhill after the spaghetti. One of several reasons to like Bar Primi, Andrew Carmellini’s new restaurant at East Second Street and the Bowery, is that there is almost nothing on the menu but appetizers and pasta. You can eat all the things you go to Italian places for without ordering a $35 grilled salmon simply to prove that you know fusilli is not considered a main course in Milan.  Mr. Carmellini and his partners (Josh Pickard, Luke Ostrom and Sal Lamboglia) have not exactly discovered life on Mars with this concept. After all, this is the founding principle of cheap Italian restaurants across the country. It’s unusual, though, to see it endorsed by a chef who knows better. Pasta is the whole point of Porsena, which the chef Sara Jenkins calls her “pasta-centric restaurant,” as you know if you’ve had the firm, chewy rings of anneloni tossed with fiery lamb sausage and bitter greens. But then her menu proceeds to a full roster of secondi. To be fair, Mr. Lamboglia, a longtime Carmellini cook who leads the kitchen at Bar Primi, does offer one main course a night on a weekly rotation. (On Wednesday, it’s the Italian sausage served at Mr. Carmellini’s Sausage Boss kiosks in Madison Square Garden.) Each time I was there, the servers also pushed a special, a grilled branzino “muffaletta,” which they said meant the fish comes with chopped green olives, like the sandwich. I ordered it once. It was fine. I preferred the pasta. The menu divides them into “traditional” and “seasonal.” We would be here for hours if I tried to figure out what is seasonal about orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe, a widely known classic from Southern Italy, or which tradition gave us spaghetti with a sauce inspired by clams casino. The important thing to notice is that there are 12 choices in all, and one of them is almost certain to be exactly what you feel like eating.  For me, on almost any given night, that would be the linguine with golden bread crumbs and garlic that’s been slapped around in hot olive oil for a minute or so. It may be because the kitchen is using this season’s garlic, but the sliced cloves (four of them, the menu says) tasted as juicy and fresh as corn and, in their oniony way, almost as sweet. For this, I paid $14 and counted myself lucky. Spaghetti pomodoro, also $14, is just as uncomplicated and just as right, with green basil clinging to plum tomatoes cooked to the halfway point between fruit and sauce.  Mr. Lamboglia makes those dishes with dried imported noodles. Most of the other pasta is fresh and very good. Its finest use may be the fiore di carciofi, a long, fat spiral filled with creamy artichoke and mascarpone. The sauce (a hot ladleful of fried bacon, garlic, chopped parsley and white wine) works mysteriously well with this mutant, vaguely flower-shaped cannelloni.  Bar Primi applies its sauces more liberally than a place in Parma might. Italian verisimilitude is not the goal. Mr. Carmellini and Mr. Lamboglia, who was raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, by a father who cooked for years in restaurants on and off Mulberry Street, have given the menu a red-sauce generosity, even when the sauces aren’t red.  Sal’s Antipasti Salad is basically an antipasto sampler of the kind usually seen on a checkered tablecloth — sliced salami and provolone, raw celery and radishes — thrown into a tossed salad with a small blizzard of Parmigiano-Reggiano. It’s impossible to dislike. Shrimp and octopus with boiled potatoes and pickled cherry peppers make a cold seafood salad that few checkered-tablecloth joints could rival. There are even meatballs filled with melted fontina in a rough tomato sauce. You want them to taste handmade, honest and delicious. They do. Grilled broccolini dressed with stewed onions and Aleppo pepper sits on a shiny, smooth brick-colored emulsion. It looks creamy and soothing. It is fierce, fiery and garlic-drenched, a fantastic trick played by the kitchen.  The menu has minor dips but no major sinkholes. That disassembled clams casino over spaghetti could do with more clams and less cleverness. The day I had orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe, the divots of dough weren’t as shiny with pork fat and olive oil as they might have been.  The idea for Bar Primi came to Mr. Carmellini years ago, before he left A Voce and built his fief of a half-dozen restaurants in New York and one in Miami. The chance to do it finally came along when Peels quietly shuffled out of business this year. Taavo Somer, an owner of that restaurant, was hired to rework his Peels design, mixing domestic idioms like white paneling and mullioned windows at tree-branch height with rustic Italian motifs, like wine shelves of unfinished wood. The result is an inviting, civilized spot, one that reaches back over the Bowery’s skid-row period to the brief age when the East Village was on Edith Wharton’s map of New York society. Within Mr. Carmellini’s fleet, Bar Primi is more a neighborhood hangout in the spirit of the Dutch than a big, booming circus like Locanda Verde or Lafayette. Like all of those places, and unlike the stereotypical linguine slinger, Bar Primi has a deeply affordable wine list you could happily get lost in. Off topic for a linguine slinger but very much on topic for a hangout, there is at all hours a great hot roast beef sandwich, shaved thin and kicked into action with spicy red pepper sauce. So sure of itself it is known simply as the Sandwich, it deserves to join the venerable epitomes of the genre found at Brennan & Carr and Roll-n-Roaster in Brooklyn. New Yorkers who have watched Mr. Carmellini’s game throughout his career may complain that he now rarely drives to the basket for the spectacular dunks he used to throw down when he was coached by Daniel Boulud. I made that complaint myself about the unimaginative, stubbornly un-French cooking at Lafayette when it opened. But a well-timed layup like Bar Primi can win games, too.

184,Bâtard,3 star,"Aug. 26, 2014",Pete Wells,TriBeCa,Modernist,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/dining/restaurant-review-batard-in-tribeca.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/dining/restaurant-review-batard-in-tribeca.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"A few minutes into my first dinner at Bâtard, it became obvious that the chef, Markus Glocker, has a sniper’s accuracy at the stove. Nothing on his gracefully composed plates was chewier or crunchier or softer or saltier than it wanted to be. Mr. Glocker’s kitchen chops were not exactly a surprise, given that he worked in Vienna for Heinz Reitbauer, in Chicago for Charlie Trotter and in London and New York for Gordon Ramsay, none of them ever known to have smiled indulgently at a young cook and said: “Don’t worry about burning those onions, kid. The customers won’t notice.”  Technical prowess is a fine thing for a chef to have, but it’s no guarantee of memorable, expressive cooking, just as a big vocabulary doesn’t necessarily mean an author will write books worth reading. In both cases, you need to have something to say.  Mr. Glocker has many things to say, and he says them clearly and with charm, as I learned over three excellent meals since Bâtard opened in May. Some dishes were so successful they seemed destined never to leave the menu. One was the springtime-sweet bowl of minted pea soup with fried sweetbreads that seemed more flavorful than anybody else’s sweetbreads. Another was a kind of bouillabaisse in which rabbit (a roasted loin, a perfectly cooked kidney and saffron ravioli with a light and delicately herbed rabbit filling) splashed around in the tomato-fennel-saffron broth. A month later, both dishes had been retired, and in their place was something new and just as wonderful.  A fried zucchini flower, filled with bits of poached prawns and served with lightly candied lemon zest and whole pieces of poached lobster, was a full immersion in summer, a swim in a clear pond in the pines. A slab of octopus terrine, small circles of leg pressed together with smoky pastrami spices and dabbed with whole-grain mustard, evoked an entirely different terrain, nodding to the delicatessen, though the nuggets of braised ham hock, as rich and seductive as tuna belly, won’t be found at Katz’s.  The complexity of Mr. Glocker’s plates never blurs the focus of his flavors. Every drop of sauce and pinch of seasoning extracts some new pleasure out of the main ingredient. There is joy in his cooking. There are high spirits in Bâtard’s dining room, too, which hums and at times roars with the sound of people having a fine night on the town. This was not frequently heard during this restaurant’s last incarnation, Corton. Everyone whispered as if a baby were sleeping in the next room. Even Drew Nieporent, the avuncular saloonkeeper who has held the lease on this address since he opened it as Montrachet in 1985, seemed to tread across Corton’s carpet on tiptoes. The carpet is gone. Mr. Nieporent and his partners in Bâtard, Mr. Glocker and John Winterman, last seen as maître d’hôtel at Daniel, had it replaced with herringbone floorboards. The white tablecloths have been whisked away, too.  The architect Glen Coben gently raised the temperature on the interior that Stephanie Goto designed for Corton, which was elegant but aloof, more like a modern-art gallery than a restaurant. The walls that lean in and their twirling vines in bas-relief are flush with a tobacco-resin hue borrowed from Keith McNally’s crayon box. Banquettes that had been covered with scallion-green fabric are now dark leather and mohair.  If the bare tables and floors weren’t enough to raise the decibel level, the amount of drinking going on would. Mr. Glocker’s cooking plays well with others, and his flexible à la carte menu, with a choice of two courses ($55), three ($65) or four ($75), encourages you to get to know a bottle or two. For some drinkers, it will be impossible not to order Burgundy at a restaurant called Bâtard, and Jason Jacobeit, the head sommelier, is happy to oblige. Swimming alongside the white whales, the La Tâche and Romanée-Conti grand crus, are some lesser-known Burgundies at what are, by the region’s standards at least, reasonable prices. (The list, however, needs more bottles under $60, no matter where they come from.) Nonconformists will find blue-chip Napa Valley wines and a deep pocket of whites from Alsace, Germany and Austria, where Mr. Glocker was born. Bâtard is hardly a cruise down the beautiful blue Danube, but the kitchen can give you an excellent Viennese dinner in the form of the Poussin schnitzel, a special in perpetuity, and the Sacher torte, a special on occasion. Both are classical, the chef’s fingerprints visible only in details like the mouthwatering sea buckthorn jam and unaccountably exciting potato salad with the schnitzel. When Bâtard begins serving food at the bar, I suspect that every stool will be taken by a schnitzel-eater.  Full of ideas, Mr. Glocker comes up with the desserts, too. His caramelized milk bread with berries and brown-butter ice cream is already a certified hit, the song of the summer that radio failed to provide this year. A slice of white bread, rich like brioche, has been glazed on both sides with a shatteringly thin shell of melted sugar. It looks like the simplest thing in the world, but if it’s so simple, why isn’t everyone making it? Other desserts are good, but not so good that the restaurant can do without a full-time pastry chef forever. The flat-footed key lime pie should be repaired or replaced, and the poached fruit in a moat of sparkling wine was a little too Ladies Who Lunch for me. Mr. Winterman, the general manager, has put together a lovely little cheese cart, although he hasn’t figured out how to show it off. “We have several goat cheeses,” my server said one night. “Some cheese from France, of course. Some cheese from Vermont.” Finding this picture a little vague, I asked to see them. This seemed to catch him off guard. “I could bring the cart over,” he said, “but it would be a little tight with these tables.” The cheeses are much too good to be stranded on a landlocked cart. For now, you have to rely on Mr. Winterman to choose, and hope you’ve come on a night when he has the honey made by downtown bees who do their buzzing above a Shoegasm store.  There is another dance routine that needs practice. Maybe somebody imagined it would be fun for customers who get the vast, pink, terrific lamb chop to serve themselves lamb confit out of flame-colored Le Creuset pots. It’s an awkward fishing party. The confit is some kind of new achievement in flavor and tenderness, but to get it out of the pot, you have to lift your butt off the seat. A few cards have yet to fall into place, but Mr. Glocker and Mr. Winterman are reshuffling the deck to get a fresh combination of refined and relaxed dining, a game Mr. Nieporent has played for years. One night, Mr. Winterman showed me a cross-section of a tree trunk. (Neither he nor Mr. Nieporent pretended not to recognize me.) He thinks it would be fun to drag it out to the dining room and let customers test their skill at Hammerschlagen, a game Germans play with a hammer and nails. If the baby isn’t awake yet, that should do the trick.",Yellowfin tuna with marinated radish and quinoa; octopus “pastrami”; black olive tortellini; veal tenderloin; chicken schnitzel; lamb for two; caramelized milk bread.
185,Ivan Ramen,2 star,"Aug. 5, 2014",Pete Wells,Lower East Side,"American, Japanese",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/dining/restaurant-review-ivan-ramen.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/dining/restaurant-review-ivan-ramen.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Years from now, when PBS runs its six-part documentary about David Chang, Roy Choi and the other American chefs who over the last decade have cracked open Asian cooking traditions and hosed down the pieces with pork fat, I hope an episode will be devoted to the triple pork triple garlic mazemen at Ivan Ramen. The camera will pan majestically across “The Art of the Slurp,” Nathan Fox’s manga-style strip that hangs over the counter and starts with a fat boy in a Batman mask snapping his chopsticks apart, as a narrator intones: “In 2014, Ivan Orkin, a Long Island native who grew famous cooking ramen in Tokyo, opened his flagship restaurant on the Lower East Side.” The plucking of a samisen fades out; punk guitar chords clang; the screen is filled with a close-up of a noodle bowl. “Developed in Japan around the turn of the 21st century, mazemen is a drier variation on ramen, more like pasta than soup. Mr. Orkin dressed fresh whole-wheat noodles with a slab of simmered pork belly, chopped bacon and enough pork-bone stock to moisten the noodles. Then came the garlic: raw, pickled and roasted.” Cut to a heavyset, white-haired, unshaven, downtrodden man in pajamas, identified as a former restaurant critic for The New York Times. “Actually, there was a fourth pork and a fourth garlic in there,” he says. “Garlic oil and pork fat. Maybe Orkin thought ‘quadruple pork’ sounded too much like ‘quadruple bypass.’ Those ingredients could have gotten into a shouting match, but they were harmonious. It was like a summation of all the lard-wallowing and umami-slinging that had rippled through American food since the first drop of grease ran down the chin of the first customer who tried a Momofuku pork bun. I could eat a bowl of that mazemen right now, if they would let me have anything besides kale pellets.” Get that old guy off the screen. He’s bringing me down, though he’s right about the triple pork triple garlic mazemen. It’s an undeniably intense dish that shows how energetically and skillfully Mr. Orkin colors outside the lines of Japanese cuisine. Since Ivan Ramen opened in May, there is usually a line for the single restroom but rarely one to get in the door. Some of the pent-up steam in the ramen community may have escaped late last year, when Mr. Orkin opened Slurp Shop, in Gotham West Market. A quick-service counter with a noodle-dominated menu, Slurp Shop is a fine introduction to Mr. Orkin’s ramen philosophy (essentially, make everything — noodles, broth, droplets of fat on the surface of the soup — better), but not to his full breadth as a chef. For that, you need to go to Ivan Ramen, where he invests in creativity well outside the scope of standard ramenyas. Mr. Orkin supplements the noodles with dishes that cover many bases, though not the sweet one just yet. Desserts are promised down the line. As suggested by a dining-room collage made of hundreds of pictures of Asian and Western pop icons and foodstuffs, Mr. Orkin’s cultural allusions are quick and funny, and come from several directions at once. He makes a whacked-out vegetarian chili dog with fried tofu in place of the frank, a rich and intense stew of mushrooms and miso as the chili, and a squiggly line of American yellow mustard. (There’s no substitute for yellow mustard.) Called a Tofu Coney Island, it’s a joke that tastes great. That was true for the JFC, too: deep-fried chicken hearts and livers with a honey-mustard sauce that tasted similar enough to the traditional McNugget garnish to make me laugh, and different enough (sharper, stronger and enriched with ponzu) to make me want more. The Japanese borrowed ramen from China, and Mr. Orkin keeps up the custom. There is steamed Chinese broccoli with soy-pickled garlic, as well as a salad of crunchy daikon threads topped with spicy, funky XO sauce. On tables that could become laden with pork very quickly, each was a cool, welcome oasis. The pork tended to disappear as quickly as it arrived. True, the scrapple waffle, a takeoff on Japanese okonomiyaki, hadn’t moved beyond the gimmick stage; it was all crisp, bland surface without the peculiar bits of fat and face that excite scrapple fans and terrify everybody else. But the improbably fluffy tofu-pork meatballs catapulted themselves into my mouth at the slightest encouragement, and little do-it-yourself handrolls of nori spread with sushi rice and pulled roast pork, as slick and rich as carnitas, were gone almost before I noticed the bright, sweet-sour relief they got from roasted tomatoes. As our server promised, roasted tomato performed the same favor for a cheese mazemen, a kind of Japanese alfredo. Servers at Ivan Ramen are always pushing add-on garnishes for the noodles for an extra $2 or $3. “All our ramens are improved by an egg,” we were told one night. If Mr. Orkin thinks his ramen is better with an egg, he should put an egg on it, and charge accordingly. Value is a sticky issue with ramen. Because it is served in a minute and eaten almost as quickly, it seems to call for fast-food prices. It takes more than a minute to prepare, though, particularly at Ivan Ramen, where the noodles are made in the kitchen from rye or whole-wheat flour. Springy and hearty, they are exceptional. The broths are painstakingly simmered until their flavors are deep and focused, particularly in the vegetarian ramen’s soy-mushroom stock and the shio ramen’s base of dashi stirred into a golden chicken soup that a grandmother might want to steal credit for. The most expensive ramen is $15, or $17 with the suggested egg. The mazemens, a form Mr. Orkin has mastered more fully than anyone in the city, justify the price. (The red-hot cold mazemen, dressed with salty, spicy sesame and accessorized with two prawns, should settle any doubts.) The soup ramens do not, at least not yet. Several times, the broth arrived well below the scalding heat that gives ramen its temporal dimension, as you race to eat the noodles before they go from slightly undercooked to al dente to overdone. The soups at Ivan Ramen barely changed, so there was no rush, no need to illustrate the art of the slurp. Maybe mine sat too long in the kitchen. The ramens shouldn’t stop just short of the finish line when so many other items on the menu sail right over it.",Pickled daikon XO; Chinese broccoli and garlic; pork meatballs; JFC; Tofu Coney Island; roast pork musubi; triple pork triple garlic mazemen; vegetarian shoyu ramen; spicy red chile ramen.
186,Russ & Daughters Cafe,2 star,"July 29, 2014",Pete Wells,Lower East Side,Eastern European,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/dining/restaurant-review-russ-daughters-cafe.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/dining/restaurant-review-russ-daughters-cafe.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Because the kippered salmon, the slippery pink lengths of matjes herring and the shiny white sturgeon at the new Russ & Daughters Cafe are the same products you can take home from the old Russ & Daughters shop a few blocks away on East Houston Street, a cynic may say that the restaurant offers nothing more than an opportunity to eat the proprietors’ fish on their plates instead of yours.  To which I’d say: What’s wrong with that? The cafe, which opened in May, is modeled on the store, to an almost obsessive degree. Backlit signs in black and white proclaim the presence of sardines, chubs, rugelach and pickles by the barrel. Below the signs are boxes of matzo and jars of chocolate-covered jelly rings. In the center of the restaurant sides of salmon and whole, golden-skinned whitefish with their slit bellies pointing up wait in a refrigerated case until they are sliced to order by a counter worker in a white jacket, just as on Houston Street.  But Niki Russ Federman and her cousin Josh Russ Tupper, the fourth-generation owners of the family business, have added to, elaborated on and deviated from the store in ways that make the cafe a three-dimensional restaurant, not just a theme-park homage designed to cash in on the original’s popularity. Take, for example, the rye bread. Everybody talks about good Jewish rye but hardly anyone has tasted it. To get a rye that deserved to share the table with their smoked fish, the owners imported a baker from Massachusetts known for his artisan loaves, Gordon Weissman. His rye is dense and rugged, with a crisp, ragged crust, a sourdough depth and a generous strafing of seeds, not just caraway but also onion-scented nigella. Called shissel, the bread is as different from most ryes as bourbon is from light beer.  Or take the way that items the store is known for have been worked into the menu. Halvah is sold by the block, but shouldn’t be eaten that way. It should be eaten this way: broken into chewy bits and scattered over rich sesame ice cream along with salted caramel sauce and a spackling of sesame seeds.  Or take the new line of dishes from the Eastern European Jewish canon that are not sold at the store, like the baby knishes stuffed with potatoes and caramelized onions. Over the years the New York knish has become so dense it could be used as an anchor for a small boat. These little specimens are light and fluffy, and they taste not like flour and grease but like baked potatoes.  Or take the bar, situated by the front door on Orchard Street. How does a 100-year-old temple to sturgeon get into the cocktail trade? With a reimagined old-time soda fountain of the kind that would have blasted jets of seltzer into egg creams when Joel Russ, newly arrived from Galicia, in what is now Poland, was selling herring from the barrel on the Lower East Side. The white-jacketed bartender makes fresh cucumber soda, cherry shrubs, egg creams and excellent Bloody Marys.  He looks as if he belongs there, and the drinks, with Eastern European flavors like caraway, taste as if they belong, for the most part, although my egg cream was not as volcanically fizzy as it might have been. There is a small but well-considered wine list, too. The sparkling wines, especially the less expensive ones from outside Champagne, might have been made to go with smoked-fish platters like the Anne, which collects some of the store’s most luxurious treats on a briefcase-size board: its famous sable and Western nova smoked salmon, its underrated brook trout, its extraordinarily fine wild salmon roe and its “private stock” sturgeon. I asked our waiter what made it private stock.  “They get a lot of high rollers at the store, some very particular customers,” he said. “This one lady came in and asked for sturgeon, but when they started to slice it, she said: ‘No, no, no. I don’t want your regular sturgeon. I want your private stock.’ ” This private stock of sturgeon did not, as of yet, exist, but the slicer obligingly found her an unusually sleek specimen. From then on, the fattiest fish would be kept under the counter for customers who would not settle for the regular sturgeon. (As with many stories about Russ & Daughters, the waiter’s account has the ring of folk legend. When I asked Jen Snow, who has the title of Yenta at the company, whether it was historically accurate, her response was long and began with “Oy vey.”) At the restaurant, private-stock sturgeon is advertised but is still a high-roller item; the Anne platter goes for $90. The Anne feeds three or four people. And it does come with a basket of the excellent rye and other breads; a very good, crisp salad of thin-sliced potatoes with mustard; the house cream cheese, which sets the standard for the rest of the city; and all the usual fixings. Still, $90 is not bupkis, and it is not the only disconcerting price at Russ & Daughters Cafe.  Forget the caviar service, which starts at $105 for 50 grams of paddlefish and inclines swiftly from there. At the store, long admired for competitive prices on tins of fish eggs, the same 50 grams cost about half as much. The markups are an unpleasant surprise, and guarantee that for most value-minded diners, the caviar section of the menu will be strictly a curiosity.  At $60, the scrambled eggs with paddlefish caviar may seem like a more reasonable splurge. But when I had it, Mr. Weissman’s challah, although toasted, was going stale and the eggs didn’t have the voluptuousness achieved at, say, Jean-Georges. Some everyday items seem out of line, too, like $22 for four slices of sturgeon with butter, capers, tomatoes, onions and a serviceable bagel.  For most people, fish on a bagel may not be enough reason to go to a restaurant at night. Russ & Daughters Cafe is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., with the same paper place-mat menu day and night. You could certainly make a light supper from one of the egg dishes, especially the creamy and soft scramble with onions and lox. (How did the Lower East Side get along without this?) But that is a meal best enjoyed alone with a book. The kitchen offers very little that will provide enough traction for a group of friends engaging in a round of cocktails followed by a bottle of wine.  Unlike most New Yorkers, the menu looks best by daylight. Most helpings are modest, good for noshing. Salmon roe and crème fraîche with latkes, with hard-shell exteriors and fluffy white interiors, seem like breakfast. So does the sturdy bagel chip piled up with whitefish and salmon salads and flying-fish roe infused with wasabi. At lunch the excellent cold borscht could lead up to the herring sampler featuring rollmops, Swedish matjes and pickled herring, which has immediately joined the small list of dishes whose flavor helps define New York.  The cafe might have a stronger nocturnal allure with a separate dinner menu or beefed-up portions of plates like the latkes. And it might look into slicing Mr. Weissman’s breads closer to the dinner hour so they aren’t as fatigued. I’m not expecting to see any big changes right away, though. This is, after all, a business that took a century to give its customers a place to sit down.","Knishes; latkes; pickles; chopped liver; Super Heebster; borscht; smoked whitefish chowder; lox, eggs and onions; all smoked fish and herring; blintzes; halvah ice cream.

187,Racines NY ,2 star,"July 22, 2014",Pete Wells,TriBeCa,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/dining/restaurant-review-racines-ny-in-tribeca.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/dining/restaurant-review-racines-ny-in-tribeca.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"You can’t get mad at a macaron, but with all due respect I’d suggest that there are other French ideas about eating that would benefit New York more than balloon-weight sandwich cookies in sidewalk-chalk colors. We could, for instance, use a few wine bars of the type that began sprouting around Paris about a decade ago.  Like traditional bars à vins, they have closely considered wine lists whose length and prices are geared for the curious drinker, but they championed winemaking’s noninterventionist avant-garde before that was the thing to do. They also flicked the dust off the traditional menu of ready-to-go standbys like hams, cheeses, terrines and open-face sandwiches. Sure, there is excellent charcuterie, but there is some cooking, too, and it betrays care and originality. For the chefs of small restaurants like Septime and Frenchie that are full nearly every night, the wine bar next door has become the preferred way to expand. Racines, which the chef Pierre Jancou opened in 2007 under the glass roof of a 19th-century shopping arcade on the Boulevard Montmartre, was an early example of this breed and one of the most militant. It poured only wines made without sulfur, which even most purists admit can keep good bottles from going bad. Mr. Jancou was a believer, and he could be intolerant of those who didn’t share the faith. If you thought one of his wines smelled like a running shoe filled with Gorgonzola, fine. You could go elsewhere and drink Bordeaux with the rest of the heathens. If not for the name, you would never guess that Racines NY, which appeared in TriBeCa this spring, is any relation. It’s three times the size of the 20-seat original. The service is solicitous. The sommelier, Arnaud Tronche, genuinely appears to care whether people like what they’re drinking. Sulfur, in minimal doses, is tolerated. This being New York, prices at the low end of the long, mostly French list aren’t as low. And although wine will be the main event for many people, Racines NY is not a wine bar. It’s a restaurant — or “neo-bistro,” in the words of the owners: Mr. Tronche; David Lillie, a partner in Chambers Street Wines, down the street; and David Lanher, who bought the first Racines from Mr. Jancou in 2009. In other words, the menu is meant for dining, not snacking. Nor for sharing, either, although my attempt to keep my fork out of my wife’s plateful of whole, warm Oregon morels on a pool of half-liquid burrata failed miserably.  For the most part, the chef Frédéric Duca’s appetizers are opening moves, and very elegant ones. Mr. Duca served a length of barely seared wild salmon, the raw flesh inside the intense orange-red of a persimmon, with a scoop of cucumber sorbet and a schmear of warm cauliflower cream. These are two of the mildest vegetables in existence, so combining them would not seem like a formula for excitement, but it was like watching summer and winter meet for the first time. Raw veal with warm mayonnaise probably doesn’t sound like a bell-ringer, either. But with pine nuts and tarragon folded into cubes of meat, it made a delicious tartare, unorthodox but unmistakably French.  Mr. Duca, who grew up near Marseille, had begun to win recognition as the chef of L’Instant d’Or, in Paris, when Mr. Lanher talked him into moving to Chambers Street. Transplanted chefs often need time to find the right suppliers. But almost every ingredient I tasted at Racines NY was fresh and swimming with flavor. If you haven’t fully wallowed in berry season yet, go and get the full, dark-red strawberries layered over basil panna cotta. It’s currently the star dessert, outclassing a tart of chocolate and salt caramel that comes across as a knockoff (though as knockoffs go, it’s very well made). And his main courses are events: the hanger steak over a smoky eggplant purée with blistered shishito peppers and a rustle of cumin somewhere in the background; the red snapper with octopus and fantastic mussels fried in herbed bread crumbs, one of the nicest treatments I’ve seen anyone give a mussel in a long time; the lamb cooked two ways, most impressively as a braised shank with a deep, almost gamy intensity that fought it out with a teasingly bitter salsa verde made from arugula.  All of these dishes are brought to a pitch of refinement that is somewhat at odds with the wine-bar spirit. True, Racines NY doesn’t claim to be a wine bar. Neither does its Parisian ancestor. But New Yorkers keep talking about it as if it were one, and it’s easy to see why. A big, open bar dominates the dining room, which doesn’t have the sense of occasion you expect from a restaurant or bistro. In fact, it’s pretty generic. The walls are white or brick; the light fixtures are black and simple; the small vineyard photographs are black-and-white on white matte inside skinny black frames. Bottles, an easy and cheap decorative motif, are inexplicably absent from the shelves behind the bar’s barren white surface, which could be mistaken for the cosmetics counter at Barneys. Not every French restaurant in New York needs to look like Bofinger, but does this one really have to look quite so much like a spread from the Restoration Hardware catalog? Especially if you are spending $35 for the morels or $38 for the lamb, prices that approach those of the entry-level wines, you might hope for a room that you could picture when you close your eyes the next day.  Some New Yorkers will keep Racines NY out of their regular rotation because it doesn’t look French enough. This would be, to put it kindly, dumb. Dinner and drinks at Racines NY come as close as anything in Manhattan to the flavors of Paris today.  The last night I ate there, the wine directors for Piora and the Momofuku group were in the house, cherry-picking the list. It doesn’t take an expert to get a great glass at Racines NY. Stuttering a few disjointed syllables to Mr. Tronche, I ended up drinking a rich, almost tropical Sancerre from Sebastien Riffault, poured from a magnum; a dessert wine from François Pinon, a Vouvray with acidity and sweetness so closely balanced I found it hard to believe; a Reagan-era verdelho, a mere toddler as Madeiras go, that is one of the best companions for a cheese course I’ve ever met. Mr. Tronche could probably even find a wine to get me excited about macarons.

188,Grindhaus,2 star,"July 15, 2014",Pete Wells,Red Hook,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/dining/restaurant-review-grindhaus-in-red-hook-brooklyn.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/dining/restaurant-review-grindhaus-in-red-hook-brooklyn.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"On April Fools’ Day 2008, a former music publicist and retired dominatrix named Erin Norris signed the lease on a derelict Brooklyn storefront where she intended to open a sausage restaurant called Grindhaus. Almost immediately, the universe began sending her a message: don’t.  The space had structural weaknesses, and propping it up would become a long, expensive project. Gas burners would not be an option. Nor would the grinding and stuffing of sausages in bulk; as it turned out, there wasn’t enough room. Ms. Norris ran out of money, raised more, blew through that, scraped up a little extra, spent it on the best kitchen equipment she could afford, and announced that she would open soon. The universe, surmising that the message wasn’t getting through, sent a flood. The night of Hurricane Sandy, water filled the streets of Red Hook and filled Grindhaus, too, wrecking all that kitchen equipment.  By this point, the signs had to be clear. Evidently Ms. Norris didn’t care, because she mucked the place out, banged in new, mold-free walls, began a Kickstarter campaign to fund repairs and fresh equipment, and hired Aaron Taber, a chef she had met at the dog run.  The 20-seat restaurant she opened last December, without the sausage theme, is still called Grindhaus. This may be a sign of Ms. Norris’s stubbornness, or it may show that she grasps a basic principle of business: When you have a restaurant name that suggests a lost Russ Meyer film set in a German wurst hall staffed by karate-kicking supervixens who are barely contained by their black-leather dirndls, you don’t give it up because you can’t serve sausages. Grindhaus is not entirely sausage-free. I did eat a few pinches of fresh merguez there once. It was terrific stuff, rich and spicy, folded inside fresh cappellacci. Around these pasta bundles, Mr. Taber had set a snake-curve of charred scallion, confidently seasoned chickpeas and yogurt for a sauce. There were also balls of chickpea cakes called panisses. Panisses may not seem to go with pasta, but these were good enough to go with any dish they wanted.  In his short cooking career, Mr. Taber has worked at the Pines in Brooklyn and made dough for a mobile pizza oven. At Grindhaus, his first post as chef, he cooks alone in a kitchen almost exactly the dimensions of the restroom. He makes the kind of earnest, fashionably austere, handsomely arranged food that is signified on menus by sans-serif lists of ingredients, with no capital letters, verbs, articles or hint of how one thing may relate to the next. In some restaurants, they don’t relate. At Grindhaus, they do.  The first thing I ate there was written this way: rutabaga  carrot, sorrel, grapefruit Was it a salad? A soup? A purgative juice blend? No. It was a delicious and ingeniously simple vegetable tart. A buttery pie shell was just big enough to contain a thick, soft wheel of rutabaga held in place by a layer of puréed carrots. The lemonlike bite of raw sorrel and the true citrus of grapefruit acted as welcome rays of sunlight breaking into this ode to the root cellar. Mr. Taber’s style of cooking is often found in druidic, wood-filled restaurants with tasting menus, cupboards stacked with hand-thrown pottery and painfully earnest names derived from natural materials, like Resin. Grindhaus isn’t as high-minded as those places. It has some rock ’n’ roll in its trousers.  A steel silhouette of a broken wine glass hangs in the front window, and the jagged shards attached to the stem look like the fingers of a hand raised in a heavy-metal salute. The framed sketches of the heads of Keith Moon and Brian Jones were drawn in high school by a friend of Ms. Norris’s whose later work, under the name Cynthia Plaster Caster, would depict other regions of rock-star anatomy.  On the bar is the stuffed head of a white horse, its gaping mouth now a vase for eucalyptus branches. Like most things in Grindhaus, the head has a story. It was made to Ms. Norris’s specifications by a taxidermist who waited three years for a dead horse in the right color to come along. “The throat was to open up so it could have a lot of ephemera and antique drug paraphernalia, prescriptions from the 19th century,” Ms. Norris said. Even if you never figure out what’s in the horse’s throat, the head with its flowing mane still works its spell as part of Grindhaus’s invitation to let it loose and come on down. It’s not a rowdy place, but it is one where classic rock may play all night. It’s a place where I felt quite at ease singing along to “Volunteers” while tearing off a fistful of sourdough bread, which Mr. Taber bakes inside a cast-iron pot to give it a crust that is as stiff, crisp and dark as bread crust can get without being burned. It’s a place where certain flavors, like the seared foie gras with ripe strawberries in warm strawberry-rhubarb juice, or the duck breast with morels and rye berries, were so intense that I called over the server and asked for the same dish again, please, before another course left the kitchen. Ms. Norris buys the wines. Almost all come from the natural school, and a few were chosen with more enthusiasm than discernment, so it’s wise to taste before committing to a bottle. As they are all poured by the glass, this is easy to do. Wines that didn’t seem quite ready and a slightly undercooked monkfish were the only tastes I regretted. I could also wish for more than one dessert on the menu. Recently it was a chocolate mousse with a caramel-like strawberry cream, cacao nibs and puffed rice; I liked it just fine, but the people at my table who didn’t would have appreciated an alternative. Mr. Taber, no doubt, would appreciate a bigger kitchen and someone to share it with. Like the romance in a screwball comedy, though, Grindhaus gets its energy from the meeting of opposites: Mr. Taber’s large ambitions and his tiny work space, the carefully considered cooking and Ms. Norris’s wild paraphernalia. She hasn’t decorated the place with canes or masks from her dominatrix days, but she believes the dungeon helped shape Grindhaus. “That’s also the hospitality industry, in a way,” she said, adding: “So it finds its way into how things are run and taking care of people. Making sure no one leaves scarred. Or unhappy.”",Sourdough bread; Parkerhaus rolls; cabbage and pork jowl with huckleberries; fresh pasta; duck breast; cheese.
189,Tavern on the Green,0.75 star,"June 24, 2014",Pete Wells,Upper West Side,"American, Mediterranean",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/dining/restaurant-review-tavern-on-the-green.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/dining/restaurant-review-tavern-on-the-green.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Restaurant critics are supposed to be impartial, but I can’t help feeling some proprietary interest in Tavern on the Green. Not a financial interest, except insofar as a profitable Tavern is good for the city’s budget, which, in a fractions-of-pennies way, is good for me as a grumpy taxpayer. It’s more like a civic interest. Tavern on the Green belongs to the city and sits inside the most beautiful public park in which I’ve ever rowed, cycled, struck out in softball, misidentified a confusing fall warbler and illegally consumed alcoholic beverages. I’d let the city keep those fractional pennies if that helped Tavern on the Green live up to its setting.  So you may detect an extra cup or two of enthusiasm in my voice when I say that under its new management, the building is woven into the life of the park more fully than in its last incarnation, a wedding-cake palace as imagined by a 6-year-old princess with a high fever. And you may hear a few teaspoons of added regret when I say that it’s not a good restaurant yet by any measure.  The place reopened just two months ago, which may not be enough time to get a 700-seat Winnebago like Tavern up to highway speed. In time, the kitchen may figure out how to get plates on the table while they are still hot. The chef, Katy Sparks, may rethink some of the overworked, underdelivering recipes. The hosts may learn how to read their reservations screen so they don’t tell a customer he’s the first to arrive and ask him to wait while the rest of his party is already in the restaurant’s inner recesses, wondering if he’s gone for a carriage ride. Somebody may tell the servers not to drop the check while people are still eating dessert. The sommeliers may turn down the thermostat so that red wines aren’t the temperature of a kiddie pool.  Still, compared with its last days before its death from insolvency in 2009 made it the subject of countless dry-eyed eulogies, Tavern on the Green is much, much improved.  One of its real joys is seeing the exuberant Victorian building, constructed in 1871 as a dormitory for the grass-munching residents of Sheep Meadow, restored down to the last copper drainpipe. The snaggletoothed slate roof has been to the orthodontist. The Parks Department, determined to end the Tavern’s sparkly isolation, tore down the Crystal Room, which used to galumph halfway across the courtyard. The Berlin Wall of giant topiary animals that blocked the view of Sheep Meadow is gone, too. Now if you eat on the terrace, you can see the runners and the pedicab drivers on West Drive, and they can see you.  The restaurant’s new operators, Jim Caiola and David Salama, have tried to put the tavern back into the Tavern. Ms. Sparks’s plates are substantial, and any leanings toward fanciness are confined to the perimeters of the plate. The menu does not say, “Aunt Althea’s 80th birthday” as much as it says: “Hi there. If you happen to be going to Lincoln Center, don’t forget about me!”  The glittering, un-tavernlike interior encrustations have been scraped off. Next to the entrance is a bar shaped like a racetrack next to a convincing artificial marble fireplace flanked by carved rams’ heads. It’s dark and reassuring, just the kind of sheltered saloon you’d want to end up in after working up a thirst in the park.  In the main dining room, though, the tavern motif explodes in a whiteout. Everything is bright and off-white: tables, chairs, banquettes, floors. It looks like the indoor-outdoor, all-day, casual-dining option at a family-friendly resort in Florida. The servers have the determined enthusiasm of counselors poached from a summer camp in Maine and given a crash course in big-city restaurant customs during the bus ride down Interstate 95. One of them thought everything we did and said was “wonderful”: our clever preference for sparkling water over still, our bold decision to look at dessert menus. Another picked up a few crumbs from the leather-topped table with his fingertips, then left the rest. Somebody showed up the instant the plates had been set down to ask brightly, “How does everything look?” I can’t blame her for not asking how it tasted. The answer may have made it hard to stay chipper. Prying tiny quail bones away from meat that was griddled until it was as dry as a week-old English muffin wasn’t very wonderful. Neither was the greasy scattering of mushrooms and gummy, flavorless farro strozzapreti baked under a mound of ricotta that had no idea it was supposed to act like a sauce.  The ceviches aren’t ceviches; they’re rough-sawn carpaccios of seafood covered with garnishes that are either thuggish (harsh pickled onions and acrid, stale fried garlic chips on yellowfin tuna) or useless (avocado lumps on salmon). Then acid is thrown at them. The directive seems to be: terminate with extreme prejudice.  Is it too late to bring back the sheep? No, no. Patience. Maybe the food, which isn’t especially ornate, still needs to come down a notch or two. The pork chop could lose the stringy, sour, half-raw roasted rhubarb. The brisket in a sweetish barbecue sauce, which you’d be happy enough to find at your local brew pub, could do without the comatose potato salad. And the menu would be easier to handle if Ms. Sparks didn’t organize it by heat source. (“I don’t really care what I eat, as long as it was cooked on a plancha!”) The most enjoyable dishes tend to be the simplest. The Serrano ham and melted Gruyère sandwich was totally likable, which is my clever way of saying it was fried in butter. I couldn’t taste any wood smoke in the hearth-roasted mussels, but they were tender and flavorful in their Spanish-leaning sauce of garlic and chopped almonds. The $56 strip steak was excellent, too, although it probably helped that it was the only main course that arrived hot that night. (It is by far the most expensive of what the menu calls “large plates.” The others hover around $30, which might squeak by as reasonable for dinner in the park if the cooking didn’t get away from the cooks so often.)  The prize dessert is also the most modest: the birthday cake. White and soft, with whipped ricotta between the layers and whipped cream on top, it’s exactly what a plain-vanilla American layer cake should be. The other desserts are fine, but they could learn a thing or two from it. The berry shortcake needs a richer, creamier biscuit, and if the fudgelike brownies want to graduate to sundae status, they deserve more than a single scoop of ice cream. The best of my four meals at Tavern on the Green was brunch at a shady table in the courtyard, where I watched Sheep Meadow slowly fill up with weekend layabouts. The food wasn’t so wonderful that it would lure crowds, but it wouldn’t keep them away, either. No doubt the restaurant is aiming higher than that, but it wouldn’t be a bad place to begin.",Serrano ham and Gruyère sandwich; wood-roasted mussels; braised lamb in red curry coconut milk sauce; New York strip steak; grits; birthday cake; chocolate mousse. 
190,Gato,2 star,"June 10, 2014",Pete Wells,NoHo,Mediterranean,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/dining/restaurant-review-gato-from-bobby-flay.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/dining/restaurant-review-gato-from-bobby-flay.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Gato galloped into town in March, pursued by the food media and Bobby Flay fans in a thundering cloud of hoofbeats. The first new restaurant Mr. Flay and his business partner, Laurence Kretchmer, have opened in New York City in nearly a decade, Gato is nominally Mediterranean, but the chef rides herd on pastas and pizzas and romesco sauces with a go-for-broke intensity that’s 100 percent American. Mr. Flay brushes flavor on his ingredients in thick impasto strokes, making each plate a three-dimensional aggregation of char, smoke, capsicum, sugar, acid and fat. The cooking at Gato is many things, often all at the same time, but it is rarely shy. “Tons of olive oil,” Mr. Flay promised in a January interview in The New York Times as the space in NoHo was under plywood. “Tons of salty flavors like anchovies and olives and capers. Lots of citrus. Tons of things like tomatoes and peppers, both hot and sweet.” Stand aside, all you chefs fiddling with tweezers and eyedroppers; Bobby Flay is backing up an 18-wheeler loaded with anchovies. Of the first generation of gunslinging Food Network chefs, Mr. Flay is the only one who stayed in the saddle as the channel’s mission shifted from dump-and-stir cooking lessons to ticking-clock gladiator contests. He also kept his dignity; he acts like a professional, not a cartoon. Still, playing a chef isn’t the same as being one, and as the real estate market picked off first Bolo and then Mesa Grill, his New York presence was whittled down to just Bar Americain, a Whitman’s Sampler of American regional favorites. To audiences who don’t remember how skillfully he conjured up bursts of sunlight in Mesa Grill’s prime, Mr. Flay was in danger of becoming another Old West sharpshooter who’d joined up with Buffalo Bill Cody to delight big-top crowds by blasting holes in playing cards. With Gato, he’s a grizzled sheriff pinning on his badge again and returning to the precincts where he first laid down the law. He’s out to prove he’s more than just a big hat. But the frontier is a-changin’. The townspeople expect all kinds of newfangled foolishness. If they aren’t amazed by every bite, they’ll yelp like coyotes. Worse, they can’t live without small plates. Fine, Bobby Flay can do small plates. He can crush small plates with one hand. His bar snacks, three porcelain bowls lined up on a slate for $17, are compact flavor bombs that detonate quickly and leave a vivid afterimage. He’ll stuff cubes of tuna tartare inside a piquillo pepper, pitting cool and raw against roasted and mildly spicy. He makes a tiny powerhouse of fresh chorizo wrapped in caul fat, and gives it some shaved pickled fennel to calm its hotheaded tendencies. Many chefs leave burrata to its own, oozy devices; Mr. Flay piles on roasted beets and a vinaigrette made from oil in which black olives have stewed, and suddenly it’s a dish with something to say. I’m omitting some other stuff on these plates both for brevity and because they never swamped the rest. The size of the bar snacks may limit how much flavor-troweling Mr. Flay can do. Some of the bigger plates show his maximalist embroidery at its bring-it-on best; others seem to leave too much space for his BeDazzler. Rabbits have a famous love for carrots, but I’ve never seen one take to the vegetable the way Gato’s juicy braised rabbit leg takes to its carrot hot sauce, which tastes like sweet fire. Nor have I tasted a tarragon chicken in which the minty-licorice character of the herb had the flute-note brightness it has at Gato, which carpets the bird’s crisp skin with a variety of salsa verde made from chopped raw tarragon. Mr. Flay can put a crust on a paella like nobody’s business, and the crunchy grains of rice, once you unstick them from the bottom of the pan and mix them with a steamed egg, fried artichokes and big, tender leaves of sautéed kale, have a flavor-texture dynamic that’s just fun to eat. Steamed halibut promises all the thrills of curling up in bed with a bond fund’s quarterly report. Mr. Flay plunks the fish into a bowl of saffron-tomato soup made from halibut stock and bulked up with couscous, and if it’s not quite thrilling, it still has a winning depth of flavor, and some nuance, too. Nuance has never been Mr. Flay’s middle name, but he can achieve it, particularly in the main courses. With some of the more hyperactive dishes at Gato, though, it’s as if his years of competitive cooking have trained him to go for the knockout punch right away. He’ll funnel every ounce of flavor into the first bite, and he seems to be afraid that if he leaves out some trick, the judges will have enough taste buds left to notice what his rivals are up to. Fettuccine was soaked with potent, briny squid ink and mussel broth until it elbowed everything else — red prawns, mussels and a quiet green-onion purée — right off the plate. A side of pimentón-dusted potatoes fried to shattering bits, like crumbled bacon, was oily enough on its own without the extra richness of a runny poached egg and salty enough without a frosting of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Cheese is wheeled out again and again: soft shreds of fontina in a chicory salad; crumbs of pecorino over asparagus and fava beans whose spring freshness would have been better off with just the yellow romesco; goat cheese with crunchy potatoes alongside that tarragon chicken; gobs of bucheron in a plate of scrambled eggs blitzed with romesco. Sweetness can turn up where it’s not needed, too, whether in the romesco with an unprepossessing pork chop or in the apricot-almond dressing in that chicory salad. But if Mr. Flay sometimes lights up the tilt sign on his pinball machine, there is still a lot to love on the menu. There is a lot, period. Gato shows an all-too-rare generosity in its flavors, its eager service, its good-tempered desserts, like the summery blackberry crostata and the fromage blanc cheesecake whipped into a froth by the pastry chef, Clarisa Martino. Seeking a decent bottle of wine for $50 or under at an ambitious New York restaurant is becoming a lost cause, but there are more than a dozen of them at Gato. The wine list brings together affordable, everyday bottles with others that will sing their song to advanced drinkers. (It makes a happier hunting ground than the humdrum cocktail menu.) Given Mr. Flay’s fan base, the dining room might have been a pack-’em-in nightmare, but there’s space to flex your elbows. The architects at Rockwell Group, past masters at injecting life into big, boxy rooms, have turned this onetime homeless shelter into a flickering lair where the heat-lamp glow of hanging lights is set off against receding pools of darkness. It looks like a set for a TV show about sexy young downtown vampires who unwind over blood sausages — “Cheers” for the undead. All the reviews of Gato note that Mr. Flay is really, truly working in the glassed-in kitchen. I saw him, too, not twirling cilantro sprigs at the pass but facing the burners, his back to the audience, like Miles Davis. He says he’s sticking around indefinitely. Nobody can say he’s giving us anything less than the full Flay.",Bar snacks; pizza with lamb sausage; charred carrots; tarragon chicken; steamed halibut; orata with piquillo pesto; paella with kale and artichokes; fromage blanc cheesecake; blackberry crostata.
191,The Simone,3 star,"June 3, 2014",Pete Wells,Upper East Side,"American, French",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/dining/restaurant-review-the-simone-on-the-upper-east-side.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/dining/restaurant-review-the-simone-on-the-upper-east-side.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The chef Chip Smith and his wife, Tina Vaughn, moved to New York in 2012 after shutting their restaurant in North Carolina, but the Simone, which they opened in November, doesn’t feel like a transplanted Southern flower. It is a classic Manhattan restaurant that seems to have emerged on East 82nd Street fully formed out of a time capsule sealed in the last century. When you call the restaurant, which is the only way to reserve one of its 11 tables, Ms. Vaughn will write your name in something called a “book,” holding an implement known as a “pen.” She applies the same antique tool to the menu, which she writes out in cursive and photocopies each time Mr. Smith changes it. The Simone’s search-engine strategy is the opposite of optimized. The restaurant is not on Open Table, Menu Pages, Twitter or Facebook, and an Internet search will turn up an unrelated martini bar’s website before the Simone’s. I often think that restaurants with outdoor-concert noise levels, backless benches and no-reservations policies are deliberately trying to scare off older diners. The Simone seems to be attempting something like that in reverse: If you wanted to keep away anyone under 35, this is how you’d do it. But as some of those youngsters know, the worn grooves of an old LP can sound richer than the shimmering precision of an MP3. And the Simone has the kind of textured, lived-in, analog warmth that has become rare in Manhattan’s increasingly corporatized, professionalized restaurant scene. Though expensive, with main courses fluttering into the low $40s, and formal, with waiters in vests and neckties primping white tablecloths, the Simone isn’t starchy at all. It’s a living, breathing mom-and-pop outfit where Ms. Vaughn will gush with bubbly pride about the Provençal bottle she spontaneously offered to work into a flight of rosés, while Mr. Smith, no showboat, channels his pride into the cooking. (A third owner, Robert Margolis, keeps a poker-faced watch on the dining room.) Like the rest of the Simone, Mr. Smith’s kitchen is a bit of a throwback. The winds of New Nordic and modernist cuisines do not ruffle the surface of his stockpots. He works within French tradition in a manner that was almost the default New York style 15 to 20 years ago. Mr. Smith, who trained under Patrick O’Connell and Jean-Louis Palladin, is not rewriting the rules of French cooking. It’s simply the language he speaks, and he’s fluent enough that he can use it to talk about the ingredients in his part of the world. If you were designing a dish to go viral on Instagram, you’d start by ruling out flounder, which has the must-see quotient of a “Matlock” marathon on TBS. The fish is a favorite of Mr. Smith’s, who served me two flounder dishes that rank among the best seafood I’ve tasted this year. In late winter, he rolled juicy, big-flaked fillets around a mousse of flounder and black truffle flecks; I would have burrowed into it until spring if I hadn’t also wanted to eat the whole thing. The flounder’s cold-weather swaddling disappeared a few weeks ago, and a jaunty new May outfit appeared: a golden sheet of bread crumbs speckled with fresh green herbs on top of the fish, a platform of crushed, minted favas below. Mr. Smith’s main courses often pair two takes on a protein, one very good and the other exceptional: a juicy roasted chicken breast with fried croquettes of dark meat, ham and foie gras so hard to ignore that dinner came to a dead stop while we passed them around; a drum of braised lamb shank with a single rib daubed with a Moroccan spice blend that landed with a menacing uppercut of heat; a crisped boneless duck thigh with thin slices of breast that were pink right out to the edges and almost surreally tender. One time, Mr. Smith doubled down and lost. The grilled loin and braised thigh of rabbit, both on the dry side, must have been a fluke, because he usually showed the intuition of a chef who knows just how his ingredients want to be handled. He has good sense with appetizers, too, and an admirable sense of restraint; he doesn’t turn them into scene stealers that leave the main courses nowhere to go but down. The first king salmon of the Alaskan season were shown off handsomely in a tartare with crisp cucumbers and bright preserved lemons. His goat-cheese soufflé was more warm custard than eat-it-now atmospheric condition, but it was still an excellent custard. He carves sweetbreads into long planks, creating more surface area for the crunchy coating of bread crumbs and Dijon mustard that was more than half the point. House-made charcuterie sits at the top of the menu, and it belongs there. Mr. Smith treats the tradition with a rare classicism, as in his recent bacon-wrapped terrine of pork, chicken liver, pistachios, pink plugs of foie gras and Armagnac prunes. I wished that the brioche toast served with it had been a little softer and lighter, but I was happy enough eating the terrine alone. It was like a rousing chorus of “La Marseillaise” made of meat. One night, Ms. Vaughn explained that during some lean times at a previous restaurant when they had to let the pastry chef go, Mr. Smith taught himself to make desserts. He has more of a feel for the last course than many chefs, although there were a few false moves, like a lemon tart that wasn’t puckery enough to withstand a sugary overload of meringue. But other desserts fell right into line, like a tart of Mr. Smith’s own marmalade with a crushed almond topping, and a little tower of Lord Baltimore cake, the yellow layers filled with pecans, dried fruits and coconut that were addled with bourbon, the way Lord Baltimore intended. There is no bar “program” at this restaurant, no list of nine-ingredient cocktails with dingbat names like Simone Says. But if your drink request is normal enough, it will materialize on the staircase in the hands of a waiter who presumably got it from some unseen, unheard Jeeves on the second floor. The Simone is a personal restaurant, and it has some personal quirks. The sophisticated-lady playlist can push nostalgia a step too far; raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, on the original cast recording, may not be everybody’s favorite thing at dinner. And Ms. Vaughn has a funny habit of sidling up to the table to ask single-word questions: Delicious? Lovely? The thing is, there was always a single-word answer: yes.

192,Narcissa ,2 star,"May 27, 2014",Pete Wells,East Village,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/dining/restaurant-review-narcissa-in-the-standard-east-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/dining/restaurant-review-narcissa-in-the-standard-east-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Gather around the old Victrola, kids. Grandpa wants to tell you a story about wealth, power, real estate, pornography, carrots and a sweet-faced dairy cow named Narcissa. About 90 miles north of Manhattan is a 76-acre triangle of land on the Hudson River whose owners over the centuries have acted out the history, in stop-frame animation, of social power in New York. When Dutch families ran half of the Hudson Valley, it was farmed by the son of a settler from the Netherlands. He sold the place to one of the Livingstons, an aristocratic Scottish family who ran the other half.  As Gilded Age capitalists crashed New York society, the property was bought by William B. Dinsmore, a founder of a company that was the U.P.S. of the Civil War era, but with stagecoaches instead of brown vans. The Dinsmores had a Gatsbyesque time there, entertaining trainloads of weekend guests with a private golf course and a greenhouse full of orchids. Pipe down, I’m getting to the porn.  There are always fun new ways to get rich in America, and in the prolonged group grope between the invention of the Pill and the Meese Report, Bob Guccione got rich by printing photos of Penthouse pets, who exposed things that the blushing Playmates didn’t. With his earnings, Mr. Guccione bought the old Dinsmore estate. But when we chased pornography off our streets and onto our laptops, Mr. Guccione wasn’t rich any more, and his country retreat was seized by creditors.  Now we save our soft-focus pictures for pork chops, and restaurants are one of the last places where moaning in public is still acceptable. So of course the person who bought the property at auction is a restaurateur, André Balazs. Renaming the estate Locusts-on-Hudson, Mr. Balazs rents it out for weddings (the website tastefully passes over the gold-chained Guccione years) and farms the land again. Today it is home to vegetable plots, laying hens and a retired cow, Narcissa. She gave her name to Mr. Balazs’s latest restaurant, inside his Standard East Village hotel, and her moony eyes look down at the dining room from framed photographs. Narcissa the cow has no role in the restaurant’s rib-eye steak, but the farm is supposed to help in other ways. Last fall, Narcissa’s chef, John Fraser, started planning this summer’s menu by choosing the vegetables he wanted from illustrated seed catalogs. These books, he said, were “food porn in and of themselves.”  Whether teenage boys will hide pictures of undressed kohlrabi under their mattresses remains to be seen, but Mr. Fraser has already come up with one of the year’s most photographed carrots. A take on beef Wellington, it has salt-cured roasted carrots inside the puff pastry where the meat should go. It’s a startling success. The carrots are tender without a trace of mushiness, and a walnut paste darkened with cocoa and coffee gives them a brooding, bittersweet depth. Mr. Fraser is known for his refined, thought-out vegetable tasting menus at Dovetail, on the Upper West Side. His vegetable plates at Narcissa are more unbuttoned and generous. They’re complex, but in a relaxed way that fits this casual, many-things-to-many-people dining room, where tables of chef chasers sit next to narrow-waisted colts who look as if they get their nutrients from air kisses. Beets are spit-roasted for hours until their outsides are charred like grilled steak and the insides have a focused, waterless intensity; then they’re lightly crushed into deep-ruby hunks that drink up a horseradish crème fraîche. Plum-size sweet potatoes go on the rotisserie, too, getting a hot allspice-heavy jerk sauce completely right for their sugary flesh, which can taste flabby on its own. This kitchen knows how to build a salad, mixing vinaigrettes that have a switchblade edge and tossing in sophisticated-hippie handfuls of sunflower seeds (with saucerlike leaves of brussels sprouts) or crunchy chopped pistachios (in the mixed-greens Narcissa’s salad).  Side dishes are often a crass adventure in check-padding. That’s not the case at Narcissa, although the carrot fries — overdone carrots in a greasy battered shell — just made me miss the Wellington. (This is why magicians never repeat a trick.) But I could eat Narcissa’s steamed new potatoes in green garlic and olive oil all summer long, and I wish steakhouses would steal its “supergreen spinach,” wilted leaves folded into a béchamel-fortified purée that has a Sprite-bottle gleam.  I’m giving these vegetables lingering close-ups because they have a swaggering originality that the meat and seafood rarely match. Hake with a south-of-France trio of tapenade, oranges and artichokes, and a poussin the size of a mango with legs, in a vaguely truffled chicken reduction, were extremely pleasant, but wouldn’t get Narcissa noticed on their own.  Other dishes seemed designed for jet-lagged hotel guests who don’t want any back-talk from their dinner, like the not-quite-juicy roasted branzino with a standard-issue salsa verde. Mr. Fraser could use a few more main courses like the steamed black sea bass, which worked up some excitement — an uphill battle for steamed fish — by means of a toasty coconut-curry broth and hollow cross-sections of green almonds, squeaky-crisp as an unripe pear.  Deborah Racicot’s desserts are just clever enough; if you’re paying attention, you can tell that she is, too. To go with a round chocolate tart, like a brownie with a melted center, she lightly curries bananas, using slightly green ones so they’re not too cloying. The nicest thing I can say about the long winter is that it allowed her citrus salad with tapioca pudding and orange-blossom granité to stay on the menu until May. Tableside patter can be strange. A server one night talked up the “day-trip scallops” (lucky them) and pushed carrots Wellington as a mid-meal “palate cleanser.” There was no song and dance from the wine staff, led by Ashley Santoro, only to-the-point advice on a very appealing list. The design has a disjointed feel. Wooden chairs hang from pegs, in the aspirational Shaker Zen style, but the low zigzag partition along the bar could come from a Vegas coffee shop. Then there’s the steep staircase to the restrooms with crazy diagonal stripes reflected in the mirrored ceiling. It looks as if the director of “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari” had remade “The Lost Weekend.” If you’ve been drinking, tie a rope around your waist and have a friend slowly lower you down.",Salads; rotisserie beets; rotisserie sweet potatoes; carrots Wellington; steamed black bass with French curry broth; bone-in rib-eye; supergreen spinach; bittersweet chocolate tart.
193,River Cafe,2 star,"May 20, 2014",Pete Wells,Fulton Ferry,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/21/dining/restaurant-review-the-river-cafe-at-fulton-ferry.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/21/dining/restaurant-review-the-river-cafe-at-fulton-ferry.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Back in the 1960s, when nobody except rats, longshoremen and gangsters needing to dispose of a wayward bookie saw much value in the Brooklyn waterfront, Michael O’Keeffe saw romance. He saw enough flowers for a year of proms, he saw a piano player massaging a Steinway, he saw a curtain of glass framing the Brooklyn Bridge and the lights of Fortress Manhattan on the other side. All of this he saw floating on a barge in the East River. After pleading for permits for 12 years, he persuaded City Hall to see it, too, and in 1977 the River Café dropped anchors. Did Mr. O’Keeffe see men producing diamond rings from their jacket pockets? He has seen it hundreds of times since. So have I, sitting at the bar one summer a few years back when a young man talked his date into catching the view from the deck outside then dropped to one knee, right next to the swiveling mounted binoculars. I’ll never forget it, or the look in the couple’s dewy eyes when they discovered that the door to the dining room had locked behind them.  No questions were popped at the River Café for more than a year after Hurricane Sandy dished out a surge tide that even a barge couldn’t stay on top of. When the River Café opened again in February, the walls, ships’ deck floorboards, the grand piano, most of the wine cellar and nearly everything else was new. You’d never know it. Mr. O’Keeffe paid for a museum-quality restoration.  As before, you reach the River Café by traveling down a cobbled driveway with lanterns and a miniature forest of plants on either side, as if Snow White’s cottage were at the end of the road. The entrance casts its fairy-tale spell on a good number of wanderers who follow the winding road only to be sent away because they don’t have jackets (for the men) or reservations (for everyone). Those who are allowed inside cross a short gangplank to the floating dining room, where captains in black tuxedos stand guard. On the right, flowers; on the left, a pianist who gently spoons out ballads for hours on end without ever seeming to need a break. He doesn’t sing, but memory dredges up the words: When I’m close to you, dear, the stars fill the sky. So in love with you am I.  This trickling brook of melodies babbling away in the background is more pretty than beautiful. Like many things about the River Café, it is white-limo elegant. But so few New York restaurants today reach for elegance of any kind that the resurgence of this one is a gift to the city.  Even harder to find are restaurants where tourists can go to gape at the view and New Yorkers can go without being embarrassed. Windows on the World, once straight across the river, is gone for good, and the return of the revolving dance floor at the Rainbow Room, scheduled for October, can’t come soon enough. No place in the city combines spectacle with hideaway intimacy and undiluted romance the way the River Café does.  And if more customers will take photographs of the Brooklyn Bridge’s steel underbelly than of their plates, the food is still much better than you might fear if you’ve been to other restaurants with souvenir views. “The kitchen aims to please but not to shock,” William Grimes wrote in his two-star review 12 years ago, the last time the restaurant was assessed in The New York Times. That hasn’t changed. Neither has the chef, Brad Steelman, who has been in his post since 2000.  The sailor’s “steady as she goes” might be the River Café’s motto. An opening salvo from the kitchen, a single shrimp on a Southeast Asian papaya salad with crushed peanuts, makes it clear that flavor epiphanies are not in store. The rack of lamb I ate recently, which was inside a skinny ring of mint jelly zipped up with mustard seeds, appeared to be the same dish Mr. Grimes described. (We both liked it.) Radiating like spokes from a hub of firm, hand-chopped steak tartare are lines of mustard, chopped capers, shallots, cornichons and chives: the usual suspects.  Mr. Steelman doesn’t need his garnishes to provide hologram moonwalks, though. His main ingredients are almost always good enough to be their own special effects. For his shrimp Oscar, he sets hollandaise boosted with blood-orange juice against beautifully sweet Pacific blue shrimp and meaty white lumps of crab. In another appetizer called Three Shells, strips of abalone dunked in a yuzu-kaffir bath and firm little kumamoto oysters in a classic mignonette had the shining immediacy of great seafood, too, even if the third shell, Taylor Bay scallops ceviche, didn’t quite keep up. And while poached lobster could probably find more exciting companions than celery root purée and slightly sweet-sour butternut squash dice, the lobster itself was tender and sweet enough to be a solo act. A duck breast whose skin has a terrific crisp shellac, seasoned with lavender and a trace of dried chiles, was better served by the cozy Eastern European comfort of glossy braised red cabbage and crisp squiggles of sweet-potato spaetzle. Some of Mr. Steelman’s ideas can be questioned. His extremely good Barolo-braised oxtail appetizer would get along nicely with either polenta or pasta, but perhaps not with polenta stuffed inside pasta. And he piled too much breading on fried oysters, which were rescued from dryness only by their topping of smoked salmon and caviar. In general, though, he sticks to classic notions and we get the rewards; his mushroom Wellington turns the obligatory vegetarian main course into a real event. Desserts, included in the three-course $115 fixed-price dinner, could use refreshing. Vanilla ice cream and vanilla ice milk turn up on several, with no noticeable taste of vanilla. But that didn’t hurt the milk-chocolate soufflé, already sweetened by a melting cap of toasted marshmallow, or the chocolate marquise straddled by a dark chocolate replica of the Brooklyn Bridge’s towers and cables.  Maybe a chocolate bridge is a little hokey, but so is dropping to one knee in front of the Manhattan skyline. In both cases what counts is not the originality of the gesture but its sincerity. In its desire to sweep us into its secluded, flower-strewn island, the River Café is sincere in a way that restaurants hardly ever are these days. At the end of a night there, I always regret that it’s time to come back to the mainland.

194,El Quinto Pino,2 star,"May 13, 2014",Pete Wells,Chelsea,Spanish,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/dining/restaurant-review-el-quinto-pino-in-chelsea.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/dining/restaurant-review-el-quinto-pino-in-chelsea.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The name means “the fifth pine,” a Spanish idiom for the boondocks, which was probably a stretch even seven years ago when El Quinto Pino opened on West 24th Street, across from the canyon wall of London Terrace. The thumbnail curve of the sardine-can tapas bar is just the way it’s been since the beginning, packed, every seat there and on the opposite wall a few inches away taken almost any time you show up.  Turn right at the door, though, and you’ll find something new. Last fall, El Quinto Pino’s owners and chefs, Alex Raij and her husband, Eder Montero, took over the lease on the apartment next door and filled it with tables, making their sardine can a real restaurant. “It won’t make a bid for your entire night: You will snack at El Quinto Pino and almost inevitably eat more somewhere else,” Peter Meehan wrote in a “$25 and Under” column in 2007, its last review in The New York Times. With a reservation for that side room you won’t need to go anywhere else for dinner. You won’t want to, either, once the food starts zooming out of the kitchen. Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero also own Txikito, across Ninth Avenue, which digs into Basque cuisine, and La Vara, in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where the menu is a master’s thesis on Moorish and Jewish imprints upon Spanish cooking. A short “menú turístico” at El Quinto Pino investigates a different region of the country every few months, which gives regulars a reason to keep coming and gives the kitchen a launching pad for dishes that may hit the permanent roster. Other than that, the two chefs haven’t tied themselves down. Having laid down their Iberian credentials in their other restaurants, they’ve given El Quinto Pino a passport to roam around. Among the bar sandwiches tightly wrapped in paper is a visitor from New Orleans, a po’boy with closely packed, terrifically crunchy fried squid legs at its core. Another is a fortified Cubano, in which the ham and crisp pickle have more oomph than usual, the cheese doesn’t taste processed, for once, and the braised pork is supplemented with a red wallop of blood sausage. The chefs do a takeoff on Catalonia’s version of the croque monsieur, the bikini, but they aim a double-barreled blast of Mexico at it, topping the melted cheese with roasted poblanos and huitlacoche, the flamboyantly weird, mushroom-tasting black fungus that grows on corn ears.  Geographic freedom between pieces of bread was written into El Quinto Pino’s charter from the start, when Ms. Raij brought out (all rise, please) the uni panino. A pressed ficelle filled with creamy sea urchin, melted butter and a lashing of mustard oil, it became one of the city’s essential sandwiches. It still is, even though one night mustard-oil supplies must have run low and the panino wasn’t the same without its throat-catching rumble. The rest of the menu is made up of tapas-style plates, and the servers are careful not to overload the small tables, bringing just one or two at a time. The kitchen mostly presents these dishes as tangles that are easily shared, and resists the impulse toward multicomponent platings. With Raij-Montero portions, four people seems to be the breaking point at which you’re not so much eating as nibbling. I enjoyed El Quinto Pino more in a party of three, and best of all with just one accomplice.  Some of the seafood is so appealing and out of the ordinary that dividing it can test your ability to play well with others. I hated surrendering the last fried lump of sea anemone folded into soft scrambled eggs. Called ortiguillas, they tasted almost like fried oysters, but not quite, and I wanted to get to the bottom of that “not quite.” My curiosity and my appetite also wanted a few more runs at the Catalan salad xató, which mixed chicory and canned bonito with raw salt cod, soaked to pull out the salt and to reveal a flavor of quietly intensified fish. Dressed with both romesco and an uncooked tomato sauce, this salad seemed to get more lively with each bite. Tender, apple-blossom-pink gambas al ajillo get a little fresh ginger along with the garlic, an addition that made me want to eat them twice as fast. (Mashed and sliced avocado don’t have the same effect on an oddly inert salpicon of shrimp.) Smaller shrimp from Cadiz, the size of a paper clip and intensely flavorful in their shells, are pressed into a tortillita, a wonderful fritter that looks like a latke cooked under a brick. Fried on their own, these shrimp turn up again to bring a marine undertow to a jiggly poached egg with slivered snow peas.  The kitchen’s hand is so steady that it’s easy to pass over its occasional bobbles, unless you’re unlucky enough to be served two or three in a row. My disappointments were spread out: dully spiced lamb skewers; underseasoned bits of fried pork whose name, “bag of bacon,” raised undue expectations; seafood fideua, like paella made from noodles, that lacked the oceanic depth I loved when I had the same dish at La Vara. And it’s unclear how the xocolata dessert is meant to be served. One night the salt-sprinkled ingot of chocolate ganache was filled with fruity green olive oil that spilled out at the touch of a fork; I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed the pairing of the two ingredients more. On another, the oil was cold and congealed like Vaseline. Fortunately I had the excellent crema catalana, roused from its usual custardy slumber by cinnamon and lemon zest, to fall back on.  Everything I know about dating could be carved onto the head of a pin with a butter knife, but a younger man who lives down the block from El Quinto Pino assures me it’s a great date place. He didn’t mean the bar, with its was-that-your-foot? dimensions, but the new dining room. Separated from the drinkers by a galley kitchen, its 30 seats feel secluded and romantic, but not in an obvious way. The architect Silvia Zofio gave it a quietly domestic, midcentury look, with an earth-toned tapestry covering one wall and a chandelier that suggests the swoosh of a flamenco dancer’s skirt in mid-twirl. It’s a room for talking, and if it’s not exactly the boondocks, it’s easy enough to get lost there for an hour or two.

195,Cagen,2 star,"April 29, 2014",Pete Wells,East Village,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/dining/restaurant-review-cagen-in-the-east-village-and-ristorante-morini-on-the-upper-east-side.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/dining/restaurant-review-cagen-in-the-east-village-and-ristorante-morini-on-the-upper-east-side.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"“The chef calls this one the gun, because it hits you,” our server at Cagen said promisingly as she set the night’s last bite, a stubby little handroll, on the table. Glossy and dark, it looked, if you had a suggestible turn of mind, something like the barrel of a snub-nose revolver, with a metallic sheen it got from its seaweed wrapper, a rare blend of green and black kelp. The gunpowder was inside: an extra-hot, nostril-punishing slug of wasabi implanted alongside strands of sweet squash, waiting to go off when I bit into it. The maker of this nifty loaded firearm is Toshio Tomita, the chef and owner of Cagen, which opened last summer in the East Village. Mr. Tomita worked for 16 years for Nobu Matsuhisa, and he has his mentor’s ability to bend Japanese tradition in his own directions. If you’ve tasted the shiso chimichurri at Nobu, you won’t be surprised to hear that Mr. Tomita serves it with sashimi at Cagen, but this is his own version, made not just with shiso but also with wild Japanese wild ginger, yuzu juice and more than a little jalapeño. Next to it is a dish of soy cooked with mirin, but it was the chimichurri I kept coming back to, basting it on pliant slices of skipjack, sea robin or suzuki, the Japanese sea bass. One minute Mr. Tomita will do the unadorned, noninterventionist thing you expect from a Japanese chef. His ingredients, especially the fish he brings in from Japan, are often exceptional. Three broiled fillets of ayu, a Japanese trout, wore nothing but their shimmering skins, the better to show off their delicate freshwater taste. The next he will throw a curve. A plate of small appetizers offered ham deep-fried katsu style with a splotch of Worcestershire on its panko crust, along with a single mouthful of the Nobu classic, miso-marinated black cod, as irresistible as ever. But then there were two little flavor bombs of grape tomato halves barely cooked in white wine and yuzu. Were they pickles or candied fruit, or both? Either way, I wanted more. And what was inside this little paper parcel secured with a twist-tie? A pea-size speck of goat cheese, white chocolate and wasabi. It tasted like an after-dinner mint from another planet. Cagen inhabits the empty shell left behind by Kajitsu when it moved to Midtown. Kajitsu specializes in the vegan cuisine of Japan’s Zen temples, and the two basement-level dining rooms of the East Village original had a monastic severity; the walls were coated with sand from Kyoto, and everything else followed that color scheme. Mr. Tomita appears to have moved in and gotten right down to work, without putting too much energy into redecorating. Time has not brightened the interior’s subterranean charms, which could use a fresh coat of good cheer. You notice this more at the tables than you do at the counter, where Mr. Tomita’s samurai intensity supplies extra atmosphere. Cagen is a kappo ryori restaurant, in which the chef prepares most of the food facing the diners across a counter. (Mr. Tomita’s son, Rei, works on hot dishes out of sight in the kitchen.) You can pick a path across the à la carte menu or just free-fall with a seven-course, $120 omakase meal. It’s a question of budget and time, but the big splurge shows off all the things Cagen does very well: sashimi with that nervy chimichurri, sushi wrapped in grilled seaweed that crackles like autumn leaves, and zaru soba, served as three small ponytail bunches of cool soba noodles. The first is plain, the next is dusted with yuzu peel, the last is freckled with kuro shichimi, the black seven-spice blend. They all get dunked in a soy dipping sauce. When they’re gone, you get a pitcher of the hot, cloudy water they were cooked in, for pouring into the dipping sauce. Good as this fancy Cup-a-Soup was, I always wished I had more of the firm, nutty noodles. Then I would look over the counter at the two matching stones that grind each day’s soba flour out of whole buckwheat. Each stone is the size of a birdbath and they are powered by hand — Mr. Tomita’s hands. The thought of all that labor was the only thing that stopped me from asking for seconds. *** Given the rate at which Michael White’s Altamarea Group spits out restaurants these days, this column has adopted a new policy. The amount of time spent critiquing each Altamarea place will be proportional to the time Altamarea spent coming up with the idea. This review of Ristorante Morini, open since December, will be brief. The name, a tribute to Mr. White’s mentor in the kitchen, has been used before, at Osteria Morini, which this new restaurant doesn’t resemble in any way. The downtown osteria serves the fun, lusty food of Emilia-Romagna, while the ristorante, on the Upper East Side, is not defined by Italian geography or, really, much of anything. The website promises “pan-Italian regional cuisine with a menu that covers various seasonal specialties, both inland and coastal.” Well, that narrows it down. The menu is most similar to that at Mr. White’s Marea, and while seafood isn’t the only choice, in my experience it tended to outshine other options, like the fine but slightly dull sage-roasted chicken or short rib braised in red wine. Main courses were mostly memorable for their prices, which start at $35 and inflate from there. But dull dishes are rare. Gordon Finn, the executive chef, is turning out the most carefully prepared and well-considered food that the Altamarea Group has given New York since Ai Fiori opened in 2010. You should get an excellent meal if you stick to the cured and raw crudi, like the wonderful bay scallops with bits of pink grapefruit and dots of pistachio purée; the pastas, which are as good as they are at any Michael White restaurant, which is to say they are as good as at any place in the city; and dessert, overseen by Altamarea’s corporate pastry chef, Robert Truitt. What you won’t get is a solid argument for going there and not to another Altamarea subsidiary. If you want refined, expensive seafood, you can get it in much more attractive surroundings at Marea. Inside Ristorante Morini’s split-level space, the chandeliers look like grotesque experiments in stretched skin, and the artwork is the type that speaks eloquently of corporate tax write-offs. Ristorante Morini hasn’t bestirred itself to become a unique destination; it seems to want nothing more than a piece of the action in a neighborhood whose residents proved long ago that they don’t mind overpaying for pasta.",Sashimi; sushi; soba; black cod; seasonal seafood.
196,Telepan Local,1 star,"April 22, 2014",Pete Wells,TriBeCa,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/dining/restaurant-review-telepan-local-in-tribeca.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/dining/restaurant-review-telepan-local-in-tribeca.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Something happened to me recently at the Cleveland, a small restaurant downtown, that struck me as both unprecedented and inevitable. After a friend and I had finished a small opening snack, the server brought our appetizers and main courses. At the same time. It’s impossible to imagine any kitchen, even the most tragically inept one, making the same mistake five years ago. This was a pure symptom of the current small-plates epidemic. The old two-course menu has broken down so badly that some restaurants feel no obligation to send dishes out in any particular sequence, even if diners clearly order appetizers and mains, as we did.  Until we work out some protocols for small-plate dining, the way cultures like Spain’s have done, we’re going to be eating on a lawless, fast-changing frontier. Sometimes innovative restaurants like Recette or Pearl & Ash come swirling out of the chaos. At other times it coughs up half-formed and unconvincing places like Telepan Local.  It’s easy to imagine what Bill Telepan was thinking. Since 2005 he has done all his sensible, seasonal, ingredients-first cooking in one restaurant, Telepan, on West 69th Street. In a perfect city, Telepan’s success would have lured more places of its caliber to the Upper West Side. Instead, the center of gravity of Manhattan’s dining scene has migrated steadily downtown, while a looser style has swept in to make even relatively youthful places like Telepan look a bit antediluvian.  A small-plates menu in TriBeCa must have seemed like a way for Mr. Telepan to reach diners who couldn’t find Columbus Avenue without the aid of an Uber driver. In practice, Telepan Local, which Mr. Telepan opened on Greenwich Street in early January with Joel Javier as chef de cuisine, offers most of the drawbacks of small-plates eating and almost none of the advantages.  As at so many of these restaurants, the dishes at Telepan come out whenever, they land wherever, and you have no idea if you’re going to get too much food or too little. The meal unfolds, or unravels, on tables built in Nicaragua from dark and white slats of wood approximately cobbled together. They are the size of the ones in cocktail lounges where, in another era, people had manhattans and mixed nuts while waiting to be moved to the dining room. Now, this is dinner: glasses for water, wine and cocktails; blue carafes for carbonated water and clear ones for filtered tap; bottles of wine; plates for eating and plates for serving; and a votive candle, all vying for two or three square feet of real estate. Something’s got to give, and it is the silverware, which falls to the floor with surprising frequency. Or maybe it jumps, through some instinct for self-preservation. “We’re a farm-to-table American tapas restaurant,” my server said one night. “All the food is small plates that you can share.” In fact, many plates struck me as too small, even for one. The carrots, tiny and multicolored and al dente, tossed with oregano and bits of feta, come in a dish slightly bigger than a coffee lid. They cost $8, which in many restaurants would get you a side dish two or three times larger.  A special of bay scallops with black-trumpet-mushroom purée was delicious, but there were six of them, and three of us. The price was $16. A $12 plate of eggs scrambled with smoked trout and fried bread worked out to about two forkfuls for each of us.  These dishes were all sensitively made from great ingredients, but they were all a bit well-mannered for this style of dining. The best small plates cause a clamor. Sharing them provokes tension: Who’s getting the last bite? That question came up with the wonderful little grilled cheese panini topped with a Spanish tomato-garlic-olive oil spread. And I could imagine arguing over the sea scallops and diced fried potatoes bathed in warm olive oil and spicy Aleppo pepper.  But far more often, after a bite of, say, soft cauliflower in Cheddar sauce, or a mini-pizza with fried calamari over tomato sauce, or corned tongue with charred cabbage (really good) and Russian dressing (not quite as good), I would nod happily, and move on to the next thing. A single taste of some plates was too much. With its shrimp poppers — peculiarly bland fried shrimp stuffed with peculiarly bland crab and fish mousse — Telepan Local seemed to be trying to imitate Red Lobster and not quite succeeding. Fried watercress with cashews and chile sauce was an obvious homage to a Thai dish, yet it lacked the rippling energy of lime juice and fish sauce that any number of restaurants in Queens would have given it. Telepan Local’s pigs in blankets, however, perfectly mimicked everybody else’s pigs in blankets. Some of the best small-plates restaurants are glorified bars; picture tapas joints in Barcelona or izakayas in Tokyo or wine bars in Paris. Telepan Local looks at first as if it might fit the bill, with its long line of white barstools in an aggressively mirrored corridor up front. And the wine list is intriguing and affordable. But I had a hard time finding anybody who knew the bottles; one night my server couldn’t tell me about any of the three Greek whites except the one poured by the glass.  The cocktail list comes on strong, too. Most of the spirits are distilled locally; bitters are made on site. And I was surprised by the low-key sophistication of the Mai O Mai, a pineapple juice and rum concoction. The rest were too sweet, except for a gin and tonic that was too flat and a martini variant, the Jabberwocky, that was too warm. I had one of the worst desserts of the year at Telepan Local, a galette of underripe, undercooked pears on a gummy, doughy crust. I also had one of the best. Larissa Raphael, who pulls double duty as pastry chef here and at Telepan, has come up with a champion recipe for coconut cake that is rich like poundcake but lighter — poundcake that could fly. Maybe it can fly right out of this small-plates version of Telepan Local and into one that makes sense, not an American tapas restaurant but simply an American neighborhood restaurant. Some of the understated cooking that gets lost when it’s shared by the whole table might, in more generous portions, make lovely appetizers or main courses for one. ",Grilled cheese “pan com tomate”; foie gras jammers; vegetables; sourdough pizzettes; sea scallop bravas; pork shoulder with cranberry beans and kale; grilled beef short ribs with spicy fermented cabbage; coconut cake.
197,Jean-Georges,4 star,"April 8, 2014",Pete Wells,Upper West Side,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/dining/restaurant-review-jean-georges-on-the-upper-west-side.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/dining/restaurant-review-jean-georges-on-the-upper-west-side.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Jean-Georges is still a four-star restaurant. That is all. Thank you for your time. On second thought, there may be a little more to say. Because great restaurants can fade fast, especially these days, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s serene flagship serves a city vastly different from the one it set out to dazzle and seduce 17 years ago last month. Back then, Jean-Georges was a radical reimagining of the grand style of French dining, “an entirely new kind of four-star restaurant,” as Ruth Reichl put it in her review for The New York Times. Jean-Georges didn’t just blow the dust off the candelabra; it tossed them out. In a room that was all right angles and Manhattan energy, men and women servers (a rarity in formal restaurants then) circulated with unfussy, level, American poise. Most of all there was the brilliant cooking, which was lighter, brighter and more embracing of other cultures than French food had any right to be. What we want from restaurants is changing, though, along with our notions of luxury. The kind of comfort Jean-Georges excels at providing makes some diners distinctly uncomfortable. Chefs who couldn’t peel a banana when Jean-Georges Vongerichten got his first four-star review (for Lafayette, in 1988) now run adventurous, unluxurious dining rooms where people come for the journey and where the thrill of the ride is more important than the condition of the shock absorbers. Jean-Georges glides like a Mercedes sedan, but Mr. Vongerichten takes the curves like a Formula One driver. Consider the squab dish that just popped up on the menu. It comes on like jerk chicken, coated in a blackened rub, and while the seasonings are Middle Eastern, the searing heat is almost Jamaican. And here comes the creative leap that separates Mr. Vongerichten from other spice-peddlers: a hot sauce has been splashed around this charred squab, and it is made from flowers. A bright-orange blend of lime, fresh red chiles and peppery nasturtium petals, it makes the already fiery squab into what may be the spiciest dish ever served in a French restaurant. Over and over, Mr. Vongerichten takes risks that are almost shocking. A little canal dredged into a pool of sweet parsnip purée is filled with a fruity riesling raisin vinegar, straight up. Taste it alone and you pucker, but swirl it into the parsnips with a forkful of meltingly soft Arctic char under an airy black-truffle crust, and it’s spectacular. In the same vein, the buttermilk sauce under red sea bream sashimi or the unsweetened lemon mousse with raw sea trout and roe are almost acidic enough on their own to clean copper pots. Taste a little of everything, though, and the sourness takes its place and galvanizes the rest. There’s not much sleight-of-hand in Mr. Vongerichten’s cooking. Nearly everything is visible, and the effects can still take you by surprise. Won tons stuffed with grilled foie gras are squirted, somewhat randomly, with a spiced red-wine reduction, but what makes the dish take off are the tart, crunchy passion-fruit seeds and the raw papaya chunks livened up with a dab of lime gel. This skill for getting the greatest impact from just a few components is Mr. Vongerichten’s foremost talent. Most of the time, you couldn’t take something away from one of his dishes without hurting the whole. This is why so many of his classics still jump with energy; they’re not dragged down by pointless ornamentation. Was the sweet sea urchin with slivers of green chile and drops of yuzu on a tongue of black bread invented last week, or last century? What about that intensely aromatic lobster sauce seasoned with fenugreek and lemon grass that surrounds lobster on toast? Or the chicken with the Parmesan crust that stays crunchy for an improbably long time, even after crumbs have fallen into the lemon-butter sauce that has more lemon and more balance than ought to be possible? If you are having your first $118 four-course dinner at Jean-Georges, you won’t always know. Regulars will, though. And they may start to wonder, along with me, how many of Mr. Vongerichten’s new dishes are as indelible as his greatest hits? I couldn’t imagine improving on any of the six savory dishes I enjoyed on a $198 tasting menu of classics. They had all snapped into place for good. The only dish on a spring tasting (same night, same length, same price) that I could pay the same compliment to were the stout asparagus stalks under morels in hollandaise, and I recall people rhapsodizing about them in 1997. This could become a danger to Jean-Georges’s pre-eminence. Mr. Vongerichten and his business partner, Phil Suarez, run a company that is responsible for 22 restaurants around the world. Diners tend to worry about this empire-building in terms of quality control: Does the food suffer when the head of state is traveling? It can, even at Jean-Georges. At a recent lunch while Mr. Vongerichten was in Japan, a salmon tartare spring roll, one of the three little bites that opened the meal, wasn’t crisp enough to stand up to its lettuce wrap, and the fish was barely seasoned. Gulf shrimp in an appetizer were overpowered by the heavily toasted flavors of fried artichokes and mushrooms, and a lemon-fennel aioli lacked the verve to pull it all together. These were blips, though, well within the standard deviation for one of New York’s most daring and high-performing kitchens. In the long run, the greater question is whether Mr. Vongerichten is channeling more of his creativity into building new restaurants than into building dishes that might run 10 years from now on the classics menu at Jean-Georges. Because each dessert is made of several mini-desserts that riff on a single theme, it’s hard to tell whether any of them has the staying power of the molten chocolate cake. (It has a permanent spot on the chocolate-themed dessert, and remains better than its imitators.) But as constructed by the pastry chef, Joseph Murphy, almost all of them are deeply, instantly lovable. For anyone feeling left behind by the current fashion for scattershot, disputatious desserts, Mr. Murphy’s citrus tasting — with its tiny, crisp strudel filled with candied kumquats and pistachios, and its plush, delicately floral citron snow and citrus sections over amber riesling jelly — is an answered prayer. The wine list is book-length. But it is unusually nimble, built for versatility. The chief sommelier, Laura Williamson, has a bottle up her sleeve for any trick the kitchen might pull. Listening to her or one of her colleagues suggest a wine can be a quick, thoughtful education in the principles of pairing. The rest of the dining room staff has the original poise and unfawning attentiveness, but servers can seem remote. Smiles bloom beside some tables, but not all. Lately some top-tier restaurants have invented a new style of service that is seamless, intuitive, guided by a species of emotional intelligence. Jean-Georges hasn’t quite evolved. Examples are so minor that they may sound petty, but here’s one. A guest of mine approached the reception desk, a sci-fi podium populated by a row of three or four humans with unnervingly perfect teeth, at the same time as two other diners. A host tried to pair them off: “Are you two together?” Um, no. Another attempt was made: “Are you two together?” Unless Mr. Vongerichten is trying to run a matchmaking service, there are smoother ways to begin. The game can always be played at a higher level. That is the challenge for any restaurant that wants to shine among the striving competition. And Jean-Georges does shine. The restaurant was redesigned in graceful, gentle curves by the architect Thomas Juul-Hansen in 2008 (two years after Frank Bruni’s four-star review, its last evaluation in The Times) and is the most elegant modern dining room in the city. The enormous windows let in the setting sun, and sometimes they catch the moon rising over the treetops in Central Park. You are in the city and hovering slightly outside it all at once. Then the food arrives, the flavors fall into their startling alignments, and there is only one place you could be: Jean-Georges.",Sea urchin with black bread; scallops with caramelized cauliflower; asparagus with morels; Parmesan-crusted chicken; smoked squab with nasturtium vinaigrette; duck breast with cracked almonds; all desserts.
198,The Shakespeare,1 star,"April 1, 2014",Pete Wells,,English,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/dining/restaurant-review-the-peacock-and-the-shakespeare-in-midtown.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/dining/restaurant-review-the-peacock-and-the-shakespeare-in-midtown.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"My dinner date had eaten in this room before. A Williams College graduate, she remembered its earlier incarnation as the school’s alumni club. “I practically lived here at one point,” she said, looking over her shoulder at the stuffed peacock stashed in one corner. “I took almost all my meals here.” How was the food? “Ghastly.” By the end of the night, she announced it is much better now. For that, she can thank her fellow alumni for selling the building on East 39th Street to a developer who turned it into a boutique hotel. Called the William, it opened before Christmas with two upholstered cocktail lounges and two distinct places to eat reformed English cooking. We were upstairs in the Peacock, a civilized, grown-up restaurant where Ray Charles shimmies from the speakers and the wine list is refreshingly nondenominational. One floor below, in the English basement (what other kind would an English restaurant use?) is the Shakespeare, a rustic pub with a rock soundtrack, soccer on both televisions and taps for British lagers and cask ales. The two spots share a kitchen, a chef named Robert Aikens and just enough dishes to justify corralling them into a single review. The food I ate during two dinners at the Peacock and one at the Shakespeare was always appealing; the settings were somewhat less so. This was particularly true in the Shakespeare, where in the early evening packs of beer drinkers can crowd out those of us who are there to find out if the shepherd’s pie made by Mr. Aikens is better than the mound of ruined groceries that went by the same name in our mothers’ kitchens. It is, by leaps and bounds. The potato crust, golden with sharp Cheddar cheese, blanketed a lamb stew, thickly spiced with thyme and rosemary. All winter, I had hoped something would push back at my interior polar vortex. This cast-iron pot of ground meat buried under mashed potatoes finally did. Other pub standards at the Shakespeare were true to form, like the highly credible bangers and mash and the fish and chips, with a light sheath of custardy batter around a hunk of very fresh cod. The Scotch eggs, molten at the yolk and wrapped in juicy, salty sausage before being plunged into the fryer, were good enough to eat by the dozen, although I would be round as an egg if I had tried. I was annoyed, though, when the $16 “pint of prawns” turned out to be a pint glass of ice cubes holding up five nearly flavorless boiled shrimp. The Shakespeare needs to do better than that if it wants customers to put the emphasis on the first word of “gastro pub.” Right now, it lands firmly on the second. The Shakespeare’s two rooms have low timbered ceilings, and the one with the bar, where I sat, has two TVs bigger than some movie screens. I couldn’t make out much beyond that because the place was crammed with after-work warriors there for the drinks, not the food. I couldn’t hear much, either. But I did feel something: the creeping damp chill of a full pint of beer that someone, in the crush of bodies, had knocked over on me. A champion drink spiller myself, I wasn’t upset. My soaked jeans did undercut the warming effect of the shepherd’s pie, though. If I had wanted to get out of those wet clothes and into a dry martini, one of the two cocktail dens at the top of the stairs would have been the place to do it. The armchairs are plush, the paneling is polished, the fireplaces are burning (with gas, but still) and the bartenders don’t smirk as they mix cocktails as well structured as a Savile Row suit. The William has given Midtown the hotel bar that I’ve always wanted out of the Algonquin. The fireplaces came with the building. The plush and polish were supplied by Reid & Taylor Studios, which also designed the Peacock’s two contrasting dining rooms. One has the flickering allure of the cocktail dens up front, along with emerald wallpaper in a peacock pattern. I wanted to eat below those peacocks. Apparently so did everyone else, because there were never any free tables. Instead, I was seated in what’s called the Garden Room. Bright and oddly underdecorated, it is probably a better place for lunch than for the nocturnal consumption of meat pies. Mr. Aikens, a veteran of Le Gavroche in London, has done the gastro-pub thing before, as chef of the Dandelion in Philadelphia. He is far from a flashy cook. He just believes in doing things the right way, which often means the hard way. As our server put it, “The simpler the dish, the more complicated he makes it.” For gammon steak, which in most parts of England would mean a slice of ham on a plate, canned pineapple optional, he starts from scratch. The ham is pork loin, brined in the kitchen, then grilled, as is the slab of fresh pineapple. Potato purée below, a sunny-side egg on top. I can’t imagine finding a better gammon steak in England. Details elevate dishes like an honest chicken soup, or grilled Spanish mackerel on toast: the velvety, chardlike softness of the wilted spinach; the sweet-tart tension of the sherry vinaigrette; the crisp snap of the bacon. Roasted chicken came with a terrific plank of fresh pork-and-sage sausage and a run of gravy that neatly managed to taste rich but not oily. I appreciated the robust and musky spices and the fluffy grains of biriyani rice with a lamb curry straight from the kitchens of the Raj. The desserts are staunchly English and tended by Mr. Aikens himself. In another restaurant, this might relegate them to stepchild status, but not here. Mr. Aikens lavishes care on them, not to mention historical research and generous amounts of cream, eggs and butter. The result is a roster of sweets as deeply gratifying as any I’ve spooned my way through in the past year. One night, Mrs. Beeton’s Snow Egg appeared on the Shakespeare’s blackboard. The dish, a version of the French oeufs à la neige, comes from Isabella Beeton’s 1861 manual on household management. In Mr. Aikens’s hands, the meringue egg, rising from a sea of warm custard like steam from a hot bathtub, was studded with cracked pralines and decorated with kumquats in syrup. English cooks can work a hundred variations on the same idea, so another night brought a bowl of custard mixed with brioche crumbs below dime-size domes of meringue, melting and soft like marshmallows on a stick. Sandwiched in the middle was warm, fresh raspberry jam. It goes by the name the Queen of puddings, and asking for it is almost as good as eating it.",Gammon steak; madras lamb curry; Queen of puddings; Scotch eggs; shepherd’s pie; fish and chips; sticky toffee date pudding; banoffee trifle.
199,Rôtisserie Georgette,2 star,"March 18, 2014",Pete Wells,Upper East Side,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/dining/restaurant-review-rotisserie-georgette-on-the-upper-east-side.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/dining/restaurant-review-rotisserie-georgette-on-the-upper-east-side.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Earlier this year Rôtisserie Georgette put a new chef in charge of its spit-roasted chickens and fish, its fries flecked with tarragon and its baby potatoes heavy with meat drippings, and I couldn’t tell the difference. This is meant as praise, and not the damning-with-faint kind. The cult of the new in restaurants has brought us many wonders, but it has also left us with the curse of compulsory creativity. It’s no longer enough for chefs to cook hot food that makes us happy; they are supposed to dumbfound us with flavors the human tongue has never tasted.  This is why writers like me devote energy to, for example, puzzling postmodern taquerias while taking for granted the simple excellence of traditional ones. The change in restaurant culture is something like the shift that overtook popular music after the Beatles. Singing old Cole Porter tunes was out; suddenly every kid with a guitar and an amplifier was supposed to have the songwriting chops of Lennon and McCartney combined. Rôtisserie Georgette isn’t writing any new music. The kitchen, now under Chad Brauze, plays standards from the French songbook and plays them well, with what a colleague who has eaten high and low around the city calls “a refreshing lack of creativity.” If this restaurant had a clock, its hands would be stopped at five minutes before nouvelle cuisine, when meat was carved to cover the plate and sauce came on the side and nobody turned down potatoes, when people eating a roast with a good but not-too-expensive Bordeaux could hardly imagine a better night out.  You can feel this way at Rôtisserie Georgette, although the joys of time travel end with the Bordeaux. Jean-Luc Le Dû’s list has an affordable 2002 Haut-Médoc from Château Lanessan for $62, but the other red Bordeaux have  been adjusted for inflation and then some. Rôtisserie Georgette has a real rotisserie and a real Georgette, both easy to spot.  There are two rotisseries, in fact, standing back to back in the open kitchen. The one facing the dining room is a tall steel model with brass trim, loaded up with pudgy chickens, small flocks of stuffed quail, dorade locked in a cage with lemon wheels and thyme branches.  There is one Georgette. Her last name is Farkas. A coiled spring of proprietary energy, Ms. Farkas started cooking in restaurants at 15, attended hotel school in Switzerland and interned with Alain Ducasse in Monte Carlo. She was on her way to running a restaurant of her own when Daniel Boulud offered her a job. After she said yes, she learned that she would be handling marketing and public relations.  That little gig lasted 17 years, which may be one reason that Rôtisserie Georgette seemed to have traveled from another decade when it landed on East 60th Street last November. The loft-height walls are hung with a cluster of antique mirrors, an Aubusson tapestry and bronze Louis XV-style sconces. Carpeting helps muffle the noise, which tends to wane around 9 p.m. This is an early-to-bed crowd, and with an 8:15 reservation one night I was the last to leave. At one end of the room is a porter’s chair, its egg-shaped back upholstered in leather. Now I know where to seat the dowager countess when she comes to visit. In some ways Rôtisserie Georgette is a delayed-gratification version of the restaurants opened in the ’70s and ’80s by young Americans who fell for European ways of dining. What set Ms. Farkas’s heartstrings humming were the rotisseries of France.  Rôtisserie Georgette will sell you half a chicken for $24 or a whole one, which feeds two people for $36 each. The economy model, raised on an Amish farm in Indiana, is rubbed with herbes de Provence and cracked coriander seeds. Roasted chickens don’t always pick up the flavor of the herbs they’re stuffed with. These birds do. The legs are tender without disintegrating into strands, as rotisserie dark meat can do. The white meat is close to ideal, with just a whisker of dryness at the narrow tips. The pricier chicken is called the poule de luxe, French slang for a woman with high upkeep costs. It is brought up in Pennsylvania under Mennonite supervision, hides a terrific mushroom stuffing under its skin, and features a slab of seared foie gras that is both unsatisfying and beside the point. Too bad you can’t get the stuffing without paying for the liver, but I’m sure if I were French I’d understand that this is always the way with a poule de luxe. There is nothing fancy about the quail, just juicy meat wrapped around a pale-pink poultry forcemeat seasoned with paprika and piquillo peppers. The dorade, roasted whole and then filleted, breaks into beautiful white lemon-scented chunks.  A special one night was rotisserie duck à l’orange, carved and arranged on a silver platter. Mr. Brauze had defied the modern rule of duck cookery, taking the breast all the way to medium. He knew what he was doing, because medium-rare meat wouldn’t have taken as well to the bittersweet orange-peel sauce. Only once was I served meat that didn’t come off the spit at the ideal moment: a crumbly, dried-out lamb shoulder with a merguez stuffing that tasted as if it had been left out in the rain. With any main course, the fat-basted rotisserie potatoes are almost required, although the frites, fried to a mahogany crisp, will also do. But a strict meat-and-potatoes diet can be supplemented by creamed spinach with garam masala, tiny and fiery-hot brussels sprouts and purple cabbage stewed with cider and bacon. I’d be surprised if the vegetables at Ms. Farkas’s long-ago French rotisseries were worth noticing, but these are.  Ms. Farkas put her first initial on the better of two salads, the salade G, with a time-tested mix of endive, pears, blue cheese, bacon and candied walnuts. There is also a salade Francine. If I were Francine, I’d be on the phone with my agent trying to get my name taken off it. Nicole Kaplan, the pastry chef who made her name at Eleven Madison Park and Del Posto, handles the desserts, mostly stock characters from the bistro repertory. The tarte Tatin has been circling the target: the caramel was too scorched one time, not scorched enough the next. But the chocolate soufflé hit the bull’s-eye, and so did the dark chocolate pot de crème in a coffee mug. Neither was the least bit surprising. That’s a compliment, too.

200,Contra,2 star,"March 11, 2014",Pete Wells,Lower East Side,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/12/dining/restaurant-review-contra-on-the-lower-east-side.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/12/dining/restaurant-review-contra-on-the-lower-east-side.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The outside makes no grand statements. A glass wall stares out at a not-yet-trendy block of Orchard Street. It’s blank except for the small menu posted by the door, offering five courses for the relatively modest sum of $55. Hanging on one inside wall, more art than ad, and almost invisible unless you are walking southbound very close to the window, is the restaurant’s name in red neon script: Contra. At work in a compact kitchen at the far end of the earnest and narrow dining room are two chefs whose ambitions for Contra are anything but small. They want to create a style of cooking that New York can call its own. “This is an incredible food city, but sometimes you can see a lack of identity in the restaurants here, where people want to channel another place, another time,” Jeremiah Stone, a former sous-chef of Rino in Paris who helped open Isa in New York, told Eater shortly before the restaurant opened in October. “They want to do modern Thai, Roman, creative French.” His partner in the kitchen, Fabian von Hauske, who worked in the pastry kitchen of Jean Georges and, briefly, at Faviken in Sweden, pursued the idea. “I don’t think there’s that much of a style here,” he said. “You go to San Francisco and there is definitely a style there when you go to places like Coi or Commis. I think there should be more of an identity here, something that’s contemporary that you can’t find anywhere else.” In most other cities, hatchets would be out for a pair of 20-something chefs who rode into town promising to show everybody how it’s done. But not New York. Here we just say, All right, kids, let’s see what you’ve got. What Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have is a personal, understated, modern approach to deeply seasonal cooking. Mr. von Hauske makes the desserts and the bread, which costs an extra $3 and is worth it for the supremely creamy butter alone. Mr. Stone does the rest, but their styles are compatible. I’m not enthusiastic about what strikes me as a Northern European phobia of spices, but I came to admire their restraint with salt and added fat. You can see this approach catching on among other young chefs, some of whose food gets lumped in with the New Nordic movement. A more accurate name for their quiet, naturalistic, drama-averse approach may be mumblecore cuisine. Contra, at the moment, pulls it off with an originality that is sometimes dazzling and always worth following. The monkfish that appeared one recent night was cooked with faultless timing, roasted slowly, with the kind of tender pink center you’d find inside a seared scallop. It shared its chunky earthenware plate with leaves of charred kale, a marmalade of caramelized onions and a fish-sauce foam, but if you are thinking Vietnamese-molecular fusion, forget it. The fish sauce was a complex and milky froth made of monkfish bones and smoked trout, and it was very, very good.  This was truly expressive cooking, exploring shades of flavor more watercolor than acrylic. The dish is either changed or gone by now, no doubt, but the impression lasted. And I won’t forget Contra’s pairing of chicken breast with pickled daikon, toasted sesame seeds and blood sausage. The sausage had been transformed into a swipe of soft, tangy, beet-red paste, dotted with marjoram leaves and tart nubs of dried raspberries. It all came together in a way so unexpected and right that I had to shake my head.  New dishes roll onto the tasting menu every few days, and old ones are subject to restless tinkering. (Old, at Contra, means anything that was invented before today.) The first time I ate monkfish there, a mash of raw walnuts and garlic in miso was trying out for the role that was later played, with more depth, by the onion jam. And I liked watching the evolution of a raw scallop dish outfitted with noodle-like ribbons of raw kohlrabi. As wide as seatbelts the first time, they had slimmed down and looked more like fettuccine the next. On the other hand, the dried raspberries had gone from the blood-sausage swoosh the second time I saw the monkfish. I missed them a little.  You get the luck of the draw at restaurants that offer only tasting menus, but the format suits Contra’s food unusually well. The flavors are subtle, and on first encounter it’s a bit like walking out of the daylight and into a candlelit room: you need to adjust. Five courses is enough time to open your eyes (you may get more time than you need on nights when the pace drags). Another advantage of the tasting menu becomes clear when you are served dessert, followed by a second dessert. As you may have guessed, Mr. von Hauske is judicious with sugar and quite comfortable with vegetables. I liked a beets-and-yogurt number more than I did a creamed gianduja studded with tough sunchoke chips that put up more of a fight than I could face at the end of the night. But at least I knew everybody else would be crunching along with me, and I’d already smiled my way through a less-antagonistic dessert, a kind of rebuilt apple crisp, with an oat crumble and whipped oat-infused custard around a cider-like apple granita. This dessert was pure fun and charm, like Mr. von Hauske’s partnering of tangerine granita with a smooth popcorn-infused mousse and smashed bits of caramel popcorn.  Linda Milagros Violago, who stocked the cellars at Mugaritz in Spain and Geranium in Denmark, has put together a list of bottles from the kind of small winemakers who think of themselves as farmers and avoid modern tricks. The results aren’t always what you’d predict; a French cider, she said, had a note of blue cheese, and it did. The list almost forces you to try something unfamiliar, which feels just right for this restaurant.  I hope Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske achieve all their goals except the one about creating a shared New York style. The crazy riot of voices chattering in hundreds of accents is the whole point of this crazy, riotous city they have adopted. We don’t need other chefs imitating Contra’s style. We’ve got the original now.",
201,Gotham West Market,2 star,"Feb. 11, 2014",Pete Wells,Clinton,"American, Coffee Shops, Diners, Japanese, Sandwiches, Spanish, Tapas",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/dining/restaurant-review-gotham-west-market-in-hells-kitchen.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/dining/restaurant-review-gotham-west-market-in-hells-kitchen.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"WHEN I ASKED a friend to meet me for dinner at a food court near the Javits Convention Center, he acted as if I had suggested we fill a fanny pack with Hot Pockets and eat them on the back of a bus. After that, I sharpened my sales pitch. I told people that we would be inhaling ramen that is famous in Tokyo, and for good reason. I said that we would be drinking beers that were more unusual and delicious than what they were used to, and that for ballast we’d put down a layer of lamb sausage. I noted that we might sit at a tapas bar that in flavor and spirit comes as close to the Spanish ideal as any place in New York.  That worked. Once I had convinced them, my guests tended to like everything about this food court, called Gotham West Market, except getting there. It occupies a block of 11th Avenue in the West 40s that lately feels less like Hell’s Kitchen than Hell’s Freezer. But the inconvenient address is the reason this new eating adventure exists. It was built to lure renters to Gotham West, the 1,238-unit apartment complex above and behind it. As any New York real estate agent can tell you, even buyers who think of themselves as pioneers don’t want to mill corn and slaughter hogs like Pa Ingalls. Gotham West’s developer tried to answer that objection by bringing forth a troop of places to eat in a spot that had almost none.  It is not the only effort to upgrade the food court, long the province of soft pizzas, sludgy stir-fries and swollen cinnamon rolls. A few blocks south, the sprawling Hudson Yards development will have a food hall (the preferred term these days), as will Brookfield Place in Battery Park City. This spring, Crown Heights in Brooklyn will get Berg’n, a beer hall with food from stalwarts of the Brooklyn Flea and Smorgasburg. Anthony Bourdain, meanwhile, has driven his fans into a near frenzy with his plan to bring street food from around the world to Manhattan.  With an unusual degree of imagination, Gotham West smartly stakes out a middle ground between the star power that packs Eataly and the hope of discovery that drives small-business proving grounds like Smorgasburg and the Golden Shopping Mall in Flushing, Queens.  Somewhere between famous and brand new, at least to New Yorkers, is Ivan Orkin, the American chef who taught himself to make ramen in Tokyo. Manhattan is becoming enmeshed in ramen, but his noodles at Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop stand out from the tangle.  Of the traditional ramens, my favorites are the shio, a supercharged chicken soup of phenomenal depth and clarity, and the vegetarian shoyu, darker and heartier, tasting of soy sauce and roasted mushrooms. Both broths were scalding hot, with a fatty richness that made my lips slippery. After the first few mouthfuls of rye noodles, I put down my chopsticks and stared into the white ceramic bowl, trying to see where all that flavor was coming from. If I ever showed up at Slurp Shop in a linen suit, I might forgo slurping and order roasted-garlic mazemen, a more recent style that dresses the noodles in a thick sauce, something like Italian pasta. Or I might eat a rice bowl. The one with smoked whitefish tastes like a Japanese translation of a morning at Russ & Daughters. But I was even more taken by the one topped with tender, soy-rich pork and a smear of salty, sour plum paste.  The chef Seamus Mullen is here, too. His tapas bar, El Colmado, expands on the Spanish menu he developed at Tertulia but is set up so it’s easier to drop in and graze and drink wines from Catalonia or Bierzo and pretend that 11th Avenue is in Spain. El Colmado feeds the illusion. The cooks are dressed in sky-blue grocers’ jackets and dark gray caps, and the counter is propped with jars of squid and cans of pimentón next to oysters on ice. They are excellent, as is the Serrano ham, which falls from a vintage Berkel slicer in shaggy pink leaves that are meltingly pliable.  With the exception of fried artichokes smothered below overdressed arugula, the cooking has a light hand that befits the elemental flavors of Spanish cuisine. Frying is a strength, in croquettes filled with smoked eel, or fried whitebait, their pinpoint black eyes staring up from a swirl of lemon-yellow aioli. Lamb meatballs are a model of the form. So are the gambas al ajillo, red shrimp in a quarter-inch of garlic- and shrimp-infused olive oil that I would drink from a shot glass. The market showed some discernment in electing Caroline Fidanza’s Little Chef as a delegate from Brooklyn. Ms. Fidanza helped create the borough’s current restaurant aesthetic as the first chef of Diner in Williamsburg, before she downshifted to a smaller shop, Saltie. Little Chef’s menu expands a bit on Saltie’s, adding soups and spirited juice blends. (I’m a fan of the carrot and fresh turmeric cocktail.) The core mission is the same, though: lavishing care on breakfast and lunch with a modest roster of eggs and sandwiches. Simplicity is luxury in the Ship’s Biscuit, a raft of creamy scrambled eggs and ricotta on very fresh focaccia studded with crunchy sea salt.  Across the hall, staring down the largely vegetarian pleasures of Little Chef with a meaty gleam in its eye, is the Cannibal. An outpost of the cultish East 29th Street original steered by the chef Francis Derby, this baby Cannibal makes do without a full-fledged kitchen. Sometimes it shows; the brussels sprouts I had tasted like Thanksgiving leftovers. There is a baked Japanese sweet potato that was a wonderful thing to find at the end of a cold walk, but in general charcuterie is the strong suit here, like spicy lamb sausages in natural casings or a surprisingly gentle sausage of juicy rock shrimp with fennel pollen. Even better is the beer fridge, shelved with obscurities that the servers expertly match with your tastes.  Some spots are geared for the day-to-day needs of locals. Genuine Roadside is an all-day diner annex designed and run by AvroKO, the design firm that did the rest of the market. I got more of a kick out of the hipster-truck-stop décor, with its shelf of vintage beer cans that includes deep verticals of Schlitz, than I did from an uninspiring pulled pork sandwich or the hard-shell ceviche taco spackled together with guacamole. But if I lived upstairs, I would make an occasional lunch of the fried chicken sandwich. And I would be devoted to the high-end heroes built by the Court Street Grocers Sandwich Shop. Dessert is a weak spot, especially at night. Little Chef, which bakes homey sweets during the day, closes at 6 p.m. Another early closer is the Blue Bottle Coffee kiosk. The baked goods devised by one of its owners, Caitlin Freeman, like crisp almond biscotti with more than a hint of saffron and the excellent, sweet-and-savory shortbreads, taste best between sips of state-of-the-art coffee and espresso. After dark, the best choices are the old-school flan from El Colmado or the s’mores icebox cake from the Cannibal, worth ordering just so you can see the toasted marshmallow slab.  Nearly every vendor has counter seating, but servers will run food out to the communal tables and benches in the center of the hall, which is handy if you want ramen and your friends want tapas. The offer is always made with a smile; while the businesses are separately run, they share a common spirit of friendliness. It’s as if everybody knows you didn’t really want to come to 11th Avenue.

202,M. Wells Steakhouse,1 star,"Jan. 28, 2014",Pete Wells,Long Island City,"American, French",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/dining/restaurant-review-m-wells-steakhouse-in-long-island-city-queens.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/dining/restaurant-review-m-wells-steakhouse-in-long-island-city-queens.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The steakhouse is in trouble. Not financial trouble, because new ones keep opening, but spiritual trouble. Its soul is unwell. Because many other restaurants now offer better beef, the steakhouse serves little purpose except as a stage set for the dwindling number of occasions that require men to bond by spending money and consuming red meat together. Sensing that it has lost its swagger, chefs have tried to revive the genre by applying their culinary-school training. Their knifework is geometric, their potato recipes are French, their menus prettified with appetizers like diced raw bluefin under droplets of Ligurian olive oil. Each dish may be a delight on its own terms, but the whole approach is wrong. Trying to save the steakhouse by adding sashimi is like trying to improve a martial arts movie by casting Gwyneth Paltrow. We all know that there’s a problem, but only Hugue Dufour and Sarah Obraitis seem to have any idea how to fix it. Husband and wife, chef and manager, the two came to New York a few years ago and began waging a merciless attack on all that is fastidious and fussy in modern dining. First was the 18-month run of their gonzo diner, and then their “dinette” inside MoMA PS 1. Their most recent assault on propriety is M. Wells Steakhouse, which opened in November in a converted auto-body shop in Long Island City, Queens.  M. Wells Steakhouse needs some fixing itself. Discipline is not its strong suit, for better and for worse. It can lurch from magnificence to sloppiness, from inspired fever dreams to inarticulate notions that aren’t ready to leave the kitchen. One thing that needs improvement is the steak. This isn’t as fatal as you’d think, because when M. Wells Steakhouse succeeds, it does so in a deeply satisfying fashion, by feeding the lust in your gut for a meal that is not just a dinner but a feast.  Mr. Dufour and Ms. Obraitis get this. They know that we go to steakhouses to feel more alive. They respond appropriately, even if that sometimes means feeding us enough to kill us.  Let other chefs precisely engineer 130-degree steaks with immersion circulators and digital thermometers. Mr. Dufour has gone back to the cave, grilling meats over a crackling wood fire. This makes the steaks smoky, of course, and a little uneven, slightly overdone in spots, the meat seasoned with the scorch of burning fat. It’s an imperfect steak, and those imperfections are just the kind of the premodern thrill that makes a traditional steakhouse great. When we go to a steakhouse, we want to wrestle with our own appetites, to learn their exact dimensions. Luckily, confrontational portions are the way Mr. Dufour signs his name. I have eaten whole tasting menus that were less filling than the appetizers at M. Wells Steakhouse. French onion soup is more solid than liquid, stuffed with poached pork belly and a marrow bone (tiny spoon provided) that takes the natural beefiness of onion broth to its logical conclusion. Solomon Gundy, a dish that takes pickled smelts as its starting point, adds half a potato waffle, a huge outcropping of crème fraîche and a landslide of intensely crunchy trout eggs. If winter is getting you down, I’d prescribe one Solomon Gundy, to be taken at the bar with a glass of Champagne. (Étienne Guérin, imported from Montreal to be the wine director, has built a winningly nondogmatic list that is mostly French but doesn’t turn up its nose at a well-made retsina.) Less photogenic but just as wonderful are the sweetbreads blanquette in an unnervingly delicious expanse of white sauce. The blanquette is also offered as a side dish, but only the appetizer version is served on a plateful of mashed potatoes. There are two very good salads as well. Do not be naïve enough, however, to think that you will be eating lightly by ordering the romaine Caesar under a heap of grated Parmesan, as fluffy and white as the frosting on a coconut cake, or the improbably crisp grilled iceberg wedge in a blue cheese dressing speckled with bacon and candied pecans.  Ready for your pork chop tower? Here come a half-dozen thin-cut grilled chops piled up, with a salty pat of anchovy butter between each one, as if it were a stack of pancakes. It’s deranged and wonderful. With other main courses, though, we have to face the unpleasant reality that dinner at M. Wells Steakhouse can at times resemble “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”, that all this heroic swaggering comes with a certain amount of swaying and weaving and stumbling over the furniture, gastronomically speaking.  A Moroccan tagine with soft hunks of full-flavored lamb was as sweet as Jell-O salad. A torpedolike lobster roll tasted of its bun, and not much else. In the caviar sandwich, the pop and brine of what must have been a fat helping of sturgeon roe from Florida were muffled between two fried planks of Texas-toast-size bread. I kept thinking of what I could have done with that much caviar, or the $50 I’d just spent.  I wasn’t much happier paying $17 for the bone-in burger, a dense bundle of ground beef on the very low end of the juiciness and tenderness scales. The dish, with a swoosh of bone jutting out from within the bun, is a hit on Instagram. Too bad I couldn’t feed it to my camera. The skin of the trout au bleu, netted from a tank in the kitchen, conked on the skull with firewood, gutted and slipped into a tangy court bouillon, is meant to turn blue, eponymously. Does it, though? Hard to tell, because it was always covered up by fingerling potatoes, cabbage and tartar sauce. The flavor and feel of the trout seemed terrific, but with so many things competing for attention, that was hard to tell, too.  And while the fire does great things to the steaks, the meat didn’t always live up to it. The grass-fed Kansas City strip was all elastic muscle and very little flavor. The somewhat retiring chateaubriand needed the help of a sauce, but sauces are sold separately, and nobody offered us one. The best steak I ate at M. Wells Steakhouse came from a neighbor’s tomahawk chop, grilled on a whole rib almost the size of a goalie’s stick. It could have served six, so we bartered for a taste. The meat gushed with juices and shiny, delicious fat.  M. Wells Steakhouse was in the works for about two years. Still, I sometimes got the sense that Ms. Obraitis and Mr. Dufour are making it up as they go along. They wanted a dessert cart but decided to keep it stationary, requiring customers to walk over to it to select one of Bethany Costello’s sweets. (I can save you the trip: Get the tall pile of cheesecake or the Paris-Brest, which crackles with scraps of hazelnut brittle.) It’s a crazy way to run a restaurant. And if Mr. Dufour can fix the trout dish and find a steak that has the tomahawk chop’s intensity for less than $200, I hope it stays that way. A great steakhouse should make you feel a little insane.",M.

203,Han Dynasty,0.75 star,"Jan. 21, 2014",Pete Wells,East Village,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/dining/restaurant-review-han-dynasty-in-the-east-village-and-hirohisa-in-soho.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/dining/restaurant-review-han-dynasty-in-the-east-village-and-hirohisa-in-soho.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Independent thinkers find this hard to admit, but when you see crowds of New Yorkers standing outside a bakery or putting their names on the list at the door of a restaurant, more often than not the food they’re hanging around for is worth eating.  Whether it’s worth the wait is a separate question. In general, though, the crowds know something. Dominique Ansel Bakery is a wonderland, and Maison Premiere’s happy hour is such an amazing bargain that I am afraid that simply mentioning it may spook the owners into charging more than a dollar for each pristine oyster. There are exceptions to this rule. It does not apply to lines formed by tourists who trade their vacation days for a handful of cake crumbs under a waxy helmet of frosting on Bleecker Street. Nor does it apply to lines for brunch. Be wary of the opinions of people who will endure hunger and hangovers for a free mimosa. And so far, the rule does not apply to the lines at Han Dynasty in the East Village, a Sichuan restaurant that has been quoting waiting times at dinner of 45 minutes or more since it opened around Labor Day. This is nothing new for its owner, Han Chiang. Lines have been a feature of the six Han Dynasties he operates in and around Philadelphia. Despite his habit of informing customers, in loud and profane terms, that certain items on the menu should not be ordered by anyone but children, Han Dynasty has been so popular that he plans to open 100 locations around the country.  I can think of quite a few towns where this would be great news, but I’m mystified by the popularity of Han Dynasty in Manhattan, where there are far better Sichuan restaurants. Han Dynasty’s translation of the cuisine has a thick American accent. Many main courses are heavy on sugar, bell peppers and especially MSG, which is often used in great, slashing doses. They come across as close relatives of the kung pao chicken made by the best Chinese takeout in your neighborhood. In fact, your local joint might do this Sichuan crossover hit better than Han Dynasty, whose version was one of the sweetest and least appealing things on the menu.  In the restaurant’s anemic interpretation of cumin lamb, floppy bands of meat, drenched in a syrupy sauce, were too wet to give off any of the amazing fragrance of toasted spices that announce the dish’s arrival before it reaches the table at Szechuan Gourmet in Midtown, Little Pepper in College Point, Queens, or a dozen other restaurants around town. Under the menu heading “Shifu Special” (shifu means, roughly, chef) is the classic Taiwanese dish Three Cup Chicken. By tradition, the sauce is made with a cup each of rice wine, soy and sesame oil. Han Dynasty seemed to add a cup of sugar, too, and applied so much sauce that the chicken, meant to be served sizzling, arrived in a caramel soup. Apart from the dan dan noodles, which needed more snap from black vinegar, the appetizers were a less cloying crew, their seasoning closer to the Sichuan spirit. Cold rabbit with peanuts in chile oil, with the thrilling, classic combination of red chiles and Sichuan peppercorns, made my lips vibrate like a tuning fork. Dry pepper chicken wings had all the crunch, complexity and aromatic power I’d missed in the cumin lamb.  I had hoped that somebody would curse at me when I ordered. It never happened. Actually, the service was unusually friendly and forthcoming with the kinds of detail about the dishes that can be hard to obtain in some Sichuan restaurants. And the egg-yolk-colored paint and modern, Chinese-themed art on the walls give the place some energy. Still, if I want Han Dynasty’s wings again, I’ll get delivery. A 45-minute wait for the doorbell to ring would be well within reason. There are no lines at Hirohisa, which opened last summer on a quiet SoHo block. Instead there are reservations, which lately have not been hard to come by. In some ways, it’s easy to see why the crowds have passed it by. The cooking is very Japanese, in the let-the-ingredients-speak mode that can leave some Americans cold. “It’s ... subtle,” one person at my table said. “Very subtle,” another said. At times, I agreed. Some of the grilled meat courses, for instance, didn’t leave an impression on my memory as large as the one they left on the bill.  But for the most part, I love the way Hirohisa Hayashi, the chef, brings out the whispering harmonies that result when one small wave of flavor laps against another.  He finds those harmonies in the way lightly charred blocks of sesame tofu come together with buttery lobes of sea urchin and shreds of fresh wasabi. And again in the bowl of raw salmon layered over white rice, which becomes a steaming soup as you add roasted green tea from a pot. And again in the gently sweet and seductive stew of lobster in white miso and dashi. But nuanced flavors can also be potent, as an omakase meal last fall made clear. Mr. Hayashi intensified grilled lamb by marinating it in red miso. Served on top of a hunk of grilled tilefish was a slab of broiled foie gras; the heat chased the fat from the liver, and this became the sauce for the fish. It was a dish to make you shake your head twice, once for how luxurious it felt, and again for how simple it was.  Hirohisa is a kappo-style restaurant, a form of Japanese dining in which the chef makes both hot and cold dishes behind a counter. There are two kitchen islands floating at the edge of the serene white dining room, one for cold dishes like sashimi and another where the cooking takes place. You watch the action and relax, drink in hand, as if a friend had invited you over for dinner. In this case, you’re drinking sake from a list of junmai (“subtle rice and water”), junmai ginjo (“unrestrained challenge”) and junmai dai ginjo (“a specific target”).  With a carafe on the table, the soft light flowing from alcoves in the ceiling, the chefs bending over their knives, all the lines around the city seem very far away.",Dumplings; won tons; dry pepper chicken wings; rabbit with peanuts in chile oil; mung bean noodle in black bean sauce; fish dry pot style.
204,The Bistro at Villard Michel Richard,0.5 star,"Jan. 14, 2014",Pete Wells,Midtown East,"American, French",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/15/dining/restaurant-review-the-bistro-at-villard-michel-richard-in-midtown.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/15/dining/restaurant-review-the-bistro-at-villard-michel-richard-in-midtown.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The first time I ate at Villard Michel Richard, the latest restaurant to dance among the frescoes and marble pilasters of the Villard mansion in Midtown, I strongly suspected that I was in an awful hotel restaurant.  This seemed like a connect-the-dots conclusion. It’s a restaurant. It’s in a hotel, the New York Palace. And it was awful.  That didn’t make any sense, though. Born in Brittany but a star in the United States, trained in pastry but adept in every corner of the kitchen, Michel Richard has been one of the most respected chefs in this country since the 1980s. Settling in Washington, he gave the city a restaurant, Citronelle, that earned national fame. Michel Richard was serious. He would not have come to New York last fall to open an awful hotel restaurant. Other possibilities had to be considered. Hoping that I was wrong about the awfulness, I went back two more times, concentrating on the à la carte menu served in the bistro on the Madison Avenue side of the restaurant rather than the tastings presented in a room named the Gallery, where dinner starts at $140 for four courses.  The Stanford White interiors look better than they have in years, thanks to the attention the design firm Jeffrey Beers International paid to the way light strikes the paintings and fireplaces. White’s giddily opulent Gilded Age rooms can awe out-of-town visitors. Two weeks before Christmas, the restaurant was full of little girls in fancy dresses, most of whom stared, hypnotized, into phones and tablets, although one young rebel held a doll in her lap. A glass cube in the center of the dining room shows off the wine stockpile amassed by Gilt, the last restaurant in this space. It’s not too hard to get a wonderful and affordable bottle, but you may have to manage on your own. One night, when my table of three wanted a little Beaujolais, the sommelier tried to sell us a magnum. Another time, when I asked for help choosing among more than 80 German whites, a manager said apologetically that he didn’t know much about them, and that the people who did weren’t around. Still, I always ended up drinking well. And if everything had been on the level of the roasted chicken, the rustic bean soup and the salmon fillet on a bed of lentils energized with balsamic vinegar, Villard Michel Richard would easily qualify as an average hotel restaurant. But many other dishes vaulted across the gap that separates average from awful. Think of everything that’s great about fried chicken. Now take it all away. In its place, right between dried-out strands of gray meat and a shell of fried bread crumbs, imagine a gummy white paste about a quarter-inch deep. This unidentifiable paste coats your mouth until you can’t perceive textures or flavors. It is like edible Novocain. What Villard Michel Richard’s $28 fried chicken does to Southern cooking, its $40 veal cheek blanquette does to French. A classic blanquette is a gentle, reassuring white stew of sublimely tender veal. In this version, the veal cheeks had the dense, rubbery consistency of overcooked liver. Slithering around the meat was a terrifying sauce the color of jarred turkey gravy mixed with cigar ashes. If soldiers had killed Escoffier’s family in front of him and then forced him to make dinner, this is what he would have cooked. Yes, Villard Michel Richard is, in fact, an awful hotel restaurant. But it still didn’t make any sense. Was Mr. Richard not the chef I had thought? Were the ecstatic reviews, the five awards from the James Beard Foundation, the induction into the Maîtres Cuisiniers de France, all a mass delusion? I doubted that, but to make sure I had dinner at Central Michel Richard, a bright, loud French-American bistro that opened in Washington in 2007. (Citronelle has been closed since 2012.) If a dish was served in both cities, I ordered it. In every case, the Washington version looked and tasted better, for the same price or less. Mr. Richard makes a chicken-liver mousse he calls faux gras, and at Central it was so silky and rich that the pun was not much of a stretch. The one in New York wouldn’t be mistaken for anything but mediocre chicken liver.  Lobster bisque in Washington had a robust shellfish intensity. The Villard version was floury, pale and almost completely bland; you could get nearly as much flavor by putting a lobster bib into a juicer.  A frisée salad at Central was garnished with crunchy little croutons, freshly crisped bacon matchsticks and a warm poached egg. At Villard, the croutons were stale, the bacon limp and the egg cold.  The strangest thing about my dinner at Central was the fried chicken. It looked like the one at Villard, but it was terrific. The difference between them was like the difference between winning a medal for figure skating and falling through the ice.  Mr. Richard was so clearly a smart, accomplished chef that for one crazy moment, I wondered if Villard Michel Richard was bad on purpose. Maybe he was paying tribute to the awful hotel food of years past, the way Grant Achatz and Dave Beran of the restaurant Next are paying homage to Chicago’s steakhouse tradition. The seafood pasta, after all, is almost a direct quote from the 1980s, when doughy, gluey, overcooked fresh pasta and washed-out bits of unidentifiable seafood drooped in flavorless pink sauces. Of the same vintage, and just as bizarre, were the mushrooms under a tower of puff pastry ringed with cold, mud-colored sauce that tasted of uncooked wine. (If Villard Michel Richard doesn’t make it as a restaurant, it could reopen as the Museum of Unappetizing Brown Sauces.) The flaw with this hypothesis was the desserts. They broke character. Mr. Richard’s elegant, reverse-engineered Kit Kat bar; his rectangle of classic crème brûlée with mango sauce; his profiteroles in the style of a croquembouche, with a steeple of puff pastry spheres enclosing the ice cream and a pitcher of warm chocolate sauce to be poured over the top: They were all too good to be a joke. The girls in dresses even put down their phones for the celebration cake, a chocolate drum that shoots out sparks and, when you break it open, reveals a jumble of fruit and spongecake. There was another possibility: Perhaps the restaurant was awful because Mr. Richard wasn’t actually involved. It’s true that he is not the owner, but neither does he have the kind of licensing and consulting deal that has often made the names of Gordon Ramsay or Todd English little more than celebrity endorsements. He is a partner, a publicist said, sharing in profits and overseeing “day-to-day operations.” A union contract limits his ability to hire and fire cooks, but that didn’t keep Paul Liebrandt and Justin Bogle from pulling off formidable technical feats when they ruled this kitchen. There is one more theory. Villard Michel Richard may be a symptom of the deal-making culture that afflicts the restaurant business. Too many chefs are being tempted with too many offers from too many developers and investors. Hotels especially know that a famous name lures travelers, who won’t realize until it’s too late that the food being served has nothing in common with the cooking that made the name famous.  Opening a restaurant used to be a brutal process, and for many chefs it still is. If you’ve spent your own money and borrowed from your friends and family, you’re too scared to slack off. But the best-known chefs don’t have to worry about this anymore. It’s become much easier for them to open restaurants. Maybe it’s too easy, because running one is still as hard as ever.",Napoleon; celebration cake; crème brûlée; profiteroles.
205,Toro,2 star,"Dec. 31, 2013",Pete Wells,Chelsea,Spanish,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-toro.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-toro.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I can’t remember what we were eating at Toro, the new tapas restaurant in far western Chelsea, when one of the people at my table looked up in wonder. It could have been when we were swaying like drunken sailors over the suquet de mariscos, a chowder by way of Catalonia with cool sea urchin and warm lobster bobbing in parsnip-infused milk. Or when we had finished the last shrimp in the gambas al ajillo and were scraping up the last bits of a sauce for which a tank full of lobsters must have given their shells. Or when we were crunching through croquetas of ham mixed with unmistakably earthy meat from a pig’s head. Or when we were cutting into another croqueta, this one filled with unusually fluffy and moist salt cod sitting under two golden hoops of fried lemon peel. Or when we had emptied a sardine tin of its raw mackerel marinated in a Thai-derived green curry, rich with coconut milk and sharpened with lime juice. But I remember his smile and his question: “How can a place this big have food this good?” Toro, opened in September by the chefs Ken Oringer and Jamie Bissonnette and based on their enduringly popular Boston original, has factory-height ceilings, an industrial-chic design and 120 seats at long communal tables and smaller, unshared ones. It isn’t all that large compared with Morimoto across 10th Avenue, or Buddakan on the east side of the same building, or the teeming mess halls of the meatpacking district a few blocks south. By local standards, it is a bungalow in a neighborhood of McMansions. But by the cozy standards of the Barcelona tapas joints that inspired Mr. Oringer and Mr. Bissonnette, Toro might as well be a Home Depot. It sells almost as many items. The beverage list alone is a major treatise on Spanish drinking. There are spins on Spain’s beloved gin and tonic, dressed up with lemon grass syrup or yellow Chartreuse, although my Vauvert Elixir was a bit flat and cloying, as if the tonic came from a bartender’s hose. More inviting at the start of a meal are the feisty and autumn-crisp hard ciders or the cavas, a few of which settle any doubts that Spain is making world-class sparkling wine. Moving beyond bubbles, Toro stocks the garnachas and tempranillos you’d expect, but it has discoveries in store, too, from underappreciated grapes like xarel-lo and mencia. You may need a drink before ordering dinner, because the menu gives you something like 60 choices. Some are fully traditional Spanish classics like toast spread with raw tomatoes that shimmer with olive oil; others are non-Iberian interpretations like yellowfin tuna in white soy sauce with tissue-thin vinegared cucumbers. This presents a corollary to my dinner companion’s question: How can a menu this big have so many excellent dishes, and so few disappointments? I’ve certainly tasted things at Toro I wouldn’t be in a hurry to order again. One November night, I stayed cool to several dishes that could have used more warmth themselves. Chilly deviled eggs were somewhat generic despite being topped with a slip of preserved tuna belly. A $36 plate of streaky jamón Ibérico should have been warmer, too, to help soften the flavorful fat. This was an oversight I didn’t expect from a restaurant that goes to the trouble of hand-slicing the tagged Spanish hams that it proudly hangs from the ceiling. And while I loved the way mint yogurt brightened the wintry sweetness of rutabagas, sunchokes and carrots in a vegetable paella, I had no luck finding the socarrat, the crunchy bottom layer of browned rice that our server had promised would be the best part. The pan had been hustled off the flame before the crust had set. But there were fewer misfires each time I went, suggesting that the kitchen is settling down to business. I was happy to sink into the profoundly Spanish flavors of a vegetable stew called escalivada, with smoked eggplant in olive oil that carried the sweetness of simmered red peppers and onions. I immediately wanted more of the hot blowfish tails seared in a crust of North African spices. And I wondered how the simple combination of potatoes, octopus, harissa and charred onions could result in a contender for the best octopus dish in a city that’s gone cephalopod-mad. The octopus and blowfish gave me a hunch that later meals confirmed: The seafood at Toro can be spectacular. Can be, but not always: A whole sole griddled on a plancha could have used a kick of acid or salt, while delicate threads of sea cucumber were kicked around by acrid bits of over-fried garlic. But griddled red shrimp from Galicia were wildly delicious, from the tips of their tails to their heads packed with buttery orange fat. A blood-red run of fresh-pressed cranberry juice made an exciting vinaigrette for oysters, briny and raw. The clams, mussels and shrimp in paella Valenciana had plenty of character, and this time that irresistible layer of golden rice had fused to the pan. There were delicious oddities, too, like softly springy cod stomach flavored with some intensely funky stuff from inside the head of an octopus; it occupied its own wonderful niche between mild and extremely weird. A third question: Would this food taste even better if the place weren’t so big? Tapas in Spain are intimate, convivial bites. They’re snacks, sometimes running into meals, that you eat during hours when you fall into a bar for an hour or two of purposeless hanging out. New Yorkers aren’t so good at that. We eat tapas in restaurants where the casual, offhand moment of unplanned deliciousness gives way to the wait list, the crowds, the reservation before 6 or after 10, the upsell, the table smilingly offered with the condition that “we’ll need it back in an hour,” as a host at Toro told me one night. To their credit, Mr. Oringer and Mr. Bissonnette do not cook as if they are in a huge restaurant. Toro’s food isn’t stagy or gimmicky; it’s honest and thoughtful, and it can feel a bit lost in this space. There are times when eating tapas here is like watching card tricks at Yankee Stadium. And if I ever want to try some of these dishes in a smaller room, I can just go to Boston. The original Toro is less than half the size, and for the eight years it’s been in business, people haven’t stopped complaining about how hard it is to get a table.",Tortilla Española; bocadillo de erizos; escalivada; caballa tartare; rabbit and snail paella; suquet de mariscos; croquetas de jamón y cabeza; croquetas de bacalao; panza de cerdo; gambas al ajillo; pulpo; pez globo; zanahorias.
206,Sushi Nakazawa,4 star,"Dec. 10, 2013",Pete Wells,West Village,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-sushi-nakazawa-in-the-west-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-sushi-nakazawa-in-the-west-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE CHEF was late.  All 10 of the black-leather-and-chrome swivel seats, the same kind you’d perch on to play the slots at the Venetian in Las Vegas, were taken. Most of us had reserved a month before. Now we found ourselves sitting in the small, bright, glossy, black-and-white front room of the restaurant, which opened in August in the West Village. It looked about as Japanese as Peter Luger. Servers in black suits were offering hot towels, water and drinks, and more water, and then small talk, until it became clear that they were stalling. Were they going to let us eat?  Finally, Daisuke Nakazawa walked in the front door. “I’m sorry,” the chef said cheerfully as he slid behind the counter and prepared for work. He had just come back from Pier 76, he said. The police had towed his car. Then he picked up a palmful of rice and began to serve one of the four most enjoyable and eye-opening sushi meals I have ever eaten. I had the other three at Sushi Nakazawa over the next few weeks. The moment-to-moment joys of eating one mouthful of sushi after another can merge into a blur of fish bliss. But almost everything Mr. Nakazawa cups in his hands and places in front of you is an event on its own. A piece of his sushi grabs control of your senses, and when it’s gone, you wish you could have it again. These little events carve themselves into your memory. So does the meal, 21 pieces or so over about two hours. I remember precisely the dull luster of Mr. Nakazawa’s mackerel and the way its initial firmness gave way to a minor-key note of pickled fish and a major-key richness that kept building the longer I chewed. I can feel the warmth of just-poached blue shrimp from the South Pacific islands of New Caledonia, which had a flavor that was deep, clean and delicate at the same time. I can tell you about the burning-leaf smell of skipjack smoked over smoldering hay until it becomes a softer, aquatic version of aged Italian speck.  We don’t normally think of one sushi piece as wildly different from the next, apart from the inherent qualities of the main ingredient. But one of the points made by the 2011 documentary “Jiro Dreams of Sushi” was that a driven, obsessed chef will treat each sea creature as a unique challenge. He’ll ask, how can I make the best piece of horse mackerel anyone has ever tasted? When Jiro Ono dreamed of sushi, what he saw were new dishes waiting to be invented. In the movie, Mr. Nakazawa was the young apprentice who cried when Mr. Ono conceded that he had finally made an acceptable egg custard. With his shaved scalp, bowed head, downturned eyes and meek acceptance of Mr. Ono’s criticisms, he gave the impression of a novice Zen monk who was accustomed to abuse in the name of enlightenment. (He also gave you the idea that Jiro could be kind of a pill.) Mr. Nakazawa must have learned something, because his fish often tastes as if it has been coaxed along until it’s as delicious as it’s ever going to get. Each slice has a slightly different temperature, affecting flavor and texture, whether it spreads on your tongue or stays firm and chewy. All good sushi chefs do this, but Mr. Nakazawa seems to be able to hit any point on the thermometer with an assassin’s aim, locating a temperature for yellowtail belly that makes its buttery richness into a time-release pleasure bomb. He gets other effects by skipping the standard wasabi smear. He dabs Japanese mustard under medium-fatty tuna and the hay-smoked skipjack, bringing out its bloody-lip tang. Yuzukosho, a paste of bright yuzu peel and burning chiles, bites playfully into the cool sweetness of a sea scallop lopped from its shell just a minute before it’s served, its edges still fluttering. That scallop dish is distinctively his, and once you’ve had it you’d know it anywhere. Not everything I ate was in that category, and not everything is the best in town. The eel and octopus at 15 East are still undefeated, and possibly the rice, too, although Mr. Nakazawa’s has a wonderfully rich, rounded flavor. The $450 menu at Masa may glide to a higher pitch of pleasure, but the most striking dishes arrive before the sushi starts. No restaurant in town does as much with sushi, and sushi alone, as Nakazawa.  Behind the counter of Sushi Nakazawa, the chef is nothing like the movie’s humble stepchild. He laughs, he jokes, he handles live animals. One evening he held out a tray of sea urchins, their spikes groping the air, and asked each of us to choose one. The tiger shrimp he set down on white plates another night had more energy. With a flick of its tail one jumped up in front of a woman at the counter’s end. She jumped even higher. Another customer, more game, picked up the shrimp just above its wriggling legs, pointed toward his mouth in pantomime (Mr. Nakazawa is learning English), and asked the chef, “What is the best way?” The best way is to wait until Mr. Nakazawa yanks off its head, strips its shell and drapes the raw shrimp over a cushion of rice. Everything is gently pressed over rice, in the two-century-old Edo style of sushi that Mr. Nakazawa respects and refines. Sashimi is not served, and there are no hot dishes from the kitchen.  Sushi Nakazawa operates more like a tasting-menu restaurant than most Japanese sushi places. Mr. Nakazawa does not take requests until the very end, when he offers to sell you a second taste of anything. He does work around dietary restrictions, though. (He also notices who’s left-handed, and sets their sushi down with the ends pointing at 8 o’clock and 2 o’clock so it’s easier to pick up with the fingers.) There are three seatings a night at the counter. Reservations there can be made only for parties of two, which is needlessly unaccommodating; sushi counter dining is one of Japan’s great gifts to solo diners, and I can’t imagine Sushi Nakazawa would have trouble filling the slots. Reservations for the 25 seats in the back are more flexible, with staggered times and a discounted price, $120 instead of $150 at the counter. You can’t see the show from the cheap seats, and the room, while perfectly comfortable, will not be appearing in any interior-design magazines. But the sushi is rushed to the tables while the rice is still warm, which is crucial, and the dining room is the place to sit if you want to have a conversation without interruptions from jumping shrimp. Interruptions from Rick Zouad, the sommelier, are welcome, though. I am skeptical of pairings with tasting menus, but Mr. Zouad’s choices flattered each style of sake, and the price, $40 for six or seven glasses, is almost a gift. There are some very tempting half-bottles of Champagne from Chartogne-Taillet and other small producers or, for $12, about 15 percent of the price of the Champagnes, a 17-ounce Japanese lager brewed by Echigo from sushi rice that hits the reset button as effectively as pickled ginger. Sushi Nakazawa is owned by Alessandro Borgognone, whose other restaurant is Patricia’s, his family’s place in the Bronx. At home one night, Mr. Borgognone watched “Jiro Dreams of Sushi” and announced that he was going to bring one of the chefs to New York. His wife, reasonably, said no, you’re not. Luckily, he ignored her, and eventually found Mr. Nakazawa working in Seattle for another former apprentice of Mr. Ono’s. The trip from the Bronx to the West Village is probably easier to make than the trip from “spaghetti Frank Sinatra” to raw triggerfish under a squiggle of its own liver. Every once in a while, the distance tells. Mr. Borgognone has been bringing in sorbets made by his father at Patricia’s. The gesture is lovely, but superfluous. The egg custard Mr. Nakazawa cried over, made with mountain yam and shrimp, is the final, transporting piece of sushi. It hovers over the border between pudding and cake, and it tastes like an ending. Welcome to New York, Mr. Nakazawa. It’s a nice town for a great sushi chef. Please read those parking signs carefully, though.","No choices, but dietary restrictions are accommodated."
207,Charlie Bird,1 star,"Dec. 3, 2013",Pete Wells,SoHo,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-charlie-bird-in-soho.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-charlie-bird-in-soho.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE HARDEST-WORKING WOMAN in the food business one recent night was the host of Charlie Bird, in SoHo. Armed with nothing but good cheer and a smile that could stop a war, she had the unenviable job of preventing an uprising in a waiting area by the door that might comfortably hold three people if they were very skinny and could survive for minutes at a time without breathing. There were around 10 of us.  Tables weren’t emptying out as fast as new reservations were arriving, and hungry customers were piling up like rush-hour riders on the platform at Times Square when, “due to an earlier incident,” the uptown No. 1 is nowhere in sight.  The earlier incident causing the short delay at Charlie Bird was one that has occurred regularly since the restaurant opened in June: It gets packed early on and stays that way for hours.  There was no room at the bar, but Robert Bohr, the wine director and an owner, had wedged himself into the tiny foyer to take drink orders, enthusiastically recommending a “tanky” and “gulpable” Piedmontese Barbera from Scarpetta. The host squeezed past him to look at the dining room. As she passed, there was a light pressure on my shoe.  “Oh, I’m so sorry,” she said. “I did not mean to step on your foot!”  I had barely noticed, and once she unholstered that smile, I hardly cared. She was one of those servers who can make you feel better after a misstep, even one that lands on your toes, than you would have if nothing had gone wrong in the first place. The tone she set carried through all my meals at Charlie Bird, and it went a long way toward smoothing over any wrinkles. Quick, experienced and friendly, the servers add to the hip-hop-fueled energy of the dining room, which has the slightly too crowded and slightly too loud spirit that keeps people living in New York, even while they gripe about it. This was fortunate, because the cooking at Charlie Bird is surprisingly erratic: tremendously likable one moment, strangely off-key the next. Ryan Hardy, the chef and Mr. Bohr’s partner, is working in an eager-to-please Italian mode that leans heavily on cheese, salt and crunch. The kitchen announces its intentions right away with focaccia that is so crisp and shiny with oil that it seems to have been deep-fried. Bits of bread roasted in chicken fat multiply the crunch of a half chicken that Mr. Hardy sears, pressing down on it until the skin crackles.  Apart from a near-perfect risotto with tiny clams, the soulful mush of Italian cuisine is mostly banished; when a wonderful classic tripe stew turns up, simmered to vanishing softness in tomatoes, Mr. Hardy spoons it over crunchy slices of toast.   There is a heroic veal chop at Charlie Bird, pounded and floured and browned at scorching heat, but not scorched, served with tender porcini slices and wedges of lemon. There are chopped razor clams that ride in the long canoes of their shells alongside a fiery mash of pickled peppers. A special of bay scallops with chopped pistachios was given little capes of lardo, which may not have been the most flattering look but made the scallops seductively good to eat. Jarringly, ingratiating dishes like these were mixed in with careless ones. Some main courses weren’t hot enough, including, on one night, that star chicken. A few of the handmade pastas were standouts; others were washouts. Squid-ink chitarra with too few strands of crab was drowned in oil, and pappardelle with tender veal belly was lost in a weak, watery broth; even $50 worth of white truffles couldn’t coax it to life. One evening, the cooks seemed to be applying salt with a snow blower. Salty croutons undid crisp leaves of escarole dressed with anchovies and lemon. Chanterelle pickles and a caper-raisin purée both brought extra salt to a wing of skate that already had more than its share. Dessert could have offered safe haven. But a warm chocolate cake with a molten, sunken center like the crater of a volcano and the olive oil ice cream next to it were topped, sadistically, with much more than a pinch of Maldon salt. A few weeks ago, the sodium had been purged from that chocolate volcano and it was the best dessert on the table. If the rest of the menu can shape up, Charlie Bird will be a very good restaurant. The other pieces are already in place. The narrow space, essentially a split-level bowling alley that runs along Avenue of the Americas, has been made over as a modern bistro, with squash-colored banquettes and Lyle Owerko’s blown-up photographs of vintage boomboxes shot like Avedon portraits. The music is carefully aged hip-hop. Over the summer the decibel level could have been classed as an enhanced interrogation technique, although if it elicited any confessions nobody would have heard them. Acoustic retrofitting and a lower volume setting have helped.  Mr. Bohr, who built the epic wine list at Cru, keeps a much shorter one at Charlie Bird. Working with one of his sommeliers, Grant Reynolds, he has assembled it with such care  that I fell hard for everything I tasted. Ordinarily I’d be put off by seeing more bottles over $100 than under in such a casual place, but the markups are kind and, if your curiosity outstrips your budget, you can buy a half bottle of anything except sparkling wines for half the price. Even the cheapest wines were exciting, like the grignolino from the Piedmontese producer Cavallotto.  At $45, it cost less than the retail price of the handblown glass it was served in, which had a crystal stem as thin as a chive.  Like Pearl & Ash, another downtown restaurant that opened this year, Charlie Bird is on a mission to make the thoughtful wine service that you used to find only in hushed, special-occasion restaurants into an everyday event. That philosophy shapes the whole meal. Servers watch the tiny details, the way they do at far more formal restaurants, but they’re loose and relaxed. It’s a style ideally suited for the way we go to restaurants now, and it would lure me back, once the kitchen becomes more consistent, even if I have to wear steel-toed shoes.",Risotto of baby clams; duck egg spaghetti; tripe toast; farro salad; beef carpaccio; roasted chicken; veal chop.
208,Somtum Der,1 star,"Nov. 26, 2013",Pete Wells,East Village,Thai,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-somtum-der-in-the-east-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-somtum-der-in-the-east-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Many restaurants station an employee near the door who can make or break your evening. At Somtum Der in the East Village, that person is not a host who may banish you to a table in the frozen wastes of Siberia but a cook who can set your mouth on fire with the flavors of northeastern Thailand.  Wearing a T-shirt and a straw hat, he stands behind the bar, surrounded by glass candy-shop jars filled with shallots; heads of garlic; peanuts and cashews; granules of white sugar and little cakes of palm sugar; blistered sticks of fried pork skin; and, crucially, dried bird’s-eye chiles. When an order comes in, he grabs a wooden bat that would come in handy if he were caught in a riot and pounds it against the bottom of a deep wooden mortar. He looks as if he is churning butter. What he is doing is making tart, salty, crisp and exhilaratingly spicy papaya salad.  Called som tum in Thailand, papaya salad gave its name to this nearly three-month-old restaurant and is its star attraction, made to order in eight variations. One has brined, boiled eggs, which are fluffy and creamy and soothe the burn of the chiles. Another is seasoned with slivers of grilled pork neck, sweet and pink. The one called som tum poo-plara is darker than the rest in color and in flavor because it’s mixed with intensely funky fermented fish sauce and rock-hard miniature crabs scooped up in Thai rice paddies. It was the most complexly rewarding on the roster; the least was the one with rice noodles and sweet chile sauce, which seems to lull the noodles into a shallow, sugary daze. Nearly everybody in Thailand loves papaya salad, but the rest of the country got it from Isan, the vast northeastern plateau. Isan probably got it from Laos, next door, but that’s another story. In stalls all around Bangkok, street hawkers from Isan pound green papaya, and in 2012 a pair of restaurateurs brought the mortars indoors to a bright and offhandedly stylish place called Somtum Der. Like the Bangkok original, the East Village branch has knotty-pine walls and ceiling fixtures made from bamboo rice steamers and fish traps that could pass for the work of a modern design studio. To recap, this is a New York replica of a Bangkok restaurant that interprets that city’s street-food renditions of traditional Isan cooking. Amazingly, the food survives this journey, and if it has lost some herbs and other ingredients, it is still vibrant, fresh and delicious.  It has picked up a few things, too. Although Isan cuisine is on the march in New York, Thanaruek Laoraowirodge and Supanee Kitmahawong, who own Somtum Der, were worried that the city would wilt under the force of an all-Isan menu. With their consulting chef, Kornthanut Thongnum, they have padded it out with dishes from central Thailand.  A salad of sardines with mint and improbable quantities of crunchy, fragrant chopped lemon grass is worth a detour from Isan. Somtum Der’s drunken noodles or pad Thai with crab are more than credible, too, if you cannot imagine a Thai meal without those standbys. But they are not why you are here. You are here to build an Isan meal around sticky rice, a bowl of soup, a bit of fried or grilled meat and rustic, fiery salads. Very few dishes cost more than $12, and this is one restaurant where the refrain of “small plates meant for sharing” is not just accurate but culturally appropriate, so order as many as the table can hold. (Or maybe not quite that many. The food launches out of the kitchen quickly and relentlessly, and I felt lost in an avalanche until I learned to order about half of what I meant to eat, and then, when it was gone, put in a second order.) You want a larb or two, one of the chopped salads lavished with chiles and mint and a dusting of toasted ground rice that crackles between your teeth. The larbs with chopped duck and pork are very good. The one with crunchy flakes of grilled catfish that soak up the lime and fish sauce is even more satisfying. Another takes the opposite strategy, with minced mushrooms that don’t absorb the dressing at all but quietly allow the fresh herbs and chiles to sing out. Animal proteins do not demand the center of the plate in Isan cuisine, and while pork turns up frequently, it’s possible to put together an excellent vegetarian dinner at Somtum Der. Carnivores, though, will want at least one fried or grilled meat. Skewers of beef or pork marinated in coconut milk didn’t hold much interest, but the grilled “house special” pork did, especially when it was dipped in savory, salty jaew sauce.  Of the deep-fried dishes splashed across two pages on the full-color picture menu, sun-dried beef and pork with fried leaves of Kaffir lime made an easy-to-crave snack on their own, while the Isan sausages and pork roll worked better as pauses between spicy bites of larb and papaya salad. The restaurant is proud of its chicken thigh under a shower of fried garlic; it might have been wonderful straight out of the oil, but it was distinctly warmed over when I had it. Above all, you want papaya salad, absolutely, and you want it as spicy as you can stand. Somtum Der measures heat on a chile-pepper scale, with four chiles denoting a psychotropic level of spice. The cooks don’t always interpret this the same way, even on the same night, but most of the time a four-chile papaya salad will mean five minutes during which you are incapable of doing anything but sweating, squirming, trying to blot your tongue with rice and gulping mouthfuls of Beer Lao.  A lager from Laos, Beer Lao is a definite notch in quality above Singha, and several notches above Somtum Der’s stabs at Asianesque cocktails. It will, however, be all but useless if you are in the grips of a papaya salad armed with four-chile firepower by the man near the door. In that case, there is nothing you can do but wait.

209,Piora ,2 star,"Nov. 19, 2013",Pete Wells,West Village,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-piora-in-the-west-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-piora-in-the-west-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"You can put up with mediocre food in a restaurant that has other things going for it. When an exciting chef works in a terrible dining room, though, you feel the way you do when a friend hooks up with somebody you can’t stand. You may visit the two of them once or twice to savor the full extent of the new partner’s awfulness, but then you run for cover while you await the end.  That’s the reaction most diners had to Tenpenny when Chris Cipollone was the chef. Nearly everyone agreed that his food was terrific but that eating it in the charmless lobby of a Midtown hotel was like being buried alive with your last meal.  When news of the breakup finally came, Mr. Cipollone’s admirers began to hope they could start hanging out with him again. This summer, they got what they wanted, and Mr. Cipollone got the restaurant he deserved.  Piora, next door to a West Village pet boutique where you can buy metallic-gold PVC dog collars, isn’t large. The tables are leather-topped, as if you were about to sit down for a hand of whist, and they are hemmed in so snugly that when servers converged to set down three plates at once, they looked as if they were playing Twister. Right hand, trout! Left hand, suckling pig! But the place has been put together with intelligence and taste. You walk past a long bar attended by men in spotless white jackets, as if they had been flown in from Harry’s Bar in Venice.  Then you arrive in a square dining room with walls inscribed by long, sinuous horizontal lines. They look a bit like tentacles emanating from a sideways jellyfish, but they’re strangely soothing, and they make the space look bigger. In another optical trick, the room seems to extend past the windows in the back to a tiered and illuminated garden that makes those of us with plants at home wonder why ours don’t look this green in November. Mr. Cipollone has definitely traded up, and he’s cooking as if he knows it. Imagine, if you can, four people fighting over carrots. It happened, and one of his appetizers was the cause. Some of the carrots were roasted in ham fat until they collapsed into their own sweetness; some had a humming spiciness locked inside them; under them was tangy white yogurt and on top, a pink drift of powder. “Ham snow,” our server said. If there are Bac-Os in heaven, I had better get some religion, because this is what they’ll taste like. Piora is owned by Mr. Cipollone and Simon Kim, a Korean-American who has management experience under Thomas Keller and Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and Korean flavors dart in and out of the menu. Mr. Cipollone makes fearless use of gochujang, the fermented hot-chile paste, blending it with shrimp stock and slathering it over crunchy and charred legs of grilled octopus. The gochujang, hot and deeply funky, is almost too much, but fresh basil leaves and candied pine nuts rein it in.  But before you file Piora away under Asian fusion, be aware that the one thing you must eat is the pasta. Mr. Cipollone, an Italian-American, loves to play with pasta, but he is not chained to the traditions of Italy. He simmers black garlic bucatini in crab stock and tosses it with crab meat, adding maitake mushrooms for earthy depth. He underlines the candy-like flavor of roasted red kuri squash inside tortellini with a butternut squash juice that’s a little less sweet, a two-note melody in the key of squash. Purple rigatoni — there’s red wine in the dough — looked odd but tasted great, with peppery, fennel-seed-flecked duck sausage and lengths of the bitter green called spigarello. “I like the tortellini,” the best cook at my table said, “but I want the recipe for the rigatoni.” Personally, I want to know how to make the side dish of toasted hazelnuts with crisp bits of caramelized sunchoke. It’s as crunchy as granola and nearly as sweet, and I’d eat it for breakfast. Life can’t be all sunchoke granola and ham snow, though. Dullness creeps in. A purée of prunes stewed in tea wasn’t dynamic enough to help the washed-out flavor of a duck confit appetizer fried in a puck. Even more spectral was the taste of a suckling pig main course, although a wonderful slaw of fried burdock root and radishes nearly made up for it.  But dry-aged duck breast had a potent steakhouse intensity, and if its sauce of puréed jujubes, the Korean date, had a somewhat flat sweetness, duck jus enriched with black garlic gave it a savory kick. In a gentler mode, halibut was topped with sweet-sour ribbons of pickled butternut squash and given a last-minute swirl of toasty brown-butter fumet. Piora is about to hire its first pastry chef. With luck, it will land one who has better ideas than squirting lychee foam next to a gooey chocolate tart, or doubling down on the perfumey taste of Earl Grey cake with a scoop of Earl Grey sorbet. Until a new regime enters, I’ll content myself with a glass of 12-year-old Guyana rum filtered one drop at a time through sliced bananas. It sounds like what you would put in the bottle of a baby with a drinking problem, but it is an excellent and serious nightcap. The men in the white jackets know their booze, and Piora’s cocktails are tautly balanced and ungimmicky. This restaurant and chef are so pleased to have found each other that at times they fall into the slightly stiff good manners of somebody trying to impress future in-laws. The servers, in slate-colored striped aprons, are attentive, numerous and rather serious about this whole business of dinner. Ours can’t be blamed for our fight over the carrots, having solemnly informed us when we sat down that Mr. Cipollone’s food isn’t meant to be eaten family-style but should be consumed in separate courses, one dish to each diner. You don’t say. Now could someone please tell me what I’m supposed to do with these shiny pieces of metal next to my plate? This style might play better in a grand restaurant like Per Se or Jean Georges than it does in this cozy back room on Hudson Street. Once Piora moves beyond its self-imposed formality, it and Mr. Cipollone can start to settle in and get comfortable. This time, it looks like things may last.

210,Sushi Dojo,2 star,"Nov. 12, 2013",Pete Wells,East Village,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-sushi-dojo-in-the-east-village-and-kurumazushi-in-midtown.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-sushi-dojo-in-the-east-village-and-kurumazushi-in-midtown.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Disco music with raw fish in the East Village may not strike you as a winning formula unless you remember when Avenue A had what was probably the only sushi bar in the city with a mirror ball and a D.J. booth. Everybody called it Disco Sushi, and I loved it for reasons that had nothing to do with the food. I had eaten enough good sushi to know I couldn’t afford it. But cold rice, fake wasabi and sinewy fish mattered much less when vinyl records and the mirror ball were spinning, the tables were filling up with musicians waiting for a 1 a.m. gig at Brownies, and we were all on our third round of sake bombs. I didn’t realize how much I missed Disco Sushi until I found Sushi Dojo, which opened this summer on First Avenue near East Sixth Street. There were no turntables in sight, but the room was filled with retro disco. Usually, bone-thumping dance music is the way restaurants say “we hate you” to their customers. But at Sushi Dojo the tracks by Chromeo, Sare Havlicek and the like were played at a humane volume and compiled with an evident love for high-sheen, poppy neo-disco. And while I didn’t spot any sake bombs, plenty of people were getting bombed on sake. Ask the sommelier, Max Lidukhover, for a recommendation and he’ll give you two samples that would pass for full pours in other places, and if you’re not wild about either, he’s likely to uncork a third. Along the way he’ll teach you the basics. “Ginjo sake is very harsh,” he’ll say. “I don’t recommend it unless you’re looking to get wasted.” This is not necessarily discouraged at Sushi Dojo, where you can see customers in lip locks, customers waving their arms in full I-love-you-guys mode and customers buying rounds for the chefs, a Japanese custom that the staff avidly embraces. All this would earn Sushi Dojo a heartfelt welcome to the neighborhood even if the food didn’t stand out. But it does. The soul of this party is sushi worth getting crazy for, made by three chefs with a strong traditional bent: Hiromi Suzuki, Makoto Yoshizawa and David Bouhadana. Mr. Bouhadana is the ringleader, and the most exuberant customers seem to gravitate to his end of the counter. One night I asked Ms. Suzuki for $75 worth of sashimi and sushi, dealer’s choice. Sashimi came first: entwined bands of unshy, oily horse mackerel under a stubble of chives; firm white squares of local striped bass; shiny sunset-pink Arctic char jolted with lemon; bonito seared by a pass of the blowtorch; a slippery-soft tongue of raw spotted prawn next to its armored head. The streaks of fresh wasabi I drew with a chopstick tip underscored what Ms. Suzuki had already done with her knives, her torch and her seasonings to enhance the texture and taste of each kind of sashimi. Next, she placed one matchbox-size piece of sushi at a time on a banana leaf: glistening golden-eye snapper; a purplish strip of needlefish with skin that flashed like steel; yellowtail belly that melted like whipped lard; wild Alaskan salmon warmed by Ms. Suzuki’s blowtorch just long enough to melt some of the oils; and a delicate slip of sea eel, one of the finest I’ve found anywhere. This was more than raw seafood; it was the work of a thinking chef, and it was a treat. It was also a lot of high-quality fish for the price. If $75 is beyond your means, an entry-level 10-piece omakase sushi meal costs just $45, although it probably won’t include many seasonal specialties like needlefish or rarities like live, still-wriggling octopus. Not every piece I had at Sushi Dojo was exceptional; baby cuttlefish refused to surrender its flavor, and I wasn’t sure if a scallop, overpowered by wasabi, had much to hold on to. The rice can wad together stubbornly rather than falling into separate grains, too. But its gently vinegared seasoning blooms in the mouth, lifting up the taste of fish. There is a surprisingly long menu of cooked food, and while it doesn’t quite keep pace with the sushi, it’s more than respectable. If this kitchen fried it, you want it: shrimp in their crackling shells; a beehive of mizuna and seafood tempura with green-tea salt; a horse mackerel’s skeleton, dispatched to hot oil after you’ve eaten its body as sashimi. Kurumazushi is where I would have gone in my Disco Sushi days if I’d been able to afford it. Ruth Reichl gave it three stars in its last review in The New York Times, in 1995. At the time, many sushi hounds regarded it as the best in the city. Some still do, but I am not one of them. My meals in this restaurant, hidden on the second floor of a small Midtown office building that, like one of the artist Ben Katchor’s streetscapes, has sidestepped the modern age, offered some extraordinary tastes: king crab from Canada; very sweet squid made tender by a fine lattice of crosshatched cuts; gleaming amberjack and horse mackerel; and a hand roll of fatty tuna and scallions that made me forget how to speak for a minute or two. But an omakase meal that starts at $300 should make you fall silent more than once or twice. Some of the sushi might have come from a far less exalted restaurant: the eel drenched in sugary sauce, the forgettable salmon roe, and an array of seafood that would have had no character at all if not for the dab of fresh wasabi. The fish was too cold, a particular issue with fattier cuts like toro. The main culprit, though, was rice, a mass of starch so in need of seasoning that it erased the flavors of the fish like blotting paper. And while the wasabi on sushi was the real thing, the green stuff on a sashimi plate, one course in a $140 prix fixe meal I ate in the front dining room, was not. That room is a cheerless place, and lacks Kurumazushi’s greatest asset: Toshihiro Uezu, the chef. An antic, grinning presence, Mr. Uezu has as much fun as anyone in the restaurant. Standing between the sushi counter and a wall that looks like a raked sand garden in Japan, he slams metal trays of fish on top of one another, catches his breath, and turns to a customer: “O.K.! Sushi or sashimi? You choose or I choose?” And then he is off. “Horse mackerel,” he says, reaching across the counter with a length of pinkish fish draped over rice. “Horse?” a customer asks, unsure he’d heard it right. Mr. Uezu loves this. “Yes! Horse!” he says. “Secretariat!” He laughs. Everybody laughs. Just like that, it’s a sushi party.","À la carte sushi, $5 and up; platters, $80 and up; omakase, $300 and up."
211,Quality Italian,1 star,"Nov. 5, 2013",Pete Wells,Midtown,"Italian, Steak Houses",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-quality-italian-in-midtown.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-quality-italian-in-midtown.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The steak will be here in a minute. First, the show. Our server parks a trolley next to a window above Midtown in Quality Italian’s sprawling main dining room. “I’m going to make your steak sauce,” he announces as he drops oregano and parsley leaves into a mortar, cranks the pepper grinder and muscles down on it all with a pestle. “Tomato-garlic sauce,” he says, adding three spoonfuls. “Now raisin molasses.” He stirs with a clatter, making as much of a production of it as any mutton-chopped bartender ever made of a julep.  “The owner likes us to do things tableside,” he says. “It’s a little kitschy, but it’s fun.”  This would make a reasonably accurate motto for Quality Italian itself. The owners are Michael Stillman; his father, Alan; and Craig Koketsu, whose company, Fourth Wall Restaurants, is bravely battling the creeping solemnity and earnestness of parts of the New York restaurant scene.  Fourth Wall has one restaurant where not just the menu but the décor and the name change with the seasons (Park Avenue Winter, Park Avenue Spring, etc.) and another that salutes the tiki gods with drinks in watermelons and coconuts (the Hurricane Club). To the Stillmans, “gimmicky” is a compliment and “too gimmicky” is a phrase with no meaning.  Quality Italian, which opened this summer, is in some ways a clone of Fourth Wall’s steakhouse a block away, Quality Meats, but the executive chef, Scott Tacinelli, has grafted some Italian-American food onto the menu for good measure. The result is, as my server promised, both kitschy and fun, although the food is so uneven you may as well order by spinning a roulette wheel, a gimmick the Stillmans don’t seem to have tried yet. This is the restaurant that finally answers the question, “What if we set lobster fra diavolo on fire?” Enter a server pushing another trolley. He pours vodka infused with hot Calabrian chiles over a pan of sweet red-pepper sauce. Now the match. The flame climbs the stream of vodka and engulfs the bottle’s neck. It threatens to engulf the server, too, but he’s quick, and there is no damage: neither to his hand, nor to the lobster, which was not stunningly flavorful the night I had it, nor to the sauce, which was. At Quality Italian, you don’t get zeppole after dinner. You get a Zeppole Workshop. The pastry chef, Cory Colton, fills a galvanized pail with fried balls of dough and sends them out with a sifter of powdered sugar, a jar of honey with a honey wand, a tiny pitcher of chocolate sauce and a scoop of ricotta ice cream, creamy and not too sweet. You do the rest.  That’s the kind of work I excel at, especially if it means that I get to skip the Zeppole Workshop’s less exciting cousin, the Cannoli Cart. This is yet another trolley upon which a server stuffs limp wafer shells with a blend of mascarpone and ricotta that is as blandly sugary as canned frosting. After tasting these cannoli, I wanted to flag down another cart to take them away. Better yet would be a swap cart, where you could trade the cannoli for the lovely lemon meringue tart in its rectangle of crisp sugar-crust pastry. Even the vegetables perform tricks. Servers stir an egg yolk into bacon-studded kale carbonara, and they crack the glassy surface of caramelized sugar above corn baked in a sweet custard: corn brûlée. Both are preposterously rich, but good. It’s hard to believe the same kitchen that makes these would send out sunchokes roasted to a flavorless, baby-food mush inside deflated skins, little pantyhose-colored bags of regret. Distinguishing between entertaining ideas and silly ones is not Quality Italian’s strength. Serving gelati in a paper cup has a Dairy Queen charm, but stamping those cups with the red Safe Handling Instructions label found on meat packages is just bizarre, unless the Stillmans want to educate the public about the risks of E. coli in ice cream. And dressing the female servers in modified French maid outfits may not be the most forward-thinking policy for a restaurant catering to Midtown professionals of both sexes. (Maybe the Stillmans nabbed the idea from Le Relais de Venise, the steakhouse chain, which seems to get away with it by being French.) I wanted to believe there was more than kitsch to the chicken parmigiana that looked and acted like a 13-inch pizza. But its shroud of browned cheese was more like Tombstone than Totonno’s; its fried breading was limp, and after our server had sliced the pizza into wedges with a wheel, the chicken turned out to be spongy ground breast and thigh meat almost completely free of seasoning. Other diners report tasting herbs and salt in the patty, but even that, and a serving that easily feeds two with leftovers (in a pizza box, of course), wouldn’t persuade me to pay $58. Luckily, a fair number of dishes don’t do anything but sit there and taste good. Oysters baked under sea urchin butter and bread crumbs are a briny thrill. Nearly as good are the baked clams, with their doubly crunchy topping of bread crumbs and crisp angel-hair pasta.  Both a filet mignon, tall and proudly alone on an empty white plate, and a sirloin, served on the bone, hit all the classic steakhouse marks, from the glossy, fleshy interior to the matter-of-fact sear. A medium-rare rib chop, though, was inexplicably lean, chewy and dry; almost all the flavor was in the crunchy trimmings left on the bone. Help was not going to come from the steak sauce, drowning in sweetness and clogged with oregano. It could have used some of the energy that a sensational sour-cherry mostarda with fried sage brought to a Berkshire pork chop.  Pasta dishes have nothing like the finesse they get at Michael White’s steakhouse, Costata, but the porterhouse agnolotti in brown butter and vincotto had the transfixing depth of dry-aged beef, and the sickle-shaped creste with shrimp in spicy tomato sauce were bright and appealing.  Finesse may be beside the point at a place where servers proudly tell you that the Quality Burger on the lunch menu is “served with Quality cheese.” The kitchen needs to work on the first half of the restaurant’s name. But judging by the crowds and the number of times I heard “Happy Birthday to You,” the Stillmans seem to have figured out that some people would still rather eat in a theater than a church.

212,Hearth,2 star,"Oct. 29, 2013",Pete Wells,East Village,"Italian, New American",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-hearth-in-the-east-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-hearth-in-the-east-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Reading the opening lines of Hearth’s last review in The Times, published in 2004, is like strolling among the headstones in New York’s vast restaurant graveyard. The critic at the time, Amanda Hesser, observed that one-word names had become fashionable, and gave recent examples: Ilo. Tappo. Beppe. Gonzo. Pazo. Pico. Salt. Fresh. Supper. Canteen. Commune. District. Town. These establishments, more than half of Ms. Hesser’s roll call, didn’t last.  Hearth did. It thrived not because it cruised along in the tail winds of a nomenclature fad, but because it diligently looked the other way as fads came and went. The same potato gnocchi wallowing in a wading pool of melted butter that Ms. Hesser praised will be on every second table tonight. Everybody else will get the same rich but not filthy-rich polenta, although the ground corn is now typically grown in upstate New York, not South Carolina. Returning again this fall are the same improbably long bands of handmade pappardelle that drink the braising juices of a fine duck ragù. If you woke up shivering because you went to sleep with a window open and the temperature dropped 30 degrees overnight, this is the bowl of noodles you want.  From the start, Marco Canora, Hearth’s chef and, with Paul Grieco, its owner, set out to adapt the transparency of Tuscan cooking to his own region and time of year. He gets few points for the originality of his vision. But for his fidelity to it, Mr. Canora’s score is off the charts. By all accounts he is in the kitchen on East 12th Street almost every night, even as he and Mr. Grieco have replicated their wine bar next door, Terroir, in four other neighborhoods.  As Hearth approaches its 10th anniversary next month, you can tell the kitchen is paying attention most of the time. Not always: one night the gnocchi would have had no flavor if not for the melted butter and grated cheese on top. Dry, stringy salt cod mantecato needed more richness, and it was stuffed in a bitter roasted yellow Hungarian pepper that needed more sweetness. Siobhan DeCarlo’s desserts were variable, too. I had a nearly perfect cardamom panna cotta with a coffee-caramel sauce one night, and a dry, drab pear spice cake with almost no hint of spices on another. I noticed the lapses because they were so out of character, like John Boehner vaping on an e-cigarette. In the dining room, though, inattention was closer to normal. The servers seem friendly enough, smiling in their plaid shirts and bluejeans with napkins peeking out of the back pocket. But all my meals could easily have been finished 45 minutes sooner, without rushing. While I waited for somebody to take an order, or bring the main course, or clear dirty dishes, there were pauses long enough for several species of Amazonian frogs to go extinct.  Ordering wine wasn’t always simple, either. Once when I asked a server about a wine, she admitted she didn’t know much about it but promised to find out. Instead she came back 10 minutes later with the bottle; we were halfway through our main courses by then, so we didn’t stop her from opening it. Any restaurant can get into the weeds, but the weeds at Hearth seem especially fast-growing and luxuriant. If I had been alone, I would have passed the time reading Mr. Grieco’s wine list. This passionate, garrulous, name-checking manifesto exhorts us to drink mead (“a true symbiosis between insect, nature and man”), urges us to drink riesling (“To say that Riesling is great is as obvious as saying Vladimir Putin is the Michael Corleone of Russia”), pleads with us to drink sherry (“the most underrated beverage on the planet earth”) and revises the lyrics to a Justin Timberlake song (“It’s my wine in a box, my wine in a box babe”), twice. The tension between Mr. Grieco’s confrontational wine list and Mr. Canora’s soothing menu is one of the springs that keeps Hearth in motion.  Another is Mr. Canora’s understanding of the seasons. Once a vanguard notion in the United States, cooking with seasonal ingredients is so mainstream that chefs of all stripes practice it, from the modernist gear heads to the New Nordic foragers who can tell you exactly when to pick toothwort roots.  But chefs who plug this week’s ingredients into a style of cooking that stays the same all year long, who incorporate pumpkin and pheasant into their gels and streusels and cantilevered fronds asymmetrically disposed on just one side of the plate, seem to forget that it isn’t just the farmers’ market that changes with the seasons. Our appetites change, too.  One night in June, when restaurants in the East Village had their doors thrown open and the neighborhood took on a relaxed, unhurried mood, I ate a salad that put me in the same kind of mood: sweet, firm, bright-green favas and bits of soft young pecorino, dressed with vinaigrette and chopped parsley. In early fall, I ate just-cooked canestri, like bent rigatoni, tossed with braised cauliflower and wilted Tuscan kale; on top were toasted bread crumbs that stayed crisp until the pasta was gone, which bread crumbs never do when I make them. What made the crunch of the crumbs, the chew of the noodles, the long, mellow flavors of the vegetables so satisfying was the way they filled a hunger I wouldn’t have felt a month earlier.  Even though Mr. Canora rarely has more than two pastas on the menu, that’s what comes to mind when I think of Hearth. I also picture the platters for two. The spatchcocked chicken with flavor in every scrap of its flesh and golden skin, the whole roasted fish stuffed with lemon and rosemary, and the côte de boeuf are all treated like the classics they are. Unlike other restaurants, where trendy platters for two are an old-fashioned opportunity for price gouging, Hearth sells the chicken and fish for about as much as two regular main courses. For the beef, which could probably feed three, $125 isn’t out of line. Hearth received two stars from Ms. Hesser, who praised it for what she called “good, familiar food given a little luster.” After 10 years it’s easier to see that familiarity as Hearth’s path to timelessness.",Lettuces and vegetables; grilled quail; pasta; veal and ricotta meatballs; whole roasted fish; spatchcock chicken; polenta.
213,Khe-Yo,1 star,"Oct. 15, 2013",Pete Wells,TriBeCa,Asian,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-khe-yo-in-tribeca-and-whiskey-soda-lounge-ny-in-brooklyn.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-khe-yo-in-tribeca-and-whiskey-soda-lounge-ny-in-brooklyn.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Crunching on grilled pig snouts at a Thai restaurant in Brooklyn the other night, I reflected on how far New York has come.  The snouts and I were in Whiskey Soda Lounge Ny, which the chef Andy Ricker opened in August. It serves as a way station where people can nosh and drink and watch Muay Thai highlight reels while waiting for a table at Mr. Ricker’s Pok Pok Ny down the street. Whiskey Soda Lounge is more than that, though.  It’s also a gallery of Thailand’s bar snacks, which you almost never see in the United States except at Mr. Ricker’s other Whiskey Soda Lounge, in Portland, Ore. Along with Khe-Yo, a new Laotian-inspired restaurant in TriBeCa, Whiskey Soda Lounge joins a busy crowd of kitchens turning New Yorkers on to Asian dishes that we might have treated with extreme caution not long ago. New Yorkers will pinch raw tripe in miso between chopsticks at Takashi in the West Village, rip crisp folds of grilled chicken skin from skewers at Hanjan in Chelsea, and line up for the softer morsels of a lamb’s head at the scattered outposts of Xi’an Famous Foods.  Our pain threshold for spice is rapidly climbing, too. Blistering Isan cuisine has been taking over the Thai scene, and incendiary Sichuan food is turning up all over, riding a great orange tide of chile oil.  Whiskey Soda Lounge, in the Columbia Street Waterfront District in Brooklyn, feeds the city’s appetites for both spice and novelty. To tell the truth, that pig snout was so leathery that chewing on it was like getting nourishment from an old football. But I dug into the crunchy pig tails and invitingly tender pork tongue beside it on the plate, a constant special, dipping them into a dark and intense sauce called jaew, made from soy, dried chilies and toasted ground rice. Jaew turned up again with deep-fried strips of marinated pork called muu sawan, a sweet, crunchy and irresistible species of jerky.  Offal anchors the tom saep muu, a clay-pot soup in which a vivid hot-and-sour pork broth elevates the blunt flavors of chopped heart, liver and tripe. One spoonful reminds you that the first cook who combined chilies, lemon grass, Kaffir lime, galangal and lime juice deserved a Nobel Prize for aromatic sciences. The soup and some other spicy dishes are not murderously hot, but they are not meek, either. The dressings on two excellent salads — yam plaa meuk, or squid with tomatoes and celery, and yam het huu nuu khao, tomatoes and scallions with ruffled white mouse-ear mushrooms — had the kind of warmth you feel in your joints, not the kind that makes you want a tongue transplant.   There are gentler dishes, too. A deep-fried Thai analogue to Scotch eggs, khai luuk khoei, comes with a relatively nonincendiary tamarind dipping sauce, although you can crank up the heat with bits of toasted dried chilies. One of Mr. Ricker’s most lovable hits, the Vietnamese-style chicken wings marinated in fish sauce and garlic, can be ordered spicy or less spicy, and neither version is as fierce as the kind you’d find in a sports bar. Drink a cocktail if spiciness becomes an issue. Drink a cocktail in any case, because the ones at Whiskey Soda Lounge, like Pok Pok Ny, are fun and refreshing, and because the food almost demands it. Few items, except for maybe the wings, are substantial enough to be main courses. Still, you can easily put together a satisfying meal out of a few snacks, a salad and divots of sticky rice. It isn’t a going-out-to-dinner kind of night, but it makes a great field trip with one or two other bar-stool travelers. Khe-Yo, opened in July by the chef Marc Forgione and Soulayphet Schwader, one of his longtime cooks, works the other way around. It’s easy to navigate the menu, with appetizers and main courses heavy on animal protein serving as recognizable landmarks. But while much of the food is very appealing, not all of it makes you feel as if you’ve left home.  The most intriguing flavors hide out in Khe-Yo’s sauces. Grilled black bass that comes to the table with its blackened head staring up like a totem is ordinary until you wrap it in lettuce with a funky, salty jam of tamarind and peanuts. This makes it great. A similar transformation happens when you dip the sesame beef jerky in a thick paste of assorted dried smoked chilies pounded with galangal. The condiment is as dark and glossy as shoe polish, and the peppers contribute both fruitiness and spice that make it wonderfully complex.  Meals at Khe-Yo always begin with sticky rice in a bamboo basket, along with two sauces. One is an eggplant mash, with the funky, salty taste of fish sauce. The other is called bang-bang sauce, fresh red chilies and cilantro pounded in a mortar with lime juice and fish sauce. Its genuine heat can improve some of the underspiced dishes you might run into later on, like the excessively mild-mannered laap salads (the one with sliced duck breast and braised and fried tongues is the most compelling) and the lackluster grilled chicken. It doesn’t help the meek papaya salad, though, which needs more chilies before it leaves the kitchen. Servers invariably described the sticky rice and sauce combo as “our bread and butter service.” This hand-holding feels superfluous for New York in 2013, as does the repeated instruction to wrap food and herbs in lettuce to “create your own perfect bite.” The cooking of Laos is rare in the city, to be sure, but certain dishes and ingredients overlap with those of northern Thailand next door, and at this late date the lettuce wrap probably needs no introduction. A highly skilled cook with a sharp eye for ingredients, Mr. Schwader was born in Laos and moved to Kansas with his family when he was 3 years old. Right now his menu is a little more timidly westernized than it needs to be, but his kitchen may become bolder as he gets a sense of how far New Yorkers are willing to go.  Meanwhile, diners hungry to try a few Lao dishes in unreconstructed form can go a few blocks south to Mangez Avec Moi at 71-73 West Broadway, (212) 385-0008. Its name isn’t promising, nor is its “authentic pan-Asian cuisine” tagline. But after 4 p.m., the chef, Jeannie Ongkeo, sends out a short Lao menu.  Her papaya salad hummed with fresh chilies and fermented seafood, and her nam kao, a crispy rice salad with shredded coconut, had a taut balance of hot, sour, salty and sweet. My favorite was “or stew,” a murky bowl of slippery mushrooms and eggplant cooked with Kaffir lime, lemon grass and branches of fresh dill. It was the first time I’ve tasted flavors quite like it, but I hope not the last.",Duck laap; crunchy coconut rice; sesame beef jerky; whole grilled black bass.
214,Lake Pavilion,2 star,"Sept. 24, 2013",Pete Wells,Flushing,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-lake-pavilion-in-flushing-queens.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-lake-pavilion-in-flushing-queens.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"“Uh-oh,” I said under my breath. “Is there a wedding here tonight?” I tried not to sound nervous. I’d talked seven people from three boroughs into traveling to this Cantonese restaurant in Flushing, Queens, about a mile south of the Flushing stops on the 7 train and the Long Island Rail Road. But I hadn’t made a reservation. The dining room seats slightly fewer people than Citi Field. The only way we might have trouble getting a table would be if the entire place had been rented out by a couple about to walk hand in hand into marital bliss. And that’s exactly how it looked.  A classical white arbor stood at the entrance, threaded with silk rosebuds. Lavender swags had been draped from the rafters, and lavender napkins were propped up in the water goblets. Shiny gold curtains hung in the windows, and enormous bows in pink or burgundy flopped from the back of every chair. Servers were buzzing around, immaculately dressed in black suits with red bow ties or striped neckties. But no, there was no wedding. Lake Pavilion looks like that every night. It is almost certainly New York’s snazziest banquet-style Cantonese restaurant located in a former diner. Since its opening last year, it has shimmered above the Main Street exit on the Long Island Expressway in a squiggle of blue neon. Off the main dining room, in a string of private rooms marked by varieties of tea spelled out in red LEDs, Chinese families salute birthdays and other milestones with lobsters the size of single-engine planes.  For the rest of us, finding a Cantonese seafood restaurant as good as Lake Pavilion is a reason to get a group together. By day, dim sum trolleys cruise the dining room like a fleet of dumpling-laden Zambonis. The real interest, though, is in the menu, which goes on for about a dozen pages and does not waste any of them on Chinese-American silliness. This kitchen is as serious as any in the city about Cantonese classics, along with a few more recent notions from Hong Kong. If Dungeness crabs are in season and you do not have a life-threatening allergy, please order them. Get them stir-fried with ginger and scallions, their cracked legs and deep-dish bodies sticky with a sauce that will end up everywhere while you pull the meat from the shells: on your lips and nose and thumbs and probably your earlobes.  At least as delicious and certainly less gooey is the house special, a casserole of Dungeness crab stacked up on sticky rice that’s been lightly browned while being turned and tossed with roasted peanuts, garlic chives, ham, onion and liberal strafings of fried garlic.  When the crabs scuttle offstage between seasons, you could bide your time with clams in “hot spicy XO sauce.” It looks like soup, the clams submerged in sauce that is not just hot and spicy but also sour, salty and really deeply funky. The sauce gets aromatic depth from onions and bell peppers and a lovely lift from lemon peel, and it’s so intense that the clams taste as if they’ve been stewing in it for hours, yet they’re barely cooked. Stringy, yellowing water spinach and “crispy fried chicken” with garlic, which was neither crisp nor garlicky, were the only cases in which I wasn’t rewarded for testing my luck with the menu.  Sometimes I pointed at a photo of something I wouldn’t have ordered otherwise. This is how I came to try the bizarrely compelling sea scallops in a black pepper sauce that seemed to belong on a TV dinner steak. When nobody was looking, I kept stealing another scallop from inside the circular green hedge of broccoli, convinced that what I was doing was somehow wrong, and not caring. Menu pictures also helped me give mayonnaise prawns another chance. In other restaurants I’d been left cold, not to mention bewildered, by the combination of fried shrimp, candied walnuts and lemony, MSG-laced mayonnaise. Lake Pavilion adds deep-fried pillows of thickened condensed milk. I am not sure why I loved this particular version. I’m not even sure why the dish exists, but I am glad it does.  Should you want to drive deeper into unusual terrain, I can recommend the goose webs in a casserole with bok choi and Chinese black mushrooms. The thick, floppy webs, which you suck from the goose’s bony toes, had a fascinatingly earthy flavor that reminded me a little of fresh pork belly.  If that doesn’t fully scratch your itch for adventure, do try the screw clams. Stir-fried with snow peas and yellow chives, they look a bit like squid, crunch slightly between your teeth and have a faint, delicate flavor. Screw clams are not clams. They are often called osmanthus mussels, although they are not mussels, either. They’re organs extracted from sea cucumbers, which are not, of course, vegetables.  But there is no shame in having something as simple as the excellent stir-fried lamb chops, whose only sauce is a little oil deeply flavored with browned garlic and shallots, or something as old-school as Peking duck. Lake Pavilion does the dish beautifully, shearing off rectangles of skin with a cleaver and tucking them inside yeasty steamed buns dabbed with a little hoisin. The soft buns make a much more satisfying foil for the crisp skin than the pancakes you usually see in New York, and by the time the rest of the duck had been carved, our table was still passing around the platter of little sandwiches, going back for just one more. A group of six or eight is about right for the duck, and for Lake Pavilion. But look out for the gentle upsell. Order one lobster or Dungeness crab, and your server may ask if your gang wouldn’t be better off with two. If you want a fish netted in a splash from the tanks by the door, you may at first be shown the species that cost $35 a pound, $75, or more. Ask for cheaper options, like a speckled grouper from Mexico that emerged dense and moist from the steamer, and cost less than $20 a pound.  Your server may not push a $110 bowl of shark fin soup, still legal until next summer, but may suggest an off-menu soup served in a hollowed-out winter melon for around $50. Politely decline in favor of the more humble winter melon soup that’s on the menu, its homespun chicken broth full of sweet seafood and ginger slivers. A pot that serves the whole table is $12.95. I can happily report that when I ordered a drink, nobody tried to upgrade me to the 2009 Opus One for $350. I got a Tsingtao, no questions asked.",Winter melon soup; house special Dungeness crab with glutinous rice; sautéed Dungeness crab with ginger and scallion; mayonnaise prawns with fried milk; clams in hot spicy XO sauce; salt and pepper frogs; Peking duck; steamed fish; pan-fried lamb chop with shallots; dual egg fried rice; snow pea shoots in broth; Chinese broccoli in yellow wine.
215,Estela,2 star,"Sept. 17, 2013",Pete Wells,Nolita,Mediterranean,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-estela-in-nolita.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-estela-in-nolita.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"If you wanted to take the measure of Ignacio Mattos’s cooking at Estela, which opened on East Houston Street in June, you might look at the burrata on the menu and think: no, too easy. Anyone can slap burrata on a plate and wait for the moaning to start. But order it anyway, so you can see what happens when Mr. Mattos puts this louche, voluptuous cheese on a juice cleanse.  The burrata sits like whipped cream on charred bread. Soaking into the bread and pooling around it is a brooding green liquid pressed from lovage, sorrel, celery and other foliage. It looks like something you would force yourself to drink after doing very bad things to your body. Ingesting it with burrata must be some kind of preventive medicine, the after-midnight ibuprofen with a bourbon chaser.  That’s not what it feels like, though. When this fatty sprawl of dairy is brought to heel with fresh and grassy vegetable juice, it becomes something you taste, not something that washes over you in a big creamy wave. It’s strange but it’s right. Strange food is often born from a need to kill boredom, ours or the cook’s. It can keep kitchen and dining room awake through what would otherwise be another night of spaghetti and salad.  Mr. Mattos’s cooking at Estela has a mild case of weirdness. It is just unfamiliar enough that I had eaten about a meal and a half there before it dawned on me that nearly everything is Mediterranean, more or less. I should have seen that one coming, given that Mr. Mattos, who grew up in Uruguay, cooked at Chez Panisse for a year and Il Buco for five.  The cooking is almost familiar, but not quite, and it’s the little differences that get under your skin. The flatbread served with an excellent potato-thickened mash of salt cod is a rye matzo. And a whole squid and a spring onion, both griddled on a plancha and served with a reasonably traditional Romesco of red peppers and hazelnuts, look like a leathery, podlike alien creature alongside a blackened stem that snakes down the plate. The mild strangeness drew my attention to how deep and elemental the flavors of both dishes were.  Mild strangeness hasn’t always been Mr. Mattos’s preferred line of attack. When he was the chef at Isa, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, he reveled in deep, surrealist weirdness. His best-known dish there was fried sardine skeleton, which looked as if it belonged behind glass at a museum of natural oddities. I remember rattling my jaw on nearly raw grains and getting my first taste of sweet potato leaves, which until then I had thought were poisonous.  Estela, which Mr. Mattos opened with two partners, Mark Connell and a wine-guy-slash-general-manager named Thomas Carter, is far less confrontational in ways that go beyond the kitchen. Within two seconds of climbing the steps to this spare and intimate little dining room, you know that there will be a speech on how the menu works, that most of the dishes will be small, that sharing will be encouraged, that the noise level will climb steeply, that the meal will cost more than the menu prices lead you to believe. (This is a particular danger if you aren’t careful with wines, because Mr. Carter leads us into three-digit temptation much more often than you’d expect from a list that’s relatively compact.)  The dishes aren’t composed of pixel-size bits of food that have to be divided by laser surgery; they generally share well. This is a good start, but then Estela, like many small-plates restaurants, neglects the so-called share plates that you actually eat from if you treat each new creation from the kitchen as a serving platter. The share plates at Estela are no bigger than tea saucers, and are rarely swapped out. One night assorted juices and sauces from eight recipes swirled together before a fresh plate came along. It was like seeing eight movies projected on the same screen at once. New or bigger plates would help you to focus on the energetic crackle Mr. Mattos gives beef tartare by folding fried sunchoke chips into the raw meat, or the low growl of spice he lends to a fried egg and gigante beans by pairing them with bread cubes dunked in harissa. Ingredients that don’t appear to have been tampered with often have a depth of flavor that takes you by surprise. There’s the invisible pop of yuzu and grapefruit hiding inside wheels of uncooked summer squash arranged like scales over intensely sweet raw scallops and puréed avocado. There’s the lemon that perks up white rounds of kohlrabi dressed, simply and wonderfully, with shards of fossa cheese, mint and crushed, toasted hazelnuts. There are usually only four large plates (what we once quaintly called main courses), but Mr. Mattos makes them count. Cod is briefly salt-cured and slowly pan-seared until it surrenders into soft, meaty flakes. Pork shoulder is as juicy and red as steak, and the steak is something else again. As he does in other dishes, Mr. Mattos uses flecks of char almost as a spice. With the pulse-quickening slices of beef, the blackened edges from charred eggplant get together with the oily intensity of anchovies for an irresistible roughness and force.  Desserts look simple. O.K., they are simple (there is a panna cotta and three low-key sundaes based on grapefruit, chocolate or blueberry sorbet). But Estela’s consulting pastry wizard, Alex Grunert, gives each one a little snap, crackle and pop, and they end up being more satisfying than some high-end sugar landscapes. Early on, it’s true, there was a sardine dish that was like a public repudiation of the one at Isa, replacing weirdness with dullness. And the night I found that the matzo was being served with drably spiced egg salad instead of that great whipped cod, I felt as if I had traded a classic six for a studio.  It doesn’t matter. Mr. Mattos is not trying to shock us, but he is not trying to pacify us with the tried and true, either. It’s a thin line he’s walking, and if he didn’t wobble occasionally, that would be truly strange.","Burrata with salsa verde and charred bread; beef tartare and sunchoke; mussels escabeche; quail with fig, bread and white beans; cod with cabbage, chanterelles and hyssop; steak with eggplant, leeks and anchovies; panna cotta; chocolate sorbet."

The rest of the city looked up from a collective hangover at their flashy outfits and expectant smiles and said, “Um, the party’s kind of over, dude.” Armani Ristorante, inside the Armani store on Fifth Avenue in Midtown, was one of those late arrivals. The mood in the city was humbled, downsized, frightened, and here was an expensive restaurant reached by a private elevator from the street or, better, a sinuous white ramp that twisted past two floors of gowns and luxury leather goods like a floating catwalk. After a lunch there in early 2009, Frank Bruni, then the New York Times restaurant critic, wrote a blog post noting that “the whole thing just feels sort of tone-deaf and odd.” He never reviewed the restaurant, which seemed likely to end up in the same landfill where they’d deposited the carcass of Lehman Brothers.  Some people’s money is more durable than others’, though. Giorgio Armani apparently kept pumping his into the restaurant, his first in New York.  Here it is today, as another New York Fashion Week sashays to a close. The restaurant’s kitchen is now under Sandro Romano, who arrived last spring after seven years as chef de cuisine at the Modern. The catwalk is intact, and tiny blue and purple lights still twinkle in the windows over Fifth Avenue. The white circular booths with black leather tops are still there, too, looking like the Mad Tea Party ride at Disney World, transported to Armani World.  Dolled up like that, Armani Ristorante will always be somewhat odd. But since the stock indexes hit record highs in August, it hasn’t seemed quite as tone deaf. With main courses averaging around $35, it is cheaper than (don’t laugh) Carbone, and in the same range as some Upper East Side Italian stalwarts where the cooking and service aren’t as refined. If the prices are out of touch, then so are large patches of Manhattan. Yes, if you ask for sparkling water, you will get Acqua Armani. Does the bottle, skinny as a fashion editor and stamped with a big block A, justify $11? I’d say no, but I’d say yes to the wine list, which has a surprisingly generous number of wines under $50. One night while I was scanning the Southern Italian whites, a sommelier materialized at my elbow and pointed right away to a crisp and sunny Sicilian grillo for $39. You’d have trouble matching that price at some downtown joints that pass as inexpensive. The sommelier did this without making me feel like a cheapskate. Another server showed similar discretion one night when a woman at my table immediately peeled back the glittering silver skin from a branzino fillet. “Ah, but that’s where all the flavor is,” he protested briefly, then flashed a wide smile that beamed understanding.  He was right about the skin. It was the best part of a lovely dish, its slight fattiness offset by cracked pink peppercorns and sage. Mr. Romano sets the fish on a green circle of Italian salsa verde made from arugula and fresh herbs blended with olive oil. The bright taste of the raw greens is just what this mild but meaty fish needs. Mr. Romano has a sensitive hand with seafood. It was on display on a long plate that held five raw tastes of the ocean, like branzino dyed purple by a bath in beet juice, and a sweet, firm langoustine with tart little bits of green apple. He mimics the look of seared sea scallops with short stacks of meltingly rich potato gratin. Shaved black truffles looked dramatic but didn’t follow through with the expected flavor; all the pleasure was in the gentle interplay of the potatoes and scallops. The only seafood letdown was baby octopus, which had even less flavor than the truffles. Remarkably good polenta was wasted on those bland little legs. Pasta was a trickier proposition. Lasagnetta, a tower of roasted eggplant slices layered with tomato sauce, smoked scamorza and fresh pasta rolled very thin, was a little like eggplant Parmesan and a little like lasagna, but more delicate than either, getting restrained richness from basil oil and a Parmigiano-Reggiano sauce.  Spaghetti and shaved dried tuna roe, on the other hand, got no help from slabs of tuna belly that were as mushy as a black banana. And green tagliolini was overdressed with a muddle of mushrooms and truffles and two whole langoustines dropped in the center of the bowl. Removing one accessory, Coco Chanel-style, would have focused the flavors and helped lower the ridiculous $38 price tag. I chalked both misfires up to an off night. They and other dishes didn’t have the same sparkle I’d seen on my other two visits, making me wonder if Mr. Romano is still consolidating control over the kitchen.  His menu is at its best when it takes its cues from the understated style of Milan, Mr. Armani’s base of power. The rice in black risotto with speck-wrapped cuttlefish had precisely the firm but creamy texture it should. And when the bone-in veal chop Milanese showed up, I just sat there smiling for a minute because I could tell from the gorgeous, tanned crust how much fun I was going to have eating it. Apart from gravity-bound bomboloni, the desserts were worth giving up any dreams I might have of fitting into something sold by Armani other than a sofa. There is a fine molten chocolate cake, called a fondente, with an espresso gelato that has the licorice kick of Sambuca. A puff of raspberry mousse and tongues of meringue topped a barely set panna cotta. My favorite was the least traditional: an after-dinner salad of strawberries, and inky balsamic vinegar with micro-wedges of tomato and a refreshing basil gelato. While the prices aren’t quite so out of step with the times, nobody would describe Armani Ristorante as of the moment. The tiny colored lights and view above the sidewalks always reminded me of two places from an earlier era:  Windows on the World and the revolving lounge at the top of the Marriott Marquis in Times Square. I miss the first one and still like the second one, so maybe I’m the one who’s late to Mr. Armani’s party.

217,The Pines,1 star,"Aug. 20, 2013",Pete Wells,Gowanus,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-the-pines-in-brooklyn.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-the-pines-in-brooklyn.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Someone who used to prowl around CBGB and other clubs when punk and new wave were breaking their first guitar strings told me he had seen one particularly untutored band at least 30 times. “Really?” I asked. “Yeah,” he said. “The first 15 times, they were just awful.”  I didn’t need to ask why he had stuck it out because the band was Television, and they went on to harness their early chaos into two obliquely beautiful records.  Some restaurants are like that. Even if they don’t have the mechanics down yet, their glimmers of originality can keep drawing you back. None of my five meals at the Pines since its opening late last summer in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn has been in the “just awful” category, but two were so frustrating I swore I’d never return. The opening line of my notes on one dinner reads, “I am done with giving this place a chance.” Three months later, I was back. That night, the Pines and its chef, Angelo Romano, were in control of their chords and the tempo from start to finish. Dinner began with a short glass of chilled soup, or maybe it was a virgin cocktail: tofu whipped with mint into a frothy green drink. Lolling at the bottom were juicy little Champagne grapes, a burst of sweetness lightening the intensity of the mint. Next was a salad. Wheels of yellow cucumber had been marinated with a yuzu green-chile paste to give them a citric tang and a low burn. They were set beside a pool of almond milk and stacked with thin medallions of more almond milk, this batch thickened to the texture of silken tofu.  It was very good, and the next course was simply great: razor clams and trout roe with pinched squares of fresh pasta that Mr. Romano calls borsa vuota, or empty purses. The pasta seemed undercooked and under-clammed until I gave it a stir, sending the purses down to soften in the spicy miso-butter sauce, and bringing up a dividend of extra shellfish and slices of tiny hot red chiles. There had been flashes of excellence before that night, but they had been obscured by hospitality issues, strange kitchen decisions and checks whose totals had a way of ambushing me.  The Pines, about a five-minute walk from the Gowanus Canal past windowless industrial buildings and stubby little houses, looks like an indie band sounds. Beat-up pressed tin ceilings have been nailed across some patches of wall, and others are covered in bare wood slats. Spooky dried flowers and herbs hang over the bar, evoking not a Tuscan farmhouse but an abandoned cabin being used for Wiccan rituals. Next to the kitchen is a signboard with cryptic handlettered slogans: Fugazi. Rainbows and Unicorns. Pray 4 Weezy. Beards: They Grow on You. Despite the untucked appearance of the Pines, it is surprisingly easy to spend what you would in a slick Manhattan restaurant. One night I’d rolled in like a drug dealer, hundreds of dollars stuffed in my pocket because I knew the Pines didn’t take credit cards. Service was vague and distant. We waited interminably for food, cocktails, even glasses of wine. To settle the check at the end of a long, slow night, I needed about $100 more than I had brought.  I knew from the Web site that there was an A.T.M. in the restaurant. It was broken. Lots of businesses are opening on Third Avenue around President Street, but the area is not yet one of the world’s banking capitals. After a 10-minute search on foot, I got into my car and drove until I found a cash machine.  On other nights, the food was perplexing. Mr. Romano, who cooked at Roberta’s before striking out on his own at a short-lived Williamsburg restaurant called Masten Lake, has a discerning eye for prime ingredients, but isn’t always as discerning about his ideas.  Cappellacci that looked like bishop’s miters were filled with a giddily tender and rich oxtail ragù, but the pasta was as thick as shoe box cardboard and nearly as stiff. The cappellacci were undercooked at other meals, too; apparently it’s a feature. Coating sea urchin with crunchy BBs of toasted amaranth grains and serving it with tart, astringent sea buckthorn juice struck me as a mean thing to do to a nice, gentle ingredient. Most memorable was the squab — dry-aged and roasted with its feet on — that made the bird look as if it were running. It may have been running away from the oven, because one breast was still bloody. The raw-pigeon incident nearly ended my fascination with the Pines. Luckily, though, I remembered eating other things that were distinctive and skillfully prepared. On recent visits, such dishes have become the rule, not the exception. In the spring, Mr. Romano made the smart decision to treat ramp greens like spinach, sautéing them to softness and surrounding them with a concentrated tart-sweet late-harvest vinegar. A fried duck egg and Marcona almonds balanced their garlicky bitterness. This summer, he dressed tender young purslane with a vibrant emulsion of mint and garlic. A savory foam of warmed egg yolks had been shot between the purslane branches, a lovely way of adding creaminess to the crisp greens. Mr. Romano is fond of esoteric ingredients like sea blight and Japanese knotweed, but he can wring terrific results out of more-common ones. Lightly cooked corn juice under slices of roasted pork shoulder offered profound, summery pleasure, and cabbage cooked with fish sauce, sambal and smoked pork jowl layered Asian flavors in an unexpected and very welcome way. And his choice of melted aged beef fat with chunks of bone marrow as a sauce doubled down on the beefy intensity of a Wagyu culotte steak. As my meals have been getting better, the restaurant has been growing up. The no-reservations policy was dropped. The service has become more polished and knowledgeable, ready to tell you what that glass of Slovenian refosco or other wines on Mr. Romano’s willfully obscure list will taste like. And as of last week, the Pines accepts some credit cards. These civilities make it easier to take a chance on a night that costs a bit more than the cover charge and a beer at CBGB in 1975. ","Menu changes daily, but the Wagyu culotte steak is a fixture."
218,Costata,2 star,"Aug. 13, 2013",Pete Wells,SoHo,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-costata-in-soho.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-costata-in-soho.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"So this is where he decides to bring us: back to the same place on Spring Street where it all started. The year was 2002, the restaurant was called Fiamma, and he was just another hungry 29-year-old chef from the Midwest. We didn’t know yet that his name was Michael White. We just knew that when he cooked Italian food, he could make us forget about all the others for a while. Now he has bought the place and renamed it Costata. This time around it’s a steakhouse. He is credited as the chef and owner, with PJ Calapa as the executive chef and Robert Truitt in charge of the dessert menu. But he definitely wants us to remember the early days here, and maybe reassure us that even though he’s been spending a lot of time on the road lately, we still mean something to him.  All those Foreigner and Stone Temple Pilots songs aren’t helping to set the mood. And those huge white cotton chandeliers with accordion folds are distracting. They look like air filters for monster-truck engines. The votives are a nice romantic touch. Except those aren’t candles; they’re flame-shaped light bulbs programmed to flicker on and off. They fit right in with the jokey space-age décor at the Butterfly, his new bar in TriBeCa. But on Costata’s white tablecloths, they look cheap.  And these teapots are sleek and shiny, but he’s sending them out two at a time, one with a tea bag and hot water, the other with just hot water, because a single pot won’t fill a teacup. He wouldn’t buy us teapots just because they were on sale, would he? Or is this ... a regift? But tonight let’s stay focused on the good times. To remind us, he’s making the garganelli he used to do at Fiamma, those ridged quills with peas, pancetta and, oh, that truffle cream. Wow. As indecently rich as we remembered it. This spaghetti with clams almost eats like carbonara, with its sticky yellow-tinged sauce that clings to the noodles. The casarecci, bent scrolls blackened with squid ink, have a powerful oceanic undertow that pulls the sweet shrimp and sepia along in the current.  For a minute, we’re wondering if he’s laying it on a bit thick, showering shredded fontina over the oxtail ragù with cavatelli. Then we take another bite and decide that when somebody makes pasta as wonderful as this, there are some questions you just don’t ask. Though we do want to know how many people take the menu’s advice and order pasta as a side dish with steak. Costata’s pasta shouldn’t have to compete with anything.  We should know. We’re never sure we’re getting his full attention anymore. He’s a blur, opening three restaurants since May. He didn’t seem to be trying very hard to make us happy with his last one in New York, Nicoletta. Now he’s got something going on in Hong Kong, and in London. And who knows what he does at those two places in New Jersey.  If he wants to persuade us he’s not spread too thin, some of the cooking at Costata isn’t helping his case. Raw branzino is obliterated under a black mash of salty taggiasca olives, although what little of the fish’s flavor comes through suggests that obliteration may be the right call. Potatoes puréed with barrels of melted butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano taste great, but they are gluey and oafish.  The brilliant-red coral butter painted on a split and roasted lobster the size of a dachshund looks stunning, but it’s irretrievably salty. And the generic red-meat flavor of lamb chops is a $49 shock. Some of these dishes have a coarseness that wasn’t there when we first met, or even later on, when he took us to Convivio and Alto and Marea. And the relationship feels a little one-sided now. If we had given him $59 for a bone-in rib-eye back when he was so eager to impress, would he have turned around and asked for another $3 for compound butter and $4 for sauce? Or maybe our memories have gone all misty and watercolored. Oh, now he’s going to try to sweep us off our feet again with crudo, the way he did at Marea. We’ve seen this move before.  And you know what? Apart from that sad branzino, the old moves still work. Those beautiful red prawns with lemon, olive oil and a prawn-head stock are extraordinarily fine. So is the fluke, sparkling beside the green divots of Castelvetrano olives and slow-roasted grape tomatoes. And these thin disks of sea scallop, so sweet and pure on a blanket of puréed celeriac, with diced celeriac pickle and fresh, herbal celery leaves — they’d destroy our resistance even without the head-filling taste of black truffles in the vinaigrette.  All right, the guy’s a magician with seafood, too. Roasted langoustines had better be exceptional at $19 apiece. They are. We’d come back for a second taste of the chilled lumps of tender lobster with strips of honey-coated guanciale cooked like bacon and a thick cocktail sauce that delivers a Bloody Mary’s loving slap to the head. The truth is that we always loved his gut instinct for richness and fresh, bright flavors. We don’t really need him to cook us a steak. But by now we’re ready to be won over.  The filet mignon delivers all the tenderness we want and more flavor than we expect. Pink within and a rich caramel brown on top, the veal chop is everything we ask from that cut. The pancetta-black pepper sauce takes to it the way a cat takes to an empty lap. The bone-in strip is a very good piece of beef, though it doesn’t have the intensity of the best dry-aged meat. Neither does the 40-ounce porterhouse, though big enough for at least two people, for $116. Called the Fiorentina, it’s a handsome carnation-pink all the way through, but it has no crust to speak of and is lukewarm on arrival. It’s all steak and no sizzle. For sizzle, we’ll spend $2 more to get the Costata, a 44-ounce rib-eye on the end of a theatrical curve of roasted bone. Bathed in mouth-coating melted fat, the meat is so tender beneath its dark crust that slicing it makes you feel like a bully. This steak alone is a reason for the restaurant that it’s named after to exist. When the meal ends, Mr. Truitt is a master of extending the good feelings and then building on them, with desserts that are quietly sophisticated without flaunting their cleverness.  Things aren’t the way they used to be. They’re not quite the way we pictured them in the beginning. But give us the cavatelli and a rib-eye, or a few langoustines, and for tonight, we’ll be happy.",Sardine crudo; scallop crudo; red prawn crudo; lobster cocktail all’amatriciana; bone-in New York strip; Costata rib-eye for two; langoustines; all pastas; artichokes alla giudia.

I’d like to direct their attention to this text from the ABC Cocina Web site: “abc cocina & michelin star chef jean-georges vongerichten welcome you to our modern global exchange celebrating local craft and international culture, a fusion of tradition and innovation uniting yesterday and tomorrow.” Got that? There’s more: “experience the vision of abc home curation, a romantic and mystical atmosphere and succumb to a dynamic love affair with an eclectic and enchanting cuisine.” If that gives you a vivid picture of what is in store for you at this three-month-old establishment, stop reading and use the free time that now stretches out before you to do something nice for a stranger. If, on the other hand, you found a few passages somewhat hazy, I’ll be happy to do my job.   This “modern global exchange” is what we critics like to call a “restaurant.”  By and large it is a very good one, with a few odd touches. It is overseen by Mr. Vongerichten, who collaborates on the food with Dan Kluger, the executive chef here and next door at ABC Kitchen. “International culture” must refer to the menu, which rummages through the cupboards of Spanish-speaking countries in Europe (that would be Spain), Mexico, Central America and South America (although you don’t need to go to Argentina these days to find chimichurri). This attempt to reassemble the Spanish Empire does not shed new light on any of these cuisines. Intellectually and culturally, it borders on incoherence. But in the kitchen it has inspired a large number of smart, exciting dishes along with a small handful of slightly peculiar ones. You can get along just fine without intellectual coherence when the flavors are as clear and harmonious as they are in a ceviche of white shrimp bathed in a vivid citrus sauce. Just as the throb of habaneros begins to build up, a bite of soft banana or a crisp Marcona almond breaks the tension. And sure, maybe the first person to put cucumber, dill and yogurt together with cured salmon wasn’t all that fluent in Spanish. Fine. ABC Cocina’s version is still great, with dried chiles powdering the edges of the sweet and smoky fish, and an unexpectedly bright acidity in the cucumber, which is zippy where you expect it to be soothing. There’s an alchemy at work at ABC Cocina, the kind that can turn the last thing you’d want to order into the first thing you’ll ask for next time around. For me, it was the vegetables with brown rice, which I expected would taste like a tea made by steeping the yellowed pages of the “Moosewood Cookbook” in warm kombucha and straining it through Pigpen’s bandanna. It was, in fact, one of the freshest, cleanest vegetable dishes I’ve tasted all summer. The rice was fluffy, not gluey, and each vegetable — baby fennel, tender carrots, skinny asparagus — spoke out clearly. The rice was dressed with a salsa verde that came across as more of an herb vinaigrette with a citrus rasp and a little spice. The vegetables were so tender and seasonal, you could call this a farm-to-table dish, but it’s almost too light on its feet for that. The “michelin star chef” (Mr. Vongerichten has done all right by this newspaper, too) and his protégé are both minimalists, but in different ways. Mr. Kluger has a gift for making his ingredients, especially the vegetables, taste a little purer than almost anyone else’s. With the best of Mr. Vongerichten’s dishes, on the other hand, it’s not the main ingredient you remember as much what he has done to it: a three-ingredient sauce or marinade whose ingredients are suspended in a tense standoff. Once in a great while, the two approaches — one interventionist, the other more conservative — are at war. I loved the deep, meaty flavors of roasted maitake mushroom chunks pieced together around a core of warm goat cheese, but couldn’t understand what either ingredient was supposed to get out of a sharply acidic Fresno pepper vinaigrette. And I’d skip the sweet barbecue sauce with black sea bass; the interplay of thyme and tamarind in the marinade was enough to carry the fish. More often, the team of Vongerichten and Kluger puts you in the excellent dilemma of not knowing which you like better, the food or its sauce. Should more restaurants have fried squid this sweet and fresh, or should more of them look beyond lemon wedges and marinara to find something with the rounded sweet-and-sour depth of ABC Cocina’s ancho glaze? I hope this kind of dish is what “fusion of tradition and innovation uniting yesterday and tomorrow” means, and not the drippy, messy burger going around in taco drag. The warm, slightly shiny tortillas have a depth of masa flavor that is shown off better by roasted mushrooms with a peanut-based mole. Or by the one big piece of tempura-fried fish with spicy mayonnaise and citrus-dressed cabbage. Or by the BLT taco, which translates each element of a classic  Mexican pork-based taco into idiomatic American English, with roasted pork belly and a red-and-yellow jumble of tiny, juicy heirloom tomatoes. I know what you’re thinking: enough with the eclectic, enchanting cuisine already — let’s hear about the romantic, mystical atmosphere! I am sorry to disappoint you, but ABC Cocina didn’t seem very romantic to me, or especially mystical, either. It looked to me like a fairly simple cafe, with metal chairs and bare tables, located inside a lighting showroom. That is essentially what it is. The restaurant, like ABC Kitchen, is inside ABC Carpet & Home, and nearly every object is for sale: lighting fixtures, chairs, plates, pyrite rocks, fragments of wasps’ nests and water bottles that come with a stick of charcoal (“the vision of abc home curation”). A surprising number of those lighting fixtures have tiny bulbs embedded in long tentacles that dangle over the dining room like jellyfish. I could see how it might be romantic and mystical if you are sexually attracted to gelatinous sea creatures. As for “dynamic love affair,” you are going to have to ask Google. I have absolutely no idea.",White shrimp in agua diablo; mezcal-cured salmon; calamari with ancho-chile glaze; spring pea empanadas; mushroom tacos; black sea bass with tamarind and thyme; arroz con pollo; “impossible” flan; “Popsicles.”

You may have been up at 2 that morning drafting a better ending for a long-ago memory. But certain restaurants, if you can afford them, can knock down the barriers between you and happiness for a few hours. Every taste seems to transport you to another world, while every gesture of the staff convinces you that you live in the privileged center of this one.  Daniel, which turned 20 this year, can make you feel that way. Does chilled pea soup sound like the stuff of privilege? It is when it comes from this kitchen, where Jean François Bruel has been the executive chef since 2003, and which Daniel Boulud, the proprietor, watches over from a windowed perch above the saucepans and sieves.  Those sieves got a workout on this soup, straining it to a gliding smoothness. It had the clear, refreshing sweetness of the smallest peas eaten straight from the pod. Salty diamonds of smoked sable and a white ring of rosemary-infused cream helped the soup’s purity shine more clearly. This kind of exquisitely sensitive, profoundly seasonal, fundamentally French cooking helped lift Daniel to several four-star reviews in The New York Times, the most recent one by Frank Bruni in 2009.  Again and again, I have been startled by the excellence of Mr. Bruel’s ingredients and his talent for unlocking all they had to offer. I have never tasted more calmly flavorful veal tenderloin, or fresher and more gently handled swordfish, or a more skillfully roasted breast of guinea hen. But some of these star ingredients were embedded in elaborate, multipart compositions that didn’t fully reward the attention they demanded. At times, the restaurant gave the impression that it was trying to garnish its way to greatness.  And while the service can be among the best in the city, with a supreme attentiveness softened by a surprising warmth and even chattiness, it is not always that way for everyone. When people who are known at the restaurant tell me about their meals, they look blissful. Others look disappointed or resentful as they tell me about cramped tables in the neoclassical arcades around the grand sunken dining room and hasty, perfunctory service.  One night I had a reservation 15 minutes apart from a colleague who wasn’t likely to be recognized, as I repeatedly was. We both ordered the six-course $195 tasting menu. (A three-course prix fixe dinner is $116.) Our meals were virtually identical. Our experiences were not. The kitchen sent two amuse courses to my table. His got one. A few remaining sips of my wine, ordered by the glass, were topped off. His glass sat empty at times while he waited to be offered another.  We both ate extraordinary fried lollipops of filleted frogs’ legs on a long stick of bone, but only I was then brought a napkin-covered bowl of rosemary- and lemon-scented water for rinsing my fingers. My servers were solicitous: Was this course, or that one, or that one, prepared to your liking? Was the pacing of the meal satisfactory? Could we interest you in a cheese course? Would you like your espresso with dessert, or after? Finally, as I neared the revolving door on East 65th Street: Can we help you find a cab tonight? My colleague wasn’t asked any of those questions. Still, the next morning, he reported feeling very well taken care of. And a restaurant can’t be blamed for trying to impress a critic.  It can be faulted, though, for turning its best face away from the unknowns, the first-timers, the birthday splurgers, the tourists. They are precisely the people who would remember a little coddling at a place like Daniel for years. And while a missing finger bowl won’t seriously mar anyone’s evening, missing Daniel’s cheese cart might. It is one of the finest four-wheeled vehicles in New York. Whenever I wondered if I really wanted cheese, a server would lay his knife on a soft wheel, pressing gently. The mounded top would fall for a moment then rise up again, gracefully and almost willingly. After that, the question was not if I should have some, but how many kinds could fit on one plate. It was just as pointless to try to wave away the basket of Mark Fiorentino’s gorgeous breads, like a garlic focaccia, round and dimpled in the center. Rajeev Vaidya, the head sommelier, shepherded me past the many bottles that could land a weak wine lover in debt to more affordable ones. He has a 2007 halbtrocken from the German riesling maker Georg Breuer. Some buyers scoffed at the vintage, pushing prices down, but not Mr. Vaidya. A bottle can be yours for the princely sum of $25. Recently, the title of executive pastry chef passed from Sandro Micheli to Ghaya Oliveira, and the dessert course, already exciting, has a little more energy. Ms. Oliveira’s approach is more modern and wide-ranging, embracing unusual spices and exuberant swipes of color. Her mint-scented strawberries are a giddy, flagrant essay in pink, with triangles of watermelon, columns of half-frozen strawberry mousse and ladyfingers tinted with powdered strawberry skin. It was a soft, lilting summer tune I won’t get out of my head before Labor Day. The courses before dessert could be just as wonderfully haunting. I’d give a lot to recapture the happiness I got from slow-baked abalone, rich with creamed avocado and slightly tart with heart-shaped wood sorrel. I’m still transfixed by a peekytoe crab salad’s bravura variations on apple and celery, carried through to the juices in a walnut-oil vinaigrette. And nothing quite prepared me for the untamed whoosh of intense green herbs in a bowl of olive-oil-poached cod teased into big, glistening flakes, then seasoned with za’atar and a bright cilantro sauce. But the kitchen’s compulsion toward complexity could also result in a proliferation of dollhouse garnishes. Grilled sweet shrimp were outfitted with a heart of palm purée, microcubes of mango and cucumber, bok choy, tiny tapioca crackers, curls of shaved hearts of palm, among other things. The parts never quite gathered into a rush of flavor. A variation on Mr. Boulud’s classic roasted sea bass with syrah sauce came with radicchio so bitter I wanted to slap it. A drum of sweet potato purée with a candylike crust of marrow on top only made the next bite of radicchio harder to take. The kitchen loves to put two or three treatments of an ingredient side by side, when it might do better to focus on the one that works best. In a triptych of striped jack, a poached piece on a salad of mustard seeds with cubes of riesling gelée tasted as if the components were destined to be together. But there wasn’t the same inevitability about the lettuce-wrapped dumpling of striped jack tartare topped with caviar, or the smoky rillettes surrounded by crunchy carrot and asparagus. Daniel built its fame on Mr. Boulud’s exquisite refinements on French peasant food. Over the years, the refinements have multiplied while the peasant food has been sent away to his many spinoff bistros.  Traces of it are still around, as in the short rib braised in red wine, half of a beef duo. The last time I tasted it, I was sure it was the finest French beef stew in existence. I knew my servers were trying to make my night one I’d recall with a smile. And I wished everyone could be so lucky.",Chilled minted pea soup; duck terrine; black sea bass with syrah sauce; flaked cod with za’atar; grilled swordfish; duo of beef; mint-scented strawberries; warm chocolate coulant.
222,Uncle Boons,2 star,"July 2, 2013",Pete Wells,Nolita,Thai,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-uncle-boons-in-nolita.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-uncle-boons-in-nolita.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The smallest blackout I’ve ever lived through was limited to the interior of a Thai restaurant on Spring Street, just off the Bowery, named Uncle Boons, where early one night the electricity kept cutting out, then flicking back on a few minutes later. Almost every foot of wall space is covered with pictures that might have been picked up at a Bangkok flea market: portraits of Thailand’s kings, thrift-store paintings, prints of jungle beasts, a monster-movie poster in Thai and semi-English (“Once again dinosaur shake the erath!”). But staging a Southeast Asian power failure seemed to be taking the conceit a bit far.  We didn’t stop eating, though. I would bring my own generator if that’s what it took to finish the mee krob with fried sweetbreads. In many Thai restaurants in the United States, the fried noodles in mee krob are dispatched into dissolved brown sugar with trace amounts of fish sauce and lime juice. The result is as interesting as spaghetti in pancake syrup. The sauce at Uncle Boons, which starts with tamarind pulp and palm sugar, was rounded and rich and deeply engaging. And a little thing like iffy wiring wouldn’t keep me away from the yum kai hua pli, a salad of warm roasted chicken torn and tossed with crunchy threads of sliced banana blossoms. The chicken would have been great by itself, but it was the dressing that helped it shine through the power failure: warm coconut milk soured with lime juice and spiced with dried chiles to an intensity that I think of as handkerchief-hot. Uncle Boons must have fixed its electrical troubles, because they did not recur. What did return was my excitement at tasting Thai flavors so fresh and dynamic. The restaurant has less in common with Queens Thai dynamos like Ayada, Sripraphai, tiny Chao Thai or its roomier spinoff Chao Thai Too than it does with Pok Pok Ny, Andy Ricker’s place on the Brooklyn waterfront. A few of its tricks might have been lifted from Mr. Ricker’s backpack. There is the charcoal grill, visible behind a glass wall at the end of the bar. There is the tight menu that doesn’t give you the choice of chicken, beef, pork, shrimp or squid with almost every curry, a concession that holds back some of the best Thai restaurants.  Both places look like dark, woody Thai pubs, right down to their motorized ice buckets that shake bottles of Singha until they turn into alcoholic slush that you drink through a straw. (It won’t be the best beer you’ve ever had, but it may be the coldest.) Pok Pok Ny follows through with many other wacky and excellent Thai beverages, while the drinks are Uncle Boons’s prime blind spot. Neither of the two cocktails is a complete triumph, and even the iced tea with sweetened condensed milk tastes watery. But Uncle Boons has many charms all its own. The owners and chefs, Ann Redding and her husband, Matt Danzer, met while working as cooks at Per Se, and the marks of Thomas Keller’s ballet academy are far more visible than you’d expect at a place that plays warbly Thai covers of “Another Brick in the Wall” and “Hang On, Sloopy.” The tables are set with folded cotton napkins and traditional brass forks and spoons from Thailand. Three months after the restaurant opened, the dining room staff is already quite polished, poised and welcoming. The third time the lights went out, a server brought every table an unnecessary but delicious little apology, a plate of mieng kum, little one-bite snacks. Mounded on a soft, fresh betel leaf are fresh ginger, coconut, dried shrimp, peanuts and very hot chiles. You dab on some shrimp-paste sauce, fold the leaf over and pop it into your mouth, and right away your taste buds spring to attention. It’s a preview of the flavors that will become major themes of the meal. Coconut milk is the foundation of the remarkably aromatic curry of chicken livers and fresh pineapple called dup kai kaeng supalot, and of an amazing massaman curry with shredded potato and braised beef cheeks that break up the minute you dip a spoon into the bowl. In place of the gloppy peanut-butter sweetness found in many American massamans, Uncle Boons makes a drier sauce with the exotic muskiness of a walk through a spice shop, punctuated by the crisp pungency of green peppercorns.  Over four meals, Uncle Boons appeared to be working its way toward consistent excellence. Still, there was one night when the green mango salad tilted too far into sourness, and another when damp, clumpy fried rice with crab suggested that the wok had been a few degrees shy of the smoking fury that leads to great fried rice. Spice levels could waver, too. But with only one or two exceptions, Uncle Boons came through with searing heat when it was called for, especially in that chicken salad or with a laab of minced lamb wok-fried to a deep mahogany and served warm; fresh mint and cilantro temper the spice but in no way tame it.  Subtle flavors have a place in Thai cooking, too. There’s a hint of a 1970s suburban party dip to the lon pu kem, which offers raw snap peas, radishes, crisp green mango and Thai eggplant to be dunked into a bowl of creamy, coconut-rich crab dip. And there is just enough fresh green chile in a thin nam prik sauce to bring out the sweetness in charcoal-grilled blowfish tails or baby octopus that would fit in your palm if you were silly enough to place them there and not between your teeth, where they belong. A coconut-milk-based curry yellow with fresh turmeric is one key to the greatness of Uncle Boons’s khao soi. But really, everything in the bowl plays a part: the chicken leg stewed to irresistible tenderness, the pickled mustard greens, the big frizz of fried cilantro-flecked egg noodles on top and the same noodles boiled in the curry. I wouldn’t scream if Ms. Redding and Mr. Danzer threw a few more dried chiles into the pot, but this is still the best khao soi I’ve eaten in New York.  Ms. Redding was born in northeastern Thailand, but before opening Uncle Boons she and Mr. Danzer roamed the country, and their cooking does, too. The couple may be in the market for a better electrician. But where it counts, in the kitchen, they have all the power any lover of Thai food could ask for.",Grilled seafood; chopped lamb salad; mee krob; frog legs; ancient style dip; chicken and banana blossom salad; chicken liver and pineapple curry; rotisserie chicken; khao soi; green curry and noodles with eggplant; beef cheeks with massaman curry; charcoal-roasted dorade; red curry bamboo shoots; water spinach; rotisserie cabbage.
223,Lafayette,1 star,"June 25, 2013",Pete Wells,NoHo,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-lafayette-in-noho.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-lafayette-in-noho.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"In some corners of the food media, the opening of Andrew Carmellini’s new restaurant, Lafayette, was written about the way successful nuclear tests are covered on North Korean television. Some of this was because of Mr. Carmellini’s record as a chef and restaurateur. His first two places, Locanda Verde and the Dutch, are so well loved that he would probably draw a crowd if he sold nothing but Lorna Doones and ginger ale.  But Lafayette serves French food, now getting a second wind in New York after years of running on steak-frites-scented fumes. Apart, perhaps, from Daniel Boulud, no chef in town is better equipped to make that cuisine relevant and exciting again than Mr. Carmellini. A walking Larousse Gastronomique, he spent six years at Café Boulud working within the traditions of France as gracefully as he danced around them. Given a NoHo corner lot with miles of windows, the restaurant Mr. Carmellini came up with is like a junior Eataly for Francophiles. There is a pastry shop and bakery, a cocktail bar and an all-French wine list. Damon Wise, an ace technician from Craft and the Monkey Bar hired by Mr. Carmellini as chef de cuisine, wears a toque as he oversees an open kitchen where chickens on spits slowly give up their melting fat. All of this is packed inside the brass-and-mirrors skin of a brasserie that stays open from morning to midnight or thereabouts.  As for the food, there are salads and charcuterie and oysters and shoestring fries. Almost all of it is worthy, but very little seduces you. Lafayette wants you to fall in love with it, but it tries too hard in some ways and not hard enough in others. It’s a restaurant that is a little too easy to place in the friend zone. The nonromance starts at the door. One night when a private party had taken over the basement, Lafayette let large, unfunny security men with earpieces stop diners on the sidewalk for questioning. One prospective guest with a reservation said he was on his way inside to meet somebody. “For what?” came the reply.  When Lafayette’s staff members were handling first impressions themselves, the greeting was not always warmer. One night I was briskly packed off to the bar and ordered to come back and tell the hosts when the rest of my party had arrived, even though my other guests were sure to check in before searching for me. Nobody seems to have helped the servers pronounce simple French words on the menu. Specials weren’t mentioned until I asked, and a menu change (trout in place of dorade) wasn’t disclosed until I ordered it. A basket of country bread was placed directly in front of the only woman at the table, as if she were supposed to eat the whole thing herself.  This wouldn’t be such a bad fate; baked by James Belisle, the bread is outstanding, with a dense, mildly tangy rye and whole wheat crumb beneath a thick band of crust that shatters with a noise like a motorcycle boot stepping on a bag of potato chips. But the service at a restaurant as busy as Lafayette needs a brisk professionalism leavened with charm, or else you start to feel as if you are eating in the largest and most elegant Pain Quotidien in the five boroughs. The details matter.  Luckily Mr. Wise and Jennifer Yee, the pastry chef, are as detail-oriented as they come. Ms. Yee is a master of classic tarts (both a cherry-almond frangipane tart and figs baked on a wheel of puff pastry were high points not just of the meal but of the month); modern French desserts (her charred mango with toasted coconut and lime parfait is a sunny and sophisticated tropical holiday); and, for good measure, all-American classics (she makes a great whole-wheat carrot muffin, which should be an oxymoron. The muffins are sold at the bakery counter alongside my favorite almond croissant in the city and other viennoiseries baked by Mr. Belisle). My meals leading up to dessert were often very good, even if they didn’t always reach the same highs. The red-wine sauce in tripe bourguignon is a terrific achievement: fruity but not sharp or winy, it has a bittersweet richness like good dark chocolate. The pastas, too, were reliably impressive, like the little postage stamps of ravioli filled with goat cheese and squirted with a pesto that had a just-picked freshness, or the fleur de soleil, tender and silky little flowers tossed with snap peas, pancetta and mint. The eggs Lafayette, hard cooked with smoked sable heaped into the yolk hollows and trout roe gleaming on top, tasted like three or four great brunch dishes in one small, luxurious package.  Duck breast au poivre under pinwheels of candied kumquat had a more concentrated and meatier flavor than some steaks, although the watery disks of braised radish remained on my plate.  Sometimes a modern tidiness goes too far, though. The seasoning on a neat patty of beef tartare was too polite and the frisée salad was too prim, with dainty bits of house-made bacon and an egg cooked too long to melt into the vinaigrette.  A bouillabaisse that could have been the best in town was undercut by its serving dish, photogenic but impractical. The lobster tail, langoustine, mussels and monkfish were all handsomely cooked, and the shellfish broth was wonderfully aromatic with saffron and pastis. But spreading it all out in a shallow copper braising pan meant that both seafood and sauce were tepid within minutes.  It’s now off the menu. I hope it’s simply gone to Williams-Sonoma to buy itself a deep porcelain bowl, because a spectacular bouillabaisse could help Lafayette get out of the friend zone. The by-the-book pork pâté won’t do it. Neither will the rotisserie chicken. Tender and flavorful as it is, it still puts you in mind of Fairway, not Chez l’Ami Louis. Profoundly sweet and fresh scallops won’t do it, either, not if they are languishing in a nondescript pea purée surrounded by a meek spoonful of morel jus. Another chef-engineered burger won’t do it, even if this one, served at lunch, gets its terrific flavor from ground brisket, and neither will a soft-shell crab on a toasted brioche. The crab is faultless, but the sandwich belongs in another restaurant. The name of that restaurant is the Dutch.  Dishes that would be equally at home there, or at Locanda Verde, are everywhere. This may make fans of those restaurants feel welcome. It may also help Mr. Carmellini move cooks from one kitchen to another. But it doesn’t give Lafayette the strong point of view that would make it feel like something more than a good choice in the neighborhood of the Public Theater. Of all the adjectives that might describe a French restaurant built by Andrew Carmellini, Lafayette brings to mind the last one I would have expected: optional. ","Pâté maison, eggs Lafayette, Maine scallop cru, baked oysters “Sargent,” spaghetti niçoise, duck au poivre, rotisserie chicken, mango coupe, fig tart."
224,Kajitsu,2 star,"June 18, 2013",Pete Wells,Murray Hill,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-kajitsu-in-murray-hill.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-kajitsu-in-murray-hill.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"When I eat at Kajitsu, a restaurant that practices an animal-free cooking tradition called shojin ryori, I am never shocked to find that I don’t miss meat or fish. When the Japanese have been working on an idea for hundreds of years, they tend to figure out a few things. To express wonder that Kajitsu’s chef, Ryota Ueshima, can fashion a delicious multicourse meal out of nothing but plants and mushrooms is like being astonished when a French baker makes dessert from flour, butter, sugar and eggs.  But each time I go to Kajitsu, which recently moved from the East Village to a tranquil and luminous new home in Murray Hill, I am still surprised by the variety of flavors that Mr. Ueshima coaxes out of meals that Westerners would call vegan.  Before reaching across the chef’s counter with porcini and morels cooked in steaming mushroom broth just until they have lost their raw crunch, he adds a ladleful of green sansho buds and blossoms to the bowl. They look like tiny grape clusters, taste a little lemony and make your mouth tingle in a way that intensifies as you eat. The sansho also seems to deepen and change the flavor of the mushrooms until they start to remind you of cured meat. On a blanket of Japanese maple leaves, next to a tall cup of spindly enoki mushrooms and a single boiled pearl onion with a red beak of miso, he places a little fried sandwich: two pieces of lotus root filled with house-made fermented tofu. Kajitsu is known for its fermented tofu, and if this strikes you as a sketchy claim to fame, then I urge you to eat some as soon as you can. It has something like the pungent, funky, very deep and long-lasting flavor of blue cheese, with a smoothness of its own.  Even Mr. Ueshima’s simpler dishes have unexpected depth. A chilled pea soup with a welcome sweetness was underlined by the slight savoriness of white miso. Chopped pine nuts, grated daikon and tender stems of wild parsley scattered over a soupy bowl of rice gave it a fresh, gentle flavor that was like the coming of spring. Shojin ryori was developed in Zen Buddhist monasteries after the religion arrived in Japan. The monks did not believe in taking life. They did believe in drinking tea. The frugal meal that preceded their tea ceremony grew into shojin ryori, which grew into the formal multicourse kaiseki tradition. That shojin ryori was vegetarian made it a devotional practice. That it was seasonal went without saying.  At its original address, Kajitsu may have taken the monastic aesthetic to a fault. The plain walls and chilly stone floors of the dining room were so austere, they felt slightly punitive. The new place (above a shop selling expensive tea and even more expensive teapots) shimmers, although it has not quite gone Vegas.  In the back is the chef’s counter, carved from a single block of keyaki wood and sitting beneath a gently sloped cedar arch. The front dining room has a bay window and a ceiling that seems to hang in midair. Between the two, casually resting on one side just off the floor, is an 1,800-year-old ceramic pot.  The service ware at Kajitsu is worth studying. Most pieces are handmade, like the carved wood trays and the hammered metal chopstick rests and sake pitchers. Vintage ceramics with small chips show signs of repair, and their age underlines transience of the seasons that is a major theme of shojin ryori. You could design a calendar simply by eating at Kajitsu every four weeks and taking pictures. Mr. Ueshima changes his menus on the first of the month, adding some plants that are at their peak and some that are on the rise. His dishes — four of them in a $55 tasting, eight in an $85 or $100 menu that ends with a bowl of matcha, green tea as thick and frothy as espresso — are drawn from the season, but they are also drawings of the season.  In June, he used a glossy dark magnolia leaf as the lid for a soup of slippery wakame seaweed and sesame tofu fried to a satisfying crunch. Last month, he lay pointy lily blades across a bowl that held a kind of vegan Jell-O salad, a clear gelatin dome studded with slices of raw baby okra, cooked bell peppers and mountain yam. To garnish that pea soup, the first dish on his April menu, he had made tiny replicas of pink-streaked cherry blossoms out of thin sheets of wheat gluten and rice flour, then decorated the bowl with a cherry branch whose flowers were so exquisitely small and delicate that they made other cherry blossoms look like the centerpiece at the wedding of a mobster’s daughter. Anticipating the season and showing off local ingredients are both old kaiseki traditions, but I found that the things I enjoyed least at Kajitsu were Western vegetables that had not come into their own yet. Neither grape tomatoes with a vinegar jelly in April nor corn kernels in a golden fritter in June were as lush as they will be in July. And while Mr. Ueshima seems to reach for stronger, meatier flavors than Kajitsu’s first chef, Masato Nishihara, he doesn’t always have his predecessor’s delicacy. The chef’s artistry, though, can make up for some of the flavor his ingredients might be missing on their own. His simmered tomato would still be very good in August; it is exceptional in June, a chilled poached plum tomato with slivers of juicy and spicy spring ginger set on shimmering tomato jelly that took its layers of depth from kelp and shiitakes. Although the buckwheat flavor of the soba noodles made fresh each day could be a little more full-throated, they are as tender as they could be and still hold together. Rice, the last course before dessert, is a treat that can appear in many forms. Warm and fragrant, sharpened with vinegar, it made a bed for two rows of tender, cooked king oyster mushroom stems carved to look like slices of raw fish. Dab the mushrooms with nori paste and freshly grated wasabi, pinch some rice between chopsticks, and you have a deeply rewarding take on sushi. Whether or not it is on your menu, you should drink matcha at the chef’s counter at least once. Mr. Ueshima will froth it with a bamboo whisk before giving the bowl three small turns. Then he sets it in front of you and gives a deep bow that brings you back to the roots of a meal that is more than a meal.",All menus.
225,Casa Enrique,2 star,"June 13, 2013",Ligaya Mishan,Long Island City,Mexican,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/dining/reviews/hungry-city-casa-enrique-in-long-island-city-queens.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/dining/reviews/hungry-city-casa-enrique-in-long-island-city-queens.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The first plate to land on the table at Casa Enrique is a bowl of what looks like fossilized macaroni and cheese. It turns out to be chicharrines, a Mexican street snack, squiggles of wheat flour deep-fried until they puff up like pork cracklings. The last plate might well be a dark chocolate pot de crème, on top of which stand three thick Maria biscuits, instantly recognizable by their constellations of docker holes and Greek key trim. For the chef, Cosme Aguilar, they are the cookies of childhood: the Mexican version of the madeleine. Casa Enrique opened last year in Long Island City, Queens, a block from the No. 7 train stop and the French bistro Café Henri, where Mr. Aguilar worked for 10 years. (Both establishments, along with Café Henri in the West Village, are owned by Winston Kulok and his wife, Carole Bergman Kulok, and feature the Kuloks’ pet Maltese in their logos — in the case of Casa Enrique, wearing a sombrero.) Mr. Aguilar, who was born in Chiapas, the southernmost state in Mexico, has spent much of his professional life cooking French food. Here he brings polish to Mexican classics without tampering with their essence. At times the freshness of the ingredients startles. Guacamole is mostly avocado, minimally interfered with. Slivers of raw jicama and scarlet and golden beets are dressed with nothing but lemon and white balsamic vinegar. This provides balance for the earthier dishes: hard-boiled eggs tucked inside albondigas (meatballs) molded from a blend of short rib, brisket and chuck, and lamb shank rubbed with pulla chiles and ground guaje seeds, oniony and sour-sweet like black garlic. Strips of rajas (poblano chiles), roasted over an open flame, grow tender and meaty under the influence of crema (Mexican sour cream) in the enchiladas doña Blanca, named after Mr. Aguilar’s mother, who gave him the recipe. Judged on looks alone, cochinito Chiapaneco (pork ribs, Chiapan-style) could be a dish at any Mexican restaurant: meat hunkered in a sea of thick, brown sauce, the border between sauce and black beans invisible, the yellow-tinged rice riddled with peas and carrot cubes. But the gradations of sweetness and heat multiply, from the pork’s long steeping in a paste of fruity guajillo chiles, cinnamon, allspice and a house-made pineapple vinegar left to ferment for three months. Even the perennial rice and beans are noteworthy, the rice enriched with chicken stock, garlic and serrano chiles (or, for vegetarians, corn broth and epazote, with its flicker of licorice) and loaded with fresh peas and nubs of carrot, the beans cooked in a pan still sticky with the caramelized drippings of charred onions. Mr. Aguilar makes his own tostadas and sopes, coarse halos of fried masa. They are platforms for crab bright with lime and cilantro, and for crumbled house-made chorizo, stitched with cinnamon and guajillo, pulla and arbol chiles, and spiked with more of that pineapple vinegar. There are less memorable efforts. A mole has more sweetness than depth. Fish is served over corn kernels afloat in a corn broth, a meek version of esquites, lacking the usual vivid synthesis of mayonnaise and lime. Tacos, built on tortillas from Plaza Piaxtla in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and packed with the likes of mesquite-smoked chicken, slow-cooked brisket and delicately battered fish, are puzzlingly dry. Mr. Aguilar’s older brother, Luis, watches the front of the house, where the servers eddy unobtrusively. The pale concrete floors and white walls read as either chic or stark, depending on whether you’re sitting in the cramped back room or up front at the gorgeous planked communal table. I wished there were more dishes on the menu from Chiapas, a region underrepresented among New York’s Mexican restaurants. But Cosme Aguilar’s upbringing took him across Mexico, and his menu ranges accordingly. He approaches the food not as a scholar, but as a native speaker. Elsewhere in town, higher-profile chefs who came to Mexican food later in life are embracing it as their own. At Casa Enrique, Mr. Aguilar is experiencing a kind of homecoming.

Even if you haven’t, the answer would still be yes. This is supposed to be the Italian restaurant where you celebrated your birthday before anyone told you that chicken scarpariello isn’t Italian.  This being 2013, and the two chefs, Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone, being former lieutenants of Mario Batali and Daniel Boulud, Carbone is infinitely more self-conscious than those old restaurants. It is a fancy red-sauce joint in Greenwich Village as directed by Quentin Tarantino, bringing back the punch-in-the-guts thrills of a genre that everybody else sees as uncultured and a little embarrassing, while exposing the sophistication that was always lurking there. Carbone has a technical prowess that can make you giddy; a lust for excess that can, at times, make you a little queasy; and an instinct for sheer entertainment that makes a lot of other restaurants seem like earnest, unimaginative drones. There are, in the Tarantino style, fanboy film allusions: the tile floor from “The Godfather,” the narrow passageway into the back dining room that makes you feel like Ray Liotta handshake-tipping his way into the Copacabana. There are the songs that make you think, “Oh, no,” followed by “I forgot how great this is,” as people with open bottles of Gaja on the table drum their fingers to “We Open in Venice.”  Like Tarantino’s love letters to pulpy exploitation films, Carbone affectionately picks up the clichés of its genre, twirls them, then hurls them at your head. Our captain wears a B-movie smile and a tuxedo in a shade of maroon last seen at Liberace’s estate sale. Bearing a hollowed-out wheel of Parmesan, he stabs a nugget of cheese and slides it on to my plate. It tastes young, milky and uninteresting, but next come papery slices of smoky and complex aged country ham, Kentucky serving as a stunt double for Parma, and a stack of “grandma bread,” a no-cheese Sicilian pizza with oregano and a shadowy, sweet pulp of tomato sauce. Both make me smile.  More unbidden genre tropes are on the way: tart giardiniera in oil, amazing garlic bread, fried ribbons of dough under powdered sugar, suave fig grappa, and delicate house-made limoncello in a bottle furry with frost. I don’t love every one of these extras, but I love the way they make me abandon any hope of quiet moderation. Nearly the entire menu at Carbone is a quotation, starting with the $50 veal parm, which is larger than some fancy brick-oven pizzas and looks like one, too, with ovals of browned buffalo mozzarella and a bright red, summer-fresh, barely cooked tomato sauce. Served with a fried shaft of bone, it’s a shock-and-awe dish, and the most shocking thing about it is that there is no real revisionism here; it is a veal parm, the way you always hoped it would be.  More often, the old tropes get an injection of technique that acts like a syringe of epinephrine plunged into the heart. The two-and-a-half pound lobster fra diavolo is both brash and polished, the huge portion galvanized by Calabrian chiles and soothed by Cognac. No shrimp scampi has been handled as gently or luxuriously as Carbone’s chorus line of langoustines, claws extended, bodies split and slick with butter that implies garlic without coming right out and saying it. Concentrated shellfish stock is the foundation a zuppa di pesce so deeply fragrant, you know it’s coming before it’s on the table. I wish the clam broth that infuses linguine vongole had the same intensity. But other plates of what Carbone calls “macaroni” are remarkable. Knuckles of tortellini stuffed with whipped sheep’s milk ricotta are a show of zero-gravity delicacy while elbows of rigatoni are forceful and substantial, their tomato sauce unabashedly spicy and slyly buttery. There are also, in this movie, some lapses in taste and judgment. Fried broccoli rabe is locked inside some of the heaviest, greasiest batter I’ve ever tasted. Carbone’s tiramisù, a wedge of layer cake with mascarpone between Marsala-soaked spongecake, is too wet and too boozy, a case where the middlebrow original is better than the highbrow makeover.  Strangest of all is something called Chinese chicken, which tastes as if Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Carbone were trying to recreate something from Chinatown Night at their college cafeterias. But old Italian-American restaurants generally have at least one dish on the menu that nobody orders. Maybe this soy-and-sesame-seed nonentity is supposed to be another in-joke, although it would be funnier if, when you ordered it, your captain said, “We just sold out.” They could get a laugh out of it, too. Carbone’s captains are character actors who have mastered the jokey, swaggering, slightly bossy style that was a New York specialty before waiters began to have the blandly pleasant manners of the young people who carry Bibles and ring doorbells on Saturday mornings. There is a flash of three-card monte below the surface, as these men sell you on meatballs with your pasta or promise that the lemon cheesecake is “the best you’ll ever have in your life.” They aren’t lying about the cheesecake, though. And the most talented among them can improvise dialogue while grating creamy ricotta salata over a Caesar salad that is just as sharp with anchovies as you could wish. One night a star of romantic comedies was sharing one appetizer and one main course with her male date. When the date left the table, the captain leaned in. Captain: Nice catch. Star: Excuse me? Captain: I said that’s a good-looking young man you’re with. Star: (Raucous laughter.) This kind of thing is funny only if you agree to play along. And I’m not ready to play along with all of Carbone’s casting decisions: currently all the captains, typically the most highly tipped employees, are men. But I admire nearly all the other choices that Mr. Torrisi, Mr. Carbone and their business partner, Jeff Zalaznick, have made. Many American restaurants are trying to reinvent fine dining by looking abroad. Carbone is mining the best elements of homegrown American style of service and cuisine that flourished when men in ties and women in heels, woozy from a final shot of sambuca, wobbled to the sidewalk clutching doggy bags. We didn’t know how good we had it. Carbone is here to remind us.","Carpaccio piemontese, scampi alla scampi, posillipo pan roast, Caesar salad alla ZZ, tortellini al ragù, spicy rigatoni vodka, bass vin rosso, lobster fra diavolo, double lamb chop, cherry pepper ribs, lemon cheesecake, carrot cake."
228,Taqueria Tlaxcalli,1 star,"May 28, 2013",Pete Wells,Parkchester,Mexican,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-salvation-taco-in-murray-hill-and-taqueria-tlaxcalli-in-the-bronx.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-salvation-taco-in-murray-hill-and-taqueria-tlaxcalli-in-the-bronx.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Expectations are everything. It was hard to know what to expect when April Bloomfield, the British-born chef who has been New York’s chief importer of the gastro-pub ethos since she opened the Spotted Pig, announced that her latest project would be called Salvation Taco. Although she consulted with the chef of two local Mexican restaurants, Roberto Santibañez, it seemed likely that Mexican tradition would not be treated as law. But when a restaurant has two words in its name and one of them is taco, you might think the star attraction will be a fat bundle of something hot and tasty folded inside a warm tortilla with a sauce that adds intrigue and excitement. That describes almost none of the tacos I ate at this jammed and noisy five-month-old restaurant inside the Pod 39 hotel in Murray Hill. The tortillas were a little bigger than an English muffin. A small taco can be a great taco, but these were topped so minimally and sauced so timidly that masa was virtually all I could taste. A swipe of curried crema was not enough to bring four tiny and stubbornly bland cauliflower florets to life. A relish of charred onions and pomegranate molasses might have lifted two little fried sweetbreads out of dullness if there had been more than a small blotch of it. Those tiny portions cooled quickly. Often the fillings were cold, the tortillas going stiff, a shame because they are freshly pressed and griddled. Even the miniature naan that stood in for a tortilla in one taco was so firm one day that it was unbendable, although on another it folded obediently around chunks of spiced lamb. Stacked in a covered basket, though, Salvation’s masa tortillas are tender, warm and seductively fragrant. This is how they are served if you order one of the “family-style feasts,” impressive platters of protein that you tear apart and pile into tacos yourself. Two of these were spectacular: the ham hock, with a fruity and tart chile-tamarind glaze; and the cumin and pepper-rubbed lamb shoulder, so intensely flavorful it was as if three lambs had been distilled down to a single super-lamb. Rolling your own will get you a terrific taco, but some of the tables are so narrow it’s a bit like performing surgery on an airplane seatback tray. Ken Friedman, Ms. Bloomfield’s business partner in Salvation Taco (as well as the Spotted Pig, the John Dory Oyster Bar and the Breslin), has gone for a psychedelic, polytheistic thrift-store look, filling two rooms with Japanese lanterns, glass Buddhas, Hindu gods, Christian saints and a painting of a cowboy angel by the Rev. Howard Finster. At least it supplied some visual distractions on a Friday night when a promised 90-minute wait for a table stretched to two hours. Dishes that seemed out of place in a taqueria often had a good reason for being there, including the fried pig ears sprinkled with ground chiles; a soup of kimchi, pork and hominy with the hot-and-sour potency of some Sichuan stews; and the dark, terrifically complex beef chili, long on the fruity flavor of dried chile peppers if somewhat short on meat. But the things you’d hope any taqueria would nail could be dispiriting. Guacamole was sensationally well seasoned with lime and serranos, but always arrived cold. Margaritas were strangely flat, a mariachi band without trumpets. An al pastor quesadilla needed more heat, more cheese and, crucially, any amount of pineapple, which was missing entirely. At least two-thirds of the white cubes in a ceviche turned out to be not fish but apples. There is also a lamb tongue sandwich that the menu calls a torta. It had the bread you’d expect, a bulkie roll dabbed with refried beans, but none of the trimmings: no lettuce, tomatoes, onions or mayonnaise. The tongue, poached and grilled, was wonderfully done, and so was the chimichurri of raw herbs, lime and olive oil. The only thing the sandwich needed was the crusty Italian roll that Ms. Bloomfield might have chosen if Salvation Taco was not supposed to be a Mexican restaurant. To redraw my taco baseline, I went to the Bronx. At Taqueria Tlaxcalli in the Parkchester neighborhood, I found golden gorditas, flying saucers of fried masa filled with a crunchy mash of chicharrones. These little pork puffs make impressively complex snacks with the addition of a cooked tomato salsa that had almost as much smoke as heat. I found hand-pinched sopes filled with refried beans and crumbled chorizo browned to a heavy-duty crackle that was softened by cilantro, onions, fresh cheese and crema. I found a crisp, citrusy and spicy cactus salad that was a model of unpretentious salad craftsmanship, and a torta constructed to maximize the collisions of warm and cool, crunchy and soft that are the source of the sandwich’s charms. I found juicy fajitas and even juicier alambres, a stir-fry of meat, green peppers and onions under a poof of melted queso Oaxaca and four folded tortillas. And I found tacos that filled out their warm corn tortillas the way a fat man fills out a hammock. The meats were canonical: al pastor bright red with chiles and topped with pineapple; tender barbacoa to make a convert out of goat skeptics; and deeply savory carnitas that were somehow both creamy and crunchy. The exterior of Taqueria Tlaxcalli (pronounced TLOSH-collie), with a neon Corona sign under an awning in a shade of pink that looks like lipstick at the end of a long night, tells you to move on. The interior, with mango-colored walls, lime-green ceramic pitchers and marbled blue pendant lights, tells you to stay. You may be here for a while if you come during the dinner rush, when the cooks working at slapstick speed become mired in delivery orders. And some larger plates, like knife-resistant pounded steak in a thin guajillo sauce or the chicken enchiladas in a soupy and droningly bitter mole poblano, were not worth the delay. But the guacamole, freshly mashed in a molcajete, the traditional rough stone mortar, always appeared within minutes. Taqueria Tlaxcalli also makes a stew of cactus, onions and strips of chicken or steak in an angry red sauce or, my favorite, a tangy cooked tomatillo sauce. All versions are served, seething, inside a hot molcajete — the name of the stew. Mauricio Gómez founded Taqueria Tlaxcalli seven years ago because he was homesick for the food he had grown up with in Mexico City. For new immigrants, a little homesickness is to be expected, but a restaurant as solidly good as Mr. Gómez’s is always a happy surprise.","Pig ears, kimchi pork belly pozole, beef chili, family-style feasts, churros."
229,Caravaggio,1 star,"May 14, 2013",Pete Wells,Upper East Side,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-caravaggio-on-the-italian-upper-east-side.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-caravaggio-on-the-italian-upper-east-side.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IN HIS LANDMARK STUDY FROM 1971, “The Food of Italy,” Waverley Root divided that nation into 19 distinct culinary regions. The book is a classic, its insights and prose recipes still tantalizing four decades later, but it contains a major oversight. Mr. Root says nothing at all about the Italian Upper East Side. In this chunk of the earth that broke off from the boot and drifted 4,300 miles across the ocean before colliding with Manhattan, the restaurant menus resemble one another more than they do the menus of Emilia-Romagna, Campania or Umbria. Ligurian pesto, Tuscan steak, Roman pasta all’amatriciana and Sicilian cannoli live together in harmony. Salad is an antipasto, truffles never go out of season, and beets with goat cheese is a combination as time-honored as tomatoes and olive oil. Caravaggio, which opened in 2009 around the corner from the Whitney Museum of American Art, makes a strong bid to win respect in its wayward region. Owned by Giuseppe, Antonio, Cosimo and Geraldo Bruno, the four brothers who also run Sistina and San Pietro not far away, it is one of the most civilized Italian restaurants to turn up anywhere in the city in the last few years.  Plumes of fresh flowers (cherry blossoms in early April, calla lilies later in the month) line one side of the hallway to the dining room; on the other is a framed print by — oh, hello, signed Matisse lithograph. Inside are more flowers, and much more art: a pair of Ellsworth Kelly prints, a pair of Frank Stella paintings, all four bought from the widow of William Rubin, the former curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art.  On a commission from the Brunos, the painter Donald Baechler has covered the entire back wall with a crowd of the eeriest children in the world. With their terrified eyes and gaping red mouths, they look as if they might be friends of Dick and Jane’s who have just watched Spot eat Puff. The mural is unsettling, but it has the hovering, electric presence of real art.  Caravaggio is defiantly elegant in an age that sees white tablecloths as a medieval relic whose sadistic power to stand in the way of a good time is second only to that of the chastity belt. The tables are draped with linens, ceiling baffles keep the noise to a low burble, and streamlined chocolate-leather chairs offer a quaint amenity known as lumbar support.  Another anachronism: a dress code. Jeans, shorts and sneakers are not permitted, the Web site says, although in practice only the ban on shorts is enforced. Jackets and ties are not required, but nearly all the men wear them, along with haircuts that seem to have been tidied up at Paul Molé a day or two ago. The women seem to have had their hair done even more recently. Caravaggio’s loyalists are so well groomed, it is humbling. “We are among our betters,” a companion said one night. The plates are just as carefully put together, assembled with a sharp eye for color and shape. Caravaggio has a roasted swordfish that is an Italian flag in seafood form, the white fillet sitting between a red pond of puréed tomato sauce and a frothy green sea of oregano sauce. And it served me one of the prettiest veal chops I’ve ever seen, trimmed into a thick, nearly perfect circle and evenly, handsomely browned.  Osso buco with saffron risotto, which may be the official dish of the Italian Upper East Side, looked better than ever and was almost ideally cooked, the meat tender and rose-tinted, the rice firm and creamy.  But Caravaggio, for all its civility, is haunted by inconsistency more than three years into its run. Some of my meals there were very good; in others, I couldn’t find a single dish to get excited about, and there were a few that were just not right at all. The same kitchen that dressed perfectly al dente spaghetti with a wonderfully balanced pesto of dried nuts and tomatoes put too many tomatoes in a Sicilian sardine and fennel sauce and tossed the result with bucatini that were crunchy and hard at one end. Dover sole was cooked to show off the firm delicacy that makes it such a treat, but the swordfish wrapped in the Italian flag should have come out of the oven at least two minutes sooner. Scallops, shrimp and tiny squid rings were sweet and tender, and while serving them warm over braised leeks with a lobster reduction may have stretched the definition of a seafood salad, it was so good nobody would ever complain. But in another appetizer, octopus tentacles had no flavor at all; they were nothingness with suction cups. Caravaggio’s bomboloni, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and served hot in a figure-8 dish with vanilla sauce and caramel, were light enough to achieve liftoff. But the floury, dry torta di ricotta remained depressingly earthbound. First-time travelers should be warned: no matter what the euro is trading at, the exchange rate on the Italian Upper East Side is always awful. It is especially unfavorable at Caravaggio, where salads begin at $18, and most of the pastas hover around $25. This ought to be enough to buy bucatini that is cooked on both ends. Service, slightly formal but relaxed enough to crack a smile, often lived up to Caravaggio’s aspirations. But there could be unscheduled leaves of absence after main courses were cleared, and one night one server after another tried to take our order before anyone had told us about the specials. When someone finally did, the recitation went on for almost five minutes, covering at least a dozen dishes.  It felt like a memory quiz, one I always flunked until I started writing the correct answer on my palm: just get the chicken meatballs. They are made from white meat mixed with capers, sun-dried tomatoes, thyme and enough milk-soaked bread to give them some loft, and they are braised in tomato sauce, but none of this quite accounts for their appeal. The appeal of fickle and expensive Caravaggio is easier to explain. For great Italian cooking, much of the action is in thunderous and flashy downtown dining rooms. The civilized style of a place like Caravaggio feels as rare and impressive as a blue whale. That would draw me back, along with the chicken meatballs, the bomboloni, those spooky kids and the chance that one day the restaurant will put the Italian Upper East Side on the map.",Meatballs; eggplant parmigiana; roasted swordfish; roasted red snapper; bomboloni; cannoli.
230,Randazzo's Clam Bar,1 star,"April 23, 2013",Pete Wells,Sheepshead Bay,"Italian, Seafood",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-randazzos-clam-bar-in-sheepshead-bay.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-randazzos-clam-bar-in-sheepshead-bay.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The regulars at Randazzo’s Clam Bar know what to order. I was still learning the ropes, though, so I invited suggestions. My server’s advice was quick and definitive. “Get the calama’,” she said. “That’s why you’re here.” Strictly speaking, the fried calamari was not the reason I had driven down Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn until it dead-ended at the white row of fishing ships and booze-cruise leviathans on Sheepshead Bay, then parked in front of the neon lobster with the name Randazzo’s pinched between its upheld claws. No, it was the Sauce. Randazzo’s makes any number of tomato sauces, but only one Sauce. It has two speeds, spicy and medium, but the dark, intense, concentrated, oregano-accented essence is the same. The tomatoes cook down for an eternity and then some, until they are as deeply caramelized as a pan of fried sausage and onions. The Sauce can be ladled on hot or chilled lobster, on fried shrimp, on steamed mussels or on chopped scungilli, where it works a particularly satisfying alchemy. And of course, it is poured over floured and fried calamari. A pure distillation of Italian-American cuisine, the Sauce tastes as if a chemical analysis would reveal the blueprint for every great dish in every red-sauce joint in the country. I found many other things to like at Randazzo’s, but yes, the Sauce was the reason I was there. It is the reason many people were devastated when the restaurant was destroyed by Hurricane Sandy last October, and the reason they cheered when it reopened just before Christmas. And, in a sense, the Sauce is the reason Randazzo’s is there in the first place. Decades ago, when the boats leaving Sheepshead Bay each morning carried men who fished for their living, the Randazzo family owned a seafood shop and a bar on Emmons Avenue. As a cheap bar snack, they handed out fried squid, which back then was more likely to be found on the end of a hook than the end of a fork, along with Helen Randazzo’s long-simmered Sauce. “They would cut the bar down a little every year and put in tables, because more people would be sitting down,” said Helen’s oldest grandson, Paul Randazzo. In 1964, the bar graduated to a clam bar with a menu of six items, not counting the Sauce. As the mounds of cherrystone shells grew, so did the family business, adding on a formal Italian restaurant that served pasta, broiled seafood and other Helen Randazzo recipes. When it closed in 1994, it bequeathed those dishes to the clam bar. They are still on the menu today for customers who look beyond the Sauce. Marcella Hazan may rap me on the knuckles with her cheese grater for this, but I am crazy about Randazzo’s shrimp parmigiana. The restaurant buys wild shrimp netted in the Gulf of Mexico, and their substantial flavor comes through even after they have been breaded, fried, doused with marinara and blanketed with browned fresh mozzarella. That flavor comes through just as clearly in the shrimp fra diavolo, with a heap of pasta under spicy tomato sauce and, just so you don’t forget where you are, a few clams. As a parade of marine life, though, the dish has nothing on the lobster fra diavolo, which supplements clams and shrimp with mussels and an entire Canadian lobster, ideally tender and sweet the night I had it. A different lobster dish on another night was problematic. The stuffing was an unexciting blend of baby shrimp, bread crumbs and, supposedly, crab meat. The claws were overdone to a rubbery dryness, but the tail, cooked more gently, had its quality intact. Randazzo’s pasta with clams is a lesson in the meaning of generous portions: about a quarter-acre of linguine or spaghetti weighed down who knows how many chopped clams, very sweet and very fresh, and untold cloves of sliced garlic. The pasta is exactly the kind that Italian restaurants in this country served 40 years ago, before the phrase “al dente” got its green card. It is boiled in water with little if any salt, which is less of a drawback when the sauce piled on top is a hearty one like fra diavolo rather than a thin one like the marechiara. Very simple seafood dishes found at shacks up and down the East Coast can be quite good at Randazzo’s: the raw Long Island oysters, littlenecks and cherrystones shucked at the counter; the steamers, free of grit once they are rinsed in their broth and dunked in drawn butter; the fat crab cakes wrapped in a spicy bread-crumb coating but otherwise light on the filler; the Manhattan chowder and, even though it is slightly thickened with cornstarch, the New England, both weighty with potatoes and clams. Less enticing are the lobster bisque and the corn-and-crab chowder, neither of which tastes much like its namesake shellfish. And given how pure most of the seafood is, I wish the fried clams were the squishy whole-belly variety, not chewy frozen strips in a sarcophagus of breading. This is one food that is beyond the help of the Sauce. Another is the slice of bread, slightly less hard than granite, that waits on each platter of calamari to traumatize the loose molars of neophytes. Simultaneously soggy and dry, hot and cold, it is too bizarre and unfathomable to be called awful; it is simply one of the world’s mysteries, to be discussed while eating all the squid around it. Helen Randazzo was, according to her grandson, a virtual pescetarian. Still, her recipe for cut-up chicken marinated in lemon, olive oil, garlic and oregano, then roasted and charred under the broiler, is very good. Perhaps out of her distaste for land animals, she gave the dish the unalluring name “burnt chicken.” Paul Randazzo, who owns the place now, eats fish nearly every day, but he gave it up for the two months that his restaurant was closed after the hurricane. It was a form of protest, I imagine. The night of the storm, he was inside Randazzo’s, standing on chairs and then on the counter when the bay refused to stay outside the doors. When he wanted company, he said, he got on a raft and paddled down what, just that afternoon, had been Emmons Avenue to visit a friend who was holed up on the second floor of Loehmann’s. Did anything in the restaurant survive the flood? “Me.” Today the pink-granite floor tiles, the mirrored wall painted with a scene of the marina, the tables, the chairs and the restrooms are new. The faces are not. Mr. Randazzo, his wife and his four children still tend to customers, who come in all shapes, sizes, colors and ages. Randazzo’s prices are not intimidating, especially for fresh seafood, and the welcome at the door is heartfelt. Had I grown up eating at Randazzo’s, the emotion I felt tasting the Sauce might be love. But as a relative newcomer, I’ll have to settle for gratitude.",Seafood with hot or medium sauce; raw clams and oysters; clam chowder; crab-cake sandwich; shrimp parmigiana; lobster or shrimp fra diavolo; fried zucchini; “burnt chicken.” 
231,Hanjan,2 star,"April 2, 2013",Pete Wells,Midtown South,Korean,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-hanjan-in-manhattan.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-hanjan-in-manhattan.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The pajeon at Hanjan did not look like any Korean pancake I’d ever seen. It appeared to be a casual pile of squid tempura interlaced with a few splinters of fried green stuff, but I took a knife to it and quartered it anyway. Amazingly, the gold loops and strands held together as they traveled from the dish of spicy dipping sauce to my mouth.  As I ate, I understood that Hanjan’s chef, Hooni Kim, had accomplished the most delicious kind of engineering feat, minimizing the layer of rice starch that makes up the bulk of a traditional pajeon and maximizing not just the crisp fried bits but also the flavor of scallions and wonderfully fresh squid. At the same time, his pajeon held on to the essential taste of Korean cuisine. This taller, airier pajeon was nowhere near as filling as the original, but I didn’t mind. Planning ahead, I had ordered two. Hanjan opened in December on West 26th Street, its recessed entrance easy to miss alongside rowdy neighbors like Hill Country and the Hog Pit. Like Mr. Kim’s slightly older restaurant, Danji, Hanjan has a menu divided between traditional Korean dishes (the pajeon) and new ideas (slices of raw wild salmon that you wrap around salad greens in a spicy sesame dressing). And once again, the cover versions and the original compositions are so much in touch with the spirit of Korean cooking that it can be hard to tell which is which.  Hanjan does not cast out any obvious chum for food bloggers the way Danji did with its bulgogi sliders and bacon paella. Mr. Kim may be more confident in his cooking this time around, or more certain that New Yorkers will get it. On a menu of mostly small dishes, one of the two substantial enough to anchor a meal is a large bowl of cod roe in a cloudy seafood broth that contains so much chile paste, it’s pink. Both the esoteric main ingredient and the fearless seasoning in this remarkable stew suggest that Mr. Kim trusts his audience, and vice versa. Certainly, the relationship has progressed to the point where he can name one of Hanjan’s dishes fresh killed chicken wings. Just how fresh, you may wonder, tilting an ear toward the kitchen to listen for muffled squawks. Not quite as fresh as that; the birds are slaughtered off site earlier in the day that they are served. The object is to obtain poultry with a clean and full flavor, which Mr. Kim simply underlines by marinating the wings in sake and soy and grilling them.  Other parts of those recently graduated birds end up skewered and grilled, yakitori style, with minimal seasoning. You need to love the flavor of extremely fresh chicken to love most of these skewers, especially the very chewy gizzards. The crunchy accordion folds of grilled skin are probably universally appealing, though. Two of my guests, at least, declared them the best thing on the table. A minute later, they claimed to have found something better. All my meals at Hanjan were like that, with new dishes eclipsing the memory of what had come before. “That’s my favorite of the night,” somebody would say, chopsticks pinched around a fried sandwich of shrimp and pork paste between shiso leaves. A few minutes later, somebody else would crown the grilled mackerel fillet, its skin gleaming like candy under a glassy soy glaze, accompanied by a lemon and grated daikon. Next the torch was passed to meaty slices of pig trotter braised in soy and smeared with a far-from-tame paste of fermented shrimp and soy beans. In the rush to declare winners, a few also-rans were soon forgotten. To be a contender in a town full of good Korean fried chicken, Hanjan’s needs to be crisper than it was the night I had it. A tiny portion of noodles with spicy squid vanished without impact. Thin slices of fish cakes bobbed around in a nearly clear seafood broth that was very, very good, but the dish wasn’t substantial enough for a restaurant that is, essentially, a Korean pub. Mr. Kim’s small-plates approach leads to one significant miscalculation. Hanjan charges $5 for kimchi and $4 for cold appetizers called namul. Order both and you have a small but high-quality banchan spread, which most Korean restaurants bring without charge or request. By putting a price on banchan, Mr. Kim makes it optional, just another tapas plate. Without it, the whole spirit of the meal changes. Lines of two-tops and four-tops run along opposite walls; in the center is a long communal table that might feel like trend-chasing in another restaurant but here feels like an invitation to put your elbows down and have another bottle of sake. After 8 p.m. you will need it, because the din from hungry-eyed people waiting at the bar and the customers at their tables shouting to one another that everybody needs to try the pork fat rice cakes (they’re right) will be bouncing off the concrete walls and the steel ceilings.  After a while, you may get curious about the cloudy, oatmeal-colored drink served in frosty mugs. It is makgeolli, a yeasty rice brew with the soft sweetness of cantaloupe. By 10 or so, the crowds may thin a bit and there might be a seat at the bar. This is good because that is when the ramen broth is finally ready, after bubbling in a pot for half a day with the bones of fish and pork and chicken. Ramen is listed on the menu as ramyun, one of the large plates, which implies sharing. I recommend eating it alone at the bar, where you can have all four slices of sweet pork to yourself and make as much noise as you want slurping the bouncy, squiggly noodles out of the steaming and chile-hot soup.  The ramen shows up on the modern side of the menu, even though nothing about its long-simmered, bone-rich flavor tastes 21st century. But Mr. Kim is now the city’s leading interpreter of Korean cuisine, and if he says the dish is modern, the rest of us will have to believe him.",Perilla jeon; scallion pancake with local squid; grilled half mackerel; spicy cod roe stew; wild Atlantic salmon sashimi salad; pork fat ddukbokki; fresh killed chicken wings; Korean spicy ramyun; BBQ galbi skewers.
232,The Dining Room at the Modern,3 star,"March 26, 2013",Pete Wells,Midtown East,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-the-dining-room-at-the-modern.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-the-dining-room-at-the-modern.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"WHEN MY GUEST in the Dining Room at the Modern realized he could order three courses of foie gras, he looked like somebody who had just found a $50 bill on the street. He would have extended his streak to four courses, I think, had the menu offered a foie gras dessert.  As it turned out, his appetizer would have worked almost as well as a finale. The Modern’s chef, Gabriel Kreuther, scooped out little balls of duck liver terrine and rolled them in crumbs of fried celery root so they looked like nut-crusted bonbons. These counterfeit candies were set on a rectangle of mango and passion fruit sauce within scribbles of syrupy balsamic vinegar, bringing out an unsuspected kinship between the terrine and ganache. In the second course, foie gras was a star protein, poached in red wine. This time its garnishes — bittersweet chocolate tuile, pickled red currants and a peppery caramel — worked as foils to show up its seriousness and depth. Then in the third course, it took a step back, serving as a sauce that enriched slices of squab breast baked in savoy cabbage inside a shatteringly thin brik crust.  The three dishes could have been a monotonous episode in self-indulgence. Instead they were a memorable demonstration of the skill, inventiveness and discipline that permit Mr. Kreuther to make his ingredients do what he wants them to do while still tasting like themselves. Those traits made my recent meals in the Dining Room at the Modern a pleasure and something of a discovery, if one can discover an eight-year-old restaurant run by Danny Meyer inside the Museum of Modern Art. When the Dining Room was last reviewed in The New York Times, in 2005, Frank Bruni praised its “significant joys,” including much of the food, but warned of “uneven terrain” on the menu. At the time, the far more casual and livelier Bar Room up front met its promises more fully, as Mr. Bruni suggested when he awarded that space three stars in a later review, one more than he had given the Dining Room.  The Bar Room still has more energy, but the cooking in the Dining Room has more focus and intensity than I remember from the early days. Mr. Kreuther’s dishes in this space are more complicated than the more rustic ones in the Bar Room, but the complications pay off in rewarding layers of harmony and contrast. Two cured fillets of sardine (one smooth and silver, the other crackling and golden with a thin sheet of brioche seared to its skin) were outfitted with crisp artichoke chips and dots of artichoke purée, but the warm heart of the dish was a bright sauce of tomato confit, black garlic, green olives, roasted red peppers and blood oranges. Eat it and you almost felt the summer sun beating down on your head. Other recent dishes invited you to burrow into winter’s consolations. Sweet apple-wood smoke made its way into every bite of a sturgeon and sauerkraut tart topped with a glittering vein of caviar. It was elegant and powerful, like the pairing of a luxuriously soft poached egg with squid-ink spaetzle, sea urchin, roasted salsify and fragments of black truffles. The white walls and tablecloths, and the grid of steel and glass facing the museum’s sculpture garden, suggest a contemporary gallery. This graceful, understated room stands back so the artistry can happen on the plate. Mr. Kreuther follows through. He is bold with color, painting salmon crimson with a marinade of beet juice, or drawing a dark green stripe of powdered Kaffir lime down the center of a monkfish fillet resting in a gorgeous sauce of blood orange and mustard. He is intrepid with flavor as well. Roasted lobster tail seemed complete with a smoky pimento broth that I would have happily drunk from a teacup, but then a server brought something extra, a tiny portion of tender claw meat under a wheel of burned sugar that went beyond caramel by several degrees of bitterness. It was daring and wonderful. One or two dares didn’t pay off, like juxtaposition of pear purée and bay scallops. There were technical glitches, too, like the bottom crust on the sturgeon tart that was crisp one night but damp on another, or the piece of cobia cooked to the point of dryness on one side.  Yet the next act of each four-course, $98 fixed-price dinner would invariably set things right again. This was especially true for Marc Aumont’s desserts, fresh looks at European classics like a black currant vacherin or a Black Forest cake rendered as an array of cubes, cones and spheres. Calling something modern puts it at risk of looking dated, as one or two things at the Modern do. A flurry of amuse-bouches always included a test tube full of hot liquid. Are we still pretending this is a fun way to drink soup? And the charcoal gray suits with collarless shirts the servers wear look like costumes from a sci-fi film about a dystopian, genderless future. The vented jackets in particular don’t do the women any favors. As you notice this, though, you also notice just how many women there are in the front of the house, along with others who don’t look like men of European descent. It is a pleasure to see this kind of diversity at the higher altitudes of New York dining, where it is still not the rule. The staff was always attentive and mindful, helping diners navigate food allergies, for instance. At moments, though, the service felt disengaged and aloof in ways than can make this formal room feel chillier than it needs to be. (When I heard happy, intoxicated shouts from the Bar Room, I felt as if I’d joined the wrong club.)  One night, the server driving the mignardise trolley acted as if listing the whole catalog of sweets would make the meal longer than it needed to be, and suggested that she make the choice for us instead. Another night, it was wheeled around by someone who seemed to have been waiting all night for the chance to tell us about the Calvados lollipops, the saffron truffles, the macadamia pralines and the make-your-own sandwich cookies of butter wafers and chocolate ganache in a tube.  By drawing out the moment, our server made it one to remember. Like the trolley, the restaurant itself is full of unexpected delights. Unpacking them one by one is the pleasant work of a meal.

233,Chez Sardine,1 star,"March 19, 2013",Pete Wells,West Village,"Asian, Japanese",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-chez-sardine-in-the-west-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-chez-sardine-in-the-west-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ONE MAJOR THEME of modern restaurants is what we might call Asian stoner food. This is the cuisines of Japan, Korea and other places as seen through bloodshot eyes, the cravings of a hipster whose late-night munchies send him out in search of tacos stuffed with bulgogi, pigs’ tails cooked in root beer and the like. Another competing theme is fat-on-fat cuisine. It challenges our notions of appropriate caloric intake, treats foie gras as a sacrament and has rarely seen an ingredient that couldn’t be improved by cooking it with some part of the pig. If these styles were two friends of yours, you would think they were both narcissistic, a little dangerous and more fun to be around than almost anybody else you knew. And you would pray that they never, ever hooked up.  But hook up they have, at a friendly and demented Greenwich Village tavern called Chez Sardine that Gabriel Stulman opened just after Thanksgiving. Mr. Stulman, an increasingly busy restaurateur, described Chez Sardine as “a very inauthentic take on a Japanese izakaya.” This is the kind of izakaya where a bite-size piece of hamachi sushi is crunchy with fried pork rinds, and where sashimi is slipped into a stack of flapjacks.  For connoisseurs of Asian stoner cuisine, this will sound like high-grade chronic. But the chef, and one of Mr. Stulman’s partners in Chez Sardine, is Mehdi Brunet-Benkritly, who spent four years at Au Pied de Cochon in Montreal, the Stanford of fat-on-fat cooking. So this is also the kind of izakaya where you can order a grilled cheese sandwich stuffed with foie gras, garnished with cucumbers pickled in rice-wine vinegar.  The first face you see when you walk into Chez Sardine is Pat Morita’s in a framed close-up from “The Karate Kid.” Mr. Morita, who spent part of his childhood during World War II in an internment camp in Arizona, holds his chopsticks midair, midlesson, although the lesson here is a nuanced one about the strange things that happen when Japanese culture comes to America.  Mr. Stulman, who also owns Fedora and Joseph Leonard, must have a kind of second sight for Greenwich Village real estate that lets him see future diners eating and drinking comfortably inside rooms not much bigger than a double bed. In this case, horizontal lines and walls of windows that meet by the corner of West Fourth and West 10th Streets give Chez Sardine an openness and energy out of proportion to its size. The only time the room feels small is when you are attempting to book one of the 28 seats, but even that is a fairly painless process thanks to a widget on Chez Sardine’s Web site that lists open time slots rather than making you guess. (I hope the technology catches on.)  Whether you sit at a table by those windows or at one of two short counters, the meal will probably start with sushi. Already it’s a departure from Japan, where izakayas are more likely to serve sashimi, but that’s just the beginning.  Hamachi with chicharrones reads like a declaration of war, but no. The pork skins add crunch and a savoriness that deepens as you chew and that is kept in check by pickled ginger. And Arctic char, cured with sugar and lime zest and smoked, makes for sushi you could happily eat for breakfast. Mr. Brunet-Benkritly finds a cool contrast of textures by topping cubes of raw beef with spoonfuls of sea urchin, then surrounding the pair with a ring of nori that rustles between your teeth just before it softens. He also combines like with like, wrapping eel and braised pork belly in a hand roll and then piling on layers of richness with avocado and spicy mayonnaise. In dishes like this, it can seem as if Asian stoner food and fat-on-fat cuisine were always meant to be together. But doubts are never far off. If you prize the cold-water fattiness of mackerel, you’ll wish it hadn’t been squelched by crushed potato chips, fried leek threads and cold, underseasoned rice. And oyster fans will wish that the apple mousse mounded on top of sparkling raw Wellfleets was a little more tart and a lot less sweet. As the cooked dishes start to arrive, the pattern continues: sometimes excess succeeds, and sometimes it is just too much. Breakfast pancakes with raw fish, salmon roe and lime yogurt are as fun as they sound, both silly and luxurious. But a similar dish of raw seafood with fried rice balls can’t repeat the trick. Unlike the pancakes, the rice has little flavor of its own, and it needs some to cope with an unruly mess of spicy mayonnaise, tobiko, seared scallops, raw mackerel and avocado paste. Hot and exceptionally creamy cod fritters would make an ideal bar snack, while the fried chicken nuggets — with strands of pickled cabbage and a garlic aioli that comes across as creamy Italian salad dressing — are like something you would wolf down when all the bars are closed.  At times, technique and seasonings conspire, as they do with chopstick-tender braised beef in a peppery Japanese brown curry. At other times, they seem at odds. Mr. Brunet-Benkritly gets unusually fine results out of pork belly, slowly roasting it until it is tender, meaty, fatty, chewy and crunchy all at once. But it’s hard to appreciate that neat bit of work with sweet barbecue sauce, raw and pickled cabbage, mayonnaise, pickled shallot, sriracha, shoestring potatoes and spreadable egg yolk fighting it out on the plate. Along the way there are terrific satisfactions, like the roasted salmon head, marinated in miso and maple syrup, which you poke at and poke at with chopsticks until you’re sure you’ve separated the bones from every bit of salty pink flesh and sweet skin. And there are lovely little grace notes, like the brussels sprouts in brown butter with apple purée, good enough to make you wish Mr. Brunet-Benkritly would take an interest in vegetables more often.  There are, in fact, very few ways to put together a balanced meal at Chez Sardine. This may be the common curse shared by fat-on-fat cuisine, Asian stoner food and small-plates dining: When diners expect to be wowed by every bite, why would chefs waste their time on dishes that are meant to be supporting players?  But we need those things, too, if we are supposed to get out of bed tomorrow and do this all again. After a certain point, even stoners and foie gras eaters crave a little restraint.","Cod fritters; pork and unagi hand roll; miso-maple salmon head; breakfast pancakes; braised beef curry.

234,Jeepney,2 star,"March 12, 2013",Pete Wells,East Village,Philippine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-jeepney-in-the-east-village-pig-and-khao-on-the-lower-east-side.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-jeepney-in-the-east-village-pig-and-khao-on-the-lower-east-side.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The cry goes up around the restaurant. “Ba-luuuut!” The word volleys from Jeepney’s kitchen to its dining room as a server carries the hard-boiled duck egg to a man at the bar. “Ba-luuuuuuuuuuut!” Grabbing the customer’s hand, she whacks the flesh between his thumb and forefinger with a tablespoon to demonstrate the force needed to crack the balut’s shell. Then she prepares him for what he’ll find inside. Right on top, she says, is “a really smoky chicken broth.” Under that is the white, hard-boiled, and the yolk. “And down at the bottom, there’s E.T.” The extraterrestrial is a two- or three-week-old duckling that will never hatch, a ball of spindly legs and tucked wings and fine threads of feathers. The unabashed embrace of a delicacy with major freakout potential is typical of the deep-end approach of Jeepney, a self-described “Filipino gastro pub” in the East Village. Another approach is on display about a mile south at Pig and Khao, which has a strong Filipino imprint, too. The two places have many things in common. Open since last fall, they are small, casual, fun and often loud — Jeepney with American and Filipino party rock, Pig and Khao with slow-rolling Southern hip-hop. Neither stocks hard liquor, but each still manages to shake up very entertaining cocktails. Recently, I’m glad to report, both dropped their no-reservations policies. In their styles of presenting Asian cuisine, though, they go their own ways. Before opening Pig and Khao, Leah Cohen, the chef, spent a year eating and cooking in countries like Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, where her mother was raised. Eating at her restaurant, I felt as if I were poring over an album of carefully edited postcards from her travels. Dinner at Jeepney, on the other hand, felt more like parachuting into Manila myself. I didn’t know all the vocabulary and didn’t always know what I was putting in my mouth, but I knew I had left home. I’ve grown fond of both places, but I would take different sets of friends to each. For Pig and Khao, I’d round up the ones who love Asian flavors, don’t have significant hearing loss yet, think it’s fun to get endless refills of beer from a keg in the back garden and won’t be heartbroken to learn that fertilized duck embryos are not an option. They’d be pork lovers who would go for the sugary chunks of Chinese sausage in a bowl of mussels first before dipping the so-so shellfish in a redeemingly aromatic, basil-scented broth of dashi, butter and yuzu. They would be delighted by a salad of watermelon cubes with strips of grilled pork jowl and golden puffs of fried pork rind. Like nearly every dish on the menu, it has enough crunch, salt and acidity to satisfy the most curmudgeonly judge on “Top Chef,” where Ms. Cohen came to national attention while she was cooking at Centro Vinoteca before taking over the kitchen there. Then they’d see nothing wrong with moving on to another part of the pig’s face with sizzling sisig, a modern Filipino classic. They’d devour the chopped bits of pork — some crisp, some gelatinous, some meaty — seasoned with soy and slicked with the yolk of an egg cracked over the platter at the last minute. They wouldn’t be fanatics about the authenticity of a menu that leans repeatedly on “crispy” over less familiar words. When “crispy red curry rice salad” turned out to be a less-spicy Thai pork larb tricked out with fragments of curried rice cooked into a crust, they’d nod their heads over Ms. Cohen’s talent for bright, clear flavors instead of quibbling. And when the adobo in “crispy quail adobo” was not a stewing liquid, as it might be in the Philippines, but a rich soy and garlic sauce tossed with deep-fried quail, they wouldn’t care. I didn’t care, either. The friends I’d take to Jeepney would be the explorers, the ones who see every meal as a chance to learn something. They wouldn’t fume if it took three tries to bolt the restroom door. They wouldn’t clutch their pearls at the sight of nipples on the back room’s photomurals, one set belonging to the first Filipina to appear in Playboy, the other to the first in German Playboy. (When children show up, the staff applies discreet bands of tape.) The menu nonchalantly tosses out ingredients like sawsawan and bagoong as if they were peas and carrots, and these friends would listen as the high-spirited servers explained it all. They’d pay $7 more for an extra marrow bone to supplement the impressive one that rides on top of a short-rib and vegetable soup called bulalo. They would mash the marrow with a fork into a lump of jasmine rice, then drink the deeply restorative broth from their bowls and ladle some into mine. If they came on a Thursday, when Jeepney puts away the utensils and plates and serves dinner on banana leaves, they’d wash their hands and get right down to business. They’d mold jasmine rice around bits of longanisa sausage; strips of tocino, pork that the chef, Miguel Trinidad, cures in 7Up; and cubes of pork stewed in a fascinating chocolate-colored sauce of beef blood, bay leaves and vinegar. Facing fried crabs sautéed with garlic, they would crack open the shells and excavate the meat with their fingers. Would they eat balut? Maybe. Would I? I did. The liquid on top tasted, yes, like chicken broth; the yolk was chalky; parts of the white were confusingly hard. As for the little embryo, it gave way to the spoon as easily as custard and tasted something like duck liver mixed with duck breast. If you didn’t grow up eating balut, it probably helps to stop thinking about the feathers. Jeepney’s batting average could be higher. A dish called the Defeated Chicken, with nondescript roasted chicken in adobo sauce, defeated me, too, and the slow-roasted pork shoulder in one called Bicol Express had been cut across the grain into short, dry strands. But the people I’d take there know that discoveries require both trial and error. If they prefer the reliable rewards of skillful cooking edited for New Yorkers, I’ve got a restaurant for that, too.",Spiced chickpeas; red curry rice salad; grilled pork jowl; sizzling sisig; grilled curry lamb ribs; turon.
235,Mighty Quinn's Barbeque,2 star,"March 5, 2013",Pete Wells,East Village,Barbecue,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-mighty-quinns-barbeque-in-the-east-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-mighty-quinns-barbeque-in-the-east-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Chase the scent of great barbecue in New York City, and you are rooting for a team that will, sooner or later, let you down. You are a Red Sox fan in any season from 1919 to 2003. There will be enough victories to keep the dream flickering, and there will be nights when you watch the ball hop between the first baseman’s legs. But every loss feeds a new hope in your heart. This winter, hope came in threes. Barbecue hounds ran to Gowanus to get burnt ends and char siu pork steak at Fletcher’s Brooklyn Barbecue, and to Williamsburg to find out whether BrisketTown deserved to be crowned the Brisket King of New York in a recent cook-off. They descended on the East Village to take apart Flintstonian beef ribs at Mighty Quinn’s Barbeque and watch men in heavy black gloves grab pork shoulder by the fistful and shake it into dripping hunks — yes, real pulled pork on Second Avenue. All three places slow-cook their barbecue with hardwood only, no gas allowed. All three places serve meat that is largely raised on pastures or outdoors, including pork from old breeds with flavorful rosy flesh and a thick girdle of white fat that bastes the meat as it melts. All are worth noticing, and one of them, Mighty Quinn’s, comes as close to delivering on all fronts as any barbecue place the city has seen so far. Mighty Quinn’s got its start as a stall at Smorgasburg, the open-air souk for start-up deliciousness on the Brooklyn waterfront. Hugh Mangum, a drummer and cook who worked under Jean-Georges Vongerichten, drove there on weekends hauling brisket he had smoked in Hunterdon County, N.J. The meat was deliberately, slowly sliced, and the lines were notoriously long. A 30-minute wait could make a stale bagel taste good, so the greater efficiency of Mighty Quinn’s operation makes it easier to evaluate Mr. Mangum’s work. The restaurant, which opened in December, runs on the cafeteria model, with meat at the start of the assembly line, drinks at the end and shiny metal trays that you ferry to a table made of century-old spruce salvaged from the Puck Building. The counter workers are quick and usually friendly, although once when I asked for three-quarters of a pound of brisket I got an unsmiling, have-it-our-way reply: “You can get a pound or a half-pound.” With digital scales in use, why? Half a pound at a time, it became clear that Mr. Mangum’s scope has widened well beyond brisket. The only disappointment is the chicken, no better or worse than what a skilled weekend cook can produce with a kettle grill. And while there is nothing wrong with a smoked hot sausage, the one here isn’t quite strong enough to build a meal around. With its cuts of pork and beef, though, Mighty Quinn’s gets serious, smoking more cuts of meat more skillfully than its rivals, except, perhaps, Daisy May’s, which unfortunately obscures its handiwork in sticky sauces. The pulled pork is the only one in town that doesn’t make you embarrassed for New York. It is staggeringly good. The inside meat is slick with the flavor of old-school pork butt; the black, chewy outer rind looks as if it fell into the fire. Don’t be fooled, though; the flavor of smoke and sweet fat is most concentrated there. The carvers splash the pulled pork with the house barbecue sauce, which balances sugar with vinegar and mustard; Mr. Mangum calls it Texalina because it blends the styles of Texas and North Carolina. It comes close to being an all-purpose condiment, but the rich butt would still benefit from a more bracingly acidic treatment. Spare ribs are exceptional, too, meaty and juicy, with a smoky outer ring the color of cherry soda. They are brushed with a little paprika to enhance the oak, cherry and apple smoke they picked up over many hours in a pit made in Mesquite, Tex. The beef rib is an instant conversation stopper, a long block of impressively tender meat clinging to a Jurassic curve of bone. It surely upstages the brisket in theatricality, and possibly in flavor as well, though it’s a close call. The brisket is cooked patiently to render much of the fat from the top cap, moistening even the leaner lower muscle until it gleams. A simple rub of salt and pepper is subdued but effective. The meat is not as thoroughly suffused with smoke as the best products of Texas, but it has as much finesse as anything I have ever eaten from a cardboard box. The carvers sprinkle the barbecue at Mighty Quinn’s with Maldon salt. This is nice, but it would be even nicer if the restaurant put salt and pepper, or better still a salt-pepper blend, on the table, alongside the brown-glass bottles of that sauce. In some barbecue joints in the South, the awfulness of the side dishes is a point of pride. New York, still struggling to be taken seriously, tries harder. Mighty Quinn’s baked beans, darkened with molasses, roughed up with mustard and choked with bacon, may be the best I’ve tasted. If your timing is lucky, you will place your order just as a carver is sweeping a handful of fresh brisket trimmings from the butcher block into the pan. There is a salad of peas and edamame coated with goat cheese that people seem to like, although it’s a little out of place here. Perfectly at home, though, is the sweet potato casserole, which is like a pie without a crust. Actually, with its topping of pecans in brown sugar, it is more like two pies, and is as close as Mighty Quinn’s comes to serving dessert. The natural enemy of well-smoked barbecue in New York is, of course, New Yorkers. The ones who work for the city can shut down a pit at a moment’s notice if they decide the smoke has not been thoroughly scrubbed and filtered, citing concerns about air quality. Some of us believe that the aromas of brisket and ribs improve air quality, but rules are rules. The cost of a flue that satisfies the government, Mr. Mangum said, can run from $10,000 to $15,000 for each floor. Mighty Quinn’s is in a six-story building. Hill Country’s flue is 11 stories high and Blue Smoke’s is 15 stories. Doing the math, many pitmasters are now planting their smokestacks on the low rooftops across the East River. Fletcher’s opened in November on an unphotogenic strip of Third Avenue in Gowanus that, against all odds, has become something of a restaurant row. The sides made the strongest case for Fletcher’s, like the beans that lap up wood smoke as they bake in the pit next to the meats; the crisp house-made refrigerator pickles, put up in a jar; and the macaroni and cheese when it is topped with the great burnt-end chili. Although the meats are all well seasoned and admirably smoky, nearly everything I tried in two visits tended toward dryness in one degree or another. This was more pronounced in the brisket and burnt ends than in the ribs, which were still juicy and pink. Sauces helped lubricate the thinly sliced pork steaks, like the char siu steak, with its Chinatown seasonings. As the cooks learn the idiosyncrasies of their J & R smoker, Fletcher’s meats may come closer to an ideal balance. Pitmasters are nothing if not obsessed, losing sleep to tend their fires, adjusting to each day’s temperature and humidity. The most obsessed pitmaster in New York may well be Daniel Delaney, who hitched a cast-iron offset smoker to the back of a U-Haul truck in Texas and drove it to Brooklyn. Before he opened BrisketTown in November, he sold brisket by subscription. He did his research, and sells slabs of cheese, like a lightly crunchy and caramelized Comté, in homage to the days when barbecue purveyors doubled as grocers (although he is surely the first pitmaster in history to utter the words, “We’ve started working with Bedford Cheese to curate our cheese program”). The most atmospheric of the three restaurants, BrisketTown gets the props right: the neon steer over the butcher block; the paper towel rolls used as an element of décor. You could almost believe you were in Texas if the customers weren’t all as skinny as drainpipes. Mr. Delaney pushes cooking time and seasoning to extremes. He rubs the brisket generously with salt and cracked peppercorns and smokes it for many, many hours, until it is very, very tender. The style has its fans, who line up before the doors open at 6:30 and keep coming until the brisket sells out, as it almost always does. But I was a skeptic. Long cooking had made the meat too soft; the fatty brisket one night had so little structure I could have eaten it with a spoon. And the edges were so peppery, that’s all I tasted; when I got to the milder interior, my mouth was almost numb. The spare ribs, rubbed less lavishly, were more satisfying. Recently I started a fantasy barbecue league. Now I’m building my dream New York City barbecue restaurant with elements from all over town. I’ve got the soundtrack and the corn pudding from Hill Country; the pickles and chili mac from Fletcher’s; the pork belly and beers from Fette Sau; the beans, pulled pork, brisket and both kinds of ribs from Mighty Quinn’s; the enthusiasm, atmosphere and cheese from BrisketTown.

But where are the wizards of wurst? Who will carry the flag for the multitude of cured and smoked meats that flourish in the German-speaking lands? Harold Dieterle, please step forward. At his new restaurant, the Marrow, Mr. Dieterle leads off the menu with compound words from the lexicon of German butchery. A meal there might start with excellent jägerwursts, salty, pink little sausages split and dotted with drops of violet mustard that run down the center like buttons on a cuff. There is liverwurst, too, not the sinister tube that lurks in sad deli cases but a rich paste of duck liver ground with nutmeg and allspice.  Mr. Dieterle, who won the first season of “Top Chef,” then gambled his prize money and his recipe for spicy duck meatballs to open a restaurant called Perilla, thinks globally. At Perilla, where Garett McMahan now oversees a kitchen that is both adventurous and finely tuned, chermoula and labneh might share the table with aji amarillo chiles. With his second place, Kin Shop, Mr. Dieterle made an unexpected and welcome digression into Thai cuisine seen through a Western fine-dining lens. The Marrow looks abroad again, but this time his destination is home. Half his menu is inspired by his father’s German roots. The other half draws from the Italian cuisine of his mother and her relatives. The two trunks of the family tree are stamped on the menu: Famiglia Chiarelli on the left, with the polenta and the fettuccine; on the right, with sauerkraut and schnitzel, Familie Dieterle. But another, invisible line divides the menu, too. It is the split between dishes that are completely sure of their purpose and the ones so overembellished it’s unclear what the idea was meant to be. One minute, the Marrow would send out something as concise and well considered as an appetizer of shredded duck leg pressed into a brick under a crackling sheet of skin, with a top layer of huckleberries providing all the counterpoint that the duck needed. The next, out would come skillfully cooked salmon covered by a sprawling haystack of cabbage and carrot slaw. The vegetables, underseasoned and underdressed, seemed to need something. Could it be ... nuggets of pastrami?  No, but that’s what they got. Like a flustered person who isn’t sure what to say, the dish rambled on without coming to the point. Order unwisely and the table can be overcome by this kind of nervous chatter. Luckily, many aspects of the Marrow need no editing at all. Ginger Fisher’s dessert lineup goes from one pleasure to another. I’m not sure I will ever find another turnover as appealing as the Marrow’s apple hand pie, a triangle of tender, buttery crust folded around sliced fruit, but if I do, I’ll want to swab it, too, in a dark pool of caramel, then go back for a forkful of quark ice cream.  And the next time I go for a doughnut run, I hope I collide with Ms. Fisher’s Berliners, soft and white, filled with cinnamon-schnapps cream and served over a rewardingly complex chocolate ganache.  At this point, readers who have stayed for dessert at the Marrow are jumping up and down in their seats, shouting, “What about the ginger stout cake?” I was just getting to that. A wedge of sticky, crunchy gingerbread served with roasted, spiced pears, it has an intense bittersweetness derived from the combination of molasses and stout. It really is worth jumping up and down about. So is the wine list assembled by Jill Roberts, particularly if you prize the incandescent energy and clarity of Austrian and German whites. One night, looking out at the West Village streets through the glass windows that frame this bent elbow of a dining room, I decided it would be smart to keep drinking wine at the Marrow until I’d memorized the position of every umlaut on that list. I might never learn to pronounce Smaragd, but I’d be a happy man. I’d stay happy, too, if I ordered well. I’d come back again to carve into the great golden expanse of the duck schnitzel, miraculously crisp and almost juicy. I’d sit at the bar and dip the fat lamb ribs into their caraway yogurt, chewing on the caramelized edges like jerky.  Mr. Dieterle has an odd but very good interpretation of vitello tonnato, with the part of the veal roast played by deep-fried sweetbreads. (The part of tuna sauce is played by tuna sauce; a wreckfish fillet takes on a previously unknown role that is well suited to the ensemble.) His roasted bone marrow seemed odd at first, too, with scoops of sea urchin sitting along the trench of shinbone like ice cream scoops on a nose-to-tail banana split. But Mr. Dieterle knew what he was up to, juxtaposing two ingredients that felt almost the same in your mouth, but not quite. It was a pun on textures, a delicious joke that you got with your tongue. Some dishes, though, made me wonder whether I’d missed the punch line. I wasn’t sure why anyone would go to the trouble of making salt cod into smooth and subtle dumplings, only to drown them out with chunks of spicy pickled peppers, golden raisins and a too-sweet broth. I squinted and stared at a precarious tower formed by stacking one half of a chicken on top of the other half and balancing both on a bizarre hash of brussels sprouts, batons of salami and cubes of bread. The menu called this a panzanella, after the Italian salad built around tomato-drenched bread, but these cubes were hard and dry, unmoved by their contact with the other ingredients.  One night there was a special of garganelli puttanesca with bottarga and tuna marrow, a clear jelly found inside the fish’s spine. “We recommend stirring the marrow into the pasta,” our server said. We complied, and still thought the sauce too meek and the bottarga too pushy. We couldn’t taste the marrow that had been incorporated into the pasta and didn’t want to deal with the mucilaginous blobs that had not.  Not every dish is so unfocused, but enough are that the Marrow, which should be Mr. Dieterle’s most personal restaurant, feels like his most abstract. Saws can split bones. Opening the marrow of a family’s history takes something stronger than metal.",Lightly sauerbratened lamb ribs; prosciutto-wrapped dates; cotecchino; bone marrow; braised rabbit and pretzel dumpling soup; crispy braised duck; duck schnitzel; ginger stout cake; Berliners.

Draped with bright red and yellow carpets, their trunks raised importantly, the animals marched with a retinue of turbaned drummers and attendants across a nearly life-size mural that covered the first floor of a building.  “I think we’ve found it,” I said.  Our destination was Lakruwana, one of about a half-dozen Sri Lankan restaurants on Staten Island. Some of these are a short walk from the ferry terminal in St. George, on a hilltop along Victory Boulevard where they are huddled with groceries selling banana blossoms, coconut vinegar, wood apple juice and ribbon cake.  A mile or so south, about 10 minutes from the ferry by bus or Staten Island Railway, is Lakruwana. It stands alone, in more than one way. While the atmosphere of the island’s other Sri Lankan restaurants ranges from serviceable to pleasant, Lakruwana’s verges on spectacular.  The elephants gave us a hint of what we were in for, but things didn’t really get going until we stepped inside. The walls were covered with small, rough pink stones set in stucco framed by bamboo rods. There was a brightly painted wood door in one wall, flanked by matching wood shutters, and above them began the eaves of a tin roof. It was as if we had walked into a small house in the Sri Lankan countryside that had been turned inside out. All around the room were painted masks, sharp pairs of spears, statues of Buddha, and who knows what else. The backs of the chairs were metal rods that stretched about five feet into the air before tapering off into curlicues that looked like butterfly antennas drawn by Dr. Seuss.  We’d come on a Sunday, when a buffet is served all day. If we had expected a dour stainless-steel steam table, we had come to the wrong restaurant. All the curries, rice and other dishes were waiting for us inside 20 or so covered clay pots set over flames. Lifting the lids, I found deviled chicken in a chile sauce with a balance of sweetness and spice that grew more captivating the more I ate; sticks of pineapple in a lightly hot curry paste soured with tamarind; chopped kale mixed with coconut and stir fried just until the greens begin to relax, a wonderful thing to do to kale; fat yellow lentils stewed in coconut milk with the warming flavors of mustard seeds, curry leaves and cinnamon sticks. A mysterious shiny black tangle turned out to be eggplant that had been cooked and cooked, and cooked some more, until it was nearly marmalade. I kept returning for another taste. One or two dishes were easier to resist, like pork in a murky green-black sauce or hard-cooked eggs in an extremely mild coconut-milk curry. But there was always something else to discover, especially the condiments: a flaky pink coconut sambal; another sambal of marinated onions; and lunu miris, a chile-onion relish that I used to give a screaming heat to other things on the plate when I wasn’t eating it straight up. It was Lakruwana’s lunu miris that made me take up silverware again after trying to follow the advice painted on the mirror above a small sink by the kitchen door: “Sri Lankan Foods Would Be More Tastier If You Use Your Fingers Than The Forks.” Though the curries did seem more flavorful when I ate them with my hands, I had trouble keeping a grip on the lentils. This is the cooking that Lakruwana’s chef, Jayantha Wijesinghe, learned in her mother’s kitchen in Sri Lanka. After moving to the United States, she married another Sri Lankan expatriate, Lakruwana Wijesinghe, and together they opened what was almost certainly New York’s first Sri Lankan restaurant. It was unlicensed, and consisted of a picnic table under an umbrella behind a grocery shop in a sixth-floor walk-up above a pornographic movie theater in Times Square. In 1995, it moved to the street level and went legit.  After a fire, Lakruwana relocated to Staten Island, where an estimated 5,000 Sri Lankans have settled over the past few decades. Before it moved into its current spot in Stapleton about two years ago, Mr. Wijesinghe went to Sri Lanka, designed the dining room, bought all the materials and decorations and sent them to New York City in a 40-foot shipping container. Lifting each of the bamboo-and-stone wall panels, he said, required six men.  I know of no other place in town that goes quite so far to summon up the world where its owners were born. Lakruwana may be New York’s most elaborate realization of the immigrant restaurateur’s dream: a shrine to another culture that can soothe homesickness in some patrons and kindle a thrilling sense of discovery in others.  For both kinds of customers, Ms. Wijesinghe’s menu, executed by A. Wimalaratha, is a showcase of distinctively Sri Lankan dishes. Her excellent version of mulligatawny soup, green with cilantro and sour with lemon juice, tilts more toward Southeast Asia than India. Her kitchen also makes lampreis, a steamed packet of aromatic long-grained rice, curry, eggplant, onions, bananas, soft cashews and a fried egg wrapped in a banana leaf that is pinned shut with a paper umbrella. A batter of coconut and rice flour is fried into a wafer and shaped while still warm into crisp, edible bowls called hoppers. You eat them with one of the curries, like the nuanced, gingery Ceylon chicken, or the Wadiya squid seasoned with toasted coriander and cumin. (Both were better choices than the kingfish curry or tuna ambul thiyal, which suffered from lackluster seafood.) Threads of rice flour called string hoppers are sizzled with vegetables and curry and the result, a string hopper kottu, is something like a Southeast Asian stir-fried noodle. The kottu roti is a near cousin in which thin strands of sliced roti stand in for the rice-flour threads. Both are wonderful, particularly if you convince Mr. Wijesinghe, who waits tables in a sarong, that you can handle some spice. (This is crucial with the deviled dishes, which are otherwise dull.) After the savory courses, desserts offer a welcome simplicity. There is yogurt under a dark sea of honey, and there is a mango pudding that I look forward to tasting again. Strange as it sounds, I look forward to the water, too. It is served in clay cups with glazed lips, which somehow makes it taste cooler and smoother. I’m sure the restaurant goes through a lot of these. But having imported enough Sri Lankan rocks to cover the walls, the Wijesinghes must view the cost of replacing a few broken cups as a trivial expense.","Mulligatawny soup, hoppers, kottu roti, string hopper kottu, lampreis, deviled dishes, Ceylon chicken curry, Wadiya squid curry."

Some of the proudest and most willful cooks you will ever meet are pie slingers. So when Elizabeth Falkner, a chef who until recently owned two major restaurants in San Francisco and who is a familiar face on television, goes to work at an unassuming neighborhood pizzeria in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, it’s worth a second look. And then a third, because things at Krescendo are not as modest as they initially appear.  The simple chairs and tables, the light bulbs hanging inside wire cages and the standard-issue bar do not scream ambition. Nothing does until you see, at the far end of the restaurant, a pizza oven clad in little metallic tiles that glint like sequins. In an otherwise unremarkable restaurant, spotting this outcropping of glam is like boarding the morning commuter train from Mount Kisco and discovering that you are sitting next to RuPaul. The menu seems to revert to the ordinary. There are pizza knots, rice balls and meatballs, a few salads and a handful of simple pastas including spaghetti with tomato sauce. Then there are the pies, including three under the heading Pizza Napoletana. This might have stood out a decade ago. Today, it puts Krescendo among a herd of brick-oven strivers. But here, under Pizza Italiana Classica, is a flash of lamé: Finocchio Flower Power.  What is on top of the crust is mainly fennel, but to call it a topping would imply that it is interchangeable with some other item. It is not. This pizza is an essay on the theme of fennel. Ms. Falkner stews the bulb to draw out its mellow sweetness, spreads out some raw fronds for their fresh, herbal flavor and calls on the seeds in fennel sausage for their licorice snap. The vegetable’s candylike tendencies are kept in check by sharp aged provolone and powdered red chiles from Calabria.  The Finocchio Flower Power is the pizza version of the sparkly oven, a lavishly constructed detail that lets you know that Krescendo is much better than the neighborhood Italian joint it is trying to pass for. I do not know why Ms. Falkner and Nancy Puglisi, the restaurant’s owner, camouflaged the place so thoroughly, but the result is that not enough people are talking about Krescendo.  Ms. Falkner is skillful enough to make something exceptional out of the utterly simple: Krescendo’s marinara pizza, with four or five golden cloves of roasted garlic on a plush red circle of oregano-scented tomato sauce. At the other end of the scale, she can assemble a complex fleet of ingredients that seem to be headed for a nasty collision and send them whizzing around the racetrack. One pizza, the Californication, is topped with prosciutto, shishito peppers, arugula, honey, two kinds of cheese and an arugula-walnut pesto. It sounds preposterous, but it’s very good, if you can bring yourself to ask for it by name.  One pizza didn’t work at all, the Clam Pie, which had few of the shellfish and little of their flavor. But the one called the Cure, with sopressata and fresh Fresno chiles, tasted potent enough to fix colds, hangovers and the January shivers, both the physical and metaphysical varieties.  INTENDED AS A KIND of edible plate for Ms. Falkner’s cooking, Krescendo’s pizza crust is not bland, though it is scant on salt and lacks deep flavor. But it is exceptionally light and tender, with what pizza researchers call good “crumb structure.” The rim is evenly browned, with no black blisters and only a few dark speckles. The char is minimal, but you can often taste the smoke that pours across the roof of the oven from the wood fire banked on one side.  On four different nights, the crust looked and tasted virtually the same, a consistency that eludes some of New York’s most acclaimed pizzerias. Very few of those places attempt a gluten-free crust, something that Krescendo has already mastered. Made with rice flour, potato starch and cornstarch, it is the Bizarro World double of the wheat-flour crust: crackling rather than soft, flat rather than puffy, with a fuller, more savory taste. It is not my first choice, but it is a good choice.  The quality of a restaurant’s pizza often correlates negatively with that of its pastas and salads. Ms. Falkner brings the same quiet focus to all her cooking at Krescendo. Her pasta con le sarde, with toasted pebbles of Sardinian fregola, is exceptional. And while the spaghetti al pomodoro does not surpass the great version at Scarpetta, it comes close enough to survive the comparison unscathed, and it contains way less butter. Krescendo’s pizza knots are more like zeppole, deep-fried dough with a tendency to be a bit undercooked at the core. But get them anyway and avoid the doughy parts, dipping the rest in the remarkably deep sauce of black garlic, calamata olives, balsamic vinegar and molasses. The finest use of the kitchen’s fryer is the terrific cod fritter, served with just-tender cannellini. When Ms. Falkner deviates from Italy, she shows  a Californian’s intuition for produce, as in a lovely fritto misto of sliced pears, acorn squash and onions. A beet salad one night was just routine, but finely honed instincts were at work in a salad of raw and fried kale in a lemony dressing, with pancetta candy hidden under the leaves like a prize.  As a young art-school graduate in San Francisco, Ms. Falkner first saw the sculptural possibilities of sugar and batter. Soon she was off, making desserts that teetered and towered like the designs of a chocolate-mad architect.  You will have guessed by now that Krescendo offers almost no hint of her pathbreaking work at Citizen Cake and Orson in San Francisco. But order the cassata. In Palermo, Sicily, cassata is a spongecake adorned with marzipan, ricotta and candied fruit. Ms. Falkner essentially blows it up, sending the pieces all over the plate and taking advantage of the chaos to make each fragment a little more exciting. The cake is pistachio; the cherries are soaked in Campari; out of nowhere there is a scoop of excellent tangerine sorbet.  The dessert is another of Ms. Falkner’s tiled ovens. I suspect it will not be her last.",Marinara pizza; Finocchio Flower Power; the Cure; kale salad; cod fritters with cannellini; pasta con le sarde; spaghetti al pomodoro; cassata; cannoli.
239,El Toro Blanco,1 star,"Jan. 8, 2013",Pete Wells,West Village,Mexican,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-el-toro-blanco-in-the-west-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-el-toro-blanco-in-the-west-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ONCE you plow your way through the crowds struggling in vain to catch a bartender’s eye at El Toro Blanco, you emerge into a dining room that might be in Santa Barbara during the last days of the Nixon administration. Ridged orange backs on half-moon banquettes stand up like a wall of Cheetos. Glazed brick walls in red and black flank curvy 1960s plywood chairs, dangling tangerine-colored pendant lights, and matadors painted on black velvet.  El Toro Blanco’s evocation of the last days of midcentury modernism is so spirited that you expect to see women in Halston pantsuits talking about EST while flicking More cigarettes over glass ashtrays the size of dog bowls.  Restaurant designers can’t fight the smoking ban, but what they can do is get across an idea. Even if you don’t consciously register the intention of Meyer Davis Studio, the architecture firm that collaborated with El Toro Blanco’s partners, John McDonald and Josh Capon, you can still feel it. The look of El Toro Blanco is the latest sign that in New York City, Mexican cuisine is cool, of the moment and ready to be presented without quotation marks — quaint ethnic folk crafts on the earnest side or, on the sloshy side, shot-glass bandoleers and blueberry margaritas. Admittedly, El Toro Blanco’s interior makes the point more forcefully than its menu, assembled by Mr. Capon in consultation with Scott Linquist, a chef who has wrangled tamales at Dos Caminos in New York and Border Grill in Los Angeles. The main courses are on the mild side, and the sauces rarely achieve the profound interplay of heat, bitterness, smoke, fruits, nuts and spices that can make Mexican cuisine so rewarding. Balancing that, though, is the kitchen’s emphasis on fresh flavors and its appealing lineup of street snacks and other appetizers.  Tamales were probably never meant to be fluffy, but that didn’t stop me from enjoying the airy forkfuls of steamed masa in the tamale oaxaqueña, covered with sweet plantains and shredded roast chicken in red mole, or in the lighter version with corn kernels and green strips of roasted poblanos. Empanada dough is rarely as thin and crisp as it is on the half-moons at El Toro Blanco, filled with tender short rib or with shrimp that seem to have twice their usual flavor. I refuse to choose a favorite among the three ceviches. I’d rather just appreciate the lean, classic profile of red snapper in lime juice with jalapeño and cilantro, the depth that soy sauce brought to cubes of tuna with cucumber and avocado, and the way habaneros seemed to raise the temperature of a chilled coconut-milk broth for lobster. Lightness has its limits: the Sonoran cheese crisp, a thin flour tortilla beneath melted cheese, roasted tomatoes and threads of roasted poblanos, had a way of staying behind on its pizza stand while other things on the table disappeared. Like, for instance, the scalding pan of chorizo fundido, in which Mexico looks Switzerland calmly in the eye and says, “I’ll see your cheese fondue and raise you some green chiles and a heap of crumbled spicy sausage.” (Switzerland folds and leaves the room.) Tacos didn’t always deserve the extensive acreage on the menu they occupied. The tacos al pastor needed more heat to balance the sweet pineapple and unexciting pork, and whatever the chicken breast taco needed wasn’t quite supplied by a sweet tomato-chipotle sauce. And a thick wad of stewed goat, while as tender and goaty as you might hope, called out for a bright or hot counterpoint, not just cheese and beans. But a squeeze of lime handily completed the tacos of lightly fried cod with slivers of radish, or better yet the ones with charred but still tender octopus tentacles that curled out of their folded tortillas like question marks that are really invitations. None of this is likely to alter your perceptions of Mexico, but put a few of these snacks together with a margarita on the rocks — the best, El Toro, is sweetened with orange juice and agave syrup, not liqueur — and the night will cruise along like a 707 to Acapulco. The energy can flag if you strike out for the bigger plates, though not if you order the lobster Puerto Nuevo, served split on its back with orange legs pointing in all directions. In the town of Puerto Nuevo, the lobster would be pan-fried in lard. El Toro Blanco grills it instead, and while I won’t endorse this compromise, I have to admit that the melted butter seasoned with ground chiles de árbol made me miss the pork fat a little less. Still, at times the restaurant seems to play to timid palates. The mole coloradito, which typically draws intrigue from cloves and cinnamon, is something of a fruit bomb, its sweetness landing with a thud on roast chicken breast that can tend toward dryness. A tomatillo salsa, one of three served with the bright guacamole, also gets more sugar than it can handle.  Veracruz-style fish, usually cooked in a Mexican-Mediterranean blend of tomatoes, capers and olives, was pan-seared instead; the tomatoes, now more condiment than sauce, came across as strictly Italian. Grilled swordfish repeated the pattern: simply cooked seafood in the center of the plate, tomatoes on the side, Mexico disappearing around the bend. Most of the desserts won’t bring it back, not the simple-minded apple empanada or the tapioca pudding or the chocolate tart. But a tres leches cake had a properly heart-stopping level of dairy overkill, and churros, crunchy with cinnamon sugar and scorchingly hot, were satisfying with or without a dip into dulce de leche sauce.  Mr. Capon and Mr. McDonald are the creative minds behind Lure Fishbar and B&B Winepub, both of which manage to conjure quintessentially downtown scenes without benefit of a notably progressive menu. That these two men saw a future for themselves in Mexican food may not do much to move the cuisine forward. But style can have a substance of its own, and this may be the case when two restaurateurs convince New Yorkers that the centerpiece of a fun and stylish night on the town can be a plate of tamales.","Guacamole, chorizo fundido, empanadas, tamales, Baja fish tacos, lobster Puerto Nuevo, chicken enchiladas, churros, tres leches cake."

241,Royal Seafood Restaurant,1 star,"Dec. 11, 2012",Pete Wells,Chinatown,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/12/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-royal-seafood-restaurant-in-chinatown.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/12/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-royal-seafood-restaurant-in-chinatown.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"EVERYBODY was having lobster. Before placing an order, Chinatown veterans look around the dining room to see what others are eating. At the Royal Seafood Restaurant on Mott Street one recent night, the vote was unanimous. Grandmothers were having lobster and small girls in crisp dresses were having lobster and eight police officers in stiff blue uniforms were having lobster. Nearly all the enormous round tables draped with carnation-pink cloths were occupied, and sitting on the center of each was a platter of red shells split open to expose the shiny white meat inside. Lobster wasn’t anywhere on the menu, but my table followed suit and asked for one anyway. It was hacked into sections and wok-fried with a sticky, time-honored Cantonese sauce of scallions and slivers of ginger. With chopsticks and fingertips, we dug the slippery flesh out of the legs, the tail and the claws, asking ourselves how lobster could be this soft and generously sweet. We had followed the wisdom of the crowd and won. James Surowiecki would have been proud. So would the budget hawks back at the office, because the whole lobster cost $15. This was a week after the hurricane and a few days after the lights had come back on in downtown Manhattan. Chinatown was on my mind. I worried about the mournful fish in their dark tanks, but I also worried about the money the restaurants had lost and might keep losing if tourists stayed away. Chinatown has lived through so much that it can seem indestructible, but restaurants are fragile. We eat in Chinatown restaurants because no part of Manhattan so readily offers better food for less money; because the portions are truly meant for sharing; because even those places that don’t change their fluorescent bulbs as often as they might still buy fresh snow pea shoots each day. Royal Seafood has glinting chandeliers, not fluorescent bulbs, but it suits all the other criteria beautifully. It has the added benefit of serving food that is often very close to Cantonese cuisine, the original flavor of Chinatown, with enough modern Hong Kong flourishes to let you know that it’s 2012. The kitchen is under the command of Kendy Cheng, who arrived in New York from Hong Kong several years ago and founded Royal Seafood as the chef and a co-owner. His crispy fried chicken is old-school, and one night gave me almost everything you could ask from that dish, with deeply flavorful meat pressed flat beneath a crackling sheet of skin. The bird’s head stared up from the platter. I don’t know why some of the chicken’s original savor was missing on another night. But I know I am glad I overruled the person at my table who tried to vote down the Peking-style pork chops. He got jumpy when the server called the sauce “sweet and sour.” Of course, it was the furthest thing imaginable from the phosphorescent orange jelly of dubious takeout counters. It had the color of dark rum, the resonant tang of aged vinegar and the bittersweetness of burned sugar. The sauce brought a tingle of energy to the pork’s crunchy fried coating. Smoking-hot oil is often the elixir of happiness at Royal Seafood. It cooks a whole flounder impeccably and makes the fins, tails and bones brittle and hard to resist. It turns salt-and-pepper seafood into fritters with a slightly sweet, saffron-colored batter that reminded me, pleasantly, of the Coney Island Boardwalk. The same batter makes a nifty little snack of cubed pork ribs; you chew and suck them before spitting out the bony bits. And the deep fryer’s transformation of tofu into an object of desire is so impressive I might almost have considered it fraud, if I hadn’t been busy helping myself to more. Fried crispy bean curd was lovely; even more appealing were cubes of tofu dressed with a rich minced-pork sauce, and olives that were vaguely sweet and more fruity than briny. There were unengaging exceptions to the rule of deep-fried excellence, like the T-bone steak and the “house walnut shrimp.” If fried shrimp and melon cubes glazed with warm mayonnaise sounds appealing to you, though, by all means take mine. Just leave me the candied walnuts. Royal Seafood, rarely empty, draws rush-hour crowds for its dim sum. A manager stands in the front, looking around for empty chairs beneath one of the room’s four golden dragons with colored light bulbs for eyes. The moment somebody gets up to leave, the manager barks a number into a cordless microphone hooked up to a loudspeaker, and new customers rush across the room to claim their seats. It’s like a high-speed game show in which the prizes are dumplings. The best strategy: sit on an aisle unless you speak some Cantonese. Tables are jammed together, and sitting too far from the trolleys puts you at risk of missing a favorite dumpling. I wouldn’t have wanted to skip the shumai, filled with rosy pink chopped pork or with shrimp and chives. And it would have been a shame not to try the hollow, pistachio-green spheres of sticky rice filled with salty peanuts and sweet black sesame paste. If I had sat in a back row, the chewy, lightly spicy cubes of starchy turnip cake tossed with dried shrimp, Chinese sausage and scallions may have passed me by. Few of the dim sum items were exceptional, but all were good enough and all were priced to move, and move the meal does. You can order from the menu all day, but the best time to explore it is by night, when the dining room and presumably the kitchen are less frantic. Dinner brings the opportunity to share a soul-warming casserole of curried oxtail or a platter of irregular, springy e-fu noodles with fat mushrooms. And it’s the right moment to try the house special baby lamb chops in a black-pepper sauce that has a caramel bitterness and an unexpected depth, an umami undercurrent that must come from leaves of seaweed that are frilly and green like an iguana’s beard. In the evening, with enough people around the table, you can start the meal with a hot and deeply restorative soup. Maybe the bean curd with bits of chopped shrimp, or the West Lake beef soup with bright green cilantro leaves. A server will rush the steaming white tureen to the table, his arms straining at the weight. He will ladle it out. There will be just enough to fill every bowl. You will wish all your dinners began this well. It’s Chinatown. Don’t forget it, Jake.",Crispy fried diced pork ribs; braised crispy squab; //West Lake beef soup; salt and pepper squid; crispy fried chicken; deep-fried crispy flounder; house special baby lamb; oxtail with curry casserole; snow pea leaves in broth; olive with minced pork and bean curd; e-fu noodles with mushrooms.
242,Moti Mahal Delux,2 star,"Dec. 4, 2012",Pete Wells,Upper East Side,Indian,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-moti-mahal-delux-in-manhattan.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-moti-mahal-delux-in-manhattan.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"FOODS that give us a deep feeling of indulgence aren’t always the ones you’d expect. There are spoonfuls of caviar that taste of little more than salt, and slices of wagyu so meek that their return on investment is roughly in the territory of a savings bond. Meanwhile, at a quiet Indian restaurant in the East 60s called Moti Mahal Delux, a bowl of lentils can make you go wobbly with happiness. The dish is called dal makhani, and it is an inky stew of spiced black lentils that have been coaxed into absorbing what feels like twice their own weight in salted butter imported from India. They are deeply, truly luxurious, a word I’m rarely tempted to use in the context of lentils. It had been a while since I had considered just how indulgent vast quantities of butter can make a humble plate of lentils, but the great practitioners of North India’s Mughlai cuisine never forgot. Mughlai food can be seductively rich and, with its wealth of spices and fresh ginger, spellbindingly aromatic. Heavily influenced by the Persian cuisine that was brought to the subcontinent by the Mogul emperors, the cooking of North India still has an imperial lavishness when cooked with care and consideration for ingredients, as it is at Moti Mahal Delux. The restaurant, which opened in July, is itself an outpost of an empire, a chain centered in New Delhi that has built a formidable reputation among Indians for its tandoori chicken, butter chicken and that black-lentil dal. In fact, there seem to be two competing companies, each claiming a lineage with the original Moti Mahal founded in 1947 and each vying for rights to the name in New York City. Lawyers may have to sort it out. Meanwhile, the rest of us can get down to the more serious business of rooting around the lengthy menu, paying particular attention to anything that passes through the tandoor oven. Its dry heat roasts papadum to a greaseless crisp and chases excess water from mushroom caps stuffed with herbs and cheese, leaving them tender and meaty. The tandoor also imparts a winning smokiness to an unpromising-sounding snack of grilled pineapple, sweet potato, apple and bell pepper in a sweet-tart malt vinegar marinade that has a slowly mounting black-pepper buzz. Skewers of lamb called burrah kebab emerge from the tandoor coated with a thick and tangy marinade of yogurt, sour cream and lemon juice spiced with garam masala. These chops make you want to gnaw at the bone once the meat is gone. The most eye-opening item to come out of the oven is tandoori chicken, a preparation said to have been introduced to restaurant dining by the original Moti Mahal. Justifiably, the dish and the restaurant became famous. Juicy despite its black streaks of char, the tandoori chicken at Moti Mahal Delux has a subtle heat and spice but does not have the quarter-inch of candy-red flesh that indicates the presence of food coloring. After tasting it, I thought of the restaurants where I had been served poor facsimiles of the dish and wanted to demand refunds from all of them. “My whole point of taking this franchise was to get the recipe for their tandoori chicken,” said Gaurav Anand, the executive chef and an owner of Moti Mahal Delux, in a phone interview. “Because as a chef I’ve been thinking for so long: How do they make it? It’s unbelievable.” Mr. Anand, who was raised in New Delhi, obtained the recipe he coveted from the mother ship, along with several others on the menu that are denoted as Moti Mahal Delux signatures. They are all worth having, from the golden pakora fritters spiked with ground Kashmiri chiles to the fearsomely rich butter chicken to the crab masala in a dry and complex sauce made of tomatoes, onions and a garam masala blend supplied by the restaurant’s New Delhi overlords. (A similar masala dish is made with goat brains.) These dishes set high expectations that are not met by every item on the menu, which mixes Moti Mahal classics and Mr. Anand’s own contributions. I was a bit mystified by the golgappa shots, four fried poori cups perched on different kinds of broth in shot glasses. You are meant to pour the broths into the poori, but they dribble out the bottom and don’t add much in any case. Roomali khasta was another shot-glass appetizer, fried pastry cigars stuffed with mushrooms and standing in a sun-dried tomato dip that didn’t leave much impression. And apart from the rice pudding, I was immune to the charms of the desserts. Next time I’ll have sweets elsewhere and concentrate on the things Moti Mahal Delux does best, starting with the vegetarian dishes. The kitchen brings out okra’s most appealing qualities by slicing the pods lengthwise and dredging them in roasted cumin seeds and other spices before giving them a fast blast in very hot oil. The okra hangs on to its crunchy texture even after it’s been tossed in its gravy of tomatoes and onions. Less aggressive treatment is in store for tiny eggplants with their stems still on and for broccoli, which is steamed and then simmered in a quiet saffron sauce. Mr. Anand, who also owns Bhatti Indian Grill on the south end of Lexington Avenue, said that he had discovered many of these dishes in India as a young cook. “If somebody made good kebabs, I’d get their recipe,” he said. The main dining room of Moti Mahal Delux, most recently a different Indian restaurant, has been done over in clean, modern style, with chocolate-leather chairs and straight-backed red banquettes along a blond wood wall. The room looks so fresh and new that you wish the designers had kept going a few yards more, into the corridor leading to the restrooms and the glassed-in terrace that wraps around the corner of First Avenue and 63rd Street. For a new restaurant, it has a few spots too many that could use a fresh coat of paint. For now, the restaurant has no liquor license, which keeps the check from climbing very high. A weekday lunch special with two appetizers, three entrees, a biryani, naan and dessert comes to less than $12. These are Curry Hill prices on the Upper East Side, and a bargain in any neighborhood for food that provides a surprising flavor of luxury.","Dahi palak kebabs, all pakoras, bhunni chaat, murgh tandoori, burrah kebab, malai kofta, dum ke phool, baingan Patiala, bhindi jaitpuri, paneer makhani, dal makhani, murgh makhani, meen curry, crab lehsuni, MMD signature masala, lemon rice.

No, probably not. Vegetables don’t tend to inspire great jokes. On the contrary, they conjure their very own brand of humorlessness, the tight-lipped officiousness of grim nutritionists that is captured in the phrase “Eat your vegetables.” Since opening Dirt Candy in the East Village almost four years ago, the chef Amanda Cohen has been waging war on the “eat your vegetables” mind-set, using humor as one of her weapons. Here she is on her restaurant’s Web site on the subject of cabbage: “It’s the wino of the vegetable world: smelly, unloved and looking at it makes you feel sad. A cabbage salad sounds even worse. Cabbage that’s ... raw? It sounds like a plated suicide note.” Humor is so integral to Ms. Cohen’s work that she may be the only chef in America who could publish her first cookbook in comic-book form and make the decision seem not just sensible but inevitable. Drawn by Ryan Dunlavey with facial expressions that range from mild exasperation to howling rage, Ms. Cohen’s cartoon character delivers bitingly funny monologues about appearing on “Iron Chef” and rolling out pasta dough. Along the way, she and her staff beat the daylights out of a wizard and a fairy who are idiotic enough to suggest that pickles are made by magic. But Ms. Cohen’s chief weapon in the battle against vegetable scolds is the food she serves at Dirt Candy, a vegetarian restaurant that is thrillingly free of high-minded ideals. Ms. Cohen isn’t necessarily out to save a small planet or prevent heart disease. Her goals are possibly more subversive, and she achieves them with vegetable cookery that is original, clever, visually arresting and, above all, a lot of fun to eat. Take the dish called Cauliflower! The punctuation is the restaurant’s, but I’ll go along with the emotion. Ms. Cohen gives cauliflower florets a long bath in maple smoke, dips them in cornflakes, fries them to a golden crisp and serves them on waffles. She’s making a visual pun on the chicken-leg shape of the florets and stems. But these smoky and crunchy nuggets also invite you to see vegetables as an indulgence, a pleasure that is not quite guilty but not entirely innocent, either. Eating at Dirt Candy can be like going to a child’s birthday party in a country where all the children love vegetables. Eggplant tiramisù, with layers of rosemary lady fingers sandwiching a sweet mascarpone whipped with grilled eggplant, sounds like a dare: daring you to try it, daring you to like it. While you consider your options, a server brings the final element of the dish, a white frizz of cotton candy with a startlingly pure and piney taste of rosemary. It lifts up the eggplant, the dessert and the party. One way of cooking vegetables is to go deep, to concentrate flavors until you have the world’s most carroty carrot, and leave it at that. Ms. Cohen builds layers of flavor from the outside in. During the fall, she constructs a savory tart using tomatoes in every way imaginable, to intensify the effect. There are dried tomatoes in a pink, biscuit-like crust; there are peeled and marinated cherry tomatoes on top of that crust, with a creamy layer of smoked feta; there is a ribbon of sweet and chewy tomato leather around the tart; finally, off to the side, there is a salad of fresh and dehydrated cherry tomatoes. The whole was more than the sum of its parts, but all the parts were good to begin with. The same isn’t true yet of a new dish (Onions!) built around small Chinese-derived cakes of smoked scallions and chives. One night they were overwhelmingly smoky; on another night the smoke was more reticent but the cakes themselves tasted flat. Both nights, a salad of grilled scallions, red onions and herbs could have used a livelier, more decisive dressing. But it’s very difficult to criticize a dish that includes the world’s tiniest onion rings, each just big enough to fit on the tip of a chopstick. These elaborate plates, each of which holds about a half-dozen components and can be made in vegan form upon request, emerge from a visibly cramped kitchen. This may seem like a marvel, but it pales next to the logistical feat Ms. Cohen and her staff pulled off early this month. Like hundreds of restaurants downtown, Dirt Candy lost power for four days after Hurricane Sandy. Every perishable, including stocks, jams and pickles, had to be tossed onto the sidewalk in trash bags. Almost all of it was replenished in just two days, which meant scheduling times and temperatures for the single oven down to the minute. It must have been like re-enacting the invasion of Normandy in a kiddie pool. It also involved the same kind of spatial planning that allows Dirt Candy to fit 18 seats into a spare, modernist dining room where even one more might be too much. Wineglasses are stored on a sea-green glass ledge above the tables, and customers waiting for a table are stored outside on Ninth Street. Vegetarian cooks in the United States have not always found much nourishment in American cuisine. Some looked to health food and ideology, while others have looked abroad. Ms. Cohen dabbles in overseas influences. Cabbage!, a lonesome hobo no more, is reimagined as the star of a marvelous Asian noodle salad, with kohlrabi threads standing in for noodles, fried walnuts carrying a spicy blast of Sichuan peppercorn, and purple fried won tons getting their color and flavor from juiced cabbage. A new item on the menu, Beans!, surrounds haricots verts and crisp tofu with a deeply intriguing sauce in which saffron, ginger, cilantro, coriander seed, cumin and Urfa biber pepper offer echoes of Morocco. But there is no mistaking a Dirt Candy dish for one that you would find in another country. Ms. Cohen is not adapting the vegetarian cuisine of some other culture. She is inventing her own.",Hush puppies; mushroom; fennel; cabbage; tomato; chard; beans; cauliflower; rosemary-eggplant tiramisù; ice cream Nanaimo bar.
244,M. Wells Dinette,2 star,"Nov. 20, 2012",Pete Wells,Long Island City,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/21/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-m-wells-dinette-at-moma-ps1.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/21/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-m-wells-dinette-at-moma-ps1.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"WHEN M. Wells, a tin-can diner on a windswept corner of Long Island City, Queens, closed in the summer of 2011, its operators blamed its demise on a rent increase. I never believed it. The more likely explanation, it seemed to me, is that the restaurant had to die so New York could live. As a light beginning to your meal, you could start with a half-dozen fat snails stuffed into the melting marrow of a long shaft of shinbone. After that delicate snack, you could get a little more serious by ordering an entire meatloaf with stroganoff gravy, spaetzle and foie gras. This tower of meat was meant to be shared by four people, but you could round out the meal with slices of buttered brioche weighted down with even more foie gras. That was a side dish. M. Wells posed a danger to more than the heart and arteries, though. Its chef, Hugue Dufour, advocated an approach to dining that was a threat to the work ethic that has made the city prosperous since it was called New Amsterdam. The gleefully unrestrained portions and liberal doses of fat and meat were an invitation to eat too much at lunch, get drunk in the afternoon, sleep it off for a while, resume consciousness again at dinner and call in sick the next day. If enough people had fallen into the M. Wells lifestyle, the city would have ground to a halt and our economy would look like Greece’s. But New York must have an immune system that keeps it safe from destabilizing outside influences, because M. Wells lasted just more than a year before the steak knives and the foie gras vanished from the scene. Two months ago, Mr. Dufour and his wife and business partner, Sarah Obraitis, returned to haunt our 60-hour workweeks and our plans to live to retirement age with M. Wells Dinette, a new cafeteria inside MoMA PS1 in Long Island City. In homage to the building’s past as a red brick schoolhouse, the dining area is set up like a classroom. There are long shared desks with composition notebooks tucked beneath the surface and even a few of those chairs with a built-in writing surface; others have a cage for books under the seat. More forgiving than the restaurant it attempts to reprise, M. Wells Dinette is closed for dinner and seems to have scaled back its portions ever so slightly for daytime eating. But Mr. Dufour did not return to the kitchen to make cucumber sandwiches. One weekend, a goat had been drawn on the menu chalkboard, its heart and other organs instructively labeled. (Another blackboard lists the wines, many of them French and all of them very helpful in putting away Mr. Dufour’s cuisine.) The kitchen had bought a goat, butchered it, and was selling off the pieces. By the time I got to the dinette on Sunday morning, just one leg and the liver were left. I chose the liver. With a rustic French sauce of vermouth and lardons, a mess of caramelized onions and a cushion of mashed potatoes holding everything in place, it was staggeringly hearty, the kind of thing you’d want to eat before setting off on a three-day bowhunting trip in Alaska. If my hemoglobin count had still been low after that liver, and I was still hungry, I might have followed it with the blood pudding. This big slab, the color of a just-dug beet, was crunchy on the outside, with an iron-rich tang that was softened and sweetened by a buttery apple mustard. The menus, which change daily, can be read as methodical studies in the uses of animal fat. Cured pork belly binds an expertly made terrine of rabbit shot through with pink ovals of foie gras. The rich oils of smoked herring bring depth to a surprisingly light Caesar salad with broccoli. One of my companions described the thin slices of fried bread served with a classic brandade as “crisp butter.” There is also smooth, spreadable butter, on an open-face sandwich of bottarga served with a shot glass of the anise-flavored spirit arak, and flaky layered butter in the crust on a slice of Mr. Dufour’s justifiably renowned Québécois meat pie, which overflows with the flesh of four or five species of animal. A native of Quebec, Mr. Dufour learned his blithe disregard for moderation while cooking at Au Pied de Cochon in Montreal, where he was also the pastry chef and an owner. Most of the time, his celebration of the unbridled joy of eating like a lumberjack is so convincing that I’d be prepared to split cordwood all day just to earn the right to pull up a chair. I may have to do that, in fact, if I keep going back to M. Wells for the charlotte that appears in various guises. One day the pastry chef, Bethany Costello, had filled it with pears, mascarpone and a lake of salted caramel; another time she made it impersonate a black forest cake, with chocolate mousse below brandied cherries and a dark chocolate shell. In any incarnation, it is said to serve two. It could easily make six people happy, or four people ecstatic. But at M. Wells Dinette, as at its forerunner, there are times when excess does not lead to success. There was nothing appealing about a veal cheek stroganoff — not the crunchy, underdone mushrooms, not the dense and pasty torpedoes of spaetzle, not the largely flavorless meat and especially not the pools of grease that lay on top of the sauce. Grease was also a major and unwelcome player in a bowl of onion soup topped with bland melted cheese. Get a dish like this, and you can start to wish that the kitchen put as much care into the fine details as it does into the broad strokes. Then again, you might just accept the occasional greasy sauce as the price you pay for all the food at M. Wells Dinette that you’ll never find anywhere else, least of all in a museum cafe. PS1 should be congratulated for landing a restaurant that suits the neighborhood, the museum’s audience and, trickiest of all, the questing spirit of the work in its galleries. It’s easy enough to imagine a contemporary artist butchering and roasting a goat as a performance piece. It’s less easy to imagine the resulting feast tasting as good as it did at M. Wells Dinette.",Rabbit and foie gras terrine; Bibim Wells (bibimbop); blood pudding; foie and oats; meat pie; charlotte; pumpkin tres leches.
245,Guy's American Kitchen & Bar,0.25 star,"Nov. 13, 2012",Pete Wells,Times Square Theatre District,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-guys-american-kitchen-bar-in-times-square.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-guys-american-kitchen-bar-in-times-square.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"GUY FIERI, have you eaten at your new restaurant in Times Square? Have you pulled up one of the 500 seats at Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar and ordered a meal? Did you eat the food? Did it live up to your expectations? Did panic grip your soul as you stared into the whirling hypno wheel of the menu, where adjectives and nouns spin in a crazy vortex? When you saw the burger described as “Guy’s Pat LaFrieda custom blend, all-natural Creekstone Farm Black Angus beef patty, LTOP (lettuce, tomato, onion + pickle), SMC (super-melty-cheese) and a slathering of Donkey Sauce on garlic-buttered brioche,” did your mind touch the void for a minute? Did you notice that the menu was an unreliable predictor of what actually came to the table? Were the “bourbon butter crunch chips” missing from your Almond Joy cocktail, too? Was your deep-fried “boulder” of ice cream the size of a standard scoop? What exactly about a small salad with four or five miniature croutons makes Guy’s Famous Big Bite Caesar (a) big (b) famous or (c) Guy’s, in any meaningful sense? Were you struck by how very far from awesome the Awesome Pretzel Chicken Tenders are? If you hadn’t come up with the recipe yourself, would you ever guess that the shiny tissue of breading that exudes grease onto the plate contains either pretzels or smoked almonds? Did you discern any buttermilk or brine in the white meat, or did you think it tasted like chewy air? Why is one of the few things on your menu that can be eaten without fear or regret — a lunch-only sandwich of chopped soy-glazed pork with coleslaw and cucumbers — called a Roasted Pork Bahn Mi, when it resembles that item about as much as you resemble Emily Dickinson? When you have a second, Mr. Fieri, would you see what happened to the black bean and roasted squash soup we ordered? Hey, did you try that blue drink, the one that glows like nuclear waste? The watermelon margarita? Any idea why it tastes like some combination of radiator fluid and formaldehyde? At your five Johnny Garlic’s restaurants in California, if servers arrive with main courses and find that the appetizers haven’t been cleared yet, do they try to find space for the new plates next to the dirty ones? Or does that just happen in Times Square, where people are used to crowding? If a customer shows up with a reservation at one of your two Tex Wasabi’s outlets, and the rest of the party has already been seated, does the host say, “Why don’t you have a look around and see if you can find them?” and point in the general direction of about 200 seats? What is going on at this new restaurant of yours, really? Has anyone ever told you that your high-wattage passion for no-collar American food makes you television’s answer to Calvin Trillin, if Mr. Trillin bleached his hair, drove a Camaro and drank Boozy Creamsicles? When you cruise around the country for your show “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,” rasping out slangy odes to the unfancy places where Americans like to get down and greasy, do you really mean it? Or is it all an act? Is that why the kind of cooking you celebrate on television is treated with so little respect at Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar? How, for example, did Rhode Island’s supremely unhealthy and awesomely good fried calamari — dressed with garlic butter and pickled hot peppers — end up in your restaurant as a plate of pale, unsalted squid rings next to a dish of sweet mayonnaise with a distant rumor of spice? How did Louisiana’s blackened, Cajun-spiced treatment turn into the ghostly nubs of unblackened, unspiced white meat in your Cajun Chicken Alfredo? How did nachos, one of the hardest dishes in the American canon to mess up, turn out so deeply unlovable? Why augment tortilla chips with fried lasagna noodles that taste like nothing except oil? Why not bury those chips under a properly hot and filling layer of melted cheese and jalapeños instead of dribbling them with thin needles of pepperoni and cold gray clots of ground turkey? By the way, would you let our server know that when we asked for chai, he brought us a cup of hot water? When you hung that sign by the entrance that says, WELCOME TO FLAVOR TOWN!, were you just messing with our heads? Does this make it sound as if everything at Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar is inedible? I didn’t say that, did I? Tell me, though, why does your kitchen sabotage even its more appealing main courses with ruinous sides and sauces? Why stifle a pretty good bison meatloaf in a sugary brown glaze with no undertow of acid or spice? Why send a serviceable herb-stuffed rotisserie chicken to the table in the company of your insipid Rice-a-Roni variant? Why undermine a big fist of slow-roasted pork shank, which might fly in many downtown restaurants if the General Tso’s-style sauce were a notch less sweet, with randomly shaped scraps of carrot that combine a tough, nearly raw crunch with the deadened, overcooked taste of school cafeteria vegetables? Is this how you roll in Flavor Town? Somewhere within the yawning, three-level interior of Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar, is there a long refrigerated tunnel that servers have to pass through to make sure that the French fries, already limp and oil-sogged, are also served cold? What accounts for the vast difference between the Donkey Sauce recipe you’ve published and the Donkey Sauce in your restaurant? Why has the hearty, rustic appeal of roasted-garlic mayonnaise been replaced by something that tastes like Miracle Whip with minced raw garlic? And when we hear the words Donkey Sauce, which part of the donkey are we supposed to think about? Is the entire restaurant a very expensive piece of conceptual art? Is the shapeless, structureless baked alaska that droops and slumps and collapses while you eat it, or don’t eat it, supposed to be a representation in sugar and eggs of the experience of going insane? Why did the toasted marshmallow taste like fish? Did you finish that blue drink? Oh, and we never got our Vegas fries; would you mind telling the kitchen that we don’t need them? Thanks.","Roasted Pork Bahn Mi, General Tso’s Crispy Pork Shank, Cedar Plank Salmon with Jalapeño Apricot Jam."
246,'21' Club,0.75 star,"Oct. 23, 2012",Pete Wells,Midtown,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-21-club-in-manhattan.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-21-club-in-manhattan.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"READERS who look forward to the dark thrill of a public execution on days when there are no stars attached to this column should turn elsewhere to satisfy their blood lust. This is going to be a kind of love letter to a restaurant where the food is largely forgettable and the prices are almost always unwarranted. Years had gone by since I had last sat beneath the toy trucks and boxing gloves, the model airplanes and beer steins in the barroom at “21.” Too many years, I realized in March, when another reformed speakeasy in Midtown, Bill’s Gay Nineties, went out of business. I stopped by on its last night, annoyed with myself for how long it had been since my last drink there. Then, like a man who has just returned from a funeral, I checked in on some old acquaintances. The “21” Club is in no apparent danger, although its status as a corporate trophy is nervous-making. (Last week a luxury hotel group based in India made a takeover bid for its owner, a luxury hotel group based in London.) All the same, I put on a blazer, left the jeans and sneakers at home so I wouldn’t be turned away at the door, and went for dinner. Sadly, the future of “21” might be grim if it had to survive as a restaurant alone. To get the violence over quickly: a game platter, with venison, a boar chop, house-made bacon and rabbit sausage, was as cold as if it had been carried all the way from the hunting lodge. Caesar salad, exactly what you want to eat at “21,” was hopeless, the sliced romaine unevenly dressed and dumped on a plate with stale, dry croutons that might have come from a box. Creamed spinach was a rough paste of chopped greenery in a floury white sauce. That was the worst of it. Most of the food prepared under the chef, John Greeley, a 17-year veteran of “21,” was classic, unsuspenseful and solidly prepared, like the chilled shrimp with cocktail sauce, the grilled lamb chops, the salmon fillet and the steak tartare that wasn’t as neatly hacked up as it might have been but did hold a properly honed edge of mustard and pepper. I ate only four things at “21” that I’d go back for with any anticipation: the famous chicken hash, as creamy and agreeable as Jo Stafford’s voice; the “21” burger, blended with onions and thyme for a homey taste, like meatloaf without the bread; the coconut cake, topped with a beehive of white meringue and toasted coconut; and the olives in the martinis that are as cold as a walk along Park Avenue in January. But to judge “21” as a restaurant is to miss the point of the place. Like Galatoire’s in New Orleans, “21” is at its best when you treat the food as a solid foundation for the liquid entertainment. Take note of the first question you are asked at the table. It is not an offer of still or sparkling, as if you had gone out to dinner because you were tired of the bottled-water selection at home. No, servers at “21” lead off the way they should at all restaurants: “Can I get you something to drink?” On a good night, everybody who works at “21” behaves like a bartender, and the meal sails along on a river of alcohol and high spirits. The wine director, Phil Pratt, has a practiced theatricality and patter more often heard above the splash of gin than the gentle swirl of old Bordeaux. To feel out a customer’s budget, he might ask “How ... painful do you want it to be?” He is not above exploiting the dramatic possibilities of the silver tastevin swinging from his neck, filling it with a splash of Burgundy, lifting it to his lips, rocking back on his heels, popping his eyes and pursing his lips. Many sommeliers tell stories these days. Often they are the tales of ardent fans, and when the story gets to the part about meeting the winemaker, as such stories always seem to do, the sommelier will blush like a sixth grader who has Justin Bieber’s autograph on her backpack. None of that for Mr. Pratt. One night he brought one of Michel Chapoutier’s Rhône reds to a table and asked the diners there to feel the bottle. Mr. Chapoutier, he explained, had embossed his labels with Braille ever since he had poured his wines for a blind man. “And that man,” he said, pausing before the punch line, “was Ray Charles.” It probably didn’t happen that way, but you don’t interrupt an actor mid-monologue any more than you would forget to tip the attendant in the men’s room whom everybody calls the Rev. “Hello, young man,” he said to me one night, then embroidered on his lie. “It’s a good thing you brought your driver’s license, or you’d be drinking Coca-Cola.” By some logic I didn’t follow, this led to a warning that if I didn’t behave, they were going to ask Halle Berry to spank me, and of course she’d expect to be spanked in return. (Personal and confidential to Ms. Berry: I didn’t believe a word of this.) The Rev holds court among vintage pastel murals that depict men and women relieving themselves in complicated ways, scenes that were naughty once and will be bizarre forever. The sense of time travel in that room was intense and not always comfortable, and after a few minutes I felt the urgent need to get back to my table before a portal slammed shut and I was trapped in 1952. It’s not an experience I’d want every night, any more than I could regularly afford to pay $32 for a burger or $37 for chicken hash. But I’ll be back, because I have enough regrets already. I regret all the songs I could have belted out around the piano at Bill’s Gay Nineties. I regret the nights I didn’t tune in to hear the huge mahogany doors on Danny Stiles’s Art Deco penthouse swing shut as Mr. Stiles bid all his radio listeners “Good night, dear hearts.” I regret the rides I didn’t take on Checker cabs while they still prowled the avenues. I don’t want to add “21” to the list.","Chicken hash, “21” burger, pommes soufflés, ahi tuna tartare, steak tartare, chocolate soufflé, coconut cake."
247,Nougatine at Jean Georges,2 star,"Sept. 4, 2012",Pete Wells,Upper West Side,"American, French",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/dining/reviews/nougatine-at-jean-georges-in-manhattan.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/dining/reviews/nougatine-at-jean-georges-in-manhattan.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"YES, Nougatine. You didn’t forget about it, did you? I hope not. So does Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who established it 15 years ago as the easygoing bistro next door to the demure elegance of Jean Georges, Audrey Tautou to the flagship’s Catherine Deneuve. Since then, New Yorkers have come to rely on Nougatine at Jean Georges, to give the name that nobody ever uses, for working lunches that could be expensed without waking up the auditors, yet they also tended to take it for granted. It has never been reviewed before in The New York Times, and it rarely comes up in conversations about favorite Vongerichten restaurants, although it is one of the most dependable. Part of the trouble is that it can be hard to say just what kind of place Nougatine is. There’s that slightly embarrassing name, which suggests a shop that sells chocolates or lingerie or maybe both. There’s the menu, roaming from burgers and fries to foie gras with a hotel-lobby inclusiveness. But the biggest reason Nougatine never quite emerged from the long shadow of its sister may have been its design, meant originally as a hotel lounge. Particularly after Jean Georges was brought up to date by the architect Thomas Juul-Hansen several years ago, Nougatine resembled an afterthought. It was as if Nougatine were meant to make the diners who passed through on their way to Jean Georges feel better about what they were about to spend, the way a glimpse past the curtains into the shantytown in the back of a plane reassures first-class passengers. Then in April, Mr. Vongerichten brought Mr. Juul-Hansen in to redo everything but the floors. Suddenly, Nougatine feels like a destination. It’s a livelier, more kinetic space than Jean Georges; there’s a long, mail-slot window into the kitchen where you can see the cooks, and often Mr. Vongerichten. A mirror right above the mail slot, and another window behind the cooks that looks out on Broadway, roughly doubles the energy at that end of the room. Gone now are the blocky woven-back chairs and the lounge tables that looked as if they’d been left behind by a percussionist on his way to a drum circle in Central Park. The furniture is more graceful now, with echoes of Charles and Ray Eames in the creamy leather chairs and walnut tabletops. There’s a bit of Rat Pack-era verve; the skinny pendant lights above the bar even look like smoldering cigarettes. (Nougatine’s newfound glamour is weakest at the low and awkward tables along the wall between the bar and the kitchen; after the hosts recognized me, they went to some lengths to avoid seating me there.) Despite Nougatine’s night-on-the-town gloss, though, the soul of the menu is not far from what you might cook at home — or, to be more realistic, what Mr. Vongerichten might cook if you came to his apartment on Perry Street. If the weather was hot, he might cut open a watermelon, whittle it down to cubes, arrange them in a circle like a pink Stonehenge, and scatter white fluffs of goat cheese all around. This almost preposterously simple appetizer soars above salad-bar level thanks to good green olive oil and a sly kick of cracked white pepper. After that, if you were effusive in your praise of Mr. Vongerichten’s collection of toasters, he might grill you a pork chop, then surround it with fruity habanero sauce made with cherries in early summer, or plums as fall nears. Comfortable as this down-home bone-in chop and this emphatically spicy condiment would feel in a home kitchen, they are almost unimaginable next door at Jean Georges. Nor would any restaurant of Jean Georges’s aspirations send out Nougatine’s massive, handsomely trimmed whole globe artichoke, as imposing as Vitali Klitschko’s fist, and ask you to pull it apart with your hands to dip leaves and bites of heart in a lemony, mustardy chervil mayonnaise. Too bad, because it’s a treat. A few dishes look so casual they seem to have been whipped up by Mr. Vongerichten and his chef de cuisine, Mark Lapico, after a morning run to the farmers’ market, like the crisp chicken breast with summer squash and very gently roasted tomatoes. Does it sound ordinary? Try making it yourself, then go to Nougatine and get back to me. On a menu as wide ranging as Nougatine’s, which must cater to guests in the Trump International Hotel upstairs, there must be a few slackers. I liked the idea of Cantonese-style salt-and-pepper lobster, and the warm cabbage slaw that came with it, more than I liked the chewy lobster meat itself. Still, that was a better use for the shellfish than the “lobster burger,” interred, bizarrely, under green chile mayonnaise and a blanket of melted Gruyère. And if a French-born chef serves fries, you expect more than the pale and not terribly crunchy ones at Nougatine. (For a refresher in how to cook a potato, look no further than the spectacularly crisped wedges that come with a good but unthrilling strip loin.) Since Johnny Iuzzini stepped down as pastry chef at Nougatine and Jean Georges last year, a successor, Joseph Murphy, has been settling in. His straightforward, American touch was most assured in an impressively fluffy sour cream cheesecake and in a group of ice cream sandwiches. But scraps of dough on a peach cobbler were pasty and floury, and I could never get a perfect spoonful out of a bowl of bland butterscotch pudding with heavily salted crème fraîche and bittersweet caramel. (Recent desserts at Jean Georges suggested that the changeover isn’t seamless there, either.) The redesign did nothing to change Nougatine’s weak spot, the wide runway to Jean Georges that cuts the dining room in half. Some intimacy and liveliness are lost, but something is gained, too: a front-row seat to the lavishly dressed parade of pilgrims. There are the gastrotourists, set to document the entire meal in photos; there are out-of-towners whose one big splurge this will be; there are women whose dresses and heels make you wonder exactly how long ago they met their dates. And then the parade is over, and the little dining room returns to normal. Like all successful restaurants in the grand old style, Jean Georges belongs to the world. But Nougatine belongs to New York.",Tuna tartare; watermelon and goat cheese salad; artichoke; sweet pea soup with Parmesan; foie gras and strawberry brûlée; red snapper with silky carrot; salmon baked with lemon crumbs; crispy chicken; grilled pork chop; sour cream cheesecake; ice cream sandwiches.

Just ask the host at Rosemary’s who was cheerfully trying to marshal the wildly oversubscribed waiting list the other night. (The list has been oversubscribed pretty much continuously since the restaurant opened in June.) In the kindest possible way, she tried to dissuade one member of my party from adding his name. Under strict orders from me, my emissary insisted, and finally succeeded. He was asked to come back in an hour. My group of three passed the next 60 minutes very agreeably in a bar down the street, and we returned at the appointed time. Our host apologized and said there was a group lingering over drinks at the table she’d meant for us, so we would need to wait just a little longer. And we did, standing out front, watching Villagers strut past the corner of West 10th Street and Greenwich Avenue. That was agreeable, too, for a while. But its delights were wearing thin 25 minutes later, when the host came out to say that the lingerers were still lingering. There was one table ready now, though. It was usually a two-top, she said with a wince, but since we’d been standing so long perhaps we’d like to take it? She was doing her best, but the whole situation could have been avoided, thanks to a miraculous advance in technology. Although it may sound like science fiction, a remarkable new device has the potential to change the way we communicate. It is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand yet powerful enough to enable you to place and receive calls wherever you happen to be — even inside a bar. Yes, the “cellular telephone,” or “cellphone” for short, is real, and it is available now. One day, the owners of Rosemary’s may discover that this futuristic gadget can be a handy method of notifying customers when a table is ready. At the moment, they seem to have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. There are reasons to put up with the list at the door, if not the restaurant’s technophobic method of handling it. First among them is the spirited cooking of Wade Moises, who learned to move gracefully around a scalding pot of spaghetti at Mario Batali’s finishing school. You can spot some of the headmaster’s knack for energetic flavors in Rosemary’s linguine, tossed with preserved lemon and threads of hot pickled chiles. I’ve never met a dish of pasta more deeply infused with the sunny brightness of citrus. Nearly as satisfying, but in a richer, porkier mode, was the chitarra alla carbonara with meaty strips of guanciale. But with just four pastas on the menu, there should be no room for disappointments like the gummy house-made cavatelli with starchy, crunchy peas. Mr. Moises is adept at working vegetables and seafood into antipasti that bring your appetite to attention. With a spicy dressing of grated pecorino and pickled onions, he can make a treat out of slices of raw zucchini, typically as thrilling as an ice chip. The house-cured tuna is more voluptuous than cooked tuna has any right to be, and cold shrimp tossed with mint, jalapeño and ginger shows Mr. Moises knows when to color outside the lines. At nearly every table, some wise person has ordered the porchettina, sawed-off columns of brined and roasted pork loin standing upright like the ruins of a Roman temple. The main-course-size minestra di stagione didn’t seem to tempt as many diners, but it should. On the night I tasted it, elbow macaroni shared the bowl with sugar snap peas, young turnips, asparagus as thin as a knitting needle, purple carrots and cherry tomatoes, each vegetable cooked to its ideal point, all of them in a vegetable broth that was gentle but persuasive. The menu bills it as “the ultimate minestrone,” and the hyperbole is not far from the mark. The cherry tomatoes in the soup, along with the ones in a very pretty tomato salad, were ripened in the Greenwich Village sun that beats down on a kitchen garden on the roof. The restaurant’s owner, Carlos Suarez, who also runs BoBo nearby, seems rather proud of this. The words “Rooftop Farm” are printed on the menu, right below the name, and servers always mention the provenance of those tomatoes. Most of the produce could have been procured at any farmers’ market, but the urban agrarian notion does seem to have provided a theme for the décor. The interiors firm Dekar Design flirts with rustic-Italian clichés without falling too hard for them. Parquet tables sit on parquet floors below exposed rafters; glass doors are thrown wide open in warm weather; potted plants are everywhere. The place has the feel of a trellised patio in some corner of Italy that’s heavily populated by Upper East Siders, the women wearing expensive rings, the men wearing even more expensive watches. I skulked through this slender crowd feeling like a beagle among greyhounds. Many of those greyhounds look as if they could afford to pay far more than Rosemary’s asks: each vegetable antipasto is $5; the pastas are $14 or less. Given the quality, these are impressively low prices, and they provide another possible justification for the lines. There are exceptions, though. One is the bistecca gran mela for two, a dry-aged strip steak served on the bone, for $80. It isn’t nearly as flavorful as the skirt steak, which provides a much more pronounced beefiness and, at $22, costs about half as much for a serving. Rosemary’s wine list has a gimmick that seems to promise good deals: there are 40 wines, all for $40. That price feels comfortable until you find out how many of those wines can be picked up in stores for $12 or less. (If you want a reasonable return on your $40, try the 2010 Lia Vi Barbera d’Asti from Carussin; the 2009 Marzemino from Costaripa; or the 2007 Capitel Foscarino from Anselmi.) If I felt some chagrin at paying $40 for the kinds of bottles that might be opened at an office party, most of it melted away under the influence of the summer breezes and the servers’ ready smiles. Just think how charming Rosemary’s could be if it took reservations or, failing that, if cellphones ever catch on.",Frutti di mare antipasti; lardo focaccia; mozzarella; spaghetti al pomodoro; linguine with preserved lemon; minestra di stagione; porchettina; olive oil cake.

When they arrive at the table, there is nothing prepossessing about the fried artichokes served at La Vara, a four-month-old Spanish restaurant in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. I took one look and thought, O.K., fried artichokes. I know what these are all about. So what was it that made me want to betray my friends by creating a diversion (Hey, out there on Clinton Street! Is that Martin Amis?) so I could polish them off all by myself? It clearly has something to do with the way all the luxuriously soft qualities of confited artichokes are wrapped inside those crunchy fried leaves and hearts, and just as much to do with that sauce, a creamy aioli with force-multiplying jabs of anchovy. Nor did I swoon at the arrival of La Vara’s fideuà, thin noodles cooked paella fashion in a seafood broth. Brown, broken and floppy, the noodles look like a halfhearted attempt to disguise last night’s pasta. All leftovers should fare so well. Surrounded by tiny squid, clams and shrimp, cooked until done and not an instant longer, the fideuà tastes a little like toasted durum wheat and a lot like the dripping-wet haul from a Valencian fishing net. La Vara is the newest vessel in the small and nimble Spanish armada commanded by Alex Raij and her husband and co-chef, Eder Montero. Txikito and El Quinto Pino in Manhattan, which make up the rest of their fleet, have done much to broaden the range of Spanish flavors in the city. With La Vara, Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero are exploring new territory, the vast legacy of the Jews and Muslims who shared the Iberian Peninsula with Christians for centuries. This three-way marriage, known as la convivencia, had its tensions, and the breakup was ugly, but it did wonderful things for the country’s kitchens. Its imprint on Spain’s cuisine isn’t always evident. La Vara urges, and rewards, a closer inspection. During their long rule of Spain, as Claudia Roden writes in “The Food of Spain,” the Muslims introduced ingredients that remain staples, like rice, artichokes, eggplants, bitter oranges, cumin and saffron. They brought skewers, noodles (fideuà comes from an Arabic word for pasta, al-fidawsh), the shatteringly crisp savory pastries known as bricks and chickpea-spinach stews. All are on offer at La Vara. I’m not convinced that sweet-and-savory chopped greens with pine nuts and currants are the ideal stuffing for a brick. But grilled chicken hearts made plenty of sense on a skewer, and while they could have been more tender, their pepper, caraway and coriander seed seasoning was inviting, as was the herb salad alongside, vibrant with lime. Another gift from the Moors was deep-fried fish, a term that doesn’t suggest just how delicious the long ribbons of fried, marinated, pimentón-dusted skate called raya en adobo turn out to be. But is La Vara good for the Jews? The history of Jewish cooking in Spain is fraught, to put it mildly, especially after 1492, when Ferdinand and Isabella compelled the Jews to convert or leave the kingdom. Converts were often watched for suspiciously pork-free kitchens and smoke-free chimneys on the Sabbath. Forced into hiding, Spanish-Jewish cuisine virtually disappeared. Traces remain, though, and Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero have excavated some of them. Those fried artichokes, for instance, may remind you of the carciofi alla giudea placed in the Roman repertory by Sephardic Jews. One of La Vara’s two best desserts is an almond cake called Torta de Santiago. Thought to be Jewish in origin, it survived in, of all places, Catholic convents. Understandably, La Vara skips the cake’s traditional ornament, a cross outlined in sugar. (The other standout is the Egipcio, an improved Pop-Tart with date-and-walnut paste inside an exquisitely tender semolina shortbread.) The restaurant doesn’t force-feed you any of this history, not in menu footnotes or in carefully memorized tableside lectures. What most people will notice is simply how inviting the place is behind its glass storefront, brick walls glowing under white light, and how it manages to feel intimate without feeling cramped. At any given table, the plates are scattered all over, because La Vara serves most things as small tapas-size dishes.  Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn’t. If the bar isn’t crowded and time isn’t tight, you could certainly stop for a glass of fino sherry and crunch on a dish of excellent fried chickpeas, a marvelously crisp and creamy croqueta or a single oil-cured sardine under sliced radish pickles. But the pleasures of eating tapas-style can get lost at a table for four, where you may find that just as you realize how much you’re enjoying a dish, the person next to you has managed to stab the last forkful. (See the Amis stratagem, above.) When will New York restaurants stop peddling the myth of “small plates meant for sharing”? Small plates are meant for hoarding. This might be why the most satisfying meal I had here was at a table for two. (If you have eaten out in the last decade, you can guess that while the prices at La Vara may seem low, the check won’t.) In truth, I was content to let others finish a few items at La Vara, including the strange stewed bacon sandwiches, the thin and meek ajo blanco with strands of squid, and the braised beef tongue in a watery tomato-caper sauce. But such dishes were far outnumbered by the ones I competed avidly for. If the griddled red shrimp came 12 to an order instead of 2, I could have eaten them all, and sucked the bittersweet juice from the head of each one. And I need to return for a second run at the pasta called gurullos, if only to figure out how any pasta can be as fluffy as an Italian grandmother’s prizewinning gnocchi. La Vara, by the way, was the name of a Jewish newspaper published in New York until it ceased in 1948. It was written in Ladino, a Castilian-Hebrew hybrid that was to Spain what Yiddish was to Eastern Europe. The language has all but vanished from the city, but it remains on the headstones of Sephardic graveyards in Queens and the Bronx, out in plain sight for those who know where to look.",Spiced chickpeas; fried artichokes; eggplant with honey and melted cheese; crispy marinated skate; tuna salad; cumin roasted lamb breast; gurullos; shrimp a la plancha; fideuà; Egipcio; torta de Santiago.
250,Biang!,1 star,"Aug. 14, 2012",Pete Wells,Flushing,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/dining/reviews/biang-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/dining/reviews/biang-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IF you are one of those people who believes that ingredients should always be treated with respect, by all means stay away from Biang!, an excitable name for a frequently exciting new restaurant in Flushing, Queens. Before they arrive in the dining room, the biang biang noodles, a specialty of the house and its namesake, are punished in ways that might have unnerved the Spanish Inquisition. They are repeatedly swung up and down through the air, slapped on a table, ripped right down the center and then dropped in boiling water. After handling like that, the final application of searing chile oil must come as a relief. When you eat those noodles, you might suffer, too, but only for a minute. Even if you have little fear of spices, the chile oil can bead your forehead with perspiration and make you blink back tears. Then you emerge on the other side, wide awake and energized, and you understand that the abuse in the kitchen helped make those noodles that much more fun to eat. All that swinging and slapping stretches them until they are so long that when you lift one from the bowl to your mouth, it seems to go on forever, like a magician’s handkerchief. Even better, ripping the noodles gives them ragged edges that hang on to any nearby sauce. You will want to hang on to those sauces, too. The one called “spicy and tingly beef with wide hand-ripped noodles” brings the hypnotic pairing of chiles and Sichuan peppercorn to bits of deeply concentrated braised beef. “Spicy and sour diced pork meat,” meanwhile, is a sauce that revels in oppositions: the sharp edge of black vinegar versus the supple fattiness of pork, the soothing spice-cake flavor of star anise against the fury of roasted dried chiles. Then there is the biang biang dish that almost everyone gets, lamb noodles seasoned with longhorn peppers and with cumin so intensely fragrant that it seems to penetrate every taste bud you have. Like everything at Biang!, the lamb noodles are a specialty of Xian, the ancient city in central China. The recipes come from David Shi, a native of Xian, who recreated them from his memories of cooking with his grandfather before moving to the United States in 1998. Biang! is essentially a cleaner, brighter, more modern sit-down version of Mr. Shi’s food stall inside the Golden Shopping Mall, an extremely ramshackle food court on Main Street in Flushing. He named the stall Xi’an Famous Foods. This may have been wishful thinking at first, when as far as most New Yorkers were concerned, Xian was famous only as the home base of the emperor who ordered up an army of terra-cotta soldiers and horses to keep him company after his death, in 210 B.C. But famous is what the food of Xi’an became, and quickly, because Mr. Shi’s cooking was so vibrant and his recipes so novel to customers who did not grow up in China. His menu was drawn from all over Xian. Lamb soup came from the Muslim Quarter. The biang biang noodles are served in innumerable casual shops. Another noodle, called liang pi, is a street food as common in Xian as the hot dog in Manhattan, said Mr. Shi’s son, Jason Wang. Cool, smooth, chewy ribbons of steamed wheat starch, liang pi are tossed with wrinkled tablets of house-made seitan and a head-clearing dose of stoplight-red chile oil. As Xi’an Famous Foods accrued a following, Mr. Wang, then a business student in college, began to help his father. He set up a Web site and led an expansion into Manhattan, where there are now three branches. Biang! is their latest move forward, a place where people Mr. Wang’s age might be happy to hang out and eat dishes that their grandparents would remember. The menu at Xi’an Famous Foods is the template of the one at Biang!, with some additions. There is now a whole page of skewers, like grilled cumin lamb and tofu skin (surprisingly flavorful in a nutty sauce of fermented tofu and sesame paste). The standout skewer, though, holds one meaty grilled chicken wing with salty, peppery, crunchy skin and sweet, smoky flesh. The other skewers cost $3 for three; the wings are $2 each. Laudably, the prices as Biang! follow the heroically low ones at Xi’an Famous Foods, a nice surprise considering how much more attractive the space is. Mr. Wang designed it, liberally taking cues from downtown Manhattan places like the Momofuku restaurants. Light comes from hanging Edison bulbs, and you sit on polished wood benches at polished wood tables. There are tunes by Beyoncé and Kanye West, and enigmatic propaganda-style prints of pandas by the Singapore artist William Chua. The transition from stall to restaurant has not been seamless. The servers’ notions of what it means to clear a table may not coincide with your own, and the kitchen can appear to struggle with the pace. One night, spaghetti-like strands of cold buckwheat noodles with cilantro and scallions were doused with mercilessly pungent mustard oil that stampeded its way into nasal passages I didn’t know I had. On another visit, I could barely taste the mustard oil. My suggested strategy is to order an extra dish or two, just in case. Get the cold tofu in chile oil with pickled vegetables and get the crisp, zippily dressed lotus root salad. Get the improbably elegant canapés of rough-hewn pork sausage topped with fried quail eggs, and by all means get the juicy lamb dumplings in hot-and-sour broth. And even though they are served on a bun without much flavor of its own, get either the cumin lamb sandwiches or, even better, the chopped pork belly sandwiches. In my case, the order-too-much strategy ended when dessert began. A cold egg drop soup made with fermented rice was vaguely beery and very peculiar, like a home brewer’s first batch. The one sweet I truly enjoyed was steamed sticky rice with sesame seeds and jujubes, which are not the jaw-fatigue-inducing candy, but fruits that look like olives and taste a little like dates. (Watch the pits, though.) There are many ways to adapt the cuisine of immigrants to a new country. But the father-and-son team at Biang! have hit on a model worth imitating: keep the recipes and the prices the same, and buy nicer furniture.","Chicken wing skewers; hot soft tofu; lotus root salad; sliced oxtail; flatbread buns with pork belly or sliced lamb; boiled lamb dumplings in broth; cold liáng pí noodles; wide hand-ripped noodles with spicy cumin lamb, spicy and tingly beef, or spicy and sour pork belly."
251,Nicoletta,0.5 star,"Aug. 7, 2012",Pete Wells,East Village,"American, Italian, Pizza",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/dining/reviews/nicoletta-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/dining/reviews/nicoletta-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IN an earlier, more primitive era, chefs with an entrepreneurial urge believed that success began with a delicious product. If you cooked something that enough people wanted to eat, you could build an empire that might one day span the country. First, though, you needed 11 secret herbs and spices. You needed special sauce. You needed Hot Doughnuts Now. It all sounds rather quaint. Thanks to the rise of celebrity chefs, restaurant empires have as much need for a great product as they do for spittoons and a separate ladies’ entrance. To see this new model in action, you need only study Nicoletta, the pizzeria opened in the East Village in June by the chef Michael White and his business partner, Ahmass Fakahany. It was already clear in March that Nicoletta was to be the first of several places rolled out from the same batch of dough. “We are developing distinct brands where we can open multiple restaurants, lowering costs as we go,” Mr. Fakahany told a reporter at the time as he explained how practices from his former career as a high-flying executive at Merrill Lynch were helping him wring extra profit from his restaurants. Nicoletta had been in the works for some time. In December, the two had filed a liquor license application for a corporation known as “Letta # 1 LLC,” a name that had been registered with the State of New York six months earlier. Marble tables were designed and fabricated, each with a spring-loaded socket in its top. The sockets can anchor pedestals that hold the pizzas several inches off the table. As for the product on the pedestal, apparently that could wait. About a week before the opening, by some reports, Mr. White was changing his pizza dough recipe almost day by day. He was talking about 12- and 16-inch pies cut in squares, in the style of his home state, Wisconsin. By the time hosts in Nicoletta T-shirts were stationed out on the sidewalk with clipboards to manage the people willing to wait 90 minutes or more for a table, pies were being cut into the usual wedges, and the 16-inch pizza was history. As it turns out, even the smaller size may be too much. The servers will tell you that it feeds two people. That may be true if both people are running a marathon the next morning. I was never able to finish one, even with two or three hungry assistants at the table. Some of this is because of sheer mass. Nicoletta’s pizzas are not quite deep dish, but they are heading in that direction. The crust is as strong as epoxy, and Mr. White piles it up with an abundance of toppings that would buckle an ordinary pie. In thickness and heft, a Nicoletta pizza resembles the September issue of Vogue. There was another reason my table never finished an entire pizza: we lost interest. The style of pizza Mr. White is pursuing emphasizes gut-stretching abundance over flavor. The pies are overburdened conglomerations of cheese, flour and fistfuls of other stuff; in the end, the elements cancel one another out. In the Fior di Zucca, zucchini blossoms and watery shredded zucchini were completely engulfed by an ankle-deep carpet of melted mozzarella. It was a vegetable pizza for people who hate vegetables. Not that the addition of undercooked Nueske’s bacon brought much relief to the bleak expanse of starch created by the layer of smashed potatoes on top of the Patatona. Other combinations were more promising, like the Calabrese, with excellent fennel sausage and curly divots of spicy pepperoni, or the Carbonara, the pasta classic reimagined in pizza form. But that great shelf of crust deadens the taste of any ingredient that gets near it. Mr. White has said he engineered the dough to stand up to the rigors of delivery and reheating with no loss of quality. In that, at least, he has succeeded. Warmed up a day or two later, a Nicoletta crust is just as stiff and bland as when it was fresh from the oven. Pizza hunters with long memories will recall another pizzeria founded by an acclaimed chef whose pizza was met, at first, with skepticism. A decade ago, Mario Batali’s Otto opened with pizzas that were griddled, not baked. At first, they were not encouraging. The dough was tweaked and tweaked again, but in the meantime you could have a wonderful time at Otto without eating a single slice. The menu offered many other diversions, including full-flavored vegetables, robust pastas, a wine list built for Italy-hopping, and Meredith Kurtzman’s array of gelati, which won cult status and deserved it. Nicoletta has a far less elaborate gelato menu than Otto’s. There is only one flavor, a house-made vanilla soft serve called fior di latte, but it was consistently the high point of my meals. Creamy and easygoing, it never failed to make me smile, whether topped with amarena cherries, drizzled with blueberry limoncello or left undecorated. Nicoletta would be a pleasant place to stop for ice cream if only the staff didn’t seem to expect you to order some of the other food first. But they do, and it’s not an uplifting experience, even if you steady yourself with a glass of red wine poured too cold from a tap. The pizzas, at least, don’t resemble anything else in New York. The salad recipes might have been nabbed from that corner trattoria you stopped going to a few years ago. There is the Nicoletta, with lettuce, red endive and a sliver of focaccia smeared with goat cheese. Or the insalata mare with clams, mussels, squid and octopus, all as tender as an extension cord, all bathed in a dressing that had no effect on any of it. The snacks and appetizers can have an off-the-rack quality as well. Tender as the meatballs were, is the city really suffering from a shortage? Nice surprises did pop up now and again, like the suppli fortified with ragù and the cucumbers pickled in white balsamic vinegar that were good enough to sell by the jar. But on the whole, what is striking about Nicoletta is how little evidence it gives of Mr. White’s prodigious talent for cooking Italian food that can make you dizzy with pleasure. He has overseen five restaurants that were awarded three stars in The New York Times: Fiamma, Alto, Convivio, Marea and Ai Fiori. (The last two are still open.) After a run like that, it must have been tempting to think that great pizza would materialize on command. So far, it hasn’t worked out that way.",Cucumbers in white balsamic vinegar; ice cream.

If green zebra tomatoes and white nectarines are the romantic leads, the part of okra is a cameo played by Willem Dafoe. For those wise to its unconventional charms, though, even an okra cameo can be memorable. That was the case the other night at Reynard, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. I was eating an excellent piece of wahoo, which the kitchen treated as something like a cross between swordfish and albacore, grilling it to medium rare and slicing it into generous slabs. Beside it was the kind of salad you could eat all summer long: cool faro and bulgur, green herbs, agreeably sugary tomatoes and long green spears that I mistook at first for green beans. In fact, they were young okra pods halved lengthwise and quickly tossed on a searing grill. Okra holds its own under forceful heat, while a meek flame will melt it into a swamp of goo. This heat, and this okra, had something extra: a fleck of char and a lick of smoke from a wood fire. This treatment may not turn okra into a box-office draw, but it was still pretty cool, in a Dafoe kind of way. It also showed off what’s best about Reynard, where nearly everything that comes out of the kitchen is chosen by hand and cooked with firewood. Chosen by hand means that the chef, Sean Rembold, has a farmer who will pick baby okra pods when they’re the size of an AAA battery. He has a fishmonger who can deliver bluefish yanked from the sea so recently, it can be served ceviche-style with smoked crème fraîche. Mr. Rembold may have a forager, or he may just hang out in Williamsburg’s few remaining vacant lots, because one night he was serving milkweed leaves, as thick and soft as pappardelle. Reynard, which opened not long ago on the ground floor of the new Wythe Hotel in Williamsburg, can get a little “Portlandia” at times. Andrew Tarlow, who built the restaurant and is a partner in the hotel, carries a briefcase of leather tanned from the hide of a cow that once passed through his butcher shop, Marlow & Daughters. “We have relationships with everyone from our sheep farmers to our coffee roasters,” he told a reporter recently. One night, a server at Reynard said that the Mast Brothers had already been in. (“They sat at that table over there,” she said.) The Masts, two chocolate makers with Smith Brothers beards, may be more famous locally than the cast of “Girls.” I wondered whether any customers, on being informed that the elegantly composed layer cake is made with Mast Brothers chocolate, had ever asked, “Who?” “No.” You might be tempted to roll your eyes at how perfectly Reynard would fit into a novel about the Brooklyn dining scene until you remember that Mr. Tarlow helped write the book. In 1998, with a partner he had met waiting tables at the Odeon and a chef who had trained at Savoy, he took over a failed diner down the street from Peter Luger and renamed it Diner. Next came Marlow & Sons, where Mr. Rembold was the sous-chef and later, the chef. The restaurants helped a style of cooking that had started to seem not quite flashy enough for Manhattan — scruffy, devoutly local, indebted as much to Berkeley, Calif., as to France and Italy — establish itself as the common language of chefs from Greenpoint to Ditmas Park. Happily for him and for us, Mr. Rembold has something most of those chefs don’t. Reynard’s kitchen was built so that almost everything can be cooked with fire. Sit in the rear dining room, with its tiled floor and soaring raftered ceilings that make it look like the set of a play about Balthazar being staged in an abandoned factory, and you can see the rigs at work. If you keep a fishbowl-size grill on your fire escape, you may writhe in envy as you watch one cook working at tongs’ length from leaping flames on a grill as big as a coffee table and another stashing skillets at eye level inside a wood-burning oven. Reynard’s hoods must be powered by jet engines because you don’t smell smoke at your table until you get close to your food. Then you can’t miss it. You can savor the smoke in the round oven-roasted clams, oysters and mussels served, with their juices, over thin toast slices. You can appreciate the way it turns grilled leaves of romaine lettuce with bread crumbs into a Caesar salad that has a beguiling edge of char. It burrows all the way through a roasted duck breast, making every scrap of meat worth whittling away from the bones. Smoke even has its way with the dessert course. If you are one of those jaded creatures who has grown weary of tarte Tatin, then the grilled and caramelized peaches in the version here may revive you. One day the skill with which the kitchen handles fire may carry over to the rest of its work more reliably. I hope so, because several dishes missed their mark by mere inches. A melon salad came close to being a sweet ode to summer, but it turned sour thanks to sharp and briny pickled jalapeños. Croutons saturated by brown butter made an otherwise lovely main course of rock shrimp too rich to finish. And lobster with vanilla sauce lacked the confidence that was needed to resurrect this nouvelle cuisine landmark. Some of this can be attributed to the strain of changing the menu nearly every day. So can the servers’ occasional fogginess about just what, exactly, is on the plates. Their jobs might be easier if they didn’t have to memorize a catalog of unlisted specials, a pointless affectation from a place that prints the date at the top of the menu. (By day, when light filters through enormous windows, Reynard offers breakfast and lunch, with far fewer choices.) Diner and Marlow & Sons have their off nights, too, but somehow their small scale and obvious eccentricity conspire so that it hardly matters. Reynard feels more serious and self-conscious, as if trying to prove that Williamsburg has come of age. And yet Diner, circa 1998, could not have built a cellar of offbeat and affordable French wines as deep as the one Lee Campbell has built at Reynard, or found enough customers to drink them. Growing older does have compensations.",The menu changes too often for recommendations.
253,Atera,3 star,"July 17, 2012",Pete Wells,TriBeCa,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/dining/reviews/atera-in-tribeca.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/dining/reviews/atera-in-tribeca.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"MATTHEW LIGHTNER has funny ideas about snacks. That is his name for the flurry of little bites that kick off each of the tasting menus at Atera, the remarkable new countertop-dining restaurant in TriBeCa where Mr. Lightner is the chef. One of them looks like an engorged, rhinoceros-gray potato chip and tastes like something scraped off a rock. That’s what it turned out to be: lichen found in the woods near Bear Mountain, pulverized and reconstituted. Another night, there was a bitter and stringy clump of fried garlic roots, about as rewarding as eating a broom. A facsimile peanut made with foie gras and peanut butter wasn’t as good as an actual peanut, and a facsimile egg shaped from aioli wasn’t as good as an actual egg. After a few more such mouthfuls, I decided that, if I were ever invited to a Super Bowl party at Mr. Lightner’s house, I’d bring the guacamole. Yet, when snack time was over and the core of the menu began, something remarkable happened. A kitchen that had seemed willfully strange began to use strangeness as a key to unlock sensations and emotions. Irritation and bafflement yielded to a steady sense of wonder. Wonder is not on the menu at most restaurants in New York, nor is it much in demand in this relentlessly pragmatic city. Wylie Dufresne and Paul Liebrandt are among the small corps of chefs busy keeping Manhattan supplied with new inventions. But on the whole, novelty-seeking adventurers have looked to Spain, to Scandinavia, to Chicago and to northern California. Mr. Lightner opened Atera in March after winning a national reputation at Castagna in Portland, Ore., and cooking at Noma in Denmark and Mugaritz in the Basque Country, poking around in their cabinets of curiosities. He touched down in New York’s hermetic environment, trailing wild ideas from the West Coast and Europe like alien spores. With a counter perch at one of the 13 unexpectedly comfortable high chairs of soft leather (there are another five a few steps away, at a table beside a shaggy vertical garden), you watch the cooks bent over their work, silent and solemn. At this stage, there is not much cooking. Mostly they are arranging food on fresh hay, or moss, or slate, or polished wood, or smooth riverbed stones, or buffed lengths of bark. Nearly every arrangement ends with the tweezered application of oddball plants: glasswort, crunchy beach pea pods, violets, bright green tips of spruce branches, wisteria or black locust blossoms. Watching all of this unfold, some have portrayed Mr. Lightner as a woodsy forager come to town, Euell Gibbons on Worth Street. Others, remembering his liquid nitrogen and powdered gelling agents, have seen a geeky science-club member, giddy over his chemistry set. In truth, he is a little of each. One of his plates may hold a modernist bauble next to a specimen from the forest floor. At Atera, foraging and modernist techniques are two roads to the same destination. Whether he is fussing over a corsage of edible wildflowers or tinting a baguette with squid ink to fashion a copy of a razor clam, Mr. Lightner is opening our eyes again to how busy nature has been. He seems to be feeling his way toward an articulated, poetic response to the seasons that is something like a modern Western version of kaiseki. In Mr. Lightner’s hands, pear skin can be dried into a crinkly green leaf to drape over squab. Sunflower toffee can look like a peach pit, and chocolate truffle like a black walnut shell. In his eyes, there is beauty in homeliness. A charred lump of beet looked as if it had been left too long in a campfire by a distracted Boy Scout. Sliced open and displayed against a luxurious shellfish cream and trout roe, its flesh radiated a purple so deep it was almost black. And there can be contrast in sameness. With one dish he brought on a sudden whiteout: Atlantic halibut, poached in and sauced with whey, with camomile petals scattered on top and pickled garlic cloves here and there. You don’t see so many shades of white side by side unless you’re comparing paint chips. Mr. Lightner is his own pastry chef, and many of his desserts are spectacular. In late spring there were cookies mimicking oak leaves with spindly breadstick stems; July brought a white rose made of frozen rosewater. It glowed as if there were an LED encased inside it. “It’s beautiful,” I said involuntarily. In fact, Mr. Lightner may have more aptitude for desserts than savory courses; he is fascinated by sculpture and unafraid of prettiness. At the moment, too, he may be more adept at expressing his ideas through sight than taste. Careful to vary the look of each course, he does not always do the same with flavors and textures, sending out several dishes in a row with frozen or half-frozen elements, for instance. With many of the snacks, an urge to show off trumps a desire to please. That urge leads to a silly guessing game, in which one of the extremely polite and rather earnest servers challenges you to name the main ingredient in one dish. When I found out it was air-dried squid, I felt like a child who had just opened a gift-wrapped package of socks. Mr. Lightner may need time to sort out all of the ideas ricocheting around his head. (Amid the moss and fronds, the laboratory culture tubes used to dispense sauces stick out like a remnant from the early days of molecular gastronomy.) At times, his food can’t live up to its striking first impression. A lobe of sweetbreads was glazed in a savory hazelnut caramel that wasn’t really savory enough. Lumpfish roe in a sourdough slurry seemed to be aiming for a taramosalata effect, but it didn’t have the same briny pungency, and the fish eggs were distractingly grainy. The menu changes often enough, reservations are scarce enough, and the $150 price tag before tax, tip and drinks is daunting enough, that you’re unlikely to eat the same meal twice. But if you do, you’ll understand why magicians never repeat a trick. Atera could stand to serve a few more dishes whose flavors are thrilling enough to stand on their own once the novelty is gone. It is well on the way already with stunners like the beet ember, with its deeply pleasing interplay of earthy and oceanic flavors. Or, in a gentler but equally transfixing mode, the raw scallops cured in gin botanicals and then interwoven with shards of green-tomato ice. And a handful of wet, crisp green almonds with milk skin and fresh almond milk exhibited no trickery, just a sensitive and joyful celebration of an ingredient that is gone from the market almost before it arrives. Seasonal cooking has often meant a narrow devotion to simplicity. Mr. Lightner is chasing another path, a cuisine that uses this-week-only ingredients together with technical sleight of hand to summon up moments of genuine beauty. It doesn’t all come together yet, but it comes close enough that a night at Atera is now one of the most fascinating experiences you can have in a New York City restaurant.","Only one menu a night, but with advance notice the staff works around dietary restrictions."
254,Almayass,1 star,"July 10, 2012",Pete Wells,Flatiron,Middle Eastern,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/dining/reviews/almayass-in-manhattan-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/dining/reviews/almayass-in-manhattan-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ANY time a server in Manhattan informs you that “all our food is served family style,” you can be certain that the dining room will be notably free of actual families. Platters that might feed two children and their parents are more likely to languish before a herd of bachelors and bachelorettes, who will reflexively hoist forks to their mouths while getting drunk on cocktails invented by publicists. I found myself wondering where all the family restaurants have gone while spending time at Almayass, which opened this spring on East 21st Street, a few steps from the gang-grazing mess halls of lower Park Avenue. Every time I ate there I saw enormous tables covered with lemony hummus, yogurt-coated eggplant dolmas and canapés of spiced meats under quail’s-egg bull’s-eyes, and at least one of those tables would be swarmed by a large clan, from grandparents to their children to their children’s tiny infants taking a turn on one shoulder after another. This was unusual enough in that part of town; still more striking was that whenever a baby vocalized some urgent complaint, there were no grimaces of infanticidal rage at the other tables. Or on the faces of the people working there, several of them members of the Alexandrian family. Rita and Shant Alexandrian, the children of Armenians who fled the 1915 purge and later settled in Lebanon, operate the original Almayass in Beirut and its spinoffs in Kuwait, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Qatar, all of them with Armenian-Lebanese menus shaped by their family history. In fact, family values set the tone for the whole experience of eating at Almayass. At times that is refreshing; occasionally, like one’s own family, it can drive you slightly bananas. One waiter, for instance, played the overbearing uncle. When we asked for suggestions, he wrote down what he thought we should eat. It took some haggling to replace any of his selections with one of our own. Another reminded us of the kind of shiftless cousin who never stays focused. He seemed to forget we were there for vast periods of time. When we had all finished the initial pours of a bottle of white Chateau Musar, one man at our table flagged him down to ask for a refill. The waiter emptied the bottle into his glass, filling it almost to the brim, as the rest of us stared. Although I never determined which servers were related and which were merely in the wrong line of work, there were moments at Almayass when I understood why there are laws against nepotism. Yet sooner or later the table would be spread with food, and sometimes that is enough, especially when the flavors are ones you don’t taste every day. That’s definitely the case at Almayass, where the Alexandrians punch up Lebanese dishes with Armenian accents like lemony grains of crushed red sumac berries and flecks of Aleppo pepper that offer more robust flavor than fiery heat. The restaurant even stages a Manhattan comeback for some Armenian classics. Another question: Where have Armenian restaurants gone? A fixture of the city’s dining scene 50 years ago, they had all but vanished by the end of the last century. Ever since, certain New Yorkers have nursed longings for subereg, a labor-intensive lasagna variant, and basterma, considered by some cured-meat connoisseurs the highest form to which pastrami can aspire. Both desires can be requited at Almayass. One woman at my table hadn’t tasted subereg since the death of an Armenian aunt who was educated in a French convent in Istanbul; she pronounced Almayass’s exquisitely tender and subtle version “right,” if not quite as good as the suberegs of her memories. The tangy and peppery basterma made a strong case for the Armenian charcuterie canon. So did an intense beef salami called soujuk, especially the version topped with sliced lemon and ground sumac, doused with arrack and set on fire at tableside. An Armenian bulgur salad named Itch (how it must hate its parents for that), with chopped herbs and tomatoes, had a red-pepper glow that kept luring me back, once the chill of the refrigerator had worn off. The bulk of the cooking, though, is Lebanese, ranging from terrific dips to less terrific kebabs. Meats and seafood at Almayass tended to be overcooked; grilled prawns one night were so tough that I sliced them with effort and swallowed them with regret. I found only one main course that I truly enjoyed, broiled lamb chops that you pick up by their ribs so you can swab them in a secret Almayass sauce that seems to go into nearly everything, but tasted especially welcome here. The hunting was happier among the small dishes. The salads, like green olives dressed with a spicy tomato sauce and lemon juice, tasted radiant, a Levantine beach-side afternoon beamed down to Flatiron. I would have happily eaten a fistful of the kebbe sajieh, fried pockets of beef and bulgur kneaded together and stuffed with walnuts and pistachios. And while the pita had no charm, that mattered less when it was dunked into dips like the lemony charred eggplant mash called moutabbal; its cousin, moutabbal Almayass, made with beets and tahini; and the mouhammara, a rust-colored paste of walnuts and red pepper that gets its sweet-sour shuffle from pomegranate molasses. Parties of eight or more, and not just multigenerational families, seem drawn to Almayass. In part this is because ordering for that many people lessens the impact of the occasional rogue kebab. (In small-plates restaurants as in insurance, the larger the participating group, the lower the risk to the individual.) But these big tables may also be responding to some kind of secret signal of hospitality sent out by the unmistakably family-run restaurant. One Alexandrian sister, Siran, designed the menus, with their covers of inlaid wood; another, Alidz, watches over the dining room with Varak, her brother; their mother, Rita, chose the sculpture of blue-glass flowers on wire stems and other works by Armenian artists around the interior. Almayass can be frustrating and deeply idiosyncratic at times, but it always feels personal. The Armenian restaurant scene, it turns out, went west, to greater Los Angeles. As for family restaurants, they thrive in the outer boroughs, exiled by the forces of real estate. When somebody dares to open one in Manhattan now, it’s worth marking the event. I’d recommend celebrating with a plate or two of flaming soujuk.",Fattoush; spicy olive salad; moutabbal; moutabbal Almayass; itch; mouhammara; dolma with yogurt; kebbe sajieh; soujuk flambée; lamb chops. 
255,Hill Country Barbecue Market,2 star,"July 3, 2012",Pete Wells,Midtown South,Barbecue,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/dining/reviews/hill-country-barbecue-market-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/dining/reviews/hill-country-barbecue-market-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IN the line of duty, I’ve eaten food served on a curl of bark, food served on a slate shingle, food served on the end of a wire, food served in an antique silver caviar caddy and food served in a box of rocks. But for sheer power to send ripples of anticipation through the pit of my belly, none of those vehicles beat the greasy butcher paper at Hill Country Barbecue Market. Whenever I eat at this restaurant on West 26th Street, I head for the meat counter and ask for a pound of moist brisket. If a pound strikes you as too much, then you haven’t had Hill Country’s moist brisket. A counter worker with a long knife tears off a sheet of brown paper and proceeds to bury it under slabs of meat. Beef ribs, too, yes, and some jalapeño-cheese sausages. A couple of those, please. Let’s make it three. When I stop at last, the counter worker grabs the ends of the butcher paper and scrunches them to form a basket filled with smoked meat and serpentine wisps of steam. I carry that basket to my table and set it down in front of my friends, casual as can be. They look amazed, and if they don’t, I rethink the friendship. At the table, the paper is flattened into a communal plate, and I cover one patch of it with seasoned salt. Pink from cayenne and spotted with black pepper grains, the salt goes with brisket better than barbecue sauce. Paper, meat, salt: by now my stomach is in a riot and I am sure I should have ordered two pounds of brisket. Moist brisket on greasy paper is not the only reason to eat at Hill Country, but it’s a convincing one. The term “moist brisket” is the restaurant’s euphemism for the deckle and tip of the brisket, upholstered in fat that will slowly render and baste the meat during the 13 or 14 hours it spends in the smoker. Carved just before serving, the meat is juicy throughout, but the parts that really get me going are the blackened edges that give way to a mahogany-tinted quarter-inch or so of smoky borderland between crust and interior. The moist brisket, along with the beef and pork ribs that carry a similarly peppery, crunchy top layer, show Hill Country’s rotisserie barbecue pits at their finest. The restaurant is a state-of-the-art Manhattan homage to the preindustrial craft of Texas barbecue, particularly as it is practiced in the town of Lockhart. The flavors Hill Country achieves in its pits are not precisely the ones I remember from meals at Lockhart’s legendary rivals, Smitty’s Market and Kreuz Market. At both places, the smoke was deeply entrenched in the meat. Despite burning about 1,500 pounds a week of post oak shipped in from Texas, Hill Country doesn’t produce that kind of deeply smoky barbecue. It produces very slowly roasted meat with an echo of campfire around the edges. The low smoke quotient makes a spongy, beige pork chop a disappointment, and leaves the market chicken just another slightly dry rotisserie bird. But it does no harm to the prime rib and the beef shoulder. They may not be great Texas-style barbecue, but they are still terrific slabs of roast beef, cooked medium-rare through and through and ringed with that salt-and-pepper crust. And the jalapeño-cheese links, shipped to Manhattan by Kreuz Market, are always full flavored and insistently spicy, though their juiciness varies from day to day. When Hill Country opened, five years ago last month, it joined a wave of new restaurants that tried to coax more smoke into barbecue than had seemed possible on the tightly regulated shores of the East River. In a glowing $25 and Under column in 2007, the last time Hill Country was reviewed in The New York Times, Peter Meehan focused on the meat, especially the brisket. “No other barbecue place that has opened in New York in recent years has gotten it so right, right out of the gate,” he wrote. Since then, Hill Country’s other virtues have become easier to notice, or harder to ignore. Year after year I am drawn back to the dessert case for another plastic cup of banana pudding, built upon a custard so thick with eggs and cream it brings Paris to mind, and not the one in Texas. And as New York has become cluttered with strenuously playful cupcakes, few make me smile as easily as the one at Hill Country that is filled with grape jelly and frosted with a fluffy turban of peanut butter. According to hard-liners, the only permissible side dishes with barbecue are white bread and saltines. Anything else is as out of place as a yuzu macaron. Hill Country takes a more liberal point of view, thankfully. When I can afford to surrender the stomach space, I will have some peppery corn pudding, which has roughly the same relationship to an ear of corn that an ice cream sundae has to a cow. And I am always grateful for the relief provided by crunchy, sparingly dressed coleslaw and a vinegary salad of black-eyed peas. None of these dishes look like restaurant food; they seem like things packed for a church picnic by the best cook in town. The cook in this case, or at least the one whose recipes the kitchen follows, is the restaurant’s executive chef, Elizabeth Karmel. Named in her honor, EAK’s Bowl of Red is a ground-beef chili that could be a meal in itself, although it’s soupy enough that I wish Hill Country really did serve it in a bowl rather than in the same paper cartons used for all the sides. In Texas, much of the atmosphere of a barbecue joint is provided by the employees and the customers. Since shipping live Texans across state lines can be complicated, Hill Country’s owner, Marc Glosserman, bought inanimate objects like battered butcher blocks, salvaged floorboards and an old Blue Bell ice cream freezer. All this may be mistaken for the set dressing a big chain might use, but no chain would play Ray Wylie Hubbard and Reckless Kelly, or hire bartenders who mouth the lyrics as they tuck their bottle openers into the back pockets of their jeans. Hill Country may not be the real thing. But it plays the part better than anybody else in town.",Moist brisket; beef ribs; pork ribs; jalapeño and cheese sausage; corn pudding; chili; banana pudding; peanut butter and jelly cupcake. 
256,The NoMad,3 star,"June 19, 2012",Pete Wells,NoMad,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/dining/reviews/the-nomad-in-new-york.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/dining/reviews/the-nomad-in-new-york.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"CREATIVE people should never explain their process to anyone except their biographers, who care, and their spouses, who have to listen. The rest of us ought to be left guessing. It’s difficult, for instance, to give your full attention to a meal at the NoMad once you have read the interviews in which Daniel Humm and Will Guidara, its ambitious young operators, talk about modeling the restaurant on the Rolling Stones. They went through a branding exercise, writing down words that defined the band (loose, alive, genuine, deliberate) and molding the restaurant’s identity around them. Those words hang on a kitchen wall, not far from the enormous photo of Mick Jagger onstage, one leg goose-stepped up to microphone level. Once you know all this, you keep looking around the NoMad’s cluster of small, grandiose dining rooms thinking, “If this is supposed to be a night with Mick and Keith, why am I eating dinner at 5:30, and where are the police?” True, there’s an absinthe-fortified martini, the Turf Cocktail, that could easily become a habit, but it’s probably not the kind described in “Sister Morphine.” And while the thin women at the next table have a seen-it-all air, I doubt they have anything to teach Anita Pallenberg. If the “Sticky Fingers” flashbacks are distracting to me, though, they seem to have been liberating to Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara. They run Eleven Madison Park, a restaurant that rose from the middling ranks, and kept rising, and finally soared into world-class status. With a chance to do a second, larger, more populist restaurant inside the NoMad Hotel, they could have taken the well-traveled route with a bistro or trattoria. You know the model: steak frites or pasta with skillful knife work and tricky garnishes to prove the chef’s fine-dining bona fides. Instead, they have done something rather novel and wonderful. The NoMad takes recipes developed in Mr. Humm’s kitchen at Eleven Madison Park and translates them into a more open and generous style. Dishes fastidiously set in place by surgical tweezers to create the intimacy, delicacy and artfulness expected in a $125 four-course menu have been simplified, painted with broader strokes in a more relaxed hand that suits à la carte dining. At Eleven Madison Park, which earned four stars from The New York Times in a 2009 review by Frank Bruni, Mr. Humm concentrates and compresses suckling pig for about eight hours until it holds more flavor than any one piece of meat should be able to contain. It is the enriched plutonium of pork. In its best-known version, the suckling pig and its garnishes are arranged like two exclamation points running beneath a thin green line of baby leeks. Vast stretches of the white plate are left vacant. The NoMad serves suckling pig, too, but it is at the center of the plate, with pickled mustard seeds spooned over it and a crown of dandelion leaves resting around it. The dish is vastly easier to produce, no doubt, and does not scream, “Take my picture” quite as insistently. But it still looks grand and (let’s get to what really matters here) it offers a new way to consume enriched plutonium of pork. Lobster, which Mr. Humm prepares expertly and with never-ending variety at his flagship, was on the NoMad menu recently as lobster minestrone — with tomatoes, string beans, peas and quills of handmade garganelli in a light broth. Duck is here, too: not the whole roasted bird glazed with lavender honey and then carved tableside, but flat slices of the breast, with pickled juniper berries and scrolls of shaved pickled peaches. Color is splashed around with retina-filling gusto in Mr. Humm’s kitchen. A salad of strawberries, raspberries and roasted beets was supersaturated with ruby and garnet. Snap peas, cherry tomatoes, carrots in two shades and cauliflower in three are planted upright in a dish of shiny ice pebbles, the crudités tray treated as a botanical garden. And rarely have radish greens made the visual impact they have when left on the ends of red radishes enrobed in a thin shell of butter, like strawberries dipped in white chocolate. The colors, and much of the NoMad’s flavor, result from the creative deployment of vegetables practiced by Mr. Humm and his chef de cuisine, Abram Bissell. But if you have heard anything at all about the NoMad, you know that its signature dish is a roast chicken for two accessorized only by white asparagus and the smallest swipe of potato purée. Upstaged by the duck at Eleven Madison Park, here the chicken is the uncontested prima donna, and heads swivel when it goes by. Under a skin of lacquered brown the color of a loaf of challah lies a stuffing of brioche with foie gras and truffles. It is a dish from another era, when chicken breast was still seen as a worthy canvas for great chefs. Taste it and you know why. This is white meat for sybarites. On the side is a fricassee of the dark meat with morels, almost an afterthought. If served at a dark no-reservations tavern in the Village, it would be enough to put the place on the map. When things can go so right, you notice when they go even a little wrong, as they did with a slow-cooked halibut that was slightly squeaky and verging on dry in parts. Grated horseradish somehow didn’t lend raw hamachi the extra savor it needed, and while a finger-scorching loaf of bread topped with zucchini was irresistible on one occasion, on two others it was unpleasantly sticky on the inside. But these are minor demerits for a kitchen that takes on as much as the NoMad’s (besides tending to the restaurant’s 120 seats, it also cooks for room service). At times the operation’s scale seems to strain the dining room staff, too. Menus and empty glasses can linger on the table, and a plate of five excellent cheeses (made in Switzerland, like Mr. Humm) arrived at the table with no introduction; we had to ask which was which. Mr. Guidara, who oversees the dining room, has imported some talent from Eleven Madison, and you can still feel the difference between the veterans and the new hires. With time, that should change, and the servers might even start to have fun. The restaurant wants everybody to have a good time, yet curiously nobody seems quite sure how to go about it. The music has the forced energy whipped up by D.J.s trying to draw too-sober guests to the dance floor: Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin and, of course, the Rolling Stones, in up-tempo numbers, as if Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara wanted to host a class reunion for baby boomers. The restaurant’s designer, Jacques Garcia, has built a series of rooms that try to evoke a belle epoque house, with rich fabrics, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, framed herb fronds and a glittering bar held up by carved mahogany elephants. It’s fancy without being elegant, and slightly decadent without being particularly interesting. It needs a little mystery and some more-attractive upholstery. But while the NoMad seeks its tone, there are so many reasons for patience. The selection of cocktails, an entire fleet, is surely one of the best in the city, down to a cooling and alcohol-free fennel-basil soda. There is the crazily smooth torchon of foie gras wrapped around a rough bull’s-eye of pig’s head pâté. And the pastry chef, Mark Welker, has a dessert called Milk and Honey that takes two simple flavors surprisingly far. If the only way to conjure these pleasures was to summon the Stones on a Ouija board, that’s all right. The muse doesn’t always come looking for us. Sometimes, we have to build a trap.",Tagliatelle with crab; foie gras torchon; suckling pig; roast chicken for two; milk and honey dessert.
257,Hakkasan New York,1 star,"June 12, 2012",Pete Wells,Clinton,"Chinese, Dim Sum",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/13/dining/reviews/hakkasan-new-york-in-midtown.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/13/dining/reviews/hakkasan-new-york-in-midtown.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"AT first, a hostile takeover did not appear to be the best solution to the problems of Hakkasan, the multimillion-dollar exercise in Orientalism one block off Times Square. Protesting in the streets seemed like a more promising approach. It wouldn’t be hard to muster a mob of New Yorkers outraged by a restaurant that asks $48 for grilled Chilean sea bass or wok-fried lamb chops. After a few days of pickets out front, Hakkasan would cave and drop its lunatic prices. At the very least, it might apologize for tacking an extra $3.50 for a small bowl of rice onto the check of customers who are already paying around $50 for a main course, plus a bruising markup on the wine. But while I was writing protest chants (“We like to eat/fried rice and such/but Hakkasan charges/much too much”), I began to see that the idea was flawed. People might conclude that the problem with Hakkasan is that its prices are too high, and that’s not right. The real problem is that its prices are too high for extremely restrained portions of food that is, in too many cases, about as interesting as a box of paper clips. It’s not all dull. What I remember most vividly about my meals are some truly outstanding dim sum items, including first-rate steamed dumplings; a soft-shell crab with curry leaves and a tangle of crunchy egg-yolk threads; a tender and nuanced bite of lobster with XO sauce; and the dizziness and shortness of breath I felt whenever I tried to understand where the money had gone. Some of it, no doubt, helps pay for the spectacular interior. The restaurant is part of a big expansion paid for by the Abu Dhabi-based investment company that now owns the Hakkasan brand, with seven locations around the world. At its first Manhattan restaurant, the 11,000-square-foot dining room has been diced into small chambers separated by silk-embroidered banquettes, walls of white Carrara marble and carved Chinese screens. Following the custom for intensively designed Asian restaurants, the lights grow dimmer and the music gets louder and untz-untz-untzier as the night goes on. One evening before darkness had descended, I sat with a view of the kitchen, and what I saw made me suspect that Hakkasan has the crew and the equipment to be the greatest Chinese restaurant in New York. There behind the screen was a squadron of woks blasted by flames that looked hot enough to refine steel. Each one was being tended by a white-jacketed cook, and each cook had the focus of a cobra. If you were in a cooking competition and this gang was the other team, you’d take one look and think, “It’s over.” You wouldn’t stand a chance against people who can make crystal dumplings as good as Hakkasan’s, the meaty brown morels pressed right up against the see-through wrappers. Some other dim sum items (under the awkward name “Small Eat”) were just as expertly done, like the lovely shrimp and Chinese chive dumplings, green-edged ovals dotted with a red goji berry. The texture of the rice noodle slipped around Wagyu beef was superb, as was the tender steamed bun stuffed with meaty red char siu. Tiny pumpkin-duck puffs, in the shape of pumpkins with leaves of borage cress, looked as if they were made for a dollhouse vegetable patch. I would have adopted them if they hadn’t been so delicious. The dim sum is, in fact, the best reason to eat at Hakkasan, particularly if you go for lunch or brunch, when the selection is greatest. (At any hour, though, it’s best to avoid the oily XO seafood puff and the ridiculous foie gras shrimp toast, a waste of perfectly good gavage.) Just don’t think of going if you balk at paying more than $3 a dumpling, or indeed if you demand any kind of rational correlation between price and product. In the rest of the menu, though, the kitchen pours its considerable skills into dishes that only occasionally rise above the ordinary. Little squares of pipa duck under a crackling shell of skin were good enough to make me wish that a $39 serving brought more than 10 pieces, each the size of a tea bag. But silky house-made tofu was misspent on a weird curry-and-black-pepper-flavored custard that traveled under the name “mabo tofu.” The crisp honey-toned skin on something called spicy roast ma la chicken was truly admirable, but the chicken meat itself was characterless, cast adrift without either the Sichuan peppercorn buzz (ma) or the chile-pepper burn (la) that the name promised. Disconnects like this are so common that you wonder if the person who wrote Hakkasan’s menu has ever met the chef. Anything described as spicy was sure to be as mild as cream cheese. Run-of-the-mill udon noodles with duck had no trace of the advertised XO sauce. Nothing I tasted at Hakkasan was unpleasant, but when the check easily surpassed $100 a person, it was hard not to feel cheated. It was like buying scalped tickets to see Anna Netrebko at the Met and then finding out that she would be performing the Katy Perry songbook. Sheer frustration finally put the idea of a takeover into my head. If a great restaurant was trapped somewhere inside Hakkasan, why not set it free? An elite crew of zealous Chinese-food fanatics should be able to pull it off. I can’t imagine that the smiling women in red Diane von Furstenberg dresses at the front podium would put up much of a fight, especially once they saw that we came as liberators. First, we would tell the cooks to make the food in their hearts instead of the lackluster recipes that somebody in the management company apparently believes non-Chinese people like. Unfortunately, we wouldn’t be able to drop the prices at first, at least not until we had reimbursed the owners for confiscating their restaurant. But once we had done that — I foresee a very amicable transaction, after which we would all share a plate or two of the braised abalone with truffles, having a good laugh over the $888 price tag — we could let gravity take over. If you’re with me, let’s meet outside the restaurant at 6 tonight. Oh, and somebody please bring some good music. The stuff they play at Hakkasan at night now — it’s enough to put crazy ideas in your head.",Steamed dumplings; crispy duck salad; fried soft-shell crab; lobster with mushrooms in XO sauce; pipa duck; Hakka spicy seafood fried rice.
258,Neta,2 star,"June 5, 2012",Pete Wells,Greenwich Village,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-neta-in-greenwich-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-neta-in-greenwich-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"EVEN by the spartan standards of sushi bars, the interior of Neta, on West Eighth Street, is defiantly plain. The walls are covered in a nubby material that makes them look like bulletin boards in a corporate cafeteria. They’re even dotted with pushpin-size holes, as if somebody had taken down the Man With a Van fliers just before unlocking the doors at 5 p.m. The best view in the house is from one of the 20 seats at the long maple counter, and even then you face a kitchen in floor-to-ceiling stainless steel where eight or so cooks in white caps silently go about their business. There are diners on Route 4 in New Jersey that give you more to look at. Soon it won’t matter. In the presence of unusually well-made sushi, a kind of tunnel vision sets in. Anything else in the room might as well be invisible as the world narrows down to a gleam of fish on a finger of rice in a tight circle of light. Since sushi good enough to bring on this malady can cost serious money, most of us do not suffer from it very often. It’s been my good fortune to have been afflicted several times recently at Neta. You won’t notice the walls when you have before you a piece of sea urchin roe on a cylinder of rice wrapped in nori. The tail end of the nori isn’t rolled tight but instead juts out like the short length of film that you used to feed into cameras. It unwraps itself inside your mouth. You have just enough time to notice how each grain of rice stands out from the rest, to enjoy how boldly the rice has been seasoned with vinegar and salt, before the mouth-filling taste of the sea urchin takes over. Now here in front of you is toro in a milky shade of pink. It will melt on your tongue; it is nearly melting already, sprawled across its bed of rice. Here is some marvelous sashimi of orange clam, expertly sliced for maximum tenderness. And now a piece of hamachi under a frizz of spiced and fried potato threads. Neta is a collaboration of two longtime disciples of the sushi master Masa Takayama. Nick Kim helped Mr. Takayama open Masa in 2004, and stayed on as head chef until 2010. His partner, Jimmy Lau, was head chef at Bar Masa in New York and the one in Las Vegas. In other words, these two know how to order prized Japanese species from Tsukiji market in Tokyo. Such exotic items are rarely seen at Neta. In part, this reflects the chefs’ interest in what Mr. Kim has called “Japanese food with local ingredients,” like stunning scallops from Massachusetts and mugwort foraged in Central Park. Yet their locavore sect allows salmon from Scotland and bluefin tuna from Spain. In an interview, Mr. Kim gave another reason the menu is fairly conservative: they weren’t sure yet how far their customers would go. At the moment, they keep off-the-menu esoterica like blowfish for regulars who want to go beyond the entry-level offerings. Neta will be an even more exciting and confident restaurant when the chefs have learned to trust their customers. In the meantime, it has compensatory pleasures. One of the biggest (and stop that laughing) is vegetable sushi. Had a friend with a fish allergy not told me that she’d eaten an extremely satisfying vegetarian dinner at Neta, I might have read that section of the menu with as much attention as I give to sponsored posts on Twitter. Curious, I tried grilled shiitake caps pressed around rice, a lotus root roll with minty shiso and another roll of asparagus tempura. They were some of the purest vegetable preparations I’ve tasted all spring. If your heart does not dance to the rhythms of mushroom sushi, then by all means proceed directly to the small hot and cold dishes. Grilled sea scallop is sent out on its shell with butter seasoned with garlic and soy as its sauce, dots of sea urchin as condiment and a lime wedge as garnish. The recipe would be wonderful with any good scallop. The chefs at Neta use one that has been severed from its shell an instant before grilling, a level of freshness that will keep this dish in my mind for a very long time. Fluke and shrimp rolled up inside a translucent sheet of daikon, another small dish, looked alluring, but was wrapped so tightly its flavors never emerged. This, though, was an anomaly in a kitchen with such a gentle touch that the food often seems to be held together by nothing more than the chef’s will. Chopped salmon with Sichuan peppercorn oil is set on a plank of rice so delicate it’s ready to take flight, and curls of shaved bonito on top flutter like wings trying to help it achieve liftoff. Duck skin, duck meat and foie gras brushed with hoisin sauce were stowed inside a half-pipe of cucumber carved so thin it resembled a single layer of leek. This is one of the ideas the chefs packed with their sushi knives when they left Masa, where a similar cucumber dugout is used for eel. Another Masa touch is the cocktail glass filled with toro tartare and caviar. You spread the tuna belly and the sturgeon roe on lightly grilled white bread, a bite at a time. It is alarmingly easy to eat, the only difficulty being the need to make sure you run out of bread early so you can eat the last bites of toro and caviar straight off the spoon. This transporting dish is typically included in Neta’s $135 omakase menu, but not on the $95 version. On its own, it is $48, the costliest item on the menu by far. Even if you forgo that particular frill, a meal at Neta can still tear a small hole in your pocket. Of course, you can tell yourself that you just saved hundreds of dollars by not eating at Masa. Neta is more American than Masa, and the chefs aren’t above hybrid concoctions like a spicy tuna roll. (It’s good, too.) I did miss the more Japanese communication style of traditional sushi bars, where an entire meal can be conducted with nods, smiles and lifted eyebrows. Service at Neta can lean a bit too far in the how-are-you-enjoying-the-mackerel-tataki direction. But I can’t complain about that, because the answer was always the same, whether the question concerned the mackerel or almost anything else: very much, thank you. I enjoyed it very much.",Omakase menus; seasonal rice; Neta spicy salmon; duck and foie gras;grilled whole scallop; vegetable sushi and rolls. 
259,Le Bernardin,4 star,"May 22, 2012",Pete Wells,Midtown,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/dining/reviews/le-bernardin-in-midtown-manhattan.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/dining/reviews/le-bernardin-in-midtown-manhattan.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ERIC RIPERT has been the executive chef of Le Bernardin for 18 years, and people sometimes ask him if he gets tired of cooking fish. Clearly these people have never eaten at Le Bernardin. No other restaurant in the city makes the simple cooking of fish (and the fish at Le Bernardin is cooked simply, when it is cooked at all) seem so ripe with opportunities for excitement. Some of the thrills are the hushed kind, like the way black garlic, pomegranate and lime support the crisp skin and white flesh of sautéed black bass. Others are scene-stealers, as when a white slab of steamed halibut is slowly surrounded by a crimson pool of beet sauce that, with crème fraîche stirred in, will turn the delirious pink of summer borscht. A few are flat-out luxurious, like a small boulder of caviar nested inside a heap of sea urchin on a carpet of little gnocchi. I blinked my eyes a few times at the $70 supplement on top of the $125 set price for four courses at dinner. Then I decided not to worry, because a chance like this might not come along again. A year from now the sea urchin and caviar, along with almost everything else on a menu of nearly 40 items, may well have made way for a new crop of thrills. For a restaurant so determined to stay on top, keeping such a deep repertory and refreshing it so often would seem to be a risk. It is also, of course, one source of its enduring success. Le Bernardin’s four-star rating in The New York Times has been confirmed every time the restaurant has been assessed, from 1986, when it opened, through 2005, when Frank Bruni wrote its most recent review. Why wait to say it: today I fall in line, happily, with my predecessors. Not that I am reviewing the same restaurant, exactly. Under the relentless guidance of Mr. Ripert and Maguy LeCoze, his partner in the business, Le Bernardin moves forward without a pause. To rest for a minute might mean growing old. Change, typically gradual, came in a rush last summer, when the interior was given a shake-up by the architecture firm Bentel & Bentel. The old dining room was always compared to a corporate boardroom, but for some reason its monumental scale and profusion of framed canvases in an antiquated style made me think of the atrium of a minor art museum. That’s all different now, starting with the art. Now, just one enormous painting of a brooding sea, “Deep Water No. 1” by Ran Ortner, looms over the space, imparting a sense of motion and immediacy. Wavy blades of twisted aluminum ripple like reeds along another wall. Opposite are shimmering, swaying curtains woven from vines and aluminum fibers. This room may never be sexy, exactly, but now it has a suggestive invitation in its eye. The downside of the redesign, however, is the removal of a good number of tables for two. Just as the restaurant has worked up a little romance, couples have a harder time getting reservations. The sleepy little bar was remodeled, too, and is now a sleek leather-and-steel lounge. Cocktails, when appropriate, come with a stainless-steel swizzle stick, not (please pound your fist on the bar along with me) a cheap plastic straw. The lounge is also something like Branson, Mo., for Le Bernardin’s greatest hits, bringing back from retirement classics like the irresistible smoked-salmon croque monsieur overflowing with caviar. The full menu is available, though I can’t imagine perching on a tuffet not much higher than a footstool to eat a $125 dinner. One French Connection cocktail and a brioche filled with warm truffled lobster, and I’d be ready to move along. Comfort, though, may not be the point. Simply having a lounge at all gives the entire restaurant a pulse that was missing before. The achievement of Bentel & Bentel’s design is that the interior now walks in step with Le Bernardin’s cuisine. Both are up-to-date, lively, intimate and playful. A corporate boardroom is no place for Laurie Jon Moran’s elegantly disassembled desserts, for instance. Mr. Moran’s plates are a bit busier than those of the last pastry chef, Michael Laiskonis, who left late last year, but the flavors quickly and agreeably reassemble themselves as you eat. And a museum is no place for the muscular sancocho sauce served with lacquered grouper, or more recently with striped bass. Inspired by the Puerto Rican stew, the sancocho is enveloping and warming, made from oxtails and chicken, with a low current of heat. The fish is treated like meat and likes it. Another attempt at the same treatment perplexed me: Dover sole in a red wine and cassis sauce the color of grape chewing gum. Out of more than two dozen I tasted, this was the only dish that didn’t come together for me. And at each meal just one minor detail struck me as not quite keeping up with the rest: the breads, which are outclassed at a number of places around town. Mr. Ripert has been stocking up on ingredients from Asia for years now, but somehow he makes the whole enterprise feel new. Sliced geoduck set down on a fluffy mousseline of smoked edamame and given a bath of wasabi and lime has obvious roots in Japan, yet doesn’t taste Japanese at all. The original impulse has been transformed. Like nearly all the savory dishes, this one depends upon the kitchen’s expert sauciers, especially Vincent Robinson, who has been on the job since 1985. Standing over his stockpots, Mr. Robinson has the control of Mariano Rivera on the mound. (Get well soon, Mr. Rivera.) When he makes a sauce of sweet pimentón for red snapper, the level of heat will be just perceptible; in a red wine and squid ink sauce for sepia, it will rise a bit higher and stop, right there. When he blends bergamot with grapefruit and other citrus for lobster, or jalapeño with lime for fluke sashimi, the nip of acidity will touch down precisely on this spot of your tongue, and nowhere else. Every time I went to Le Bernardin, somebody ordered a vintage Bordeaux, and the decanting apparatus would be trundled out. What on earth did those people order, I wondered, and did they ask Aldo Sohm for advice? Mr. Sohm, who holds the title chef sommelier, has studded his list with the required blockbusters, but he also has hidden oddities and discoveries to drink with raw salmon bathed in cardamom and ginger. He was joined on the floor at all times by at least two other sommeliers, silver tastevins swinging from their necks. They and other servers patrol the room like the Secret Service at a parade, on the lookout for the slight muscular shift indicating a guest is about to stand. One, two, three brisk steps, and someone is there to pull back the chair. There are slightly more women on the dining room staff these days, although men are still overrepresented as they are at other restaurants in this style. Ms. LeCoze and her maître d’hôtel, Ben Chekroun, are zealous about enforcing correct procedure, and woe to the novice who clatters dishes or forgets to look customers in the eye the minute they walk in the door. There is one other aspect of the service at Le Bernardin that sets the place apart from some of its peers. In spite of Mr. Ripert’s television appearances, in spite of the restaurant’s global acclaim, no one ever tried to let me know I was lucky to be there. But I was.","Geoduck, fluke sashimi, sepia, sea medley, langoustine, red snapper, black bass, halibut, piña colada dessert, yuzu meringue tart."
260,Cafe China,2 star,"May 1, 2012",Pete Wells,Midtown South,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/02/dining/reviews/cafe-china-in-midtown.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/02/dining/reviews/cafe-china-in-midtown.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"FOR a certain kind of food enthusiast, there is a deeply felt but little examined belief that immigrant-run restaurants, like presidential candidates, should not pay too much attention to their appearance. Just as a $400 haircut can spell days of bad press for a politician, a dining room outfitted with anything that might be termed design can raise suspicions of misplaced priorities. Some Sichuan-food fanatics I know, for instance, would roll their eyes at Café China. It looks far too pretty for a place serving a cuisine renowned for its chile-powered ability to make eaters teary-eyed and sweaty. Out front is the potted bamboo whose fronds sway in whatever breezes find their way to East 37th Street in Midtown. A vintage bird cage sways from the ceiling by the front door. Soft light is thrown by candles and chandeliers of hobnail milk glass, and the robin’s-egg-blue walls are hung with images of Shanghai starlets from the 1930s. A bartender pours cocktails into etched-glass coupes, and portable typewriters are here and there. (Customers use one as a guest book, tapping out compliments.) The skeptics would look at you with outright disbelief if you told them that this quaint, demure restaurant serves uncompromising Sichuan food that can stand with Manhattan’s best. But a cold appetizer of spicy diced rabbit will silence the doubters. It silences everybody, even the ones who aren’t totally sure they want to eat small cubes of bone-in rabbit with scallions and peanuts. The bones turn out to be essential to the overall experience, though. You need a minute to separate them from the meat, and during that minute some very intense things begin to happen to your tongue and lips. The sauce on that rabbit blends Sichuan peppercorns with scoops of small, fiery dried chiles. Sichuan cooks call the heat of chile peppers la. Ma is the word for the mouth-numbing zing of their region’s prized peppercorns. Stir them together and you have ma la. The chile heat and the Sichuan pepper tingle intensify each other until your mouth vibrates the way Wile E. Coyote does when he is hit on the head by an iron beam. You get the ma la buzz from the ma po tofu, too. In this hot entree, the nearly flavorless pockets of soft, delicate tofu offer safe harbor from the ma la assault (momentarily, at least). Then you take another forkful and it begins again. You have about four seconds to appreciate how exquisitely balanced the ma and la are before you reach for a drink, or cold cucumbers or bitter melon. The force of its ma la kick is certainly one test of a good Sichuan restaurant, but not the only one. As Fuchsia Dunlop noted in her cookbook “Land of Plenty,” ma la is one of 23 distinct flavor combinations in Sichuan cooking. One of the best reasons to go to Café China is that the chef, Lu Ziqiang, shows great control of flavors beyond the head-spinning realm of ma la. Even his spiciest recipes hold back from obliterating your palate, so you can taste the other dishes. As a chile-seeking friend put it, “Nothing is disgustingly hot.” That was a compliment. Pickle and fish stew has a burn that stops short of eye-watering, with round slices of preserved red chile bobbing in the broth like life preservers around a shipwreck. But it also has a sharp tang of pickled mustard greens that changes the formula to something new. Cumin leads the charge in other dishes, not just the well-known cumin lamb, which is superb and velvety here, but also in a dish called baby black lamb, which gains depth from fermented tofu and sweetness from red bell peppers. Cumin seeds and chiles strafe a whole tilapia that is steamed inside a tent of foil. Any objections I might have had to seeing fish given this rough, almost brutal treatment were forgotten the minute I started to eat. A far more gentle fate was dealt to the tea-smoked duck, with its whisper of smoke, its crisp handsomely rendered skin and its dipping sauce of sweet miso. Mr. Lu, a native of Chengdu, Sichuan’s capital, excels at foods that are marinated or cured, like the duck or the great cold appetizer of sliced beef with five-spice flavor, or the pork belly inside what the menu calls, confusingly, shredded pork sandwiches. (The pork is in fact sliced, and the sandwiches are the kind of steamed buns familiar to Momofuku followers.) Café China was opened in August by Xian Zhang and his wife, Yiming Wang. The two are Chinese-born bankers who make up for their lack of restaurant experience with the strength of their convictions. They insisted on a focused menu of about 75 items, with no egg rolls for the takeout crowd. They argued with Mr. Lu about monosodium glutamate, and won their case by force, charging into the kitchen to throw the MSG away. Without it, the smoked tofu with Chinese celery shoots doesn’t deliver the same kick in the head you’d get at Sichuanese competitors a few blocks away, but it does have a clean celery flavor. Even under a blizzard of spices, the main ingredients at Café China taste like themselves. Ms. Wang was in charge of the décor, meant to evoke Shanghai before World War II. Sometimes she seems to picture herself as a design element, gliding across the dining room in tight vintage dresses and bobbed hair. The restaurant works at a languorous, almost tropical tempo. This sometimes manifests itself in hazy service and puzzling waits for cold appetizers, but mostly it is a refreshing change from the usual staccato rhythms of Midtown Sichuan operations. For ma la maniacs, these are glorious days. Once you leave Chinatown, good Sichuan food may be easier to find in Manhattan than good Cantonese food. In Chelsea is the amazing Legend; Land of Plenty opened near Bloomingdale’s; there are Grand Szechuans all over. The 30s alone have  Szechuan Gourmet, Lan Sheng, Mapo Tofu and Café China. With so many expert chile-wrangling chefs, surely there’s space for a restaurant where a casually cool retro interior can be home to Sichuan’s enveloping heat.",Five-spice beef; husband and wife special; spicy beef tendon; spicy diced rabbit; baby cucumber; pork sandwiches; pickle and fish stew; chungking spicy chicken; tea-smoked duck; fragrant fish fillet; spicy cumin lamb; baby black lamb; baby ribs in bamboo leaves; double-cooked pork; ma po tofu; vegetable dishes.
261,Alison Eighteen,1 star,"April 17, 2012",Pete Wells,Flatiron,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/dining/reviews/alison-eighteen-in-manhattan.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/dining/reviews/alison-eighteen-in-manhattan.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"DID somebody forget to tell Alison Price Becker that in the decade since she last operated a Manhattan restaurant, all of New York below 42nd Street has been taken over by kids, and that their idea of going out to eat resembles some kind of blood sport? They have no sense of mortality, these young people. It’s nothing to them if restaurants make them wait all night for a table. They’ll stand up knocking back $16 cocktails for hours as if there won’t be a price to pay in the morning. Their bodies are still limber and lean, curse them, so when these kids are finally shown to a seat, and it turns out to be bigger than a laptop but smaller than an actual human lap, they can wedge into it without hearing anything inside creak or snap. The seat (O.K., it’s more like a stool or a bench or a tree stump or maybe an anvil) will offer no lumbar support, but still they won’t wake up the next morning feeling as if they’d been lifting file cabinets all night. The damage to their eardrums hasn’t started to manifest yet, so they can bob their heads to an early ’80s hair-metal anthem while recounting the latest episode of “The Walking Dead.” And the way they eat! They’re like houseflies, always buzzing around one another’s plates, sharing a dozen dishes ordered off menus divided into indecipherable headings like “By the Foot” and “Neither Fish nor Fowl.” Apparently none of this news has reached Ms. Price Becker’s ears. Or perhaps she heard it and then chose to go her own way. Either way, what she opened in January a few blocks off Union Square is a perfectly normal restaurant. Alison Eighteen is not a replica of her first place, Alison on Dominick, which she ran from 1989 until 2002. But it works the way restaurants worked in those days. You show up for your reservation, are led to a recognizable chair at a table that’s all yours, eat an appetizer and a main course in that order, make conversation with your inside voice and then go on your merry way. And if there are a few bumps as the night proceeds, at least they will be familiar bumps. You can almost hear the sighs of relief as patrons make their way past the bar and through the eggplant-colored velvet curtain into the orderly, un-raucous, cleanly illuminated dining room. There is no dress code at Alison Eighteen, yet nearly all the men who eat there show up in blazers. It must be a sign of gratitude. Not to say that Ms. Price Becker wasn’t keeping tabs on the city’s mood while she was in exile in the Hamptons. Alison on Dominick summed up its era’s suave metropolitan ideal of a date-night restaurant. But these days, date night could mean walking up Second Avenue eating deep-fried hot dogs followed by crack pie and soft serve, so Ms. Price Becker has eased up on the romance. Instead of lining the walls with the black-and-white Parisian scenes shot by her brother, the photographer Jonathan Becker, she has installed Payton Cosell Turner’s whimsical wallpaper with line drawings of produce stands, park benches and awnings for a variety of establishments, all named Alison. This is not a room where young men will offer tiny Tiffany’s boxes to their pretending-to-be-surprised girlfriends, as they regularly did on Dominick Street. But it may be where couples who got engaged there will repair to decide whether it’s finally time to sell their country house. While they talk, of course, there will be food. Most of the time, it will be in an Americanized bistro mode, and most of the time, it will behave itself. There is no funny business at the rotisserie, for instance. It will spit-roast a chicken that looks and tastes the way a rotisserie chicken should, and will do wonderful things with a hunk of lamb shoulder seasoned with preserved lemons. There is a no-nonsense grill, too, applied to uncomplicated cuts like a juicy pink pork chop and a sirloin. If I couldn’t taste the evidence of all 35 days the steak had supposedly been aged, it didn’t matter much. The lip-smacking Bordelaise and the hot, crisp potato sticks supplied more than enough flavor. The lamb shank created by Tom Valenti when he opened the kitchen at Alison on Dominick became a totem that each of his successors paid homage to or kept in the repertory. Alison Eighteen’s chef, Robert Gurvich, offers his own tribute to the dish in the form of a fully satisfying veal shank with reduced braising juices. Before those main courses, you could begin with fat mussels in a wonderful creamy broth, or some well-dressed salads, or an appetizer-size portion of stewed rabbit on wide house-made pappardelle speckled with mustard seeds. Both noodles and meat were so good that I was tempted to write off an earlier collision I’d had with a pasta dish: razor clams slapped — grit, shells and all — on top of a knotted clump of flavorless fettuccine. Maybe it was a failed experiment, and I was glad to see that on a recent evening it was no longer being offered. I was less thrilled that an earlier night’s special had been promoted to the menu: seared bigeye tuna over lemon jam so sugary you could spread it on toast. Scrape off the jam, though, and you have an excellent piece of fish. I did something similar with a white cocotte of polenta with wild mushrooms, tilting it until a small pond of olive oil and melted butter collected on one side. The dining room staff makes a great show of brisk efficiency. They wear white coats and neckties, and somebody is always topping off your water while holding a splash-catching pad to the glass. But I craned my neck in vain looking for someone to suggest a bottle of wine before the main courses landed, or to take a dessert order, or to bring the check. Behind that velvet curtain, Alison Eighteen can feel a bit like seeing a revival of an old play in out-of-town tryouts. The sets look great, but the dialogue can feel a bit strained, and the players need time to learn their lines. The audience looks indulgent, though. After all, they don’t write them like this anymore.",Mussels; salads; rotisserie meats; veal shank; franzipan cake.
262,Kyo Ya,3 star,"April 10, 2012",Pete Wells,East Village,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/11/dining/reviews/kyo-ya-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/11/dining/reviews/kyo-ya-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"SOME facts are beyond the reach of search engines. This is probably lucky for all of us, and it is especially lucky for those who go to eat at Kyo Ya. A Japanese hideaway in the middle of the East Village, Kyo Ya gives up its secrets slowly. Learning them is part of the adventure. The restaurant, which turned five years old last month, has no Web site. Reservations cannot be made through OpenTable. Any menu you manage to turn up online is likely to be seriously out of date. If Kyo Ya has opinions about bankers or fracking, they remain untweeted. Even in three dimensions, Kyo Ya can be elusive. Whenever I take friends there, I ask them to meet me on Seventh Street, just east of First Avenue. If I don’t, I will end up studying the menu at length until my phone trembles with a text message: “I’m outside. Where is this place?” It is below street level, at the bottom of an iron staircase marked by a carved sign that says, not too helpfully, Open. Once you make your way inside, welcomed by hosts who always seem delighted by your arrival, you look around, smile and start to unwind. The restaurant — floors, tables, counters, chairs, walls, doors, spoons, trays, even toilet seats — is made almost entirely of wood, with one long curving wall of stacked panels that fit together so well they make you want to take up carpentry. It is a room that restores all five of your senses if you have spent your day flicking away at pixels. And it puts you in the right frame of mind for the food of Kyo Ya’s chef, Chikara Sono. Like much Japanese cuisine, it is grounded in the shapes and rhythms of the natural world, and in respect for the seasons. It is easy in New York now to believe that eating ramps in April makes you an expert in seasonal cooking. As a meal at Kyo Ya will show, this is a little like believing that eating a tuna salad sandwich makes you a marine biologist. It’s a wide world out there. And it’s a wide world in here. Fans of Japanese food trust that Mr. Sono will find a way to serve rarely seen ingredients the minute their fleeting season begins. A couple of weeks ago, Kyo Ya offered a taste of spring’s first young bamboo shoots. The spiky leaves were peeled back like corn husks to expose the tender core, barely marked by the grill, seasoned with soy and flecks of kinome, the leaves of the sansho pepper plant. “You eat this part,” our server said, gesturing toward the stalk. We did, tentatively at first, then greedily. Mr. Sono’s most highly evolved display of right-now seasonality is the kaiseki menu, a procession of courses following a model that evolved over centuries. In February, I reserved one of the 10 spots for the kaiseki meal served nightly. Deep winter may not be the ideal time to appreciate a style of cooking that tries to showcase ingredients at their absolute peak. Still, I was transfixed by course after course, each a study in the forms and flavors of roots and leaves and marine life. A gratin of creamy sesame tofu with bits of deeply sweet blue shrimp was like a Japanese translation of shrimp and grits, and a great translation, too. Poached burdock mousse tasted the way the woods smell after it rains. Most astonishing of all was a plate of scallops in a sea-urchin butter so richly pleasurable that the only intelligent response was total submission. If you have heard of Kyo Ya, chances are you have been told that the kaiseki menu is the thing to get. It is a rare treat, no question, but so are many of the dishes that can be ordered à la carte with a smaller investment of time and money. If you eat this way, your meal will be less epic, but it can be just as enjoyable. Not every good tale is a novel. A compelling short story could be written about the chawanmushi, the traditional savory egg custard, served steaming hot with shrimp, ginkgo nuts and other little treasures hidden inside. It was so silky it made silk feel like pavement. Another could be told about the slowly simmered kurobuta kakuni, a pork belly that stands out even in a city that is full of them. And there is another story in the sweet potato that is steamed twice, then fried tempura style and eaten with a few drops of soy sauce. And another in the black cod in a miso glaze. No matter how many times you’ve had this dish, the version here can still make you shake your head in amazement. With every meal at Kyo Ya, I found another dish to add to my list of favorites, or a subtle new sake, or a deeply aromatic tea I’d never tasted before. With all of this, I was delicately guided by servers who were almost balletic in their gracefulness and nearly clairvoyant in their attentiveness. Toward the end of what had sounded when we’d placed our order like a very full meal, a server seemed to sense that we were still hungry even before we did. He mentioned a plate of sashimi. It was exactly enough. Much of the menu is likely to succeed with almost anyone, but some of Mr. Sono’s cooking can leave behind those who aren’t prepared to follow the Japanese palate down every winding path. One of my companions could not quite come to terms with the texture of cold sea urchin lobes and tofu skins bobbing in a milky broth. Another balked at lifting glassy baby eels with chopsticks. On a recent night, I faced a tiny but powerful cup of fermented squid in a sauce of its own liver. If fried calamari is a sunny day on the coast, this was a cold night near the ocean floor. I found it thrilling, but not everyone would. But even my most cautious friends went wild for the pressed sushi, which is rarely served in New York. The rice is fortified with shiso, two kinds of ginger, scallion, fried kelp and sesame seeds. The fish is placed on top, and the whole thing is squeezed into a tight rectangle. In the most arresting version I had, salmon trout was gift-wrapped in a papery sheet of oboro kombu seaweed that looked like green marble. There is more to learn, but that pleasure should be yours. I’ll stop here.",Goma tofu cocktail; goma tofu gratin; sweet potato tempura; chawanmushi; shiokara (fermented seafood); kurobuta kakuni (braised pork belly); sashimi; pressed sushi; clay-pot rice; seasonal specialties; kaiseki menus.

Mads Refslund slipped into town in January as quietly as a canoe. Word was that new owners had taken over the Acme Bar and Grill on Great Jones Street, which had dished up jambalaya under strings of chile-pepper lights for more than two decades. From the sidewalk, it looked as if nothing had changed. The red-and-blue awning still advertised “Authentic Southern and Cajun Cookin’. ” When the double doors opened in January, Eater, the usually all-seeing restaurant blog, reported that the menu “still has a Southern accent.” Soon, clued-in diners were filing ecstatic reports about Mr. Refslund’s food, which was non-Southern in the extreme. He was tucking a spooky tartare of bison and raw shrimp into endive and radicchio leaves. He was roasting sunchokes in a bed of hay, then setting the hay on fire. For dessert, there were chewy dried pears strewn around a green mulch of frozen wheatgrass juice. As some of those diners realized, the gentle and thoughtful cooking at Acme has nothing to do with Louisiana and quite a lot to do with Denmark. Along with René Redzepi, Mr. Refslund had been a founding chef of Noma, the Copenhagen restaurant that is the current center of the culinary universe. He was present at the creation of the new Nordic cuisine, an experiment in restricting the kitchen to ingredients that can be grown or caught or foraged locally, leading to a new appreciation for humble grains and edible weeds that nobody in Scandinavia had thought about eating for many years. Bits and scraps of this movement have drifted across the Atlantic, touching down on plates at Isa and Frej in Brooklyn, but the new Acme was the stealthy arrival of the genuine thing. Acme doesn’t look or act like a restaurant for gastronomic mandarins, which is one of its more appealing features. The owners have cultivated a constituency among the kind of gallery circulators and style trackers who turn up in Paper magazine. During Fashion Week, the arching mirror that runs nearly the length of the dining room reflected men in expensive-looking flannel and women in expensive-looking everything, nearly all of them angular and underfed. The servers are lean, too, in stiff, narrow-waisted jeans, their skinny ties tucked into the plackets of crisp white shirts. They do not intone psalms about Chef’s wisdom or explicate every last item on every last plate. Half the diners probably wouldn’t want to hear it, and the other half are having fun discovering it on their own. The food invites that. What looks like a bowl of sea foam subsides into a milky sauce of roast sunflower seeds bathing open clamshells embedded in sand-colored barley. It’s a small, intimate landscape that you eat. In fact, you might choose to eat it each time you come to Acme, noticing that it’s a little different each night, now with scallops, now with razor clams. Mr. Refslund cooks intuitively, by look and feel and perhaps by mood, but in three meals this dish was always cozy and comforting, with a sophisticated sense of balance. A painter’s hand is at work in a plate of carrots, too, though this time the genre is a botanical still life. The kitchen roasts them with pine needles and slices them in half the long way, serving them under a see-through sheet of lardo. The carrots, stretched out in a tart pool of blood-orange sauce, are knobbly and crooked, ugly but radiant. But to find real beauty in homeliness, order those blackened sunchokes. They might remind you of marshmallows that got too close to the campfire, or more appetizingly like fresh-dug truffles, but either way they are undeniably strange. And undeniably wonderful, enriched with butter, melted Gruyère and actual winter truffles. The nature-trail quality is turned down a notch in the main courses (“Sea/Land” in the menu’s language), although you never know where a craggy leaf or weedy flower is going to turn up next. The main courses are generally simpler and, almost without exception, excellent, particularly a chicken breast with a refined giblet sauce, and anything where fish is involved. There is black sea bass with pickled green tomatoes; there is arctic char with snow-white leeks; there was, at one point, turbot in a simple butter sauce with green fennel, and the kitchen seemed to nail them every time. None of these ingredients sound particularly Scandinavian, which is part of the point. “I think it would be very stupid to import things from Denmark,” Mr. Refslund said over the phone last week. “My whole philosophy is to tell the story of where you are right now.” This was his philosophy in Copenhagen as well. He and Mr. Redzepi were roommates and best friends who became co-chefs, heading off on a four-month tour of the Nordic region. Their hunt for puffin eggs and reindeer moss was the starting point for Noma’s cooking, although Mr. Refslund is the first to say that he had no hand in what the restaurant became. About five months after the opening, it became clear to both men that there was one chef too many, and Mr. Refslund left. “The whole cuisine today is René’s,” he said. Acme is not Noma in NoHo, nor is it MR, Mr. Refslund’s rarefied Copenhagen restaurant, now closed. The cooking is greatly simplified and meant to be shared. (This isn’t always successful; four people can’t split two fried eggs, and even perfectly cooked fish can cool on its trip from platter to plate to mouth.) The aim is to avoid startling the tables discussing Hedi Slimane’s move to YSL, while not boring the ones debating the chef César Ramirez’s move to Manhattan. The second group must be wondering if Mr. Refslund is going to be allowed to cook at his full capacity. And I’m wondering what will happen when he begins to make friends with local farmers and foragers. While the kitchen has been getting steadily more precise, I have the sense that the raw ingredients are holding it back somewhat. The salt-baked beet salad, for instance, can seem like a sketch not fully colored in yet. (Mr. Refslund also has a thing for al dente vegetables, as if he didn’t want to tame them with too much heat. Sometimes it works and sometimes, as when the sunchokes or carrots are crunchy and raw-tasting, it doesn’t.) One night as I left, two young European travelers were out front, peering at the awning. “Excuse me,” one said. “What is ... ca-joon food?” The restaurant is serving another kind of cuisine now, we explained. What kind, they asked. One of my companions hazarded, “Modern Danish?” But no. It’s modern New York, it’s fascinating and it’s going to be a blast to watch it grow. There were no trumpets playing when Mr. Refslund landed, but you can hear them now, and they’re going to get louder.","Pearl barley and clams; black heirloom carrots; hay-roasted sunchokes; chicken and eggs; turbot; black sea bass; arctic char.

264,RedFarm,2 star,"March 6, 2012",Pete Wells,West Village,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/07/dining/reviews/redfarm-in-the-west-village-turns-up-the-flavors.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/07/dining/reviews/redfarm-in-the-west-village-turns-up-the-flavors.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"JUST for a moment, try to forget that the dumplings are staring at you. It won’t be easy. They have plaintive black sesame-seed eyes, the dumplings at RedFarm, giving them the appearance of strange, adorable characters in a Miyazaki film. These flat-bellied duck and crab dumplings look like a school of wide-mouthed catfish; the pale-green ones, filled with shrimp and snow-pea leaves, like moon-faced tadpoles. Over here are Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde, spectral shrimp dumplings in blue, pink, yellow and white, chasing a Pac-Man made of sweet potato tempura with a blueberry for an eye. Ignore their plaintive stares, and stare at them instead. Look how rounded they are, how their fillings weigh against their glossy wrappers like the summer juice pressing against the skin of a plum. They look firm, ripe, ready. You can tell that they’re going to be good. But you don’t know how good they really are, and how good RedFarm can be, until you try one. And then, plaintive stares or no, you begin devouring these bundles of delight one by one. RedFarm, in the West Village, is a collaboration between one of New York’s greatest Chinese chefs, Joe Ng, and one of its greatest Chinese restaurateurs, Ed Schoenfeld. Only one, Mr. Ng, is Chinese by birth. Mr. Schoenfeld is Chinese by calling, a Brooklyn-born Jew who long ago heard an inner voice urging him to bring better kung pao chicken to the people of Manhattan. They have several clever ideas at RedFarm. First, the menu has been tailored for a Western palate, with none of the bland and slippery specialties that non-Chinese eaters find so enigmatic. It also seems designed for the age of Yelp, when the entire world can be split into either Nothing Special or OMG. RedFarm’s cooking runs hard toward OMG. Finally, there is the idea the management likes to broadcast: “Chinese cuisine with a Greenmarket sensibility,” which boils down to spending more on ingredients than many other Chinese restaurants do. A server one night rattled off the provenance of just about every scrap in the kitchen, from the rib steak (Creekstone Farms) to the truffles (a forager in France). “We don’t say all this on the menu, but everything is intelligently sourced,” he said. All that sourcing and intelligence result in some wonderful flavor. The rib steak, marinated for a night in shredded papaya, ginger and soy sauce, is the last thing I’d expected to find in a Chinese restaurant: a great steak. A few more pieces of beef like this around town, and soon baked potatoes and cheesecake will be the only reasons for steakhouses to continue to exist. The winter farmers’ market can’t be much help in assembling the okra and eggplant in a Thai-style yellow curry, but Mr. Ng must have other connections, because the vegetables can hold their own against the spicy and warming curry, fragrant with lemon grass and rich with coconut cream. The bowl satisfies you and makes you want more at the same time, a tension that feels so good that a meal at RedFarm could begin and end right there. Could, but shouldn’t. It would be insane to come to RedFarm without having a dumpling, and silly not to have four or five. They are the foundation of Mr. Ng’s fame as the Balanchine of dim sum, built at World Tong in Brooklyn and then at Chinatown Brasserie in NoHo, where he is still the chef. The shrimp and snow-pea leaf versions have a juicy sweetness far more intense than what you usually find in Chinatown. The mixed-vegetable, with sunny corn kernels peeking through the crimps in the dough, have a right-off-the-vine vibrancy. Still, neither one is going to overtake Mr. Ng’s soup dumplings in popularity. Here’s how to eat them: hold one in a spoon, raise it to your lips, nip off the puckered crown, suck out the hot thick broth, and try to remember tasting a more-flavorful soup dumpling in Manhattan since the early days of Joe’s Shanghai. For sensations like this, people have stood in line, and stood and stood, since the restaurant opened last August. RedFarm belongs to that post-Momofuku generation of restaurants made possible by the discovery that people will wait in line, open their wallets and put up with a reasonable amount of discomfort if the cooking consistently vaults above usual levels of intensity. No reservations are taken, except for large parties. The décor, to stretch a definition, is provided mostly by potted plants and by Mr. Schoenfeld’s owlish eyeglasses, color-coordinated with his sweaters. Cartons of beer and liquor are stowed above the tables on raw-lumber platforms. (What design budget there was seems to have gone into buying one of those highly accomplished Japanese toilets.) In exchange, all the flavors have been turned up as high as they can go. The dishes can be salty, or sweet, or rich. Often they are all three at once. At RedFarm, the food goes to 11. It’s hard to fault that approach when you’re crunching on one piece of crispy beef after another, lured in by the black vinegar and Grand Marnier glazing a deep-fried exterior. Or dipping a pastrami egg roll into mustard, and ingesting an entire century of sodium-drenched Lower East Side culinary history. But I wouldn’t advise eating both in the same meal, or even the same week. RedFarm’s waiters, though very good, tend to steer you toward the more-is-more end of the menu. I was in better hands with the woman seated next to me one night who said: “You should get the smoked cucumbers. You’ll need them.” I saw what she meant. Though not exactly sodium-free, the cucumbers are cooling and refreshing, gently pickled and pulsing with pink peppercorns. To her suggestions, I’d add three of my own: a plate of snow-pea leaves; the dessert of carved fruit in light ginger syrup; as many glasses of water as you can manage. Whether the unbalanced menu is heartfelt (Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Ng like this kind of cooking), cynical (they believe their target market likes it) or both, is hard to tell. The two hope to plant takeout-friendly RedFarms around the city, so clearly their eyes are on the mainstream. Meanwhile, Mr. Ng seems to have glanced away from Chinatown Brasserie, which on a recent night sent out food that was a second-generation copy of what it used to be. At the moment, though, there is just one RedFarm, and Mr. Ng and Mr. Schoenfeld are focusing all their energy on it. For New Yorkers who know a great dumpling when they see one, that’s more than good enough.","Dumplings; spicy crispy beef; oysters; smoked cucumbers; Kowloon filet mignon tarts; okra and Thai eggplant yellow curry; rib steak; fried rice dishes; noodle dishes.

265,Jungsik,2 star,"Feb. 28, 2012",Pete Wells,TriBeCa,Korean,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/dining/reviews/jungsik-intribeca-reinterprets-korean-cuisine.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/dining/reviews/jungsik-intribeca-reinterprets-korean-cuisine.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"FOR many adults, a lobe of sea urchin has the same power to magically improve almost any plate that a squirt of ketchup has for children. The effect is far more luxurious, though. So I was not exactly stunned to find myself dipping my spoon over and over, slowly but determinedly, into a bowl of sea urchin over rice at Jungsik. And telling a friend, “Wow, you’ve got to try this.” And never quite getting around to sliding it over to his side of the table. The other tastes in that bowl did surprise me, though, and made it one I’ll remember happily for some time. Seaweed and sesame oil scented the rice. Above it were sticks of Napa cabbage kimchi and a handful of quinoa, fried until it lost its usual mustiness. I stirred all this together, like bibimbap, and began to travel. The seaweed and the briny urchin tugged me toward the beach. The kimchi and sesame oil dropped me on the corner of 32nd and Sixth. As for the quinoa, as it crunched between my teeth I was back at in my parents’ house, eating a breakfast bowl of Grape-Nuts. It sounds like a cab ride to crazy town, but it was great. A lot of what we call creativity in cooking is simply rearranging old patterns by swapping one ingredient for another, less-expected one. A talent for forming entirely new patterns is more rare. It is that much more exciting when you encounter it, as you do in some of Jung Sik Yim’s menu at the refined and expensive restaurant he opened in TriBeCa at the end of last summer. New Yorkers who crave Korean cuisine for its militant strafings of chile paste and raw garlic may find that Jungsik takes some getting used to. Its goal is refinement, for better and, at times, for worse. Rather than steaming to the table in rustic bubbling pots, Mr. Yim’s food is plated, and plated with a vengeance, with bits of this and that marching in neat, colorful chorus lines across expansive white plates. Inside a vibrant green circle of cilantro and jalapeño sauce is a red snapper fillet that literally sparkles; the scales are left on the skin, and exposure to blistering oil makes them puff and stand up in translucent points of amber. It’s an achievement, this crust made of fish-scale sequins, and it’s wonderful to eat. In the shadows of refinement, though, lurk dullness and pretension, and Jungsik sometimes slips into one or the other. Some dishes come and go without leaving much impression. Early on, the service was fluttery and nervous-making; now it tends toward a mannered formality that is almost a parody of fancy-restaurant etiquette. And the price, while lower than it was at first, is still what real estate brokers would call “aggressive.” (A five-course dinner is $115, and a three-course menu, the only other option, costs $80.) This may explain why Jungsik was half empty on a recent night. I wish more New Yorkers would give the place a chance. I also wish the place would give more New Yorkers a chance. Friendlier prices and a more comfortable tone would be a start if the restaurant, an import from Seoul, wants to adapt to its new environment. Mr. Yim was born in South Korea, learned to cook in the army and went on to work in kitchens around Seoul, including a bakery and a rice-cake shop. At 25, he came to the United States for culinary school, and after graduation he worked briefly at Bouley and elsewhere. As the tastes Mr. Yim grew up on collided with the techniques of the modern American restaurant kitchen, all sorts of ideas shook loose. What do you get when you inject a suave sabayon with the unruly heat and sourness of kimchi? A sauce for Arctic char that’s lush and focused. What if you stir barley into simmering anchovy broth? Two familiar Korean flavors generate a third, a little uncanny and very good. The chef planted his flag first in his home country, opening Jung Sik Dang in Seoul in 2009 with friends from culinary school. Their ambition was huge. Jung Sik Dang adapted Western fine dining for a culture where most restaurants prize tradition over innovation. Instead of panchan, small dishes of fermented vegetables and other things, meals began with a salvo of amuses bouches and a choice of breads served from a tray. All of this put the food of Korea on an equal footing with that of Europe and the United States, a forceful statement of national pride. Exported to Manhattan, though, Jungsik is just another restaurant, and its prices invite comparison with some of the city’s best. In that company, even a few off notes can hurt. In a flurry of five little pre-appetizers, a froth of red grapes over puffed rice was so dull that a baby might have wanted to add hot sauce, and a bulgogi slider wasn’t much more invigorating. Only Korean fried chicken on the end of a toothpick suggested that the meal to come would be worth sticking around for. The interior of the restaurant, with two long walls of creamy banquettes and white table linens, has a kind of rectilinear, modern elegance, but it might have been so much more striking if the grandly windowed space, once occupied by Chanterelle, had not been carved into boxes. With its distinctive view of Hudson and Harrison Streets now given away to a private dining room, the remainder looks like one of those cool-but-not-really hotel restaurants with names like CobaltBlue and 3sixty5. Jungsik has struggled to find the right tone in its service, too. Although highly attentive, the staff can affect an elaborate, almost Edwardian courtesy that does not seem to come naturally. Perhaps the actors on “Downton Abbey” can sound believable saying things like “As a final element to your meal here, we provide you with an angelica root pot de crème,” but it’s a bit much for the young servers at Jungsik. This reaching for elegance, clearly, is meant to convey something beyond the strict meaning of the words. It is trying to stake a claim for the global standing of Korean food. But Jungsik doesn’t need that. Mr. Yim is staking that claim on nearly every plate he cooks, and doing it convincingly. Now the restaurant he has built needs to stop worrying about the world, and start paying more attention to its new home.","Mushroom with dashi broth; sea urchin; barley in anchovy broth; miyeok; spicy kalguksu; crispy snapper; Arctic char.

266,Shake Shack,1 star,"Feb. 21, 2012",Pete Wells,Downtown Brooklyn,"Fast Food, Hamburgers, Hot Dogs",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/dining/reviews/shake-shack-struggles-with-inconsistency.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/dining/reviews/shake-shack-struggles-with-inconsistency.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"AFTER tossing out one of those limp politician’s jokes about how its arrival in Brooklyn meant that Shake Shack had finally “hit the big time,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg snipped through a green ribbon Dec. 20 to formally open the chain’s location on Fulton Mall. It is not every day that the mayor serves as midwife at the birth of a hamburger stand, but it is not every hamburger stand that achieves the prominent spot in the city’s consciousness held by Shake Shack. There are 14 of them now, uptown, downtown and out of town (Miami, Washington, Kuwait City). One respectable writer has spoken of the burger as life-changing. From its origins as a hot-dog cart that the restaurateur Danny Meyer set up as a kind of art project in 2001, Shake Shack has become one of the most influential restaurants of the last decade, studied and copied around the country. Its legacy can be seen not just in the stampede of good, cheap burgers, but in the growing recognition that certain fine-dining values, like caring service and premium ingredients, can be profitably applied outside fine dining all the way down the scale to the most debased restaurant genre of all, the fast-food outlet. To answer two obvious questions right away: Yes, I would give stars to a hamburger stand. No, probably not four stars. While the mayor was talking, a line had formed. Lines are so central to the Shake Shack experience that they have symbolic overtones. The line is democratic: everybody waits, including Mr. Meyer’s children. It is a signal of freshness: everybody waits, because the food is cooked to order. It is the people’s endorsement: everybody waits, so it must be worth it. I ate at the Shake Shack in Brooklyn and others around the city more than a dozen times recently. After about a third of those trips, I walked away thinking, “Wow, that was an awesome burger.” The other times, the food generally wasn’t worth the wait. Finally I understood that the people in line were looking for something that doesn’t come in a wax-paper wrapper. Shake Shack’s pitch is that, yes, even in New York, we can all return to a simpler, cleaner, friendlier place and time. It delivers on that pitch most reliably in its shakes and custards. The shakes are smooth, not crunchy with ice crystals, and drinkable, not so stiff that they fight the straw. And the flavors are true. A live current of caffeine pulses through the Fair Shake, made from vanilla ice cream swirled with coffee extract. (For those who like a different kind of buzz, Shake Shack has pints of Brooklyn Brewery’s easygoing Shackmeister ale. It also pours wine into stemless tulip-shaped glasses. You don’t realize they’re plastic until you touch them.) I was never let down by the hot dogs, bought from Chicago’s irreplaceable Vienna Beef, which were split down the middle, griddled and laid in a toasted potato bun with or without the classic Chicago garnishes. Better yet is the Bird Dog, a smoked chicken and apple bratwurst from Usinger’s of Milwaukee. How the burger could change lives I never divined, but on occasion it was magnificent, as beefy and flavorful as the outer quarter-inch of a Peter Luger porterhouse. More often, though, the meat was cooked to the color of wet newsprint, inside and out, and salted so meekly that eating it was as satisfying as hearing a friend talk about a burger his cousin ate. Even when the burgers were great, they could be great in one of two distinct ways. In the classic Shake Shack patty, a tower of ground beef is flattened against a searing griddle with a metal press and made to stay there, spitting and hissing, until one surface turns all brown and crunchy. A patty handled this way takes command of a Shackburger, standing up to its tangy sauce, its crisp lettuce, its wheels of plum tomato. Sometimes, though, the grill cook hadn’t had the energy needed for smashing and searing. Instead the patty was tall, soft and melting, so pink inside that its juices began to soak the bun at the first bite. Good as this version was, it was anomalous. Shake Shack wasn’t even consistently inconsistent. Once when I ordered a double burger, one patty was browned all the way through while the other was the color of a ripe watermelon inside. When Shake Shack’s slant-roofed kiosk first landed in Madison Square in 2004, it handily outclassed its nearest rivals, places like McDonald’s and Burger King. But success has bred better competitors. Today, for less than $10, you can get a burger at least as flavorful at Schnipper’s Quality Kitchen, FoodParc, Bill’s Bar & Burger and Steak ’n Shake Signature. In the early days, Shake Shack’s commitment to better ingredients, like antibiotic- and hormone-free “100 percent all-natural” Angus beef, might have seemed progressive. Now, you can get inexpensive burgers with a stronger promise of sustainability, made from beef that is local, organic or grass-fed, at Steak ’n Shake, Bark Hot Dogs, Bareburger, Whitmans and others. And you can get better fries just about anywhere. Considered as décor, the crinkle-cut fries are exactly right, calling up images of the milkshake-with-two-straws past that is at the core of Shake Shack’s appeal. Considered as food, though, they are pretty awful. Freezing turns them mealy, and no amount of oil or salt can make them taste like the fresh-cut potatoes that are standard issue at some burger joints now. Mr. Meyer runs one of the world’s great restaurant companies. Can’t one of his chefs show him how to make a decent French fry? Or help to upgrade the Shroom Burger? This item, a deep-fried portobello mushroom, erupts in a gushing flow of bland molten cheese that can scorch your hand when it’s hot and that grows even less appetizing as it cools. Though it has its fans, to me it is a bitter, slippery, 570-calorie throwback to the dark ages of meatless cooking, a don’t-care package for vegetarians. A restaurant with a menu as limited as Shake Shack’s should not have this many weak spots. Yet as with many of Mr. Meyer’s restaurants, the food is not the only attraction. It may not even be the primary one. Before Shack Shack, buying cheap burgers was rarely uplifting. Recently at a McDonald’s in Brooklyn, I waited to order as the people on the registers traded loud profanities with customers who were, I guess, their friends. A few months later, I went to the Shake Shack in Brooklyn with a friend’s 7-year-old daughter, who truly does seem to live on bread alone. Burgers and hot dogs were not doing it for her. “I want a grilled cheese,” she said firmly, and before I could tell her that it wasn’t on the menu, an order-taker leaned across the counter. “I can make you a grilled cheese,” he told her. They both smiled. One little piece of stagecraft at Shake Shack sums up the Meyer approach. It is handled so smoothly that I noticed it only after my 10th or 11th meal. When I reached the front of the line and made my request, I was, as always, handed a buzzer that vibrates when the food is ready. Then I was asked my name. As I made up an alias, it occurred to me for the first time that if you summon customers with a buzzer, you don’t need names. Except at Shake Shack. When I went up to get my takeout bag, the woman at the counter looked me in the eye and said, “Have a great night, Tony.” It was almost enough to make me stand in line again right then and there, and my name isn’t even Tony.      ","Hot dogs, chicken dogs, shakes, frozen custards, concretes, floats, lemonade."
267,Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria,3 star,"Feb. 14, 2012",Pete Wells,NoHo,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/dining/reviews/il-buco-alimentari-e-vineria-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/dining/reviews/il-buco-alimentari-e-vineria-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IS it crazy to fall for a restaurant because of a handful of chickpeas? Tumbling around with pickled currants under crunchy stalks of grilled octopus leg, these chickpeas were smaller and sweeter than usual, less starchy and grainy. Tasting one was like encountering a goldfinch if the only birds you’d ever seen were pigeons. Still, they were just chickpeas. Is it more logical to fall for a restaurant because of sliced bread in a basket? It was remarkable stuff, with the gradually unfolding nuances of taste that are achieved only through a slow and patient fermentation of dough with wild yeast. But other restaurants serve great bread. So let’s blame it on the salumi board, with satiny pink and white folds of lonza and capocollo and lardo that melt on the tongue into a lasting impression of salt, pig fat and time. The meats, cured and aged in the basement of Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria, are among the finest salumi in the country. In truth, there were a dozen little tastes that made me fall for this restaurant, which opened on Great Jones Street four months ago and has become New York’s most complete realization so far of a powerful myth: the simple and convivial spot that tastes just like Italy. That myth is an old one. You go to a small town in Umbria and find your way to some modest trattoria, or maybe a market with a few tables. Then lunch arrives, and the top of your head comes off. Meanwhile everybody around you has their elbows on the table and is acting like food this good is no big thing. And you say, why not? Why couldn’t we have a place just like this back home? The answer could fill a book, but the abridged version is that the modest trattoria can’t exist without the town. Fantastic elemental cooking requires fantastic elements, and those have to come from the baker, the grocer, the butcher and a dozen other local trades people and merchants. Still, the myth echoes in many places, from the pursed-lipped pieties of Alice Waters’s cathedral to the open-throated revels of Mario Batali’s pagan temple. Very few believers have tried to live out the myth by recreating the entire Italian village. But in a sense this is what Donna Lennard and her partners have done at Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria, and that is what makes it such an inviting place to have a pastry in the morning, a sandwich and a bowl of soup at noon, and a small feast at night. First, she built the grocery, the Alimentari part of the name, which carries those earthy chickpeas, along with salt crystals and olive oil with a pepper rasp that catches in the back of your throat. The shop seems at first to be the whole show. Keep walking. Down a few steps and past a colossal sculptural chandelier that would not look lost hanging in the Guggenheim rotunda is a bright, busy room where people are tearing at pieces of bread, eating off one another’s plates and talking with their elbows on the tables. Every cliché of the rustic Italian restaurant is on display here: the terra-cotta floor tiles, the handblown wine bottles, the rickety chairs, the overworked servers who are always rushing to somebody else’s table. Get their attention, though, and they will reliably guide you toward the good stuff on the menu and on the wine list. With six to eight selections from a number of producers, the wine list lets you drink your way through some bottles you might overlook on a more comprehensive list, like the spry Tyrolean whites of Garlider, or the spicy Calabrian reds of Odoardi. The sooner you order, the faster you’ll get a basket of Kamel Saci’s breads. He makes a dozen kinds, letting the dough gain flavor and structure during a rise that lasts at least 18 hours, sometimes twice that. His bread is not something you munch absent-mindedly while waiting for the first course. It is the first course. The Alimentari, with its $9 chocolate bars, might be too precious for everyday cooks. But it lets Justin Smillie, the chef of the space in the back (the Vineria), do amazing things with dishes that on paper sound commonplace. A few drops of specially imported Sicilian anchovy sauce, called colatura di alici, propel a roasted short rib for two to a height of deliciousness that short ribs rarely scale. With a forceful crust of peppercorns and coriander seeds, and crunchy bits of meat that are this restaurant’s answer to Kansas City’s burnt ends, this may be one of the best new dishes in town. Actually, since the same meat reappears as a sandwich filling at lunch, it may be two of the best new dishes. Bucatini alla gricia is a classic bare-bones production of pecorino, pepper and cured jowl. It is what Romans put together when there is nothing else in the house. When it’s cooked fearlessly, like it is here, you don’t need anything else in the house. Anyone still under the impression that dried pasta is inherently inferior to fresh will be quickly and permanently set straight. And if that doesn’t work, they should proceed to the spaghetti with bottarga to study the way the mullet roe sauce wraps itself around every strand, sheathing it in creamy maritime intensity. On the night I tried it, I only wished that the spaghetti had had a little more snap; sometimes the pasta station here seems to lose track of time, and a bowl of noodles that should be tensely coiled is allowed to unwind just a bit. Not that Mr. Smillie spends his days opening packages of spaghetti. He is, after all, the chef who was fired from a doomed East Village gastropub for spending too much at the Greenmarket. (More compatibly, he also cooked under Jonathan Waxman and Dan Silverman.) Somehow in February he hunted down the ripest persimmon I’ve tasted in a year, sending out wedges of it with a grilled quail that had not a hint of the liver overtones quail sometimes gets. And he found tiny beets to plant like tulip bulbs in a snowy drift of ricotta curds, with shiny tongues of white grapefruit on the side. Still, what makes Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria stand out are the products made in this village-inside-a-restaurant, and above all the cured meats. When Americans first conceived the myth of the great, simple Italian restaurant back home, the one thing that was most out of reach would have been salumi of this quality. Ms. Lennard first entered the cured-meats business about a decade ago at her first restaurant, Il Buco, a block away on Bond Street. At the time, only a few people in the United States were trying to replicate Italian-style salumi. As they set out to study a very intricate craft, they discovered that even fewer Americans were raising the old breeds of hogs whose thick sheath of sweet, creamy fat is essential to great salumi. If you somehow assembled the right skills and the right pork, you could still be stopped by the law. Ask Ms. Lennard about that. In 2006, the city’s health department told her that the temperatures in Il Buco’s basement curing facility were all wrong. “They made my guys chop all this gorgeous prosciutto, some of it two years old, into little pieces, and pour bleach over it, and put it into plastic bags, and poor Bernardo in the morning had to throw them into the garbage truck,” she said by phone. Bernardo Flores, the butcher in Ms. Lennard’s village, now has high-tech curing equipment in the basement of the new restaurant, imported from Italy at some expense. To devise a safety plan that keeps the inspectors at bay, she hired Christopher Lee, a longtime salumi maker at Chez Panisse. The work they are doing now, with pork from some of the best pig farmers on the East Coast, is the kind of exceptional reward Manhattan bestows on people who are stubborn, tireless and have the right timing. And on the rest of us, too, if we are lucky.","Salumi; filetti di baccalà; fried rabbit; spaghetti with bottarga; bucatini cacio e pepe; bucatini alla gricia; porchetta alla Romana; spit-roasted short ribs; crispy polenta.

268,Kutsher's Tribeca,1 star,"Feb. 7, 2012",Pete Wells,TriBeCa,"Deli, Eastern European",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/dining/reviews/kutshers-tribeca-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/dining/reviews/kutshers-tribeca-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IF Kutsher’s Tribeca were a musical, it would be “Springtime for Hitler.” This is, after all, a restaurant whose business model rests on the idea that what New York has been missing is somewhere to go for upscale gefilte fish. It was opened in November by Zach Kutsher, whose family owns a faded Borscht Belt resort famous for stand-up shtick in the ballroom and eat-til-you-plotz meals in the dining room. When Mr. Kutsher told an interviewer that he hoped to continue the Catskills tradition “in a really modern, fun, hip, downtown kind of way,” it sounded so unlikely, that only one explanation made any sense. The place must have been designed to fail. But in TriBeCa, as in Max Bialystock’s theater, the surefire flop is a hit. On many nights, all 130 seats are taken with diners exploring a menu that updates the cuisine of Eastern European Jews. Strangest of all, everybody seems to be having a good time. Well, maybe not the ones who order the gefilte fish. But when the kitchen isn’t trying too hard, Kutsher’s turns all the jokes about Jewish cooking upside down. Which is to say: The food here’s not bad. And such big portions! Kutsher’s has other attractions, too. For one, it must be the least pretentious “nice” restaurant to open in Manhattan in years. A meal there does not begin with the ominous question, “Have you dined with us before?” But it may start with a server saying, “I’ll tell you what I tell everybody: you have to speak up because it gets loud in here, and I’m deaf in one ear.” There is no chef’s tasting menu, but there is a children’s menu. (Some care goes into it. If children are going to eat chicken fingers, they ought to be as crunchy and as juicy as the panko-crusted ones at Kutsher’s.) The dining room, designed by Rafael de Cárdenas with zigzags of blond wood and banquettes of charcoal leather, has a skinny-tie, Sinatra-at-the-Sands verve. But it is also spacious and open enough to appeal to the three-generational families that trooped in during Hanukkah. Zach Kutsher likes to circulate, working the tables as his grandfather and father must have done in their day. Gifted restaurateur-hosts can give you a sense that a Champagne cork is about to pop somewhere, maybe at your table. Mr. Kutsher’s homey brand of hospitality is a bit more like a can of Dr. Brown’s Cel-Ray soda. (Kutsher’s makes its own version of this, dry and refreshing.) But the presence of the man whose name is on the sign is welcome these days, when so many restaurants are run by interchangeable managers hired by chefs we’ve stopped hoping to see. Mark Spangenthal, the chef at Kutsher’s, won a reputation at the Screening Room and other restaurants for doing a lot with food that didn’t sound like much. Take, for instance, his matzo ball soup at Kutsher’s. Matzo ball preferences are deeply personal and beyond argument. Mr. Spangenthal aims for midrange fluffiness, so people who like a tightly compressed matzo ball that lands in the gut like a sock filled with pennies may not be satisfied. But they will certainly notice how flavorful these matzo balls are, and appreciate the rich broth, with its robust flavor and lip-smacking stickiness. The kitchen has been hard at work on that soup, but it has covered its tracks. The cooks labor over the charcuterie, too. The pink, soft, delicately hot-smoked veal tongue; the peppery, cold-smoked pastrami of duck breast; and the chopped chicken and duck liver, blended with head-spinning doses of chicken and duck schmaltz, all repay the effort. Not smoked on site, but still worth ordering, are the fat slices of pastrami salmon and nova lox. Sweet, meaty pickled herring is given two treatments, one of which reaches far beyond Eastern Europe and comes up with yuzu and wasabi. That dish, though, is the exception to the rule at Kutsher’s, where in general the more a plate looks like restaurant cooking, the less entertaining it is. The gefilte fish — made from halibut, padded out with bread, beaten to a fine paste, molded into tidy pucks and scrubbed of any perceptible seafood flavor, let alone a shiny gelatinous glaze — is the most striking example of overcompensation I’ve ever tasted, and the blandest. It is useful only as a sponge for the seasoned horseradish and the chrain, or beet relish, each energetically bright and pungent, and each deserving a better foil. Quinoa varnishkes forfeit what makes kasha varnishkes worth eating — toasty, earthy buckwheat — in favor of damp and listless quinoa. It clings to the floppy noodles like laundry lint. The most satisfying main course by far is the roast chicken with pletzel stuffing and mushrooms for two. Only the drumstick planted upright in the center of the platter, and the flavor that comes from brining the bird overnight, gives away the chef’s hand. In other main dishes, the effort increases and the returns diminish. A welter of mushrooms and caramelized onions and a knish that stands up on the plate like Devils Tower are distractions from a very tasty prime skirt steak. Salmon is hidden under a falafel crumble that lacks confidence, as if it knows it doesn’t belong. Reinventing flanken is a noble idea, but turning it into red-wine-braised short ribs with mashed potatoes, a dish served at a hundred other restaurants, may not be the ideal way to go about it. The cuisine of Ashkenazi Jews deserves a future beyond, as a friend put it, “self-referential jokes that fewer and fewer living people get.” Around town, a number of chefs are working on it. At JoeDoe and JoeDough in the East Village, Joe Dobias brings a non-Jewish perspective (and non-Jewish ingredients, like bacon) to dishes like chopped liver and tongue. He always seems to be asking, How much more flavor can this food handle? Noah Bernamoff and Aaron Israel, in their remarkable dinner menus at Mile End in Brooklyn, follow a more artisanal path, looking for handmade beauty in what was once rustic peasant food. At Kutsher’s, this cuisine is not so much rethought as retouched. You might wish that Mr. Spangenthal had a bit more faith in its grandmotherly charms, or that he had a vision of how to bring those charms into the modern world. But did you expect vision from a place with Milton Berle’s picture hanging by the door?","Matzo ball soup, charcuterie, kreplach, roast chicken for two, ice cream sandwich.

269,Parm,2 star,"Jan. 24, 2012",Pete Wells,Nolita,"American, Italian",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/25/dining/reviews/parm-restaurant-review-nyc.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/25/dining/reviews/parm-restaurant-review-nyc.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IF the meatball parmigiana hero were a Southern dish, scholars from Chapel Hill, N.C., to Tallahassee, Fla., would hold academic conferences every six months just to talk about it. If it were a Florentine dish, the Four Seasons would have it on the menu for $95, or $55 without white truffles. But it is an Italian-American dish. It is at home on Wooster Street in New Haven, Atwells Avenue in Providence and Salem Street in Boston. It cannot be ordered at any restaurant that uses a truffle shaver. The closest thing to an academic symposium in its honor would be the lectures on the Food Network given by Prof. Giada De Laurentiis. Italian-American cuisine is not beloved by the arbiters of good taste, who celebrate risotto alla Milanese but ignore baked ziti, garlic bread, spaghetti and meatballs and lobster fra diavolo. “We’ve certainly moved, as a nation, beyond those dishes,” the food columnist Josh Ozersky declared on Time.com last year. In that case, I would like somebody to explain why my mind keeps drifting back to the meatball parmigiana hero at Parm. Like most things at Parm, which opened on Mulberry Street in November, it is prepared by cooks wearing white paper hats and is set before you in a red plastic basket. And, like most things at Parm, it is completely faithful to your memories while being much, much better than you remembered. At first, the sandwich exhibits nothing out of the ordinary. The tomato sauce, simple and summery, just seems to have been made by a good cook. The mozzarella and torn leaves of basil are fresh, which isn’t unheard of. The seeded roll is completely normal. The meatballs are not normal. For starters, they are not balls, they are patties. Anyone who has ever taken a bite of a meatball hero and watched one of the meatballs launch into orbit will recognize at once the significance of this deviation. Patties stay put. Most sub-shop meatballs are as hard as a 15-minute egg. The patties at Parm are not. Your teeth fall right through them. And when they do, you find something else that isn’t normal: the meat is juicy and rosy pink on the inside, the color of a perfectly cooked pork chop. The meatballs, made from veal, beef and sweet Italian sausage, are pink because they were braised at 180 degrees in a CVap low-temperature cooker for 40 minutes. They were braised at 180 degrees because Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone, the chefs behind Parm, studied fancy-restaurant techniques under chefs like Andrew Carmellini, Mario Batali and Wylie Dufresne. But the meatballs are sitting on a hero roll because Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Carbone are Italian-Americans who, once they had a restaurant of their own, decided to cook what is a kind of soul food for them and for millions of other Americans, even those with no Italian ancestors. This hybrid cuisine was created by immigrants who were, overwhelmingly, born in Southern Italy, at a time when the region was rural, overpopulated and desperately poor. More recently, when chefs and food writers studied authentic Italian food, they tended to travel to the wealthier north. Italian-American cooking, a bastardized cuisine with roots in an out-of-fashion region, was doubly uncool. Mr. Carbone, in a phone interview, said that when he was working at Babbo, “The sense I got was that the food of Italy was legitimate food, and the food Rich and I grew up eating was this weird thing we shouldn’t talk about.” Parm is essentially an expanded rendition of the lunch operation that the two chefs used to run at their first restaurant, Torrisi Italian Specialties, next door. (That restaurant now focuses all its energy on its prix fixe tasting menus.) Parm makes former Torrisi lunch standards like heroes and a marvelous array of vegetable side dishes. But the menu has grown to include, for instance, baked clams. Briny and just-cooked beneath crumbs of sesame breadsticks, they are like the meatballs in that all their divergences from the original are improvements. That’s the case with the fried calamari, too. Very small, very sweet and absolutely tender, they share their basket with two kinds of fried hot peppers that keep the squid from overstaying its welcome, as it sometimes can. With other recipes, Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Carbone do not tweak the original. They throw it under the bus. You may know pizza knots as the cold, lumpish chew toys that let pizzerias unload their stale dough. The warm pizza knots at Parm levitate, held down in their basket, it seems, only by a veil of grated cheese. The turkey sandwich at the old Torrisi persuaded many people, for the first time in their lives, to eat turkey more than once a year. It reappears at Parm (there would have been a riot had it not) served, as before, on a round semolina roll or on a hero. For the first time, it’s also on the menu as a platter, with a choice of baked ziti or salad on the side. The platters help Parm make its bid as a spot for dinner as well as for lunch. On that score, there is also a series of nightly specials, like a chopped steak on Tuesday to rival the one at Peter Luger and a zuppa di pesce on Friday. But even a clever cocktail list doesn’t quite succeed in making Parm as enticing by night as it is by day. At all hours, tables are set with paper place mat menus dominated by sandwiches. The whole mood of the place, in fact, isn’t especially attuned to the sense of theater New Yorkers like their restaurants to provide after dark. The old Torrisi managed to have it both ways. The shelves stocked with bags of pistachios and boxes of pasta looked utilitarian in the daylight and romantic when the votive candles were lighted. Parm has cartoony kitchen wallpaper and haphazard lighting that throws parts of the dining room into pools of shadow, and not the sexy kind. Would a few candles stuck into straw-covered Chianti flasks be pushing the joke too far? Maybe, but Mr. Carbone and Mr. Torrisi aren’t afraid to embrace a good cliché. Recall those chefs and food writers telling us that pasta is its own course, not a side dish, when you’re enjoying a springy cube of baked ziti with your chicken francese at Parm. Who cares what they do in Bologna? This is Mulberry Street.","Pizza knots, salami and eggs, giardinia pickles, cauliflower, baked clams, calamari, eggplant parm platter, meatball parm hero, turkey on a roll, Saratoga club, zeppole, zuppa di pesce (Fridays only)."

You know you will be bumped and jostled, but you don’t know which direction it will come from. Waiting at the bottleneck of the hostess’s stand, the blows land from behind, as more people struggle into the compressed entryway from the street. With no tables immediately available, you’re invited to wait at the bar, where all the stools are taken, so you stand in the narrow aisle between the bar and the tightly packed tables. Back and forth, servers protecting platters of pasta or empty glasses utter soft, “Pardon me’s,” hoping you will notice them. A woman sitting at the bar facing away from you erupts in laughter, sending her stool shooting back into your leg, a painful reminder of Newton’s laws of motion. Departing diners shrug into bulky coats, almost knocking you into the servers as they swing their arms. Just as you are about to indulge in aggressive impulses, the announcement comes: your table is ready. Deep breath. Lupa was a hit when it opened 12 years ago, and it continues to be today, judging by the crowds. A third of the tables are held for walk-ins, and if by chance you do want a reservation, particularly in the prime slot of 6:30 to 9:30 p.m., well, a month in advance is not too soon to try. Back in 1999, Mr. Batali and Mr. Bastianich had just embarked on their road to superstardom. Babbo was already a big draw, but Del Posto, Esca and Casa Mono were yet to come, as were their various triumphs in television, books, retail and wine. When Lupa opened, it was surprisingly inexpensive. Appetizers cost $5 to $9, and main courses $9 to $15, and I reviewed it then as a $25 and Under restaurant. That may seem laughable today, though it’s still relatively inexpensive. Still, as The New York Times has not evaluated Lupa since, I thought it was time to take another look. Over the years I’ve had meals there that I’ve very much enjoyed, including an unforgettable occasion about which I can say only that it involved a catheter, a martini and a very large hypodermic needle. Indeed, I was predisposed to like Lupa, though I had made it a practice to arrive only at off hours to avoid the crowds. Having now approached the restaurant in a more dedicated, critical way, at normal dinner hours, too, I’m left puzzled. Just as I wonder why people on the Upper West Side line up so patiently on Sunday mornings for mediocre brunches, I’m confounded by the people who subject themselves to the indignities of waiting for a table at Lupa. Is the food good enough to make it worth the aggravation? That’s a personal decision, though rewards do beckon. In retrospect, the original Lupa team was awfully impressive. Mark Ladner, who is still nominally Lupa’s executive chef, went on to four-star glory at Del Posto. Jason Denton, who led the front of the house, is now a partner in a half-dozen New York restaurants, including Betto and ’inoteca. Robert Bohr, an early sommelier, was a partner in the late, lamented Cru and is now a high-profile wine consultant. Today’s team is trying to maintain. The wine list, under the stewardship of Shin Tseng, is excellent, deep in most Italian regions, with many esoteric and moderately priced bottles as well. The food, under Cruz Goler, the chef de cuisine, strains to meet the demands of popularity. At its best it can be highly satisfying, but it’s inconsistent and sometimes has a slightly tired feeling. This is especially true of the wide selection of antipasti. On one visit, a dish of sardines, golden raisins and pine nuts was a perfect combination of briny pungency, sweetness and savory, nutty crunch. On another, the dish was simply fishy and salty. Similarly, on one occasion, the soft, forgiving texture and mild flavor of tiny octopus went beautifully with the richness of chickpeas. On another visit, the octopus was tough and flavorless. Sweet rounds of acorn squash were tasty enough, but served by themselves made for a dull platter. They were much more enjoyable another night, when yellow squash was mixed in. Many of the antipasti have a one-note quality, a blend of vinegar and sweetness repeated from one dish to the next, particularly apparent when you order a combination platter. On a more positive note, house-made salumi are superb, particularly the rustically earthy soft testa, or headcheese, and the coppa cotta, a gently spiced cured pork shoulder. Pastas are another story. These simple, humble Roman recipes are as satisfying as they are elemental, and Lupa blessedly resists the urge to gussy them up with additional ingredients or to lay the sauce on too thickly. Bavette cacio e pepe, spaghetti alla carbonara, bucatini all’amatriciana and a special one night of a spiral pasta with onion, red pepper and guanciale are all variations on the same theme (pepper, cheese, maybe some pork, onion or tomato), and they are all superb. So was feathery light gnocchi with tangy sausage, fennel and tomato, and pappardelle in a savory, spicy lamb ragù — no tomato. I loved a Tuesday night special of crisp, richly flavored duck in an agrodolce sauce, which balanced taut sweet and sour elements on a knife’s edge, and while thick slices of heritage pork were served plain, the meat flavors were pure and clear. Yet simplicity did not always benefit the main courses. Tender hanger steak with polenta and mushrooms was simply bland, as was bass with salt and olive oil. Saltimbocca (veal, prosciutto and sage) served like a giant omelet over escarole, and a Sunday special of pork shoulder stuffed with cheese, tomato and spices arrived in huge portions, too big to finish in one sitting, but very tasty for lunch the next day. If you have room, desserts like an olive oil torte with roasted pears are richly satisfying, while sorbettos are simply refreshing. If it’s late, you may want to linger over Lupa’s superb selection of digestivi, after-dinner drinks ranging from intensely bitter to sweet that are delicious whether you need one or not. At off hours — a late night, a midafternoon — Lupa continues to be delightful, satisfying and attentive. At prime times, Lupa feels more like commerce than cucina. I wish it were the other way around.",House-made salumi; sardines with raisins and pine nuts; bavette cacao e pepe; spaghetti alla carbonara; gnocchi with sausage and fennel; bucatini all’amatriciana; pappardelle with lamb ragù; duck agrodolce; heritage pork; saltimbocca; olive oil torta.

The guys in beards and knit hats have their place, as do the tattooed servers, the avant-garde wines and turn-of-the-last-century cocktailians, and all the rest. I love all that, of course. But occasionally I have guests with more uptown tastes. They prefer not to be physically challenged by seating arrangements that would daunt even spelunkers. They would rather not strain to hear over the pounding beat of a bartender’s iPod, or squint to decipher a graphically perplexing menu in the barest glow of candlelight. They do not go to restaurants to be challenged by chefs intent on transgression. I feel this way sometimes. Moody? You bet. If you want a restaurant where an earlier definition of civilized engagement holds sway, the gracious Monkey Bar at the Hotel Elysée on the East Side will do very well. As a restaurant, Monkey Bar is more storied in its own mythology than in actual history. It is the barroom that has, as they used to say about intriguing women, a past. But few will want to quibble with that mythology on entering the warmly lighted dining room, with its brass monkeys expressing all manner of human emotions, its Edward Sorel mural that commingles several eras in depicting New York’s urbane golden age, and its red leather curved booths beckoning to disarm you with their soothing embrace. Yet Monkey Bar is hardly retro, though Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, who was among a group that bought the restaurant in 2009, had exactly that in mind at the outset. Mr. Carter had a vision of the restaurant as a kind of clubby crossroads for fame and power. Those who already were in, were in, via a private reservations line. Anybody else had to e-mail for the predictable 5:30 or 10 p.m. runaround. As Frank Bruni put it in his New York Times review in 2009, “He fashions a fantasy New York where arrivistes bask in mutual recognition and reciprocal adoration, each mirroring the others’ sense of triumph, the unruly city edited down to one preposterously romantic room for the most unromantic of pursuits: back scratching and social climbing.” Monkey Bar, indeed! The crowd came at first, but didn’t stay for long. Perhaps the enduring appeal of F. Scott and Dorothy, Odets and Gershwin, didn’t stretch to a menu of hoary warhorses like lobster thermidor and clams casino. Ever the successful editor, Mr. Carter knew when tweaking was in order. He took on a new managing partner, Ken Friedman, who had mastered an entirely different sort of environment at the Spotted Pig, the Breslin and the John Dory Oyster Bar. Mr. Friedman, in turn, hired Damon Wise, who had been executive chef at Craft, to take over the kitchen. He put Belinda Chang, formerly the wine and service director at the Modern, in charge of the dining room and wine list, and added Julie Reiner, an owner of Flatiron Lounge, Clover Club and Lani Kai, as cocktail queen. The result is a refined but relaxed dining room, where crisp suits and ties are not out of place but Mr. Friedman swans about in creased blazer over untucked shirt, jeans and sneakers. Reservations? No worries, you can even use OpenTable. The demimonde has yet to return; it may never, but the overt effort at social stratification is past. Open seats abound, and the greeting feels warm and sincere. Mr. Wise overhauled the menu, eliminating the museum pieces. Instead, he offers a contemporary menu that is straightforward even though some of its complexities can seem puzzling and fussy. More often, they are simply delicious. Few things set as welcoming a tone as a skillet full of warm, glossy Parker House rolls, buttery and topped with coarse salt, as at the John Dory. Keep ’em coming! You may want to save one to dip into escargot, lardo and fennel, topped with a big soft egg. Pierced by a fork, it oozes out and embraces the ingredients into one savory whole. A square of lush braised pork belly, soft and sweet, came with fried oysters and what the menu terms Hatch Chili kimchi. I didn’t detect any kimchi, but the understated heat served as a gravitational force holding the components together. Nantucket bay scallops were sweet, rich and savory, as if they’d been salted and buttered internally. A round of foie gras torchon was so lavish and sumptuous, I could have eaten it without the brioche toasts. But dishes like raw yellowfin tuna with smoked mushroom, sea bean and slivers of radish; or cured hamachi, chanterelles, endive and cranberry, lacked internal logic. Main dishes crowd even more elements onto a plate. Every meat offering comes two different ways. Duck comes as tender breast and earthy, coarse leg, complemented by salsify and oyster mushrooms, as well as superfluous figs. Bacon-wrapped roasted pork loin and braised pork cheeks are so good that the busy-ness on the plate of bok choy, turnips and shiitake ravioli is amusing rather than annoying. Niman Ranch beef arrives in a medallion of sirloin and of glazed short rib, both tender and flavorful, served with black cabbage and hen o’ the woods mushrooms, a combination that works beautifully. As if to mimic the meats, halibut is cut into medallions like big sea scallops, served with hearts of palm cut like bay scallops, and in an oyster velouté with tiny squid and chorizo, which all enhance the fish. Yearning for simpler fare? Fettuccine is subtly smoked, then served with uni and hackleback roe, a smoky, salty, unctuous delight. But a côte de boeuf that can serve three was far tamer than the 28 days of dry aging promised, and an overcooked red grouper was served on a bed of cranberry beans that were, shall we say, al dente. You cannot go wrong with Ms. Reiner’s cocktails, and Ms. Chang has made great strides with the global wine list. Desserts are not to be skipped. From the sugary beignets, warm and fragrant, to robust yet subtle chocolate-hazelnut mousse with salted caramel brittle, to a beautifully seasonal steamed chestnut pudding, they attain the sophistication and wit that the other courses are still striving toward. Changing on the fly is never easy. But the Monkey Bar team has successfully traded in exclusivity for graciousness, while turning an embalmed menu into living, breathing cuisine.

272,Sushi Yasuda,3 star,"Nov. 15, 2011",Eric Asimov,Midtown East,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/16/dining/reviews/sushi-yasuda-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/16/dining/reviews/sushi-yasuda-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"WHEN a good friend insisted a few years back on dining by herself at the French Laundry, the renowned Napa Valley restaurant, I found it hard to comprehend. Wouldn’t she miss out on the communal relishing of shared flavors, delights and memories? Of course, she said. But more important to her was the opportunity to savor each nuance with unobstructed emotions, to laugh or to weep as the mood dictated, without the sort of inhibitions companions might pose. Her meal turned out to be exactly the uncompromised joy she had imagined. Being a somewhat stolid male, I have rarely found crying at the table to be an issue. Yet I have come to embrace my friend’s point of view when I visit exceptional sushi restaurants, and particularly Sushi Yasuda, the standout shrine to sushi now in its second decade on the East Side of Manhattan. Since it opened at the end of 1999, the trio of owners, Naomichi Yasuda, a master sushi chef; Shige Akimoto, the restaurant manager; and Scott Rosenberg, the business and design manager, staked the restaurant’s reputation on a pure, uncompromised expression of the traditional art of sushi making. They succeeded brilliantly. In 2000, William Grimes, The New York Times’s restaurant critic at the time, awarded Yasuda three stars. That was the last full review of Yasuda. Early in 2011, Mr. Yasuda retired to Japan, leaving the sushi-making operation in the hands of his disciples, Tatsuya Sekiguchi and Mitsuru Tamura. It seemed high time to pay Sushi Yasuda a return visit. Even with the equivalent of a full restaurant lifetime under its belt, when other places might want to renovate or at least freshen up their interiors, Sushi Yasuda continues to make a vivid visual impression. The dining room is surprisingly small, dominated by an L-shaped sushi bar. Within the room, the floor, ceiling, walls, tables and the sushi bar itself are all made of smooth blond bamboo planks, unadorned and saturated in light. No music intrudes. No wine list or cocktails to distract, although a small selection of sake and beer is available. Anything with the potential to divert attention from the food itself has been minimized or eliminated. The effect is to be transported to a calm sanctuary where one may experience sushi artistically, pleasurably and, dare I say, spiritually. Aside from the somewhat brusque experience of making a reservation — you are told when your meal will start and when it must end, issued a confirmation number and ordered to call back the day before your meal — Yasuda is a warm, friendly place. Servers will laugh and joke. While they may coax you in a particular direction, they rarely seem rigid, despite the fairly narrow parameters of the Yasuda vision. Here, the creative liberties taken with sushi are a world away. Avocado is an unknown. The chefs do not play around with seasoning, adding jalapeño here and mayonnaise there. Monstrous portions of fish do not overlap the rice like flopping fillets. The classic proportions endure. The restaurant takes pains to advise against overly liberal dousings of soy, wasabi or pickled ginger. No better opportunity may exist to take, on its own terms, what sushi has to offer. For better or worse, most people arrive with their own distractions: friends, loved ones, business companions. They may dine in small groups of four or six at the handful of tables, or in twos at the bar. I have done that myself, but I’ve come to believe that Yasuda is best enjoyed solo, at the bar. Here, one of the half-dozen chefs places himself at your service. You may order à la carte or pre-set combinations, but best is omakase (to let the chef choose), which may run around $100. It’s expensive, but a surprisingly good value compared with other sushi bars. Sashimi to start, he asks? Yes, please. The chef places a long, smooth bamboo tray before me, with a tangle of daikon, some pickled ginger and a bit of coarse salt on one end. Then, on the tray, giant clam, squid tentacles, thick slices of blue-gray mackerel and thin slices of white fluke. The salt is for the clam, and indeed it amplifies the rich flavor. Each item contrasts with the others, the depth of flavor of the clam, the texture of the chewy squid, the bracing freshness of the mackerel, the saline fluke. Now, a new tray and sushi. With quick, efficient movements, the chef slices and scores the fish. Without looking, he grabs a handful of rice, massaging it into shape. Regulars, it is said, can tell the chef by how the rice is shaped. A dot of soy, a slice of kanpachi (young yellowtail), and there it is in front of me. I pick it up with my fingers and place it on my tongue, fish-side down. It feels as if it’s melting in my mouth, the fish supremely pure and the rice delicate and subtle with a suggestion of vinegar and a hint of soy. The parade of sushi begins, each piece with an individual touch. A bit of coarse salt with buttery sea scallop; a few tiny leaves of cress with Spanish mackerel; a dollop of sweet soy on tender eel; sea urchin so intense, complex, subtle and soulful it sends shivers down my spine. With each piece, I close my eyes as I eat, concentrating on the exquisite flavor sensations. My shoulders relax. For a moment nothing exists but me and the sushi. Between courses I overhear the couple next to me starting to bicker. “I am not confrontational,” she says. “I want to know why you say that!” I retreat to my cocoon. A cooked dish arrives from a small selection of special appetizers: tiny delicate pieces of grilled monkfish liver, an oceanic foie gras. Then, a fresh sea-eel roll, a quietly delicious dish. And finally, omelet, both smoky and sweet, the perfect final flavor for a meal that was beautiful to observe, both in preparation and result, that stretched the boundaries of deliciousness and that offered a rewarding, though quick (under an hour) contemplative journey. One disheartening moment: I was served fatty bluefin tuna, prized yet horribly imperiled. I ate it. I can’t lie, I adored its richness and soft texture, which is like that of Kobe beef. But I did not enjoy it, and on subsequent visits I specified no tuna. With dozens of fish selections that change daily, I didn’t miss it. With its devotion to sushi in its purist form, unalloyed with other Japanese cuisines or American twists, Yasuda occupies a singular position in New York’s sushi landscape, even without Mr. Yasuda. It excelled back in 2000, and in 2011 it continues to meet its high standards.   Sushi Yasuda ★★★ 204 East 43rd Street, (212) 972-1001, sushiyasuda.com.

273,Saxon & Parole,1 star,"Nov. 1, 2011",Eric Asimov,NoHo,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/dining/reviews/saxon-parole-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/dining/reviews/saxon-parole-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"BRAD FARMERIE, the executive chef at the new NoHo restaurant Saxon & Parole, is nothing if not versatile. When his restaurant Double Crown, a culinary fantasy of British imperialism in Asia, closed this summer, Mr. Farmerie and his partners, AvroKO Hospitality Group, quickly created an entirely different mood, aura and menu in the same space, as if they were stagehands changing sets between acts at the Metropolitan Opera. The artifacts and tchotchkes meant to conjure up colonial nostalgia have been banished to the prop closet until the next go-round. The British-Asian mashup of a menu has gone the way of the empire, to live on through the rosy lens of memory until great minds decide it’s time to haul it back out. In its place the partners have rolled out an entirely different theme, though still centered on a lighthearted evocation of a sentimental past. Saxon and Parole were two 19th-century racehorses, you see. So what? So nothing, really. It’s simply a vehicle for AvroKO to create a vague sort of horsy ambience, part bluegrass men’s club, part Cracker Barrel, which in fact is warmly appealing. A large bar dominates the front room. Alongside are two sweet, human-scale dining rooms, with walls of weathered wood and whitewashed brick. Subtly stylish reminders of the stable abound: a sleek wagon-wheel chandelier here, stacks of horse blankets there, and of course renderings of the namesake nags on the wall. Downstairs is another room, done in brown leather, dark wood paneling and a wall of whiskey bottles. AvroKO cleverly consigns the loudspeakers of the restaurant’s sound system to the bar upstairs, so while they transmit a steady diet of blues, classic rock and soul into the dining rooms, it’s not intrusive enough to stymie conversation. Mr. Farmerie’s new menu is as carefully rendered as the design, emphasizing gutsy all-American fare that does not require the conceptual leaps inherent in Double Crown’s more academic approach. It reads of richness and abundance. All told, one sits down to dinner at Saxon & Parole anticipating warmth, good times and satisfaction. Will the expectations be fulfilled? Yes and no. As with so many current menus, composing a meal requires some complex calculations. Aside from appetizers and main courses, the menu teems with other choices, like what are described as “seasonal pots of deliciousness.” It’s a bit of a hype job, in truth. Chicken liver mousse, sweetened with port and pepper jelly, arrives in a glass crock. But it’s a bit too sweet, and besides, why stick a big sprig of frisée in the crock, hindering passage of knife to mousse? Other pre-appetizer possibilities include oysters, shrimp cocktail, towers of raw seafood, or, for those more inclined to turf, plates of charcuterie. One outlier among these simple presentations: a blend of chopped razor clams, egg, a little caviar and lemon aioli that is sort of a delicious, clam-intense version of lobster salad. Most of these dishes are unnecessary if you order conventionally, which clearly not everybody does. On one side of the dining room, young women drink cocktails and eat shellfish, pausing to have a waiter take group shots with each of their smartphones. Elsewhere, a dating couple share a hamburger and a single glass of wine, while at a large table a steakhouse-style office gathering is in progress, with beefy men guffawing, ties tucked between shirt buttons. As appealing as the menu seems, the rendering is inconsistent. A salad of diced roast beets with watercress, spiced pecans and feta is a superb composition, a blend of sweet and bitter, soft and crunchy. But another salad of endive, frisée and spinach with maple-glazed grapes seems ill-defined, dominated by the sweet grapes, which lack a contrasting flavor. Steamed leaves of brussels sprouts are draped with a poached egg and coated with a hollandaise flavored with truffle and yuzu, then topped with bits of pancetta, a melding of rich, comforting goodness. Then comes a carrot, ginger and lemon soup, with the intriguing addition of “toasted chili marshmallow.” Don’t bother. The marshmallow, which melts into the soup, combines with the carrot to make this otherwise underseasoned soup overwhelmingly sweet. Between these poles are decent, satisfying, unremarkable dishes, like a terrine of foie gras with a sweet, tangy peach and onion relish, and tender mussels in a tomato-and-caper broth. The highlight is an extraordinary burger that is a veritable explosion of umami. A big patty of aged beef is topped not just with a thick swatch of bacon and melted havarti, but with a fried egg as well. Does the funky tang come from the meat or the toppings? Hard to tell, but it’s altogether messy and delicious. One clue might be that the steaks, both a bone-in strip and a rib-eye for two, lack the same burst of flavor, though the menu says they have been dry-aged for 28 days. They are tender and beefy enough, but more satisfying steaks are easy to find. By contrast, a diminutive filet mignon, which in the days of our thoroughbred heroes might have been called a lady’s steak, was perfectly satisfying. Better choices include a moist, flavorful roasted half chicken that included both white and dark meat, not always a given no matter what a menu says, with a lively garnish of charred fennel, olives and sun-dried tomatoes. A Berkshire pork chop was likewise beautifully cooked, pink inside and full of porky flavor, with apple, quince and a salad of purple potatoes. A lobster, grilled and halved, was rich, buttery and tinged with lemon (and enticing with a side of pickled tomatillo), but a roasted branzino, stuffed with Parmesan and panko, was overcooked and tasteless. Service at Saxon & Parole is still a work in progress, well meaning and friendly but at times clueless. Once, the steak for two was simply set down with an empty plate, and left to me to divvy up. Things tend to lag, too, and fatigue can overcome a table as plates are left uncleared long after the eating has ended. That’s unfortunate, because several superb desserts await, including warm, feathery light cinnamon doughnuts, and Mother-in-Law’s Christmas pudding, just about the best fruitcake imaginable: moist, not too sweet, laced with beams of citrus and chocolate flavor. Ice creams spiked with booze are pretty tasty, too. The ambience at Saxon & Parole is pleasing. The new set is convincing. But a little more attention to consistency and execution in cooking and service could make the difference between win, place or show.

274,Salinas,2 star,"Oct. 25, 2011",Eric Asimov,Chelsea,Spanish,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/dining/reviews/salinas-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/dining/reviews/salinas-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"EVER since the center of culinary innovation shifted to Spain with the ascent of El Bulli and other like-minded restaurants, New York has been awaiting its own specimen of contemporary Spanish gastronomy. For some reason, it hasn’t happened, at least, not entirely successfully. José Andrés, a Spanish celebrity chef, has brought his brand of culinary alchemy to American cities as far removed as Washington and Los Angeles, but not to New York. GastroArte near Lincoln Center is better at undermining form than offering flavor, said Sam Sifton, who gave it one star in The New York Times earlier this year, when the restaurant was still known as Graffit. You can eat wonderful traditional Spanish food in New York (vast platters of paella, shrimp sizzling in garlic, Galician-style octopus, the world’s greatest ham) but the practitioners of contemporary Spanish cooking have yet to commit themselves to the challenge. Luis Bollo, the chef at Salinas, a Spanish restaurant in Chelsea that opened in June, is one who tried. Back in 2000, Mr. Bollo came from San Sebastián to open Meigas, a Spanish restaurant in Lower Manhattan that offered the full range of foams, gels and whiffs of essence. Perhaps the time, or the execution, was not quite right. Mr. Bollo soon abandoned what William Grimes, then The Times’s restaurant critic, called “the hocus-pocus,” and returned to solid, traditional cooking, including a soft succulent suckling pig that I can still taste to this day. But the restaurant closed in 2001. Mr. Bollo left town for almost a decade, opening restaurants in Connecticut. Now he’s back with Salinas, and New York’s Spanish restaurant culture is the better for it, even if he digs more deeply into traditions of Spanish cooking rather than probing its outward boundaries. You will not find hocus-pocus at Salinas, but you will find tripe, an ingredient that can make mature adults recoil in childish fear but in Mr. Bollo’s hands achieves a wonderful, belly-warming magic of its own. It is braised with tomato (and, shhh, veal feet, which add richness) to a point of melting tenderness, then served with bits of chorizo, ham, smoked paprika and, as a crowning glory, crisp little chickpeas that offer a perfect crunchy contrast. On a recent chilly night, this dish made me sigh. Salinas is long and narrow with three rooms. In front is a small bar and lounge. A middle section with a stone wall and long mirror looks vaguely like a split-level den. The rear, a wood-and-stone dining room with a gas fireplace and a nifty retractable roof, is where you want to be. In the warm weather it’s a gorgeous open-air dining room. In the chill, you don’t even know you’re in a courtyard. The dining room is incredibly dim, though. Anyone older than 40 will need an iPhone flashlight app to read the menu. I can’t remember which financial genius decided that a menu of appetizers and main courses was not enough. The pre-appetizer menu of small plates has made restaurant meals more expensive and more filling, and, in the case of Salinas, somewhat blurs the divisions. Classic, simple tapas like grilled bread spread with fragrant olive oil, garlic and tomato, or slivers of jamón Ibérico glistening with funky ham perfume are mingled with more complex starters like the tripe, or an elemental plate of large shrimp with garlic, white wine and lemon. Delicious, you’ve seen it before, and you can’t go wrong. Crujiente mahonés, flatbread topped with cheese, honey, thyme and sea salt, is likewise simple and irresistible, the spices combining almost like zaatar, the Middle Eastern seasoning. Not all the tapas selections achieve liftoff, though. Croquettes made of veal cheeks, mushrooms and apples were mushy and monochromatic. Certain ingredients, like the smoked paprika and all manner of pork, appear repeatedly in different guises, often to great advantage. Mr. Bollo’s pulpo appetizer is about as cutting-edge as anything gets on the menu. Slender coins of octopus (flavored with the paprika) are dropped on puréed potatoes like white pepperoni on a beige pizza, with crisp sautéed greens alongside. Though it has the visual appeal of a manila envelope, it’s an arresting take on the traditional pairing of octopus and potatoes. Equally lovely, and presented in more familiar form, are pumpkin-and-chicken soup, rich with broccoli rabe, potato and, of course, bacon and chorizo; and tender, earthy quail wrapped in bacon and served with juicy quince. Of course, we haven’t even gotten to main courses, which, thankfully, include Mr. Bollo’s suckling pig. If it’s not exactly the one I remember, it remains one fine piece of swine, soft and sweetly flavorful against the crisp, crunchy skin. Rosejat rápida is a brilliant dish in which crisp, short strands of fideo pasta are topped with chicken, chorizo, tiny cockles and saffron aioli, a smoky, savory bowl that one can easily inhale. Grilled chicken is served, naturally, with cubes of crisp ham as well as Swiss chard, garlic and a lemon sauce. The dish is moist and delicious in a way that other chicken breasts can only envy. For all the good that Mr. Bollo offers, his paella negra, in which the rice is turned black with squid ink, is fairly uninteresting. With the usual array of clams, mussels and fish (but no discernible pork), it was a routine rendition, and unaccountably salty on two occasions. One other criticism I can’t help making is of the wine list, which offers a preponderance of full-bodied, dense, powerfully fruity and oaky Spanish wines that don’t go very well with subtle foods. Easier-drinking options are not obvious, but I would suggest a white and red on the list, Zarate’s refreshing 2010 albariño and the 2006 Pirineos, made from the rarely seen parraleta grape grown in the Pyrenees region of Somontano. It’s perhaps too much of a concession to mainstream American restaurants that Salinas offers a pastel de chocolate for dessert, the usual molten cake by another name. Yawn, but it is well done. Equally familiar is a crema de vino, essentially a crème brûlée (or a crema Catalana) but flavored with Rioja, also well done. Best of all is the most classic, torrija caramelizada, simply a slender loaf of bread pudding exalted to a plane of high deliciousness, imbued with cinnamon, nutmeg and citrus, served with a scoop of coffee gelato for good measure. New is exciting, but old can be brilliant.   Salinas ★★ 136 Ninth Avenue (19th Street), Chelsea, (212) 776-1990, salinasnyc.com. ATMOSPHERE Dim and casual, polite and well appointed.

275,Tertulia,2 star,"Oct. 4, 2011",Sam Sifton,West Village,Spanish,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/dining/reviews/tertulia-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/05/dining/reviews/tertulia-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"SEAMUS MULLEN, a bearish young Vermont-raised chef with a sleeve of tattoos, was standing in the back of Tertulia last week, smiling damply in the heat and smoke of his open kitchen, as a wood fire crackled beside him and waiters in handsome plaid shirts dodged this way and that. The air smelled of smoke and garlic, pork fat and olive oil. Customers sat at high tables and low ones running east toward the bar and the restaurant’s front, some shouting, others straining to hear. Tertulia opened in August and is something of a scene: loud, crowded and hot both literally and metaphorically. Gwyneth Paltrow and Jay-Z had been in the restaurant earlier in the week, with Chris Martin and Beyoncé. (Twitter exploded. “What’s the German word for ‘acute regret over missed celeb sighting’?” wrote the essayist Sloane Crosley, who was in the restaurant at the time but somehow missed seeing them.) The atmosphere is that of a medieval bar as interpreted by the fashion editors of New York magazine. It is “Game of Thrones” in J. Crew and Uniqlo. Mr. Mullen picked up a plate of food from the work table behind him, where a large ham of Ibérico pig crouched within a vise, glistening in the harsh kitchen light. He used a white kitchen towel to clean the plate’s edge, and then delivered the result to a tall table next to his monster hearth: wide folds of amberjack, served on top of Asturian beans and silky roast peppers. The amberjack — wild-caught, out of Florida — was buttery, rich, tea-colored and a little smoky from a run over the fire. It melted on the tongue. The beans were creamy and substantial, their velvet richness augmented by the plush ermine nature of the peppers. They combined beneath the fish to serve as frame and amplifier. Eating it led to sighs and raised eyebrows, contented silence. The dish, consumed by two generally voluble men, was gone in a little under 60 seconds. It was all one of them could do not to order a second. Time was, an Irish guy from New England opening a Spanish taberna in the West Village would have led to howls from the food elites, and at least a few jokes about Pedro O’Hara. (There’s even an Israeli sommelier, Gil Avital.) But Mr. Mullen, who won plaudits for Boqueria, the Gramercy tapas bar where he was chef from 2006 until 2010, is cooking now at the very top of his game. You cannot get a proper cocktail at his new restaurant. (Mr. Avital will bring you some smoking-good Ribera del Duero if you ask.) The service is not sublime. Someone may during the course of a meal accidentally spill a glass of wine down the front of your blouse, or disappear when you desire the bill. Reservations are taken only for parties of six or more, and the temperature in the dining room sometimes rises to the level of a stalled No. 6 train. But these occasional discomforts aside, Tertulia is still great fun: a casual Spanish gastropub that sees its roots in the cider bars of northern Spain, and its success in a cuisine that is equal parts pork and seafood, salt and olive oil, garlic and smoked paprika. Pork is the restaurant’s first among equals, though Mr. Mullen does grill a marvelous lamb breast that he serves with creamy farro and cauliflower, glazed in sherry vinegar. (It is not giant, and works well as a shared appetizer.) He uses that Ibérico ham as everything from inspiration to condiment. He serves ruby-red slices of the stuff as an appetizer that is marvelous on its own, and outrageous paired with a plate of simple, rich pan con tomate. He saves scraps to mince into the béchamel he loads into oozing croquettes, and drapes thin slices over hot rice adorned with crisp snails and wild mushrooms, with a salad of celery and fennel. Smoked pork cheek arrives with a tiny quail egg. A special some nights brings grilled Ibérico pork ribs: crisp, succulent, luxurious. Seafood gets good billing as well. Mr. Mullen marries pickled anchovies to salted ones on toast kissed with olive oil, with soft sheep’s-milk cheese and slow-roasted tomatoes for taste and texture, the fruit complemented first by sherry vinegar and then a drizzle of aged balsamic for sweetness and wealth. He puts baby squid on a plancha to give them a soft crunchiness, and serves the result with peppery mustard greens and pine nuts dressed in strong-backboned poblano pepper vinaigrette. (Pass on the small, tasteless grilled clams.) Tertulia offers a number of large, shareable entrees in addition to the tapas; these are platos familiares, in the language of the menu. Chorizo criollo brings a bat of garlic sausage served above a sea of small Pedrosillano chickpeas, with melted Cabrales cheese that offers a creamy saltiness that improves both meat and legume. It is a perfect second course in a meal that starts with the pan con tomate and a beautiful autumn salad of squash and fried kale, mushrooms and pressed sheep’s-milk cheese, in a mushroom vinaigrette of slippery earthiness. Paella de mariscos presents a healthy ratio of rice to crisp soccarat, the crackly fond that develops on the bottom of a paella pan as it cooks over open flame. The dish is dressed in runner beans, sepia, shrimp and clams, and is almost as salty as it is sweet and smoky. Best bet: drizzle your plate with aioli and consider the matter until the food is gone. Those with world enough and time should consider a special of slow-grilled turbot that Mr. Mullen has recently been serving until he runs out of fish. Turbot is a flatfish with sweet white meat that can in the wild grow to prodigious size. (Juvenal wrote one of his satires about “a marvelous expanse” of turbot that was fit only for an emperor: it was too big to cook.) Farmed in saltwater pens in Chile and elsewhere, it now comes to market at roughly the size of a dinner plate, with a tenderness that places it somewhere in the region of saltwater trout. Mr. Mullen racks the fish in the fireplace with a coat of lemon slices and herbs and a belly full of smoked pig’s cheek, and tends to it carefully. The result is delicate, scented by oak and lemon, and extremely satisfying when paired with crisp potatoes showered in smoked paprika, and fried Padrón peppers covered in heavy sea salt. Finish with a caramelized rice pudding or some torrijas, if only to fill the dining room with the scent of the burning sugar as Mr. Mullen sears the food with a fire-heated brand. And add to the ranks of Harold Dieterle’s Thai-speaking Kin Shop another Manhattan amazement, another soldier in the army that marches against fake authenticity in the name of hard work and big flavors.  ","Pan con tomate, Ibérico ham, smoked pig’s cheek, anchovies, autumn salad, fried fairytale eggplant, croquettes, smoked amberjack, lamb breast, paella, rice pudding, torrijas."
276,Coppelia,1 star,"Sept. 27, 2011",Sam Sifton,Chelsea,"Caribbean, Latin, Latin American",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/dining/reviews/miss-lilys-and-coppelia-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/28/dining/reviews/miss-lilys-and-coppelia-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ONE is a self-styled Cuban diner, the other a Jamaican luncheonette. Neither serves steak au poivre. But two restaurants would seem to be making a run at the cool-kid crown left tarnished on the streets of Manhattan when a rent increase closed the French-accented Florent in 2008. Only one is open 24 hours, as Florent was: Coppelia, which the talented Mexican restaurateur Julian Medina opened on West 14th Street in April. The restaurant serves a wide-ranging menu of Latino food from across the Caribbean basin and into South America, and an all-day breakfast menu of the sort to delight barflies, insomniacs, late-rising drag queens and all those who thrill to the flavor of pressed Cuban toast with eggs. Coppelia is done up in sun-faded pastel hues, with blue-and-white tiles on the floor, a sea-foam pressed ceiling and lovely teal shutters along the west wall that evoke images of old Havana. A long marble counter runs opposite these, at which you can sit and drink café con leche and eat ropa vieja at dawn, reading a tabloid, considering options, feeling fuzzy or fine. The atmosphere is analgesic. It may not be a restaurant where you would want to celebrate a birthday or a promotion. For one thing, the liquor license has yet to come through, leaving patrons drinking watermelon juice and Jarritos soda. But Coppelia is exactly right for the morning after, and perhaps for the next couple of meals after that. Comfortable booths abound, as well as a few round tables for larger groups. In keeping with the diner theme, the menu is gigantic, running patterns from granola and yogurt all the way to steamed yuca, with stops for plenty of Spanish-style diner standbys along the way. (The tuna melt offers a smear of chipotle for heat.) Naturally, guacamole appears as well, spicy and citrus bright. Mr. Medina also has Toloache in the theater district, and two Yerba Buena restaurants downtown. They have left him with a reputation as one of Manhattan’s finest mashers of avocado. At Coppelia the dish keeps up his standing. Hamburgers and Cuban sandwiches are available, as well as empanadas and big salads. Mr. Medina even serves chicken wings, with a fiery chocolate-chipotle sauce that is not quite complex enough for mole. They are multifaceted all the same, a fine defense of the bar-food snack: crisp and fiery, with a sweet thrum in the sauce and jicama in place of celery on the side. The restaurant’s strongest suits may be found on the small list of main dishes. Ambition winks out from them, offering a hint of the seriousness that must underscore even the most casual of good restaurants in this city. That ropa vieja, for instance, is less a deconstructed version of the famous Cuban dish of “old clothes” than a gut renovation: beautiful shredded beef in a piquant tomato salsa, with soft peppers and rice and beans. Roast pork is wickedly moist in a slick of garlicky mojo, with chicharrons for textural balance. Shrimp are tossed in a fiery rum glaze. Arroz con pollo gets the jumble treatment, with scrambled egg added to a tossed bowl of chicken, red peppers and soft yellow rice. (Less impressive are the desserts, designed by Pichet Ong, a restless New York pastry chef whose inventive playfulness is at odds with Coppelia’s more basic vibe. Stick to his chocolate cake with dulce de leche buttercream, which is marvelous.) Best of all is lomo saltado, a stir-fry of Peruvian extraction that combines short ribs with soy sauce and vinegar, tomatoes and red onions, fried potatoes and rice. Mr. Medina’s version, served in a deep white bowl, is delicate, with tender ginger-flecked meat and fat, luscious tomatoes. These leak into the rice and potatoes, and provide a kind of solace to those eating dinner as the sun begins to make its way back up in the sky. MISS LILY’S FAVOURITE CAKES, meanwhile, is a Serge Becker production that opened this spring on Houston Street after a long-running battle with neighborhood residents that left the restaurant with only a beer and wine license. It is a tiny place (just 19 tables and a short bar) that serves a menu of slightly haute-ified Jamaican food. In keeping with Mr. Becker’s aesthetics (he also owns La Esquina and the Box), the staff at Miss Lily’s is as arresting as a tower of giraffes. The restaurant draws a (mostly!) corresponding clientele that can spur memories of Fashion Week crowds at Florent. Nearly everyone in the place appears tall and casually elegant; friendly, but a little otherworldly, as if resident in a game preserve. Very few people on Earth can eat jerk chicken and look as the people at Miss Lily’s do. But it is credible jerk chicken, for all that. Bradford Thompson, the restaurant’s French-trained chef, brines the birds and cooks them low and slow in a humid oven, then slathers the pieces in thyme-rich, allspice-fantastic jerk sauce, and crisps it hard on the grill. For those for whom hardship may be quantified as checking into Shutters in Santa Monica without a reservation, the result serves as a trip to the Kingston of the mind: jerk chicken as prepared by a private chef, with no possibility of getting lost on the way. Mr. Thompson’s smoked mackerel salad is also impressive: large moist flakes of the fish predominate, with a sweet bed of fresh greens and tangy pickled onions to bridge the two textures. If he served it to you in the main saloon of a yacht tied to a dock in Miami, you would be happy indeed, before pouring another glass of Sancerre and padding barefoot up to the flybridge to watch the stars. On Houston Street, served by what looks like a supermodel, you can achieve a similar state of mind. Too bad, then, that so much of the rest of the food falls short. The room is prettily designed and comfortable, with flags of the Caribbean covering speakers hung from the ceilings and a gallery of album covers on the walls in the back room, where a disco ball hangs. But this is not enough to make up for pineapple-glazed pork ribs that emerge from the oven tasting of gristle and bone, the meat cooked into papery irrelevance, or a jerk pork burger with all the flavor of a pressed wet sawdust patty, and mango chutney that hardly improves on what you might find in a jar. Oxtail stew with butter beans and rice and peas here costs $21. It would not rate on Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn at a third that price. (Bushman Vegan Plate, with jerk seitan, would perhaps score a beating.) Desserts, with the exception of a thick, rich coconut cake, are risible. The beauty of Florent was that it was entirely comfortable being what it was: a greasy spoon with good food, welcoming to all. Coppelia honors that tradition. Miss Lily’s does not.

277,St. Anselm,1 star,"Sept. 20, 2011",Sam Sifton,Williamsburg,"American, Steak Houses",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/dining/reviews/st-anselm-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/dining/reviews/st-anselm-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ST. ANSELM is a restaurant on Metropolitan Avenue in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, right where Havemeyer Street doglegs out of its run of wig shops and bodegas to become residential. It is an offshoot of Joe Carroll’s barbecue restaurant Fette Sau, across the street, and of his bar Spuyten Duyvil, next door. St. Anselm first opened in 2010 as a highbrow-lowbrow bar-food mecca, known primarily for foie-gras pirogies and a deep-fried hot-dog sandwich called the Newark Double. It closed soon after. In June, Mr. Carroll swapped out the fryers for a massive grill, and turned the place into a neighborhood restaurant devoted to the pleasures of open fire and good ingredients simply cooked. St. Anselm was reborn. Smart thinking. The new iteration is charming, with a pulsing bass line of ambition beneath its simple steakhouse melody. Yvon de Tassigny, the restaurant’s chef, has matched great live-fire technique to excellent groceries, and reveals himself to be a master of off-cut lamb and beef. And his iceberg salad, served below warm bacon vinaigrette that melts a scattering of blue cheese across the top and softens the exterior of the crisp lettuce, is among the great things to eat on the north side of Williamsburg. Like the real-life St. Anselm, the restaurant makes an ontological argument. If we can conceive of an affordable steakhouse on the same block as the Metro Line cab stand and the Brooklyn home of the Knitting Factory, then surely such a thing must exist. And here it is now: St. Anselm is Keens for the millennial set, a Bar Americain for the riders of fixed-gear bikes. It is particularly Keens-like in its preparation of lamb (and in its collection of rusty old saws on the walls, which stand in place of that restaurant’s clay pipes). Mr. de Tassigny offers two preparations. The first is a shoulder steak, simply served with compound butter and a drift of lime zest and mint chiffonade. Lamb shoulder is a fatty cut, and extremely difficult to grill without burning the exterior while undercooking the center. But judicious use of a water spritzer and some cool spots on the grill allow Mr. de Tassigny to beat the odds, and the result is a gamy success. Even better, though, is his saddle chop, which at Keens is called a mutton chop. Here it resembles the dough airplane in “The Night Kitchen” by Maurice Sendak. It is large, skirted with crisp fat, with a deep, mellow lamb flavor that is enhanced greatly by a marvelous puddle of mint-flecked yogurt. Eaten with the iceberg salad and a bowl of sweet, soft grilled fingerling potatoes, it makes for a robust and exciting dinner for two, inexpensive enough to be worth braving the crowds at the Bedford Avenue stop on the L train, five blocks away. A steakhouse must have steak. St. Anselm has hanger, served here under the old-fashioned title of butcher’s steak, and a massive rib-eye for two, with nearly a foot of frenched bone sticking out of it to give it its menu name: Axe Handle Rib Eye. The butcher’s steak in particular is a joy, tender and full of strong, beefy flavor that is winning even before the garlic butter on it melts away. And there is a pork chop, brined in bourbon and grilled into sweet submission. What this wide, golden hunk of protein lacks in presentation (it is a pork chop, sitting on a plate, no more) it more than makes up for in flavor: buttery and nut-sweet, with a whiskey kick that is as purely American as corn waving in a Tennessee field. The fires at St. Anselm touch more than meat, however. Late-season tomatoes come off the grill to pair with soft burrata cheese and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar in a simple combination that belies the brains behind it: the slight char on the fruit elevates the dish beyond its already high station. Shishito peppers secure a similar fate, their generally mild spiciness (though there is always one spark plug in every bowl) enhanced by the grill’s heat and made beautiful through the application of salt and lime. A set of three eggplants (Italian, Thai and Japanese) wears its smokiness with pride, and pairs amazingly with a small puck of fried goat cheese and a tangle of deeply sweet, dark caramelized onions. Mr. de Tassigny has a particular affinity, as well, for fish. Flame-licked sardines (eat ’em whole!) arrive as an appetizer portion aside a stack of lotus-root pickles. A whole mackerel is dressed in lime, its soft grilled white meat coming off the backbone in meaty flakes as if to make an argument in favor of this slim, cylindrical beauty as Branzino 2.0. Scallops, which often fail on the grill, get Mr. de Tassigny’s close attention, and rise to his occasion. They are sweet and smoky at once, the Swisher Sweets of bivalves, excellent with a side order of grilled long beans. Some caveats to all this praise. The grilled clams on the appetizer menu are invariably Manila: small, farmed and flavorless despite their garlicky bath. With extensive Atlantic clam flats so close to New York City, it is a shame Mr. Carroll and Mr. de Tassigny do not take advantage of them. Shrimp salad spooned into a lightly grilled avocado half is not very pretty, and hardly makes up for it in matters of flavor. Avocado is known as the mayonnaise of the vegetable world. Grilled, it becomes its mud. And there is no pastry chef, so desserts get the short shrift they so often do in steakhouses: a passable take on grilled s’mores with strawberries; a jiggly bread pudding; a jar of peanut-hazlenut butter served with chunks of local dark chocolates. It is do-it-yourself Reese’s. St. Anselm is, finally and most of all, a Williamsburg restaurant, with all that this entails, down to the smart-aleck mix of rock music (not too loud) on the stereo. Some attitude from the floor staff may be expected if you are not within the demographic that lives within bicycling distance, or if you have no facial hair, visible tattoos or interesting eyewear. “I just want to tell you,” said one of the servers one night, smiling tightly at my two young children. “There are no substitutions made here. We don’t have a children’s menu.” Nor does St. Anselm serve hard alcohol, which at that moment was unfortunate. Of course, the kids tore up their meal and demolished dessert. Then they pitched out on the street. “That lady was a little mean,” one said.","Grilled sardines, iceberg salad, grilled eggplants, grilled steaks, pork chop, lamb saddle, mackerel, scallops, grilled potatoes, long beans, shishito peppers.

278,Craft,3 star,"Sept. 6, 2011",Sam Sifton,Flatiron,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/dining/reviews/craft-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/07/dining/reviews/craft-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"LIKE drawing a circle or walking a high wire, the act of cooking simple food well requires years of training and experience, and a self-confidence that must sail close to arrogance. Above all, it requires mastery of the intersection of culinary talent and acquired knowledge. For a shining example, look no further than Craft, the plush and expensive American restaurant Tom Colicchio opened on the edge of the Gramercy district in spring 2001. There is no overt theatricality to the food at Craft. Its presentation is simple, even plain. But such simplicity belies a truth about the restaurant’s cooking. There can be no hiding behind artifice. No lipstick is available for the pigs. So if there are heirloom tomatoes on the menu, they must be the right ones, picked at the correct moment and served today, or the dish is a failure. If there are to be chanterelles, beautiful beneath a sheen of butter, they cannot be cooked three seconds past the point of transcendence, or the dish becomes a soggy mess, an $18 insult. Roast sturgeon, simply that, no more or less than the fish itself? The fish must be coaxed into that state without losing its essence, or the dude will not abide. Those may be roast scallops sitting plain on a plate. That may simply be arugula dressed in lemon and olive oil. But there is nothing simplistic about either dish. Indeed, each bite is a surprise and a delight, a snapshot of excellence that is rarer than it seems. A decade ago, soon after Craft opened, William Grimes of The New York Times awarded the restaurant three stars. It has not been reviewed by The Times since. “Quiet magic,” Mr. Grimes said of the food then, citing the high quality of the ingredients and the “masterly handling” of them by the restaurant’s staff. This is still the case, though Marco Canora, then the restaurant’s chef de cuisine, has moved along, and Mr. Colicchio has become a television star and expansion-minded businessman, with restaurants and sandwich shops in Los Angeles, Dallas and Las Vegas, among other locations. (Other Craft alumni include Jonathan Benno of Lincoln, Karen DeMasco of Locanda Verde and David Chang of the Momofuku mini-empire.) James Tracey, who was on the original kitchen team for the restaurant, is now its executive chef, and responsible for its daily operations. Mr. Tracey is a skillful interpreter of Mr. Colicchio’s menu and his culinary values, which seem distilled at this point to a simple demand for excellence in both ingredients and their preparation. The philosophy of Craft is craft. The restaurant’s storied dry-aged porterhouse remains a thick and juicy marvel on Mr. Tracey’s watch, with wide, crusty rectangles of beef that are best paired (one man’s opinion) with hen-of-the-woods mushrooms when they are available, some roasted shishito peppers and the gnocchi that are the same butter-laden pleasure bombs Mr. Grimes raved about in 2001. Mr. Tracey’s salad of butter lettuce built around a deep-fried “six-minute” boiled egg is a silken delight. Beets and tarragon can hardly improve on themselves. Nor can luscious roast chicken that might have you cooking birds at home for a month of Fridays, trying to get that taste back in your mouth. The Craft menu is somewhat less aggressively do-it-yourself than it was a decade ago, when diners were forced to build their own dinners from lists of proteins, sauces and styles of preparation. This is to the good, since it is unlikely that many diners left to their own devices would have come up with a dish as sneakily delicious as the restaurant’s soft pork ravioli paired with butter and Steen’s cane syrup, or its spellbinding risotto with bacon and corn. Also to the good is the wine list, now run by Greg Majors, who was at Cru. Mr. Majors is an affable, bearded presence on the floor of the Craft dining room. He is well worth flagging down for advice, and excitement, as his suggestion of an $80 bottle of superfunk Macchiona from La Stoppa in Emilia-Romagna proved one evening, for a dance with Mr. Tracey’s beautifully fatty roast Rouen duck. The restaurant retains the same masculine-minimalist aesthetic it had when it opened, with a constellation of Edison bulbs hanging from the ceiling, and surfaces made of concrete and leather, terra cotta and unprocessed steel. (The soundtrack, as at all of Mr. Colicchio’s restaurants, runs to dad-rock classics and NPR-approved alternative country.) The tables are wide, bare, refectory-style surfaces that provide a comfortable stage for the food, which is served family style. Lights are kept low and candles flicker, and a wide abstract horizon by the artist Stephen Hannock runs across the restaurant’s rear wall. A decade into its run, the restaurant remains comfortably modern in tone, perhaps even more so than it was at its beginning. It suggests dinner at a wealthy friend’s well-burnished downtown loft. Desserts at Craft come courtesy of Jennifer McCoy, who came to the restaurant in summer 2010. Ms. McCoy is a talented maker of ice creams and sorbets, and of a classic pain perdu with caramel and crème fraîche. And her take on s’mores, with chocolate-peanut butter mousse, is exceptional, with a smoked salt sherbet that recalls the best work of her most noted predecessor, Ms. DeMasco. Mr. Colicchio keeps his office at Craft and cooks in the restaurants on some nights. (I never saw him, in numerous visits over the course of the last two years.) Other evenings find him behind the stove at Colicchio & Sons, his restaurant in Chelsea, or checking on Crafts in Dallas or Los Angeles. He spends some days each year judging new episodes of his “Top Chef” competition show on Bravo (saw plenty of those!) and presumably fewer than he would like casting a fly line from his fishing boat in Block Island Sound. He has books to write, advertisements to film, the businesses to manage. But his flagship restaurant is as magical and delicious as it was when it opened, and it is all the more exciting for that.

279,456 Shanghai Cuisine,1 star,"Aug. 30, 2011",Sam Sifton,Chinatown,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/dining/reviews/456-shanghai-cuisine-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/31/dining/reviews/456-shanghai-cuisine-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ROUGHLY 200 years ago, in the 1970s, there was a nice little restaurant on Chatham Square in Chinatown called 456, which served mild, salty-sweet southern Chinese specialties accompanied by gallons of hot tea: cold sesame noodles, dim sum, pork in brown sauce, stir-fried greens with garlic. The restaurant was popular with the sort of middle-class urban pioneers who would later resemble the parents in the Noah Baumbach film “The Squid and the Whale.” It was cheap and good and tolerated the presence of children learning to use chopsticks. It shut down at roughly the same time those pioneers’ first marriages did, leaving only fond memories in the minds of the progeny: sepia dumpling nostalgia. Now a grandson of one of the original owners, Zhou H. Li, has returned the 456 name to Chinatown, having opened 456 Shanghai Cuisine on Mott Street. Mr. Li, the restaurant’s chef and one of its owners, serves outstanding soup dumplings and fried fish, cold noodles and stir-fries. For those who have prematurely mourned Manhattan’s Chinatown, or simply declared its primacy lost to the size and variety of the one in Flushing, Queens, 456 is a sign of health. The setting is dropped-ceiling bland, with a few plants and paintings for color. This is in keeping with the neighborhood’s restaurant history: 456 resembles nothing so much as a Chinese restaurant in Chinatown. Behind a shiny storefront and plate-glass window, the dining room runs crowded and bright back toward a hectic prep area replete with garbage bags and a dumbwaiter. The kitchen is down a flight of sticky stairs, next to restrooms that are dodgy at best. Tourists in socks, sandals and money belts take up many tables, forking at Chinese-American food and discussing fake watches and handbags. The scene is not promising. But pleasures await in the soup dumplings known on the menu as steamed juicy pork buns, and to the mandarins of Chinese food in New York as xiao long bao, or XLB. The xiao long bao at 456 are small and delicate one-bite numbers, with smooth, almost translucent skin below their rippled crowns. Served in bamboo steamers with the traditional accompaniment of black vinegar and slivers of ginger on the side for acidity and zip, they provide bites of uncommon flavor, both in plain pork and in a supercharged and slightly funky crab-and-pork version. As crucial to good xiao long bao as the quality of the dough is that of the porky broth within it. (To make the soup, cooks make a sort of aspic that can be cut into cubes and placed within the dumplings. Steaming melts these, leaving liquid.) And the broth at 456 is excellent, pure of flavor in that way that only a bone-brewed stock can be. Superlative broth appears in some of the casserole dishes, as well, including a vigorous one that combines mysterious pig fragments with chunks of cured ham, bamboo shoots and ribbons of tofu skin tied into delicate knots. Other worthy starters at 456 include a dish known here as fried tiny buns with pork: large, leavened white buns cooked crisp against a hot wok on one side, and topped with sesame seeds. Inside: ground pork and more soup-dumpling broth, a combination that provides soft and crisp, liquid and solid all in one bite. So it is a dumpling heaven. The restaurant’s cold sesame noodles are not slouchy, though, with a nice kick above their silkiness. Combine these with a scallion pancake with beef and some turnip pastry pies to make a fine dim-summish late-morning meal, Shanghai style. Just add soup: the sweet and delicate chicken and corn potage is chief among them, chunky and soft. Dinner or hearty lunch brings great opportunity, though it is crucial to bypass the spicy double-sautéed General Tso’s beef and broccoli options that sit on so many tables here as a sop to commerce. Persevere! As the bumper sticker says: Demand Real Shanghai Food. For instance: fried yellow fish (croaker, really), narrow cutlets of which are wrapped in tofu skins and deep-fried into lusciousness. (There is another version, with a batter run through with minced seaweed. It is much less successful: doughy and dry, with a patina of grease.) The same fish is available, as well, with fried pork chops, served here as Ning Bo Fried Two Delights — delightful, indeed, with the nicely crisp pork alternating with the fish. Large groups may wish to consider the restaurant’s pork shoulder in honey sauce. It is a huge, deflated football of meat and skin and fat, napped in a rich, sticky red sauce that is less sweet than its name would indicate, just as unctuous and much better, served with bok choy. (It is a poor man’s bo ssam dinner at Momofuku Ssam Bar, perhaps: $14.95 against a cool $200.) Steak Chinese style achieves a similar effect with velveted beef and a black pepper sauce. More delicate in presentation, but still powerfully intense, is a bowl of sautéed eels with chives, deep in a pleasant oiliness that is cut first by the oniony zing of yellow leeks (as ever, there is no truth in advertising), and then by a healthy dose of ground black pepper applied by the waiter tableside, and stirred into the dish with a flourish. It is rich and restorative in texture and taste, a kind of mental health food. The vegetables, cooked fast in a hot wok with garlic, are also quite accomplished, and provide counterbalance to the meats and fats and sugars. Sautéed baby eggplants in garlic sauce are a crisp/soft marvel. And amaranth greens, sometimes available, make for a fine partner to the steak. (More often it is bok choy, or Chinese broccoli.) Dessert is oranges, of course, alongside the modest check — though there is a sweet red-bean pancake on the dim sum menu if more sugar is required. Service is brusque and efficient. Tea comes quickly, as does beer. The restaurant is both the simplest and most marvelous of discoveries in a city that undergoes constant change: a Chinatown restaurant of the old school and new generation, a taste of the past and present combined. 456 Shanghai Cuisine ★ 69 Mott Street (Canal Street), Chinatown; (212) 964-0003.

It was early evening on a deep-summer Sunday in Bushwick, Brooklyn, in the dining room of Roberta’s, one of the more extraordinary restaurants in the United States. Rock music throbbed just loudly enough to diminish the poppy noise of a large dance party outside in the garden where the restaurant grows its herbs and some of its vegetables. The rough wooden tables inside were packed: neighborhood scenesters in tattoos and skinny jeans; black-car chauffeurs with ties pulled loose; gastronaut moms and dads in from Manhattan to feast. Fans whirled. People sweated, and none more than the servers, running back and forth between the tiny kitchen and the wood-burning oven near the front door. Drenched, one left the floor to change and returned in a black T-shirt marked with the restaurant’s name. There were pizzas on some tables. There are always pizzas on some tables at Roberta’s and have been since the restaurant opened in 2008, when there was no gas in the kitchen and no liquor license and no heat in the winter save what came off the oven. Roberta’s pizzas are marvelous things, of no particular geographical provenance. They are just good ingredients married well, then cooked in hot, fragrant smoke and quickly served. You can always have those. For the last two years, though, and increasingly over the last 12 months, the pizzas have been joined by the more-formal fare that a gas stove and huge ambition can create: delicate salads of foraged greens and home-grown flowers, cured meats of great complexity, painterly pasta dishes, aged roasted meats. Carlo Mirarchi, the chef and, with Brandon Hoy, Chris Parachini and Gabe Rosner, an owner, is devoted to a spare and elegant style of cooking that can come as something of a surprise if you are seated next to a table of young women in low-cut rompers gesticulating with iPhones and packs of Parliaments while arguing over whether to order the Banana Hammock pizza, with peppers and béchamel, or a plain pie. Because here is some delicate little purslane from a woman down the street who grows it in her yard, dressed in light goat’s-milk yogurt cut through with a wisp of lemon zest, with a few curls of shaved aged gouda and precisely five blueberries. Here is a small plate of Japanese cuttlefish heads rolled tight and sliced thin, then seared, served with nectarine nectar and tiny leaves of purple basil, with thin-sliced jalapeño for zip. Here is a carpaccio of Wagyu served with gooseberries, peppery watercress and small dabs of caviar, an outrageous and impeccable combination. These are extremely beautiful plates of food, artfully designed. The cuttlefish, in particular, would not look out of place on a starched tablecloth at Per Se. They are delicate of flavor, free of excess fats or salts, as pure an expression of new American cuisine as you are likely to find anywhere. It is shocking, and wonderful, to eat them in this cinder-block garage space six stops into Brooklyn on the L, a ratty old ski lodge built for bums interested in food rather than powder. There are no cloth napkins or tablecloths at Roberta’s, no comfortable seats. Christmas lights provide mood lighting, and urban detritus and flea-market finds the art on the walls. The service is excellent, however, far more polished than the setting would suggest. Roberta’s may appear an unlikely cathedral to such culinary excellence. It is no less a cathedral for that. Mr. Mirarchi’s is a kitchen poetry that is much, much more difficult to create than it seems. His food often looks austere. Its flavors just as often explode in your mouth. Take an entree he has had on the dinner menu recently: lamb breast, with mint, scallion and yogurt. The dish appeared to be a simply roasted rectangle of boneless meat that resembled a pork belly in size and wobbly succulence, with a crisp, salty crust. Its excellence seemed effortless, as if merely the product of smart shopping and a hot oven. Except: You ever look at a lamb breast taken off the bone? It looks like something you might use to wedge beneath a barn door to keep it from closing. Mr. Mirarchi uses meat glue to join two breasts into a more manageable rectangle, then presses the result overnight to set the bond. The next day, the lamb is placed in sealed plastic bags in a low-temperature circulating water bath and left to cook, again overnight. The process imparts a texture and depth of flavor that is dumbfounding. Eating this lamb was like discovering something new, like eating lamb for the very first time. The cost: $18. More magic disguised as plain figs on a plate: agnolotti stuffed with taleggio, with nasturtium. The ravioli pop in the mouth, releasing a small burst of perfectly melted cheese. It is a Shanghainese soup dumpling with an Italian accent, and thus as American as Fords and Moxie. (Mr. Mirarchi uses gellan gum to keep the melted cheese stable in the pasta package, else it might separate.) Repeated visits offered chances at house-cured prosciutto that was almost creamy in texture, and at a sweet-peppery salad of roast carrots with thick carrot purée and smoked ricotta. Also at fairy tale eggplants with arugula, lemon and pats of mascarpone; at a bowl of sweet corn kernels with purple basil, scallion and tomato; at pizzas covered with speck and mushrooms, mozzarella and oregano, set atop blistered and excellent crusts. There was for dessert one night a sorbet of sweet tea that called for cheers and posed pictures. On another, a plain baguette and small pot of butter, both of them housemade, presented a good argument for moving into the restaurant full time. A wine list that is dramatically larger and better than it was at the restaurant’s start — heavily Italian, with many options in the $30-to-$60 range — would make that life no great hardship. Roberta’s takes no regular reservations. But you can secure a table for Mr. Mirarchi’s tasting menu of a dozen or more small plates, which offers much of the regular menu along with some delicacies from his laboratory that are among the craziest and most delicious in the city. These reservations are hard to come by. Roberta’s offers the menu only two nights a week, for one table each night: a maximum of eight people a week. Arranging the meal may take a couple of months. But. Golly. You ought at least to try: scallops topped with head cheese and plum juice; sautéed black-throated perch over sea urchin sauce with sea beans; watercress sorbet. A dry-aged duck in particular, its fat gone the color and flavor of cheese below its tightened skin, managed to trigger a dopamine rush, the thick complexity of its flavor making a mockery of almost all ducks that had come before. The dish had but a slice or two of breast on the plate, above a tangle of thigh meat, some pickled cherries and sweet chanterelles, and it was difficult to imagine eating any more of it than that. The waiter smiled then and returned to the table with slices of steak, a Wagyu-Angus rib-eye aged 90 days, thick crusted, perfectly marbled, with fingerling potatoes, morels, purple scallions and astringent spigarello. Later there would be pizza — a cheese course — more sorbet and a glass of Fernet just to make it possible to breathe. For eight people a week, Roberta’s is a three-star restaurant, no matter the paper napkins or hard wooden seats. For many more in the neighborhood, collapsing into the room after a long afternoon or evening of dancing or making art, it is an amazing one-star one: a place for pizza and a beer. And for the rest of us, staring at the subway map, tracing our fingers east along the L line? Roberta’s and Mr. Mirarchi: two stars.",Pizzas; purslane salad; corn salad; fairy tale eggplant salad; cuttlefish; octopus; carpaccio; agnolotti with cheese; trofie with razor clams; lamb breast; pork chops; steak; sorbets; chef’s tasting menus.

Danji is not a particularly comfortable restaurant. Customers perch on stools along the bar or at high tables in the front of the room, or wedge into the few tables in back. There are just 36 seats. It gets quite hot in the dining room, as at a crowded party in a small apartment. Dinners proceed not as planned, leisurely affairs, but as fast-casual turn-and-burns: you get small, shareable plates and some drinks, and then make room for the next set of customers. You would not want to do business at Danji, unless your business involves knees touching and the thrill of discovery. So stipulated. (A cold OB beer or glass of soju may help.) Now slide your menu out of the drawer that hides just below the surface of each table. It is time to graze. Danji works best if you buck the trend and eat a great deal as leisurely as you can, building a tasting menu out of the tapas. (The plates run $6 to $18.) Start with a pairing off the “traditional” list, of spicy whelk salad and a small pile of buckwheat noodles. This ought to be protected by the Marriage Equality Act. The tender little whelks are poached French-style with a mirepoix cut through with lemongrass, garlic and ginger, and dressed in a sauce of gochujang, a Korean hot chile paste, that has been muted with rice vinegar and mirin, grated garlic and ginger. Across from them sit fat noodles of the Japanese soba variety, glossy with that same hot sauce, along with honey and soy, some watercress, slivered red onions, chives. They are each other’s best friends. Order more noodles: japchae, glassy little numbers off a family reunion table in Seoul, sweet and salty with sesame oil and soy, with hints of ginger and garlic to romance the accompanying julienne vegetables and a small mound of barbecued beef. Have a crisp little pancake of scallions and Korean peppers, or the seafood version if it is available as a special. You will benefit from some kimchi as well, made for the restaurant by Mr. Kim’s mother-in-law. There is Napa cabbage, of course, among other varieties: cucumber, of late, and ponytail radishes. Ignore for a moment the obvious sops to Western palates and tapas-loving cocktail drinkers: the bulgogi sliders on the “modern” menu; the “K.F.C.” fried-chicken wings; the kimchi, bacon and chorizo “paella” that reads like a midnight Twitter posting from a chef in his cups. But only for a moment! Sliders may be a goofball trend like cupcakes or Korean fried chicken. That doesn’t make them bad. (You can pass on Danji’s wings, though: unremarkable, even a little pallid.) That paella is nice, too: hot and weird below a fried Jidori hen egg, bright as the sun. And the bulgogi slider, crisp at its edges, turns out to be packed with the sweet thrum of Asian pear and the salty hush of soy sauce, with smoky sesame oil and the deep, steely taste of good beef. It provides excellent eating beneath its pickled cucumbers and mesclun-amped scallion salsa, on a soft grilled bun. A pork-belly version does, too, caramelized and fiery with gochujang and a finishing oil made from the seeds of hot peppers. Appetizers? Entrees? All Danji’s dishes are small. One exception on the traditional menu is the poached sablefish with daikon, which ought to be eaten with rice: the luscious fish and chopstick-tender daikon swimming in a dark, lovely braise of Mr. Kim’s beloved soy, garlic, ginger and Korean red pepper, with a splash of dashi and a fine julienne of ginger to lighten things up. It explains in a single bite the concept of umami. (Another big fellow: the restaurant’s classic DMZ meat stew, a staple of Korean restaurants that combines bits of hot dog and Spam, pork belly, kimchi and ramen noodles in a spicy broth.) On the “modern” side of the menu is a dish marked simply tofu with ginger-scallion dressing. It is magical. Mr. Kim rolls rectangles of fresh tofu in potato starch, then flash fries them and tops the packages with crisp bits of fried tempura batter and a few slices of hot pepper along with the ginger and scallion. By the time the dish reaches the table, the starch has softened to create a skin over the creamy tofu that is elastic and not dissimilar to mochi, the Japanese glutinous rice paste. Two orders for four people seems correct. More traditional is the steak tartare. It is a version of the classic Korean dish yook hwe, which often marries long strands of partially frozen beef to thin ones of Asian pear, sesame oil, soy sauce and gochujang, topped with a raw egg yolk. All those ingredients are present here, though in fancy form (a quail egg, Creekstone beef, pear purée). But Mr. Kim, who worked at Daniel, eschews freezing the meat and, with his fine dice and careful plating, makes the dish seem exactly as if it might be served with a plate of fries at Benoit or Balthazar. It could be colder, perhaps. But it is pretty great. Not that everything at Danji is. There is no need for grilled corn with a cheese aioli and spicy mayonnaise here or perhaps at any other restaurant; fried calamari with wasabi mayonnaise is unnecessary except to accommodate those for whom a menu with no calamari is no menu at all; there is no real dessert on offer. And even if you stall your way through the menu, ordering in waves of food, a meal at Danji goes by quite quickly. Meanwhile, the crowd waiting up by the bar for tables stares bullets if you linger.

282,Boulud Sud,2 star,"Aug. 9, 2011",Sam Sifton,Upper West Side,Mediterranean,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/dining/reviews/boulud-sud-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/10/dining/reviews/boulud-sud-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"TO the list of terrific Daniel Boulud restaurants in Manhattan, add this Lyonnais chef’s first significant gesture toward the sea that laps at the South of France and Spain to its west, then stretches across to Africa and east to the Levant. Boulud Sud is the Manhattan equivalent of a private yacht anchored off Monaco, serving the food of Sardinia, Greece, Tunisia, Gibraltar, Beirut. And you are invited along. Here are sardines marinated in slick oil and pungent vinegar, with toasted pine nuts for texture and white raisins to bridge the sour and sweet. Iberico ham with grilled pan con tomate — a dish seemingly made of time and water and sun, happy pigs and spitting fires. Beautifully charred squid with bits of chorizo and a tumble of Swiss chard, with tapenade for salt. Spiced duck wrapped in pastry, with date chutney: soft and rich. Harissa-fired lamb, tender and grassy, with yogurt sauce and Algerian eggplant. Just add a glass of rosé from Bandol, and “War Horse” at the Vivian Beaumont to follow. You can always come back after for more, or for a hot dog at Mr. Boulud’s new Épicerie Boulud on the corner, next to Bar Boulud, where come to think of it you might also go, just to score a frisée salad and a glass of Côtes du Rhône. Forget the boat. Stay in New York City. Boulud Sud stretches out beige and sunny along West 64th Street, all open dining rooms with curving ceilings that evoke Cunard ships and Fred Astaire. It is connected to Bar Boulud via the basement, where the two restaurants share restrooms. You could stage a farcical romantic comedy in them, with Justin Timberlake hustling between Katherine Heigl (his fiancée, pouting at Bar Boulud) and Anne Hathaway (his true love, at Boulud Sud), then getting lost downstairs. Mr. Boulud could have a cameo, perhaps playing a hairdresser. (In 10 years, at the rate he is going, Mr. Boulud will have annexed Café Fiorello, Bar Boulud’s neighbor to the south, to make it into a supermarket and liquor store, then jumped across Broadway to run the Grand Tier restaurant at the Metropolitan Opera, and perhaps worked a deal to cater socials at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints up the street.) The real star of Boulud Sud is its executive chef, a young Briton named Aaron Chambers, whose white-jacketed upper body can occasionally be glimpsed through the narrow pass into the restaurant’s open kitchen. Mr. Chambers, 30, has put in time at Raymond Blanc’s Manoir aux Quat’Saisons in Oxford, and Mr. Boulud’s Café Boulud on the Upper East Side, where he rose to be the executive sous-chef. He cooks with a silken French-trained style that turns out to be appropriate to the menu and the environment. Mr. Chambers’s food may have its roots in the coastal beauty and casual quayside culture of the Mediterranean. But it looks divine, court-ready. He is a cobbler selling formalwear espadrilles. To wit: Saffron linguine with razor clams and dark little clumps of bottarga is a delight, Cezanne-yellow, lemony and sweet, then briny and butter-rich. There is a strong argument for having the dish in addition to whatever else you order. Rosemary-threaded scallops with snow peas and a drift of scallion polenta offers more hearty pleasures, though the entree is no less beautiful in composition, sitting above a swoosh of soft grains, placed on the rectangular plate as if ready for auction. Bid now! The menu at Boulud Sud is, most of the time, divided into a Café Boulud-like grid of items from the sea, garden and ranch. (An abbreviated pre-theater menu runs from 5 to 7 p.m., broken up into a more traditional three-course format. It is a bummer for those eating early only because they could not get a reservation at 7:30 or 8.) Meals begin with shareable tapas and build through appetizers up to heftier fare that includes a now apparently requisite dry-aged rib-eye steak for two, served with wild mushrooms, taggiasca olives and crushed potatoes with olive oil. A diner’s best bet for flavor and value is to concentrate on the start of the menu, sharing a somewhat larger variety of small plates with the table than usual, and ordering perhaps one fewer entree. There is a marvelous summery wine list to match the food, courtesy of Michael Madrigale, who also runs the cellar at Bar Boulud, and he guides it well. (So do the restaurant’s bartenders and waiters. As at all of Mr. Boulud’s restaurants in Manhattan, the staff at Boulud Sud is first-rate: attentive and knowledgeable, with what the restaurateur Danny Meyer calls high hospitality quotients.) To start, dive into a bread-thickened Andalusian gazpacho bright with acidity and cucumbers, a basil-flecked reminder that tomatoes should be a part of every August meal. Then crunch into grilled blue prawns cooked to the sweet and precise moment when they count as cooked and not raw. Have those sardines, which define “agrodolce” in a bite. Also that purplish Spanish ham, acorn-fed and velvety, ambrosial in flavor. (Perhaps two orders?) Vitello tonnato is a miss; served almost like an hors d’oeuvre, it lacks the punch of tuna and brine that a properly sloppy version would afford. So is a strange grilled version of veal Milanese, however vegetal the roasted artichokes that come with it. It is dry and unpleasant. But octopus cooked on a plancha — then served with Marcona almonds and an almond purée, along with arugula and a whisper of sherry vinegar simultaneously to tie the flavors together and set them apart — is fantastic. Crisp-fried artichoke hearts with a pulsing aioli are likewise, as is grilled manouri cheese with tomato confit and a small breast of ricotta. These all taste of vacation, and are as welcome. You can have the lamb afterward, or the scallops or the seared wagyu with puréed fava beans, or share a salt-baked loup de mer that could run for office as Manhattan’s moistest fish. In Mr. Boulud’s house, there are many mansions. But be sure to leave room for Ghaya Oliveira’s desserts. Her baklava, torrone, rosemary-poached Bing cherries, all good. Still, they are nothing compared with her grapefruit givré, in which a hollowed-out frozen grapefruit is filled with grapefruit sorbet, grapefruit compote, sesame mousse and Turkish delight, then topped with a tuile hat and spun sesame halvah, as if straight from a cookbook co-written by Escoffier and Ferran Adrià. That is for the win.   Boulud Sud ★★ 20 West 64th Street, Upper West Side; (212) 595-1313, danielnyc.com/boulud_sud. ATMOSPHERE Aboard the luxury liner S.S.

283,The Leopard at Des Artistes ,2 star,"Aug. 2, 2011",Sam Sifton,Upper West Side,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/dining/reviews/leopard-at-des-artistes-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/03/dining/reviews/leopard-at-des-artistes-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"HIGH summer in New York City and the Upper West Side is quiet at twilight, vast swaths of the neighborhood lost to the Hamptons, the Vineyard, the Cape, the Shore. But the Leopard, which strode fiercely into the moldering Café des Artistes space on West 67th Street a few months ago, was purring as only the big cats can. Gianfranco Sorrentino and Paula Sorrentino, who also own Il Gattopardo in Midtown, have transformed what was a dark and queasily romantic space into an airy and cheerful southern Italian clubhouse. (Leopard is English for gattopardo.) Extensive cleaning has removed the nicotine lingerie that clad the bodies of the cavorting nymphs on the old Howard Chandler Christy murals that surround the room, revealing copious nubile flesh and shining white teeth. The carpets have been pulled out and replaced with stone floors. Sleek wood veneer has been applied to some of the walls. And the menu, which for the last few years of Café des Artistes ran best to potato chips and cheese dip at the dark and charming bar in the restaurant’s rear, has become a testament to the rustic joys of Sardinia and Sicily: simple food, apparently simply prepared. The restaurant has been an immediate hit with a particular subset of Manhattan society: the one that derives fame from power rather than the other way around. So there was the former New Jersey governor Jon Corzine last week at a table up front, tan and leonine, receiving nods and handshakes. Glenn Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art, sat dapper at a table behind him, eating with Adam Weinberg, director of the Whitney. This pairing appeared to pique the interest of Harold Holzer, a vice president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, seated across the room. People wave at one another constantly at the Leopard, as if at a gala or a board meeting. Lawyers nodded at television producers, who acknowledged fund managers at the bar, who fiddled with their pearls. A diner eating solo with a WQXR bag tucked into the banquette beside him deboned his own Dover sole. (“I enjoy the challenge,” he said.) The only awkward spot is the bar, once one of Manhattan’s great dark-and-quiet cuckolding spots. It has tragically been brightened in its move from the south wall to the north, and is the one space in the restaurant that may be said to have been too modernized. “I tell you now some specials,” said a waiter up front. As at Il Gattopardo, there are generally a few, and recently one has been a melting burrata cheese of exceptional creaminess served with juice-bursting tomatoes. This is absolutely worth ordering if offered. Lashed with olive oil that offsets the acidity of the fruit while underscoring the sweetness of the cheese, it is a dish that tastes not simply of summer, but of pleasant and pleasing affluence, of a tomatoland that exists somewhere far from the one described in Barry Estabrook’s important new book on the horrors of industrial tomato farming in Immokalee, Fla. “Worth ordering” is, of course, a relative phrase. The Leopard, for what it serves, is an expensive restaurant. (The waiter will not tell you now the price of that burrata, but it is $18. The Dover sole, buttery, rich and excellent, runs $45.) Still, there are bargains to be had. Delicate little cakes of lentils and ricotta, served with a dill-flecked yogurt sauce, may be too dear at $12 (and maybe too dry), but there is a healthy count on the sweet roasted beets in a hearty $11 salad that pairs them with peppery watercress and salt-rich Gorgonzola. You could follow this with a starter plate of meltingly grilled octopus with sweet, soft potatoes dressed in olive oil and lemon ($15), and make a very pleasant meal. Pastas are the best large-plate option for the cost- and flavor-conscious, with a marvelous dish of bucatini with sardines, fennel and raisins for $20, and a dead-simple chitarra with cherry tomato sauce and basil for $17. Vito Gnazzo, the chef at the Leopard as at Il Gattopardo, has a sure hand with these and, especially, with the accompanying sauces: as with the burrata and tomato salad, they taste not so much cooked as composed, which is the great trick of Italian cooking, and what makes it so hard to master. It is technique disguised as nontechnique, complexity playing at simple and plain. The bucatini in particular is especially pleasing, a complicated melody of sweet-salty-sour that managed (in one mind, anyway) to sneak best-ever honors away from a similar version cooked by Antonella Cajozzo at the Malibu posada on Gran Roque, Venezuela, a Sicilian outpost in the Caribbean sea. The pasta is slick beneath the crunch of some bread crumbs and against the lip-bite softness of raisins. The combination promises that summer will last forever. As for the listed main courses, which offer but one dish under $30 and four above $40, the best options are the simplest: lightly breaded swordfish with lemon juice, olive oil, garlic, oregano and parsley; or a thick-crusted grilled rib-eye for two, aged to tenderness and minerality, that arrives as if in a bower of rosemary, alongside a thatch of excellent fries. Il Gattopardo’s phenomenal meatloaf — veal and beef cut through with prosciutto, pine nuts and peas, then bound together with eggs and fat — is also available. Pair the meats with a too-pricey Nebbiolo in honor of Italy’s unification of north and south (the restaurant shares its name with a best-selling 1958 Italian novel about the era of Garibaldi), and life on the Upper West Side takes on a pleasant glow. It can only increase with the application of an espresso granita to beat the heat outside, or a bowl of fresh mixed berries with zabaglione. (Avoid at all costs the plain fruit plate, an homage to Midtown salad bars, circa 4:45 p.m. on a Sunday in July.) Service in the restaurant, led by Mr. Sorrentino, is of a sort that will be familiar not simply to regulars at Il Gattopardo, but anyone who has spent time in similar haunts around Manhattan, from Elio’s on upper Second Avenue down to Il Cantinori on East 10th Street: white-jacket opera buffa, heavy on the upsells, totally enjoyable. Everyone bustles, even as the hour grows late. Now give a wave to Jamie Niven, the Sotheby’s auctioneer, as he heads toward the door. Café des Gallerists!

284,Palm Too,1 star,"July 26, 2011",Sam Sifton,Midtown East,Steak Houses,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/dining/reviews/palm-and-palm-too-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/27/dining/reviews/palm-and-palm-too-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"“ALMOST no one who has ever eaten at Palm feels lukewarm about it,” Mimi Sheraton wrote in The New York Times in 1976, at the start of a review that awarded the steakhouse four stars, the newspaper’s highest rating. Either you saw Palm as a boisterous and exciting house party, Ms. Sheraton reported, or a crowded, shouty bore. There was no middle ground. (Everyone loved the steak.) The restaurant was then 50 years old. It is now 85, the father figure in an international chain that has 27 locations, all of them inspired by the original, with its sawdust-strewn floors, gruff, uniformed waiters and celebrity cartoons on the walls. The restaurant’s first child, a Palm in Washington, was born in 1972 and soon became a power haunt; its second, Palm Too, directly across Second Avenue from the original, came the following year, and Los Angeles after that. There are now Palms in the theater district and TriBeCa; in San Diego; Nashville; Boston; Orlando, Fla.; Mexico City; and San Juan, P.R. Palm is many things to many people. (Ms. Sheraton later downgraded the restaurant to three stars. Bryan Miller, her successor, took it to one in 1992, the last time the restaurant was reviewed.) In New York City, the flagship restaurant and its annex have become almost a single entity — a restaurant with a front dining room on the west side of Second Avenue (Palm) and a back room on the east (Palm Too), a combination that is set-ready for new episodes of “Mad Men,” missing only ashtrays and a strictly followed dress code. They are almost entirely interchangeable unless you have been to both enough times to have developed a preference for one over the other. Here is the cheat sheet: Palm is for groups, for first-timers and those who gather around them, for anyone interested in eating at the heart of the Italian steakhouse beast, with its composed salads and cold seafood, its excellent steaks, fat grilled lobsters and starches, or anything you’d like to consume under a blanket of melted mozzarella and sticky red sauce. At Palm the bulk of the dining room is made up of broad tables of four and six and eight, all of them raucous and crammed into a space that is smaller than it appears from outside its wide windows, and just as merry (or miserable) as it was when Ms. Sheraton stalked its aisles. Waiter, another round! Palm Too, meanwhile, is better should you desire to eat alone or with a single friend, quietly occupying a comfortable booth beneath a caricature of the publisher Jason Epstein as a green bookworm emerging from a Random House title, or a seat beneath a framed photograph of Dave Winfield, then a Yankee outfielder. Palm Too is the more intimate Palm. (And it is always Palm, not the Palm. This is a result of a city clerk’s corruption of the 1926 desire of the founders, Pio Bozzi and John Ganzi, to name the restaurant Parma, in honor of their hometown in Italy. The clerk nodded, and wrote “Palm” on the form.) The food on both sides of the avenue is first-rate, at least if you stick to the original script of salad and tangy, prime-rated beef, or salad and huge, perfectly acceptable lobster, along with potatoes and greens. (The best dessert is a cigar and a long walk home, or just the cigar, though you can certainly get cheesecake.) The best salads at Palm are brusque and proprietary. There is a requisite hearts of palm version, which offers a mixture of the slick, delicious vegetable with romaine, tomato, egg and kalamata olives. (Who needs blue cheese?) And there are two salads named for Gigi Delmaestro, who was the maître d’hôtel at Palm Too when it opened, later moving to the Los Angeles branch in 1975. The East Coast version combines shrimp, green beans, tomato, onion and bacon in a simple red wine vinaigrette; the West Coast version adds to this chopped iceberg lettuce, egg, roasted pepper and avocado. (It should be called the Kitchen Sink.) Against this bounty there is no reason to order a Caesar. It seems and tastes disloyal. Seafood starters include a marvelous rendition of baked clams oreganata, and a size-large crab cocktail that offers plain lump crab meat with a cocktail sauce that takes well to the loads of fresh horseradish that come on the side. You might have shrimp instead, which receive the same treatment, or a silky lobster bisque of deceptive heartiness — it derives its thickness almost certainly from rice rather than cream, and lists only 120 calories on the menu. Yes, there are calorie counts listed against every dish at the Palms. This is in keeping with a 2008 New York City law that requires all restaurants with 15 or more outlets nationwide to display calorie information. It is terrible for a steakhouse as good as Palm to have to comply (those clams oreganata top out at 400 calories; the West Coast Gigi at 380; a plate of hash browns will deliver or set you back a whopping 980), but this is the price of success for the Bozzi family, which still owns the business. Guests who walk into the restaurants talking of beef blanch at the numbers and bail into green salads and plain fish. Moods are ruined, arguments begun. It is better to do as was always customary at Palm in the past, and ignore the menu entirely. Most want steak — the prime porterhouse if it’s available is generally the most crusty without and tender within — and some want a giant lobster, and a very few more than that want a veal Marsala or a chicken parm (and they’ll regret it). So do not read about anything. Just ask for the steak after some Gigis and a crab. You may certainly ask for mashed potatoes or broccoli or fries. These will come with a shrug and perhaps some sucked teeth. The waiter knows you want creamed spinach and hash browns. And then have a drink while you wait for the food to arrive, and catch up with your tablemates about work or family gossip or the affairs of the day. Do not order wine — the selection is not very good. Cut into your buttery meat, your buttery potatoes, your creamy greens. These are prepared with real skill and care, and taste it. Meanwhile, look at that sawdust on the floor and the twinkle in everyone’s eyes. Palm may be a chain restaurant. But not on Second Avenue, no matter where you sit.   Palm and Palm Too ★ Palm, 837 Second Avenue (45th Street), Midtown, (212) 687-2953; Palm Too, 840 Second Avenue (45th Street), Midtown, (212) 697-5198; thepalm.com.

285,The Dutch,2 star,"July 5, 2011",Sam Sifton,SoHo,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/dining/reviews/the-dutch-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/06/dining/reviews/the-dutch-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"SO here is where you want to be right now, all of you who care about good food and the theater of eating it: sitting in a booth in the back of the Dutch, alternating bites of red shrimp and fried green tomatoes with hits of dry Vouvray. You may have a steak to follow, crusted perfectly and with a super-bass mineral tang. The Dutch is the song of the summer. It is exciting. The restaurant is on the corner of Prince and Sullivan Streets in SoHo, a beautiful leafy corner that for years held the Cub Room, which, whatever it was at its start, ended as a B-list celebrity hangout. Now renovated, the restaurant has three main dining areas, all white brick and rubbed wood and high-gloss ceiling paint, with comfortable seats and good sconces and chandeliers throwing beautiful light: A-list in the extreme. In the oak-lined oyster bar up front are men in good suits and better sneakers drinking clear-whiskey Manhattans and sucking down giant head-on, steamed Hawaiian shrimp. Across from them, in the airy, high-ceilinged and very loud bar area, sits a tall blonde in a backless black cocktail dress, swiping her iPad languidly. Behind her: about what you’d get if you handed out meal tickets at the TED conference or the Apple store a few blocks away. It is beautiful up there in the bar with the wide windows open to Prince Street, and it is a fine place to eat in late afternoon or late morning or on a whim, a place to trade jabs, bites of caviar, forkfuls of elegant beets with smoked egg yolk to cut the sweet. But for dinner you should endeavor to be seated in back, along Sullivan Street, where the lights hang low in shades that might be pencil tops as rendered by Claes Oldenburg. It is darker in the back of the Dutch, the tables larger, and the sound level low enough that you can hear the hip-hop bounce beneath the roar. What a scene. You may recognize people from television, from magazines, from Web sites and banks and funds and firms and other restaurants: the whole Gen X-Y food-crazy elite assembled to eat oysters and drink Cutty and absinthe and toast Andrew Carmellini, the restaurant’s chef and one of its owners. Mr. Carmellini stands professorial and intense in the semi-open kitchen, wearing whites and architect glasses, acknowledging nothing, keeping his head down. He knows what he has done. Once a protégé of Gray Kunz at Lespinasse and Daniel Boulud’s original chef de cuisine at Café Boulud, later the founding chef at A Voce on Madison Avenue, Mr. Carmellini was a star of both French and Italian cooking when he left the employ of others to open Locanda Verde in TriBeCa in 2009. Now, with the Dutch, he is cooking what he calls American food. By this he means the best casual-restaurant food he can come up with, out of all the larders available to him as an American who lives and works in New York City. And so the South gets a nod straight away, with a chile-flecked cakelike cornbread that starts each meal, and receives another with those marvelous fried green tomatoes and Carolina shrimp in a fiery pepper sauce. There are hints of Asia in a terrific black cod with smoked mushrooms and a sparkling yuzu-chile broth, and of Mexico in the transcendent, meltingly delicious lamb-neck mole with chayote and red rice. Yukon potato mash with gravy might have come from the best diner in your town, U.S.A.; crab meat with bloody mary sauce could have been delivered from the fantasy files of a food-obsessed resident of Maryland’s Eastern Shore. A salad of summer lettuce with buttermilk dressing and the salty hit of Parmesan? That is your Montauk summer romance right there. As for beer-braised tripe served beneath a scattering of Fritos, with lime and avocado, Mr. Carmellini calls it barrio food. But the dish tastes of the secret New York you get to experience only after a lifetime of loving it. It is the culinary equivalent of Jay-Z playing cards in the kitchen of Rao’s with Harvey Keitel in the video for “Death of Autotune.” (Hova looks at his cards: “Oh, wow. Wow!”) There is a wide stream of Italian food as well, appropriate to Mr. Carmellini’s heritage, job history and the neighborhood in which the Dutch has risen. A plate of creamy smoked-ricotta ravioli dressed in simple tomato sauce is a reminder that simplicity has its virtues. But veal pizzaiola gets the opposite treatment, with pancetta-wrapped porterhouse dressed with braised cheek, fried artichokes and a rustic, garlic-scented sauce of crushed San Marzano tomatoes and olives. Ready for the clunkers? Try an appetizer of early melon with country ham and peppery arugula. It is better than decent. (Take that!) An entree of sea scallops with bacon, peas and pickled ramps? It is unqualifiedly good. (Faint praise!) Now try umami-rich, miso-bathed asparagus with big hunks of bacon and a poached egg and think how good a word “unctuous” is when you are eating it. Rip through little sandwiches of fried soft-shell crab with a sauce that would lead Alice Waters into McDonald’s if it served it. Mr. Carmellini’s rabbit potpie, the size and shape of a football, holds amazing richness beneath its Christopher Wren-like dome: butter, rabbit and divinity in equal measure. And that steak is a celebration worth reserving for: a honking big rib-eye for two that holds its own with the best New York chophouses, even with its fancy-Dan accompaniment of a slick green salad. Finding wine to drink amid such flavor diversity could be a nightmare. But Josh Nadel, the restaurant’s sommelier, and Colin Alevras, its service director, have built a strong list and a staff that knows its intricacies. Simply say how much you want to spend, and answer all questions honestly. You will do just fine. Dessert brings a list of options that are interesting if not mandatory: devil’s-food cake; stone-fruit sundae; a sweet rice pudding with mangoes, pineapple, passion fruit, macadamia nuts and coconut sorbet. You may want these. But what you really need is a slice of one of the restaurant’s excellent pies, served with a scoop of ice cream.

286,Empellón Taqueria,1 star,"June 28, 2011",Sam Sifton,West Village,Mexican,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/dining/reviews/empellon-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/29/dining/reviews/empellon-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ART is risk. So too is business. Straddling the two is Empellón, Alex Stupak’s brave new Mexican restaurant on that odd West Village corner where West Fourth Street meets West 10th Street, off Sheridan Square. Mr. Stupak was until recently best known as a pastry chef, a modernist with an offset spatula and the maltodextrin blues. Tacos and tequila were far from his training and brief. As recently as a few years ago, in fact, he had never been to Mexico. Born in middle Massachusetts in 1980, he went to the Culinary Institute of America, then sprayed and spherified his way into high-profile jobs at Grant Achatz’s Alinea and Wylie Dufresne’s WD-50. So what is he doing in a Mexican restaurant now, cooking savory food? “I guess you could say I have no business opening a Mexican restaurant,” he told Diner’s Journal in March. He did it anyway. And a good thing, too: Empellón is one of the more captivating restaurants to open in recent months, with food that outstrips an atmosphere that is more frat-like than fine. Drizzle some roasted tomato and olive salsa over a cloudlike shard of chicharrón and listen to it snap and crackle in response. Taste the briny, pliant, melting porkiness of the combination. Now take a sip of smooth and elegant reposado tequila, and another of the sangrita Mr. Stupak serves with it: tomato juice thickened with pomegranate and kicked up with chipotle. Spoon melted Jack cheese topped with morels and garlicky guaje seeds into a warm tortilla from the Nixtamal shop out in Queens. Eat that pillow of intense and vaguely sweet earthiness: swoon. Repeat. Yes. And again. And suddenly it does not matter that Genesis-era rock is playing loud in the background and a shouty office party next to your table is screaming as if one of them is on fire. The restaurant’s food and drink are a balm for nerves scraped raw by its din. Even when the room is half full, some will consider leaving before ordering even a chip. No one will come to talk quietly of friendship or grandchildren, finance or literature. But Empellón, which is a Spanish noun meaning “push,” is well on its way to somewhere good. On the debit side of the ledger is that clattery dining room, which needs sound-dampening fabric or ceiling panels in much the same way Greece needs cash. The restaurant’s buxom list of tequilas and mezcals leads some customers to behavior that floats on the sunburned-tourist line between Tijuana bars and Amsterdam coffeehouses. The loud music underscores the stark difference between the curated playlists of restaurants like the Spotted Pig and Momofuku Ko and the shuffle function on a floor manager’s iPod. But good service and a table full of excellent food can comfort many ills, and Empellón can deliver both. Most meals start with those ethereal pork rinds, or with a bowl of unbedazzled guacamole and chips served with two salsas: a mild smoked cashew one and a more fiery mixture of chiles de árbol. These are worth keeping on the table all night. Some diners may find themselves forking the cashew version toward their mouths in between courses, as in the old days they might have lighted cigarettes. Inventive ceviches follow, most notably one that combines soft, briny octopus with soft, buttery parsnips and a nutty, sweet and fiery salsa that does much more than allow the two to coexist amicably. (Avoid the sopes, which are mostly and strangely too sweet.) There are as well some extremely good versions of queso fundido to challenge the one with morels, including one with sugar snap peas and mole poblano and another with both red and green crumbled chorizo, which with the cheese make up the colors of Mexico’s flag. Salads might in some other restaurant be risible sops to the tastes of the timid. Here they are summer-night treats. One offers green beans with cucumbers and a poached quail egg, dressed in an almond-y vinaigrette of significant power. The other has arugula with orange, mild onion and jicama dice for crunch. After a bowl of cheese and a few tequilas, these count as a kind of molecular gastronomy. Eleven taco options are available, none of them authentic in the way they might be if you ate them off paper plates at the Red Hook ball fields in Brooklyn for $5, but often just as good and sometimes more so. All come enveloped in those Nixtamal tortillas, nutty and sweet at once. Lamb barbacoa, soft and grassy, arrives beneath a citrusy, mezcal-tinged salsa; sweetbreads show up with roasted maitake mushrooms and a sauce of ground chiles and sesame seeds. There is garlicky steak. There are crisp portions of duck confit with Swiss chard; lobster with field corn and epazote; funky beer-braised pork tongue with potatoes, cotija cheese and fiery chile sauce. Oh, my. Available in orders of two or three tacos a plate, it is worth ordering a number of them for the table, as the centerpiece of a meal. Only three proper entrees are available, anyway, and worth considering: a bowl of shrimp with white rice and plantains, doused in a crazily magical smoky crab broth; or fat baby-back pork ribs with a flat nap of reduced red pozole; and an excellent sausage called longaniza, which at the sausage factory sits right between chorizo and linguiça. (Pass on the excellent strip steak not so much because it costs $45 as because there is not much of it above its ample bed of black beans and crisp yucca.) Dessert? Mr. Stupak has passed his old duties on to his wife, Lauren Resler, who labored on pastries at Babbo. Ms. Resler is no slouch, and her food is so elegant-looking as to almost clash with the room. No matter: her beautifully composed passion-fruit tart with mezcal, mint and toasted meringue hardly lasts long enough to count as aesthetically dissonant. Order two and do not be tempted by her cookie sampler, which will disappoint. Empellón has improved steadily since its opening, at least on the food front. It might be to Mexican food in Manhattan almost as Harold Dieterle’s Kin Shop is to Thai, though its room is less welcoming by a factor of six. Go there and be horrified by the scene, eat amazing food and go to sleep thinking what Mr. Stupak must, every night when he gets home: Hope this place makes it.   Empellón ★ 230 West Fourth Street (West 10th Street), Greenwich Village; (212) 367-0999, empellon.com.

287,Masa,3 star,"June 14, 2011",Sam Sifton,Upper West Side,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/dining/reviews/masa-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/15/dining/reviews/masa-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IS it worth it? This is the question that has attended Masa, the stupendously expensive sushi emporium in the Time Warner Center, ever since it opened in 2004. The food at the restaurant is exceptional, offering tastes and preparations that can be unforgettable. Take one bite of expertly diced, top-grade fatty bluefin tuna tartare cloaked in an equal measure of osetra caviar and discover a central truth: Masa, owned and operated by the chef Masayoshi Takayama, is one of New York’s peak culinary indulgences. That bite comes at some cost. Seven years ago, Masa had a base price of $300 a person, excluding tax, tip and upgrades like something to drink. Now it is $450 for the same fandango, an increase of 50 percent. A meal for two at the restaurant can easily run to $1,500 — an amount that is a little more than 35 percent of the Census Bureau’s most recent calculation of the median monthly household income in the United States. The relationships between cost and quality, experience and service have always been sticky ones for those who spend their time and money in restaurants, particularly in New York. Here are the best dumplings you may ever eat outside of China, five for $1. Over there, a steak to blow the mind of the biggest hat in Texas: it costs $190 for two people. One expensive restaurant has ironed tablecloths and nearly obsequious service. Another has placemats and plays the music of the Doobie Brothers, and loudly, too. How do we make sense of the differences among all these? Can that sense be quantified? I went to Masa to explore those questions, in meals eaten over the course of more than 12 months, first in the spare, quiet dining room and later at the wide and sanded expanse of its hinoki-wood sushi bar. Much of my time was spent in a fog of pleasure, sitting dumbfounded on the shores of excess. There is no menu and no choice afforded customers beyond deciding whether you want to spend an extra $120 for a plate of thinly sliced wagyu tataki with summer truffles. (In for a penny!) You simply surrender to the restaurant’s will, which is no trial. The quality of the ingredients and preparations were sometimes breathtaking. This was true from that toro-and-caviar dish that started my meals through the elegant kaiseki-style preparation of sea trout in a shabu-shabu broth, and from an indulgent bite of shaved summer truffles pressed onto sushi rice on through course after course of sushi to the grapefruit granité that signaled the end of recent meals. The sushi particularly astonished. Takahiro Sakaeda, the chef who prepared two of my meals, paced the evenings with the studied wickedness of a great D.J. or playwright, building acts into the meal, replete with turning points, subplots and rising action. (Speaking of: on one night, Mr. Takayama did not even seem to be in the restaurant.) Nearly all the fish Mr. Sakaeda prepared came from Japan, save some orange clam that one evening he allowed, with a small smile, to be local. There was horse mackerel and the deep-sea snapper known as kinmedai, squid and sea bream and fat red shrimp, all cut beautifully and served over ever-so-slightly warm sushi rice: a near-perfect vehicle for the fish. Mr. Sakaeda dressed these himself under a whisper of soy or a grain of Himalayan salt, depending, and passed them along like gifts. There was soft, unctuous saltwater eel under the lightest dusting of yuzu zest, a zip that offset the marvelous oil of the fish. And there was delicate grilled tuna sinew, a vile texture transformed through fire into a silky, transcendent one, amazing to behold. Mr. Sakaeda proved himself a brilliant guide to the gifts of the sea: a careful chef and eager teacher who rewarded interest with insight, pleasure with yet more. But extraordinary food alone does not an extraordinary restaurant make. The experience of eating at Masa can clash, sometimes greatly, with the grace, simplicity and excellence of the cuisine on display. One night I entered the 26-seat restaurant five minutes before my reservation time, arriving before my three guests. The room was empty, save for servers and one occupied table in the dining room. The woman at the restaurant’s front checked my (fake) name off a short list of reservations on a piece of paper on a block of wood in front of her. She took my briefcase and placed it in a closet. Then: “You may wait outside,” she said. “When you return with your guests, please have your cellphone turned off or on silent.” Masa is on the fourth floor of the Time Warner Center, in the midst of the mall’s vaunted Restaurant Collection, an assemblage that includes Per Se and Porter House in addition to Masa and its prêt-à-porter satellite restaurant, Bar Masa. Per Se is next door. It is hard to imagine anyone there asking a diner to wait outside for his guests. There are other wrinkles in Masa’s fine silk. At the sushi bar it is not uncommon for the prepared dishes served at the start of a meal, which are brought to the bar by servers, to be placed before customers with no explanation whatsoever. In the dining room it is possible for the same lapse to occur with the arrival of the sushi. It is unsettling, given the luxury of the food, and the question of its cost. Some will take issue with the fact that Masa serves an enormous amount of bluefin tuna, a fish that some say hovers on the brink of collapse as a species. (The reason is presumably simple: its taste.) Others will cavil at the manner in which Mr. Takayama caters to some guests in the restaurant while ignoring others, in seemingly direct proportion to the amount of money they are spending. (“Come stay with us in Sun Valley,” a burgher said to Mr. Takayama one night, handing him a glass of Montrachet. “I’ll fly you in.” Mr. Takayama raised the wine and laughed.) Finally, meals at the restaurant end with a clank: you are given a dessert and it throws a switch. Everyone turns away and you will have little contact with the staff until you find someone to give you the bill. Guests stare at one another awkwardly: What do we do now? At the end of its first year in business, Frank Bruni awarded Masa four stars in these pages, the newspaper’s highest rating. Masa was the first Japanese restaurant to achieve four stars since Hatsuhana was reviewed by Mimi Sheraton in 1983. (Ms. Sheraton praised that restaurant’s tempura and its inside-out rolls, while noting that the prices were lower than at other sushi restaurants in the city: “$100 for two, with tax, tip and three Scotches each.”) Masa, Mr. Bruni noted, “is very much a restaurant of this time and place.” That is perhaps no longer the case. Bruised by recession, wizened by experience, gun-shy about the future, New York City now demands of its four-star restaurants an understanding that culture at its highest must never feel transactional, whatever its cost. We ascend to these heavens for total respite from the world below, for extraordinary service and luxuriant atmosphere as much as for the quality of the food prepared. Masa is the city’s greatest sushi restaurant. That is not nothing.",
288,Gotham Bar and Grill,3 star,"May 17, 2011",Sam Sifton,Greenwich Village,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/dining/reviews/gotham-bar-and-grill-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/18/dining/reviews/gotham-bar-and-grill-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IN a city obsessed with the shiny and novel, Gotham Bar and Grill is an outlier. Open since 1984, it celebrates stability and excellence, perhaps even opulence. Fabric chandeliers billow beneath soaring ceilings. Elaborate flowers are everywhere. People dress for dinner and are escorted past marvelous photographs on the way to their tables. It is all very civilized there. Gotham has an informality of service, though, that is purely American, despite the starched white tablecloths. And Alfred Portale, who came to this Greenwich Village restaurant the year after it opened, runs a kitchen that is committed to innovation even as it celebrates the past. His life must occasionally resemble those of perpetually touring rock stars who need every night to sing the songs they wrote as teenagers. But even after more than 20 years, new songs keep coming. A sweet, tomato-flecked risotto with red Maine shrimp, nuggets of bacon and a few artful tangles of wild arugula arrived as an appetizer. The bacon had heft and smoke and fatty crunch, and would not have been out of place at a pop-up restaurant in some corner of Bushwick, Brooklyn, served by a bearish kitchen poet with a rutabaga tattoo on his forearm. It provided a fine complement to the tender flesh of the shrimp, the bite of the greens, the tender, chewy, broth-thickened rice. The combination tasted absolutely of now. Beside it on the table: Mr. Old School, a thick disk of perfectly diced yellowfin tuna, with Japanese cucumber and shiso leaf, the fish barely dressed in a sweet miso vinaigrette that tingled with ginger. Crouton obelisks rose out of this base, with greens between them: an architectural flourish that has been a highlight of Mr. Portale’s cooking since the start of his career. It was a deeply familiar dish, beautifully rendered: the original article, not a knockoff. It hummed with flavor. Both dishes were delivered without pretense, with minor, quiet ceremony. A waiter approached and placed them on the table, made sure all was well and departed. He had things to do. At Gotham, there is no recitation of the provenance of the bacon, or explanation of the wild arugula’s journey, before you eat. No one offers the name of the boat whose captain whispered the tuna aboard. This is refreshing, as it happens. A meal at Gotham is about you and your interests, not of those who made it. That fact may weigh sometimes on Mr. Portale. Being a success for so long comes with mighty, and surely sometimes boring, responsibilities. (“Five tuna tartares,” a waitress might tell the kitchen at 6, making her first order of the night. Many, many more will follow.) But if this is the case, he does not show it. Take as an example the restaurant’s seafood salad, a dish that Bryan Miller raved about in The New York Times in 1985, when he awarded the restaurant three stars; that Molly O’Neill loved in a 1993 review that gave the same rating; that Ruth Reichl called Mr. Portale’s signature dish in the newspaper’s most recent previous review of the restaurant, in 1996, which also awarded three stars. That salad is still on the menu, and still seemingly on most of the date-night tables running south along the bar: a molded tangle of scallops, squid, octopus and sweet, briny lobster, swathed by a slice of ripe avocado, dressed simply in lemon and olive oil. The wrap of the avocado is dashing, if no longer really in style. It recalls suits with shoulder pads and hair teased up with Tenax, Steve Winwood singing “Higher Love.” It still tastes terrific, though, with every flavor in balance. It still offers excitement. For those many for whom Gotham is a place to celebrate birthdays, graduations and anniversaries, it needs always to be on the menu, tasting exactly as it does. None of which is to say Gotham is perfect. The restaurant is very expensive, almost aggressively so, with starters that hover in the mid-$20s and entrees that can go to twice that number, with a wine list that hides its bargains well. Above the lights is a ceiling that is deeply unattractive, a stucco vision of those ’70s lofts with coffee-can track lighting. And the casual service seems sometimes to be perfunctory, even if it never really lags. (You will always get your water. Sometimes it comes with a splash.) The restaurant does not always show its age well. Some surfaces need fresh paint. But Mr. Portale does have plenty of new material to showcase. On the current menu, there is an appetizer of cold-smoked Tasmanian sea trout, served with tender baby fennel and celery hearts, with Meyer lemon for acidity and tiny pumpernickel croutons for texture against the firm slickness of the fish. It is unreasonably good. There is another of spring-pea ravioli, luxurious and sweet, with fava beans, delicate pea tendrils and some Parmesan, in a bacon broth of real weight and seriousness — a Greenmarket treat enlivened by a trip to the smokehouse. He makes shiitake soup with hazelnuts, crème fraîche and aged sherry vinegar. It might be beef consommé and French onion soup and veal yogurt combined into some liquid ambrosia, and a taste of it may serve as complete explanation for all those who do not understand food’s power to make people laugh from pleasure. It is an appetizer that excites and relaxes at once: a pair of velvet slippers for those who order it. For entrees, Mr. Portale cooks out of a number of larders without ever compromising the integrity of his overall vision. This is a remarkable trick. A single table might have on it a Thai-spiced Maine lobster next to a free-range chicken dusted with the French curry powder known as Vadouvan, with a seared fist of Atlantic halibut with morels and asparagus across the way, next to a dry-aged New York strip steak served with batter-fried Vidalia onion rings. On the night when that actually happened, each dish tasted absolutely and elaborately true to itself: a celebration of American diversity that avoided melting pots entirely. The lobster stood at attention among sheets of water spinach and shards of crisp snow peas, with ginger root and a pillow of soft rice noodles, in a heady bath of lemongrass broth amplified by kaffir lime. The chicken meanwhile, sweet and perfumed, with perfect skin, tacked toward the north and south coasts of the Mediterranean with layered vegetables, onion confit and preserved lemon, with a potato purée. That halibut, meanwhile, was forager-chic, utterly unfettered in its flavors, with a lick of white wine across its flesh. And the steak? It came with a marrow-mustard custard of remarkable intensity and a bordelaise you could use to adhere stamps. Only an enormous and enormously delicious dry-aged porterhouse-for-two was better, with a potato gratin, spring onions, sweet English peas, grilled asparagus and more of that bordelaise: British food made by Frenchmen, for Americans to cheer with massive zinfandels, with heady California cabernets. Speaking of which, care should be taken with the wine list, which contains a lot of these California jam pots at prices to put a sheik back on his heels. Ask for one of the sommeliers, put forward a price and discuss what you are eating and what you like to drink. They know the list, its traps and honey holes. Let them work it to your advantage: they might suggest a nebbiolo instead, at a price you can afford. “Desserts are intense and very American,” Ms. Reichl wrote of Gotham’s offerings in 1996. This is still the case. Deborah Racicot, the pastry chef, makes a rich and dashing plate of chocolate peanut-butter mousse with dark-chocolate caramel sauce and a raspberry lambic sorbet, and another that is a take on the classic s’more, with a smoked bittersweet chocolate tart, toffee and an excellent quenelle of root-beer ice cream. There is also a marvelous maple-glazed pineapple cake with hibiscus mint granité and a bourbon-buttermilk ice cream. It is a crazy-quilt finish to a meal that deserves three cheers.

289,The National Bar and Dining Rooms,1 star,"May 10, 2011",Sam Sifton,Midtown East,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/dining/reviews/the-national-in-midtown-nyc-restaurant-review.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/dining/reviews/the-national-in-midtown-nyc-restaurant-review.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"FIFTIETH Street and Lexington Avenue is the pulsing heart of no particular neighborhood, a lively intersection near the back door to the Waldorf-Astoria, just south of a DoubleTree. Office workers stream through on the way to the subway stop at the corner. Hotel guests pilot wheelie bags deep into yellow-cab traffic, and bark at one another in French. If you were looking for a neighborhood bistro of the sort where you might linger over dinner for a while, happily talking with friends while picking at fries and finishing a bottle of wine, the corner would rank low on a list of possible locations. Here, though, is the National Bar and Dining Rooms, a relatively new neighborhood bistro of just that description. With a smart, accessible and not terribly expensive menu written by the silver-haired celebrity chef Geoffrey Zakarian and executed by Paul Corsentino, his chef de cuisine, the National delivers more than its location would promise, and handsomely. Its wide leather booth seats and a beautiful tiled floor, designed along with the rest of the restaurant by David Rockwell, manage to evoke grand European cafes. But the grand circular stairwell near the entrance, rising above and around a pristine and artfully parked delivery bicycle, speaks impressively in a more familiar accent. Only in New York would someone place a bicycle near the swooping circular staircase built in the middle of a restaurant as a kind of eye magnet. The peculiar intersection of art and design, space and lack of it, makes the space interesting, makes it hum. (Bicycling about architecture. Where is George Plimpton when you need him?) The National is on the ground floor of the Benjamin Hotel, which limber-necked art history students may look up to recognize as the subject of a painting Georgia O’Keeffe made in the mid-1920s, when she was living a block south, in the Shelton, with her new husband, Alfred Stieglitz. the painting is called “New York — Night.” It depicts a dark, forbidding city of skyscrapers, the Benjamin at the center, dotted with warm yellow light of office desk lamps twinkling 30 stories up, and glowing at its bottom with a hearthlike orange that promises warmth and fellowship, and the city at its loveliest. Mr. Rockwell captures the quality of this light and uses it to animate the warm colors of the restaurant’s floor and burnished treads on his beautiful stairs, and to soften what might otherwise be a transitory, hotel-lobby feel. Customers spin into the very middle of the restaurant through a revolving door and are quite literally surprised by what happens: What could so easily be a soulless Midtown hotel dining hall presents as a sincere and bustling restaurant. This is appetizing, as it happens: it is the sort of restaurant where it is nice to be. And the food, which hews close to Mr. Zakarian’s new-American aesthetic, is to match. It is simple but not really, a menu of standards put through the reinvention machine, followed by wise and often wonderful desserts from Marisa Croce, the restaurant’s pastry chef. (Best bets on that front: malt gelato with devil’s food cake; spiced parsnip cake; a sundae with terrific hazelnut brittle — all good. Avoid the fruit plate, which is seasonal only in the sense that you can always get berries from somewhere.) Mr. Corsentino’s appetizers are strong: crisp pork nuggets with a soft onion soubise and pickled jalapeños, apples and grapes, for instance; as well as a nice grilled octopus with chorizo and cannellini beans; and beef tongue with bone marrow, pickled turnips and a brussels sprouts slaw (say that three times fast). Diners share the delicate fried arancini or the light roasted meatballs, served with peppers. They slurp at oysters that come with an excellent cocktail sauce and an apple-ginger mignonette, or sip sweet pea soup with lemon cream, an English daydream in an American’s head. A gummy dish of ricotta gnudi with mushrooms, Parmesan and watercress that seemed imported from an episode of “Chopped,” the television cooking competition for which Mr. Zakarian has served as a judge, was a disappointment. So, too, a Caesar salad that lacked both zing and zang. But beet salad with thick, strained brown-butter yogurt, pears and hazelnuts can save a table’s mood and did, an almost sweet-and-sour riff on a dish that usually hits only sweet notes. Main courses mostly kept up the parade, save in the instance of a muddy entree of roasted pork tossed with fettuccine, with ramps and snap peas. A fine dish of roast chicken with risotto and spring garlic would be a nice thing to eat on your first night in New York after a hellish flight from Los Angeles or London, though; and a perfectly cooked fist of Atlantic cod with polenta, leeks and a funky little sauce of orange and olives could greet you, as well. A dice roll on the pork chop with cheese grits and candied garlic came up craps on one occasion, but was juicy and flavorful on another, with real lusciousness below the meat. Steak frites with mizuna and a red-wine sauce seemed to gild the lily with fingerpaint instead of gold — mizuna lacks the heft and punch of either watercress or arugula, and cannot match the beefy flavor of steak. Meat eaters would more wisely turn in the direction of Mr. Corsentino’s burger, which is an ugly-looking affair below its pickled onions and jalapeños, but has flavor to spare. He has someone with a good hand on the deep-fryer, as well: the fries that should accompany both dishes have massive crunch and good potato flavor below their dustings of smoky paprika. You might order extra, and a second bottle of Au Bon Climat to dance you through to dessert. In a city run through with restaurants set in hotels, serving food appropriate to hotels, for people who stay in hotels, in neighborhoods growing crowded with hotels, the prospect of yet another hotel restaurant to visit or avoid may fill some of us with the weary sense that we are in the midst of a historical moment that is deeply uninteresting. (How much more exciting it would have been to be here when O’Keeffe and Stieglitz were padding around the Shelton). But the National makes a case that it is different, decent and worth it, and thanks to Mr. Rockwell’s design and Mr. Corsentino’s attentions, it generally succeeds in the argument.

290,Colonie,1 star,"May 3, 2011",Sam Sifton,Brooklyn Heights,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/dining/reviews/04rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/dining/reviews/04rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE lack of good restaurants in Brooklyn Heights has been a topic of discussion along the neighborhood’s leafy sidewalks at least since the first white-shoe lawyers crossed the Brooklyn Bridge to settle there. Residents who run into one another at the Variety Mart on Montague Street speak fondly of Noodle Pudding and Henry’s End, both on Henry Street, or Jack the Horse on Hicks Street, where the liquor store once was. They sing songs to the memory of Bouillabaisse on Atlantic Avenue. But for celebrations and date nights, for art and excitement and fun, they more often walk down to Cobble Hill, Carroll Gardens or Vinegar Hill or descend into the Clark Street station or the labyrinthine corridors of Borough Hall, and take a subway elsewhere to dine. Colonie, a new venture on Atlantic Avenue, mounts an argument for staying close. Long and lean beneath a rough-finished wooden ceiling, with a handsome bar in front and a large wall garden of herbs leading to a sepia-toned brick-walled dining room and open kitchen in back, it serves a mostly solid farm-to-table menu of haute American food to a building crowd. With aesthetic antecedents in both Frankies 457 on Court Street and Buttermilk Channel, also there, it seeks to draw young parents and young-at-heart in-laws, courting singles and groups of friends from the neighborhood and from afar. Often it succeeds. Alex Sorenson, the chef, who was at Mas (Farmhouse), serves a familiar menu of eggs and mushrooms and pork belly and scallops and beets. But his cooking does not seem overexposed or needlessly trendy. There is brightness to it, a clever happiness that comes through on the plate. Oysters served with a cucumber mignonette start his menu, along with a variety of what amount to bar snacks, slices of coppa or bresaola, for instance, with crusty bread. A tight list of small plates and large ones follows, along with some vegetables and salads: a grid of options that amount to a dozen or so choices. Mr. Sorenson does well by the forest floor. His roasted oyster mushrooms with pear are a marvel: crisp at the edges, and deeply nutty in flavor, with the tart acidity of the fruit acting almost as vinaigrette might, slathered over a piece of steak. He serves crisp enokis with a black risotto of Venere Nero rice: earthen and slick. And he pairs yet more mushrooms with spelt and beans in an appetizer called, simply, the Egg. The preparation of this last dish is a surprise. Current New York City restaurant culture demands that all appetizers containing whole eggs to be made only with gently poached eggs, lest people think the results home cooking and grow offended. Mr. Sorenson fries his in butter instead, sunny side up, and places the result on top of the spelt. The yolk acts as a sauce, while the crisped egg white counts as a transgressive, delicious act. Other successful possibilities: winter’s parsnip gratin, huge and fragrant in its bath of thyme-scented cream, has lately given way to potatoes and leeks. Order this. There is a lovely beet salad with ricotta salata, orange segments, crystallized hazelnuts and a welcome hit of mint. And seared artichoke hearts, served with blood oranges and hollandaise, for good reason appear to sit before every fourth person in the restaurant: The dish is creamy as a perfect brunchtime egg, with a delightful, buttery heft. And desserts, while limited in number, offer a great joy among them: a sticky date cake with salted crème fraîche ice cream. It is marvelous, perhaps the best sweet dish to be served in the Heights since the Good Humor truck departed the foot of Pierrepont Street. The entrees are sometimes less successful. An excellent if rather small portion of skirt steak was cooked admirably rare beneath its fiery crust, with top-notch French fries. This could take Colonie far. But seared scallops with sautéed red cabbage and a kabocha squash purée were bland and forgettable, if easily digested: that squash could be baby’s first restaurant meal. A pork chop with grits was sweet and flavorful one night, with a salty crust, but another time arrived tough and dry, with little flavor. Grouper, with fingerlings, horseradish and dill, was overdone, as were the potatoes. And a rabbit lasagna, off the small-plates menu but entree-size nonetheless, simply sat on the plate, rubbery, the rabbit close to tasteless, depressing. More mushrooms, please! The relationship between customers and staff can also be an issue. Elise Rosenberg, Emelie Kihlstrom and Tamer Hamawi, who opened Colonie in February, are restaurant professionals, with experience most recently at Public and the Double Crown, two smart and well-run establishments in Lower Manhattan. Ms. Rosenberg in particular is a welcome presence in the Colonie dining room, offering menu tips and guidance for the tightly edited and not particularly expensive wine list. She helps impart to the restaurant an excited, family-friendly, grown-up feel — as at a dinner party with new neighbors with whom you feel you might grow close Ms. Rosenberg and her partners are not always visible members of the floor team, however. And when that is the case, waiters, runners and bartenders alike appear to disappear, leaving some diners frustrated and would-be diners annoyed. Colonie is a good restaurant. But absent the bosses the service can take on a mediocre, almost perfunctory feel. Finally, the owners of Colonie take reservations only for groups of five or more. Seats at the bar up front, and along the kitchen counter in back, move quickly for couples, as might be expected. But larger groups (the herds of four who appear to make up a substantial portion of the restaurant’s patrons, for instance) can be left shuffling in front of a bar crowded with people eating dinner, unable to order a drink and sometimes unclear about whom they should speak to about getting on a list so they can eventually be seated. Brooklyn Heights was one of Manhattan’s first suburbs, which explains something about the neighborhood’s reputation as a culinary backwater. It has been gentrified for many more years than most neighborhoods in north Brooklyn. People eat at home in their impressive brownstones. It gets late fast there. Colonie, with all its strengths, would do well to embrace that realization and with it a truth John Cheever milled for years in his short stories set in Shady Hill: After Daddy’s off the train, he does not want to wait for dinner.   Colonie ★ 127 Atlantic Avenue (Henry Street), Brooklyn Heights; (718) 855-7500, colonienyc.com.

291,Brooklyn Fare,3 star,"April 26, 2011",Sam Sifton,Boerum Hill,"American, Seafood",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"“PARDON me,” said César Ramirez. Thus begins every meal at one of the more extraordinary restaurants in New York City. Mr. Ramirez is the chef at the Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare, on Schermerhorn Street in Downtown Brooklyn. He stood like a ship’s captain in front of the immense Molteni stove that is the centerpiece of his kitchen, the hearth around which the restaurant was built, framed by an immense collection of gleaming copper pots. Before him were 18 customers on stools set around a D-shaped stainless-steel bar. They were divided into two groups. One had started its meal at 6:30 p.m., the other at 7:15. “Pardon me,” Mr. Ramirez said again, to the second group. It was roughly 7:20. The first assembly was discussing the scallops before them on their plates, buzzing among themselves, well into their meals. Mr. Ramirez is soft-spoken. Often the first time he announces a dish, customers do not hear him and he needs to repeat himself. “This is a pea soup,” he said, “with Parmesan.” Michele Smith, who works behind the dining-room counter as a kind of major domo, the restaurant’s host and stage manager combined, had delivered the elegant little glasses for each customer to drink: a cool English pea soup of deep sweetness, green beneath warm Parmesan foam, at once bright and creamy, and flashing with salt. Mr. Ramirez worked for David Bouley at Bouley and at Danube, and his cooking has some of that chef’s precision and passion, his respect for pure ingredients. This tiny serving of soup tasted exactly of peas and Parmesan, in two separate temperatures. It was astonishing. Nineteen more courses would follow, though the simple menu placed in front of each place at the counter listed only seven: four savory courses, followed by a cheese, a sorbet and a dessert. Mr. Ramirez has an enormous collection of china on which he serves this food, and over the course of an evening, no plate would ever be used more than once. The procession was something like a meal at a sushi bar, something like a meal at Momofuku Ko, something like a course taken at the standing table in the kitchen at Eleven Madison Park, and nothing at all like any of those. What Mr. Ramirez is doing at the Chef’s Table is entirely his own production, a kind of sui generis exercise in personal expression. He and his staff are intensely focused, sometimes robotic. They draw no attention to themselves save for when Mr. Ramirez introduces each dish. Then there is silence as forks go to the food, and food goes into mouths and suddenly everyone starts nodding and chirping and staring at cooks who suddenly might as well be magicians. The mood in the restaurant thus swings on a pendulum from hushed to giddy. Barriers between couples or groups of customers start to fall. Everyone starts to compare notes, share insights, share wine. They celebrate the delicious. Single bites: There was Japanese snapper with an olive-oil ponzu sauce, and crispy leeks. Fluke with pickled daikon. A scallop served with crisp burdock root, hay against sea. King crab with yuzu marmalade, the crab shipped in fresh and steamed in the restaurant. A single kumamoto oyster suspended over a gelée made of oyster liquor. A bite of octopus with a coin of palm heart cooked in extra-strength dashi. Langoustine tempura with Iranian saffron. Fried monkfish liver with sansho that numbed the mouth. Lump crab. Ahi with ginger. Salmon with trout eggs. A single fried potato chip threaded with sage and a tiny sardine. Folds of soy-milk skin with soy and wasabi. On and on it went: a cavalcade, dizzying in its intensity. The experience was akin to adventure travel or high fever, a full hour of tiny bites before diners finally edged onto the printed menu with a single seared scallop with morels, green almonds, white asparagus and shellfish foam. “This one you can eat in more than one bite,” Mr. Ramirez said, to laughter. The dish was a dance to spring. Sea bass followed, with sweet peas and favas, as if to second the point. (Rhubarb served with the sorbet would underscore the season yet again.) Then came madai with a Japanese risotto made with sea urchin, coconut and garlic, a combination of great depth and interest — a dish to recall for months or more. And to round out the listed savory dishes, a single portion of lamb slow cooked to a velveteen texture, bright red within, over a sauce of miso and espresso. Whoa! The Chef’s Table has no liquor license, but has stemware for every style of wine and an attractive ice bin in which to store bottles. There is no corkage fee. (You will pay for broken glasses, though.) Some of the customers drink expensive Champagne or white Burgundy. Others, cheap chardonnay. They bring ancient ports for the end of the meal, middling sangiovese, excellent Muscadets. Ms. Smith, a sommelier currently without portfolio, nods politely at customers’ choices, and expresses a desire for the restaurant’s liquor license to come through. A meal at the Chef’s Table costs $165 a person, not including tip or the wine you bring. That is either expensive or not, depending on your bank balance, but it is worth the money whatever your answer. (Whether this will still be the case when the restaurant is selling wine is an open question; the cost of a meal could easily double, and change the dynamic of the room.) For now, dinner at the restaurant has the capacity to leave customers with kaleidoscopic sense memories and the vague understanding that over the course of the meal something important has happened. Reservations at the Chef’s Table are hard to come by. The restaurant opened two years ago. For much of the time since, the reservation line was attached to the mobile phone of Heidi Issa, whose husband, Moe Issa, owns Brooklyn Fare. (He plays Medici to Mr. Ramirez’s Donatello.) Potential diners got through to Ms. Issa as she drove on the Palisades Parkway in New Jersey, or sat in stalled in traffic on Flatbush Avenue in Brooklyn. “I’ll confirm that with an e-mail,” she said cheerfully, about possible dates for dinner in a few months’ time, before ringing off. This was true. It was also frustrating. More recently, Ms. Issa has handed over scheduling duties to an actual reservationist, Sarah Shelton, who each Monday opens a new week of seatings, six weeks ahead of the calendar date. It can take a few Mondays even to get through to her, much less to secure a date for dinner. This is still frustrating, but what are you going to do? There are just 18 seats. Yet the restaurant has a healthy base of regulars. Many of these are on a list of people who will come on a moment’s notice in the event of a canceled reservation. (You can ask Ms. Shelton to join them!) Some have known Mr. Ramirez since his time at Bouley, or at Bar Blanc in the West Village, where he cooked before coming to Brooklyn Fare. They are fans, who bring to the restaurant some of the flavor of a sports bar devoted to haute cuisine, food zealots with encyclopedic knowledge of highlights and statistics, delighted to have a courtside seat. “You see what you think,” one of these regulars said to a first-time diner back in November, nodding his head. “It’s best if you let it just happen to you.” Sage advice. It is worth it to try to join him. To do so is to experience the welcome culture of a restaurant that is unique even in a city as widely diverse in its culinary offerings as this one. Mr. Ramirez is Mexican, was raised in Chicago, taught himself to cook. His food is French and Japanese and Italian, made on expensive stoves in expensive pots, and served on luxe china over place mats and stainless steel, in a kitchen next door to a supermarket on a forlorn block in Brooklyn.

292,Junoon,2 star,"March 29, 2011",Sam Sifton,Midtown South,Indian,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/30/dining/reviews/30rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/30/dining/reviews/30rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"TWO new Indian restaurants have joined the Manhattan fray, competitors for a place in the upper castes of the city’s Indian fine-dining scene. Junoon rises lush and enormous off a dark stretch of West 24th Street, an Indian restaurant remade as a luxe Western palace, with a marvelous wine list and perfect rye manhattans. Tulsi glitters bright and almost romantic on East 46th Street across the street from Sparks, a Midtown bet on a great chef’s talent. Hemant Mathur is the force behind Tulsi. He was an owner and a chef at the pretty, bejeweled Devi, in the Flatiron district, where he often could be seen fussing nervously at the edges of the dining room before retreating to the kitchen to cook with rare brilliance. At Tulsi he does the same dance and, if the setting is less attractive, louder, less special than at his former restaurant, it places his cooking in sharper relief. No one in New York makes lamb chops like Mr. Mathur — heavy, ugly things caked in yogurt but tasting of gamy perfection — and it is a relief to know that he has brought that entree north with him. His Manchurian cauliflower has made the transition as well: a magical dish, sweet and fiery, worth ordering in multiples even at a small table, so everyone present can thrill to its sweet and heat, and guess at the secret ingredient (spoiler: it’s ketchup, well caramelized over the fried cornstarch batter). He serves a wickedly fine duck moilee — a delicate coastal curry softened by coconut milk — and a deeply flavorful curried monkfish with pomegranate sauce, the spices within each dish rendered distinct and powerful in the cooking. And there are very good tandoori prawns, courtesy of one of Mr. Mathur’s partners in this enterprise, the chef Dhandu Ram, whom older students may remember from his time at Bukhara Grill. Roasted to crispness, the prawns emerge from the tandoor sweetly juicy within, a lovely match for the okra that comes with them, and tingling eggplant chutney. Tulsi’s vegetable dishes do not disappoint either, most notably the house dal, simmered until its primary ingredients, lentils and clarified butter, appear to become one: a creamy yogurt made of legumes. The breads, in particular a rich and salty rosemary-garlic naan, perform marvels alongside the food. There is even a soft ginger panna cotta for dessert, from Mr. Mathur’s wife, Surbhi Sahni, to undercut the notion that all Indian sweets must be wickedly so, as if to make up for the heat of the entrees. Too bad, then, that Tulsi’s lighting is harsh, and that the service style runs more to chain-restaurant gab than anything approaching the hushed, pajama-clad grace of Devi. Too bad, too, that behind its warm and comfortable bar, the restaurant opens into a bazaar of tables more reminiscent of Home Depot’s patio furniture department than anything filmed by Merchant-Ivory. It is not a particularly enjoyable place to eat dinner. The floating curtains between tables have the stiffness not of silk but of polyester. They look itchy. And under that light, only a few people can look good. AT Junoon, just west of Madison Square Park, everyone looks good. Little expense has been spared to make sure that this is the case. The restaurant is lighted as if by softly glowing amber. The teak lounge furnishings and long bar up front might have been pulled straight off the floor at ABC Carpet & Home. And the enormous dining room, at once airy and filled with deeply upholstered chairs and banquettes, features both large sandstone sculptures and a steel reflecting pool in which float lotus blossoms under candlelight. Rajesh Bhardwaj, the Cafe Spice tycoon, is the founder and chief executive of this restaurant, now his glittery flagship. Sommeliers wheel linen-covered wine carts about the dining room with quiet efficiency, and the conversation bubbles along at a hushed level, as at an old-line Italian or French establishment. Imagine a kind of dream-state Del Posto, the sort of restaurant where of course you would order a 2006 Valpolicella Grassi with your monkfish tikka. Never mind knowing why this is so. (But it is so!) Ask one of those sommeliers for advice, at whatever price you consider comfortable. Junoon’s cellar has within it much to injure the belief that the best accompaniment to Indian food is beer. In the open kitchen is Vikas Khanna, late of Salaam Bombay and numerous television appearances. His menu offers a wide-ranging examination of Indian cuisine, divided not by region but cooking style. It is, over all, very good. The tandoor dishes are delicate beneath their crusts: sweet lobster under a cloak of cumin, cayenne and lemon, with ground fennel; venison amped up on ginger and nutmeg. A lentil soup — three-lentil shorba, it’s called here — rides silky in its elegant bowl, enlivened by cilantro, over a seat of fresh turmeric. Lamb is given a wonderful send-off by the patthar, a style in which the meat is cooked on hot stones. Even better are the curries, in particular the grilled eggplant, and a rich and fragrant duck version with an enormous amount of Tellicherry pepper to counterbalance the richness of the meat, along with a faint hum of tamarind, a zing of curry leaves. The restaurant’s desserts are as good as they are few in number, with but three options above the traditional kulfi and (less traditional) sorbet. The best of these is a date pudding cake held together with caramel, cranberries and streusel, and an orange-buttermilk ice cream. It is rich and smoky, with a creamy tang, amazing: Brahmin food that recalls Boston more than Bengal. Junoon is comfortable and elegant, almost more than the two Tamarind restaurants, in the Flatiron and in TriBeCa, to which it will inevitably be compared. Its design and service style hint at the kind of European-style sumptuousness that used to be common to upscale restaurants in Manhattan, at least before the recession removed tablecloths and quiet from so many of our dining rooms. It is a very nice place to spend a few hours, dressed and dining and drinking well. Tulsi may indeed offer a slightly more attractive bill of fare. But restaurants are always about more than simply the food.   Tulsi ★ 211 East 46th Street, Midtown; (212) 888-0820, tulsinyc.com.

293,Red Rooster Harlem,2 star,"March 8, 2011",Sam Sifton,Harlem,"American, Southern",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/dining/reviews/09rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/09/dining/reviews/09rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THERE were four elderly black women in hats at Red Rooster Harlem the other night, across the aisle from a group of white men who had come north to 125th Street by subway. Also present were a mixed-race family sharing apple pie, a stroller beside them; an Asian same-sex couple, drinking wine; and mixed-gender black couples eating Swedish meatballs. Above them all was a Philip Maysles painting depicting the artist Norman Rockwell staring into a mirror and painting a portrait of himself — as Ruby Bridges, the African-American girl who integrated an all-white elementary school in New Orleans in 1960. The scene was unusual, notable, a view of a city many believe in and few ever see, at least in the presence of Caesar salads and steak frites. New Yorkers are accustomed to diversity on sidewalks and subways, in jury pools and in line at the bank. But in our restaurants, as in our churches and nightclubs, life is often more monochromatic. Not so at Red Rooster Harlem, which the chef Marcus Samuelsson opened in December. The racial and ethnic variety in the vast bar and loft-like dining room are virtually unrivaled. The restaurant may not be the best to open in New York City this year (though the food is good). But it will surely be counted as among the most important. It is that rarest of cultural enterprises, one that supports not just the idea or promise of diversity, but diversity itself. The scene is amazing: a pulsing, cheerful and virtually always-packed bar that gives way to a crowded and sleek dining room beyond it, decorated with the work of local artists. In the seats: Harlem itself, from those matrons in the dining room to its youngest children and its political elite, along with many visitors from downtown and afar, everyone playing a role in the restaurant’s grand vision. Mr. Samuelsson, 40, who was born in Ethiopia, raised in Sweden and now lives nearby, is at Red Rooster Harlem’s heart and soul. A celebrity and philanthropist known as much for his cooking on television as in restaurants, he first tasted fame in the United States during the 1990s, as the brilliant young chef at the Scandinavian restaurant Aquavit. Later he opened a vaguely Asian restaurant called Riingo that wasn’t very good, and after that a vaguely African one in the meatpacking district, called Merkato 55: likewise. (In 2009, he prepared the first state dinner of the Obama administration.) He has other restaurants in Chicago and Stockholm. At Red Rooster Harlem he has staked the biggest claim of his career, with a restaurant meant to channel the spirit of the neighborhood’s present as well as memories of its past. It is a restaurant for a modern Harlem, a gentrifying one, a business at ease with well-heeled patrons of whatever skin tone, that has much more in common with the integrated Savoy Ballroom of the 1940s than with the whites-only Cotton Club or, for that matter, the tourist-trapped Sylvia’s soul-food restaurant down the block. There may be fried chicken on the menu (and oxtails, too). But there are some greatest hits from Aquavit as well, and a 2005 Brunello that costs $229. Mr. Samuelsson cooks down and talks down to no one. In doing so, he has created something that is at once new and entirely familiar: perhaps the only restaurant in the city to serve, alongside corn bread and pickles, both cauliflower sautéed with black vinegar and Jamaican beef patties served with Mexican salsa verde. The food is just fine. There is to start a Caesar salad of red romaine, dressed with smoky vinaigrette and shavings of crunchy bottarga over the top. Also a salty-sweet dialogue between salmon cured to New York specifications (lox) and Scandinavian ones (gravlax), with a purple mustard to offset the fat. That corn bread, cut as precisely as panels for an Ikea bookcase, arrives with a pat of beautiful honey butter — and another of African-spiced tomato jam. Some will thrill to crab cakes served with a fiery mayonnaise, many more to the restaurant’s take on dirty rice and shrimp, made with aged basmati rice and pumped up by curry leaves. (Opinions will vary about the spiced duck-liver pudding served with fatty duck pastrami, almonds and sliced pear. Here is one: it’s terrific, smooth and luscious, an appetizer analog of the late-night radio format known as Quiet Storm.) Entrees bring a complicated rendition of macaroni and cheese, featuring jug-eared orecchiette pasta and a mix of Gouda, New York Cheddar and Comté cheeses, with a crisp salad on the side. Mr. Samuelsson’s meatballs — soft and ever so sweet — remain a must-order decades after he introduced them at Aquavit. That oxtail, huge and fork-pliant, comes in a thick, fatty sauce that started as stout, with plantains to offer a hint of island flair. There is even what Mr. Samuelsson calls an uptown steak frites, a 10-ounce strip served with watercress, beautiful fries and a truffled béarnaise. Better is the fried yard bird (chicken, in the slang of old Harlem) served with a smear of white mace gravy and wisp of hot sauce, over stewed greens, with a shake can of hot spices on the side. The pieces are enormous, as if from a chicken the size of a young turkey, but bear the sweet taste of youth, in a thick crust that benefits from shake and yet more shake. The accompanying greens are tender, slightly sour, perfectly done. For dessert, sweet-potato dumpling holes with cinnamon sugar, and a tall parfait glass filled with frozen malted chocolate pudding. Oh, yes. These dishes are all prepared — with care and a kind of sparkle — by a kitchen team run by Andrea Bergquist, a former Alvin Ailey dancer who cooked at Merkato 55. They work in an open kitchen spread across the back of the restaurant, performers in front of a wide communal table and the dining room beyond it. Mr. Samuelsson is a constant presence in the restaurant, politely spending his nights cooking, wading through well-wishers and signing autographs, greeting politicians, old friends, curiosity-seekers, celebrities and neighborhood families exactly as if the groups were interchangeable: different, but all welcome and somehow the same. (An exception: Kim Hastreiter, the editor of Paper magazine. Mr. Samuelsson approached her at a banquette one night and kissed her shyly on the head.) Red Rooster supports a lively and growing lunch business. Benefit and private dinners take place in the open basement, which is still under construction. Soon there will be breakfast, an actual stage downstairs with a separate bar, and a kitchen for cooking classes. Nights in the restaurant are meanwhile insane from roughly 6 p.m. until nearly midnight, and the dining room has some of the energy and excitement you can find in the best of Keith McNally’s restaurants. Everyone seems to be there, making the scene. Red Rooster recalls early days at the Odeon, or more recent ones at Balthazar or Minetta Tavern. Recalls but does not replicate. One difference is that the bulk of the service talent is found at the host’s station, behind the bar and in management. Waiters and runners are still raw, amateurs stepping up, still learning the trade. The glory of the Red Rooster is that everyone really is there, actually making the scene: black and white, Asian and Latino, straight and gay, young and old. This fact marks a real stride forward for Harlem, and for New York beyond it. Here at last are the faces of the city we live in, sitting together in a large restaurant serving top-quality food and wine. Have we really never seen this before? It is Mr. Samuelsson’s triumph that we need to ask.   Red Rooster Harlem ★★ 310 Lenox Avenue (125th Street), Harlem; (212) 792-9001, redroosterharlem.com.

294,Fishtag,0.5 star,"March 1, 2011",Sam Sifton,Upper West Side,"Mediterranean, Seafood",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/dining/reviews/02rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/02/dining/reviews/02rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"WHAT a strange and frustrating if occasionally marvelous restaurant is Fishtag, Michael Psilakis’s new venture on West 79th Street, across the street from the Dublin House. A neighborhood joint with aspirations that are somewhat higher than that, the restaurant marries solid Mediterranean cooking to a kind of wackadoo, cheffy bravado that brings sea urchin to the table floating in a glass of brackish seawater as if it were art. (It is not. It is kind of nasty.) Fishtag is a good restaurant trapped inside a bad one. Mr. Psilakis, the executive chef and an owner, and his chef de cuisine, Ryan Skeen, grill striped bass with the best in this city, and adorn the fish simply, with lemon, over broccoli rabe. This is great. More, please. They serve a marvelous lamb burger, with whipped feta, chilies and smashed potatoes that you may find yourself thinking about days later. The dish costs $16. If it were available in your neighborhood, you would know the name of the restaurant’s hostess, the bartender and your favorite waiter within a month. The pair also prepares some of the city’s greatest toast: grilled to smokiness, its crust giving way to a luscious interior. They serve it with a selection of many estimable cheeses, cured meats and fishes, and have a fine list of bracing whites and dry reds to drink along with them. (The bar up front, which runs a long way into the space, is a good place to graze these.) But often Fishtag recalls what happens when children get into Mom’s closet and play at fashion. The food shows up in the dining room overdressed and shrieking in three shades of lipstick and mismatched slingbacks, with flavors that clash or do something rather worse than that. This may be cute for children. Here it leaves you stuck eating a bowl of the pasta twists known as trofie, which are mixed into a thick tomato sauce flecked with chewy cuttlefish and strings of short-rib meat. Gooey smoked mozzarella and an overlay of ricotta salata are on top. Oh, honey. More bad news: The menus are odd, with a format that moves from light food to heavy and with appetizers printed in red and entrees in black. There is a separate sheet for the cheeses, cured meats and fish. These are all difficult to navigate. The dining room, meanwhile, is crowded, narrow and rec-room noisy, with oppressively low ceilings and a soundtrack that runs to stalwarts of the FM radio dial, circa 1980. (“Wait, is that — Boston?”) Fishtag has none of the Aegean cheeriness that could be found when Mr. Psilakis had Onera in this space, four years ago, and none of the purity of cooking, either. Gone, too, are the diner trappings Mr. Psilakis put in when he opened Gus & Gabriel Gastropub here in 2009. That, for the record, is very much to the good. The servers jostle about and seem to suffer the ill effects of claustrophobia: they can be skittish; they seem to stoop. And everywhere the food piles high, often under parsley and pomegranate seeds, beneath rounds of radish, many dishes indistinguishable from the last. A bruschetta of bland tuna confit with bland baked ricotta, for instance, showered in too much garlic and roughly the size of a strip steak, might easily be interchanged with a similar dish served with whipped salt cod and smoked eggplant; they could stand in the same police lineup and confuse an eyewitness. Their tastes run together. On the table, they become one big pile of Greekish salad. Grilled sardines are fine. (Some compliment!) A salad of chopped chicory, wild arugula and bulgur comes with a shopping list for a yoga weekend in Taos: Medjool dates, pomegranate seeds, green olives, breakfast radish, pistachio, peppers, grilled onions and smoked almonds. Enough! Not all the experiments are failures. For an excellent bruschetta, order the one with grilled prawns, feta and fiery chilies. It could make a daily lunch without tempting boredom. Mussels, meanwhile, are served in a huge bowl with spicy merguez, in a broth heavy with shredded lamb. The combination — with pickled leeks and confitted chickpeas mixed in, to boot — is weird and exciting and new. It is a similar play to the one with cuttlefish and short rib, though with a far better ending. Get some bread with that and mop and mop and mop. Also estimable is a dish of smoked octopus with chorizo and a smoky potato purée, accompanied by pickled mushrooms and lemon. The flavors are intense and focused, with no muddiness between them. What, however, is the purpose of a grilled branzino stuffed with headcheese, except to tempt food loons eager to experience something different? (The dish might serve as a prime example of the term “critic bait.”) There is an excellent accompaniment of greens braised with guanciale, but the fish itself was overcooked, with an interior that proved of sticky interest only to those predisposed to believe a fish stuffed with headcheese is a good idea. This may well be true, but Fishtag’s version does not satisfy the court. Explanation denied. The restaurant’s burger deserves much praise, though. Mr. Skeen has drawn accolades throughout his young career (at Resto, at Irving Mill and briefly at 5 & Diamond,  among others) for his prowess with ground meats. Nothing at Fishtag dims the justification for that praise. The lamb burger at Fishtag is as fat as a squashed softball, with a monkish simplicity to its preparation. It is served beneath a tonsure of whipped feta and leaks beautifully into its bun. It tastes fantastic. You can eat this sandwich, after a bruschetta or two, then bang down some excellent Ethiopian French-press coffee to end your meal. (Neither Mr. Skeen nor Mr. Psilakis seem much interested in sweets, so there is but a mean little list of sorbets and ice creams for dessert.) You can have cheese and a punchy red wine and consider the place a wine bar. But either way you’ll be left sitting in a basement on West 79th Street listening to classic rock and feeling disappointed. There is too much at Fishtag that is too much, and too little to offer compensation for that fact. Mr. Psilakis has shown us — first at Onera, more recently at his Kefi, on Columbus Avenue — that he can do better. Here he should start by doing less.   Fishtag FAIR 222 West 79th Street (Broadway), Upper West Side; (212) 362-7470, fishtagrestaurant.com. ATMOSPHERE Subterranean almost-there blues.

295,Ai Fiori,3 star,"Feb. 22, 2011",Sam Sifton,Midtown South,"French, Italian",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/dining/reviews/23rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/dining/reviews/23rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"HERE at long last is a winning new defense of fine dining: Ai Fiori, in the Setai Fifth Avenue hotel, just below Midtown. The chef and restaurateur Michael White opened the place late last year, with Chris Jaeckle in the kitchen and Ahmass Fakahany down at the bank. It is an emphatic rejoinder to the trend toward farmhouse tables, rustic food and shouting that has so dominated the dining scene in Manhattan at least since the start of the recession. Ai Fiori is not really a beautiful restaurant, despite the Childe Hassam-ish views that its wide windows provide of Fifth Avenue. The color palette of the dining room is too earthen and anonymous. And the service is not quite formal enough for it to qualify as truly fancy, either — more Danny Meyer in attitude than Alain Ducasse. (Though check out those forks set in the high-European manner, with the tines pointing down into the thick tablecloth!) As a hotel restaurant, Ai Fiori is open for three meals a day. Some guests arrive tieless and Dockered, in drab pantsuits or business-travel black. There can be no purse ottomans for them, or other trappings of restaurants that seek to occupy the city’s highest tier. But the dinner menu is a soulful amalgamation of French technique and Italian passion, executed with great skill. It turns an Italian lens on haute French cooking to reveal French food as it might be cooked in Como for a table of aristocrats. This works out well for everyone: Ai Fiori is one of the best restaurants to open in New York in the last 12 months. (With its $79 four-course prix fixe, it also provides one of the best values.) A meal at Ai Fiori (The name means “among the flowers.”) could begin with a half-pipe of beef bone filled elegantly with rounds of celery root, thin-sliced scallop and black truffle, with a thick drizzle of bone marrow over the top and a scattering of thyme. It might start with a tender pile of buttery poached oysters with cucumber and sturgeon caviar. For those with a taste for offal and seafood, there is a soft-poached egg served with crisp sweetbreads, braised lobster knuckles, more of that black truffle and some tarragon. The egg is swathed in a cloud of crème fraîche and Coteaux du Layon, the sweet white wine of the Loire Valley. The combination is sweet and sour, slick and crunchy, all at once. There is a roasted breast of squab as well, its shatteringly crisp skin giving way to soft and gamy meat below, with a sticky Madeira sauce, a cotton-ball purée of parsnips and a golden croquette filled with liquefied foie gras. This tastes of wealth and self-satisfaction. It is the gustatory version of one of those William Hamilton cartoons, “Money Should Be Fun.” And these are just appetizers! (Others include a marvelous salad of blue crab and grapefruit, avocado, tarragon and crisp flatbread, and a thick and glossy lobster velouté with shaved chestnut and yet more black truffles, which Mr. White uses at Ai Fiori the way some chefs use salt or pepper.) What is going on here? A vest-pocket history: Mr. White was the chef at Fiamma Osteria in SoHo, where he was known as a pasta magician. In 2002, the restaurant received three stars from The New York Times. Later, he was the chef at both Alto and Convivio, where he cooked northern and southern Italian food, respectively. Those restaurants also received three stars from The Times. With Chris Cannon, his erstwhile business partner, who had hired him for Alto and Convivio, Mr. White launched the elegant and Italianate seafood palace Marea on Central Park South in 2009 (three stars again), and the more casual Osteria Morini, devoted to the food of Emilia-Romagna, in SoHo last year (one star). AT Ai Fiori, the idea is to commingle the cooking of the south of France, where Mr. White worked in the early 1990s, and the northwesterly Italian cuisine of the Ligurian coast. (The dining room, meanwhile, supports an atmosphere that is more in line with the bland veneers of American corporate culture than anything European: it really might be anywhere.) So, yes, there are a few pastas to eat after the excess of the appetizer course. They follow the starters like a run of good cards: delicate little gnocchi made of semolina flour and scented with saffron, then served with crab meat, tomato and lobes of sea urchin; a feather-light plate of wine-glazed ravioli stuffed with ricotta and mascarpone, with truffle-infused boschetto cheese; and braised veal agnolotti with a brush of butternut squash and sugo that appears composed mostly of butter and (naturally) black truffles. There are a few risottos as well. These are not as magic but they are hardly clunkers, especially since one is dressed with escargot and bits of cotechino sausage and another with a comically large portion of our old familiar black truffle and a lashing of veal stock. Eaten alongside wines to match — relatively inexpensive Ligurian treasures pulled forth by Hristo Zisovski, the restaurant’s beverage director, who came to Ai Fiori from Jean Georges; or a Norman cider, or glasses of Pauillac — they help set the stage for a meal that moves well beyond the familiar Italian boundaries of what Mr. White has heretofore cooked in New York. Dessert follows suit, with a selection from the pastry chef Robert Truitt that pays deep compliment to the savory food without overshadowing it. Among the best is the baba al rhum. It is a king’s dish, Neapolitan by way of France, served here with a passion-fruit coulis and a small arrangement of tropical fruit. The restaurant’s veal chop, as another example,  comes with a sweetbread choux farci and sauce Périgueux, the meat seared hard in a pan and finished slowly in a low-temperature oven. It arrives at  the table sweet and flavorful beneath a gloss of butter and garlic and thyme and rosemary, a taste of the south of France, hardly Italian at all. Pan-fried sole is served with a nutty brown-butter sauce thickened with cream and veal stock, then lightened with lemon juice and thyme, made salty with capers. Butter-poached lobster comes with root vegetables and a paint-thick sauce of butter, vin jaune, lobster essence and a jolt of acidity that owes something to the cooking of Jean-Georges Vongerichten. The dish nods respectfully as well to Thomas Keller, who originated butter-poached lobster at the French Laundry in Yountville, Calif. Then it dunks on both of them. And rack of lamb shows up  as individual chops wrapped in a grind of breast meat and foie gras that have been sealed in caul fat beneath a single crest of flattened parsley. Heated to melting, mahogany perfection, they sit regal and massive on the table in the manner of an edible Jeff Koons sculpture: shiny, intensely flavored, magnificent. There may be prettier restaurants in the world of Michael White. But the cooking is at its very top here at the Setai. Oui, chef!  ","Scallops and bone marrow, slow-poached egg, roasted squab; saffron gnocchi, veal agnolotti; butter-poached lobster, Dover sole, rack of lamb, veal chop; baba al rhum.

296,Hunan Kitchen of Grand Sichuan,1 star,"Feb. 8, 2011",Sam Sifton,Flushing,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/09/dining/reviews/09rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/09/dining/reviews/09rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"JERRY TANG, a son of the late Chinese chef Shorty Tang,  was talking about the business of running Chinese restaurants in New York. This was last week, during Chinese New Year, over coffee in Brooklyn. Mr. Tang, 55, has had a long career in the city’s Chinese restaurants. His father worked with the great restaurateur David Keh, who had Auntie Yuan, a Hunan restaurant on First  Avenue on the Upper East Side. In the 1970s, the family owned Hwa Yuan on East Broadway in Manhattan’s Chinatown. “I would never open a Chinese restaurant in Manhattan now,” Mr. Tang said. “My father would never open in Manhattan now. No way. Cooking is an art, it is balance. It is not fighting the city because you’re in Manhattan, and paying those rents. You want good Chinese food, food like we had before, you have to go to Queens.” So stipulated. It’s like 1973 out there. Let’s go! Hunan Kitchen of Grand Sichuan is a spare and modern new restaurant on Main Street in Flushing, north of the Long Island Expressway and six blocks south of the final stop on the 7 train. Despite its odd, intramural name, the restaurant is devoted entirely to the cooking of Hunan, the small interior province of China that was the birthplace of Mao Zedong. There are only a few tables in the restaurant, most of them large, and all of them generally crowded from about 7 p.m. on  and sometimes at lunch as well. (Reservations are recommended, but not always honored precisely on time.) There are portraits of the chairman hung high on the walls; a Pop Mao, rather than a political one. The lighting is bright, the service right on the line between brusque and affable. It is clean and pretty, though not a restaurant where anyone will ask you if you prefer sparkling water to still. Hunan cooking is smokier and more assertive in its preparation and taste than the cuisine of Sichuan province, to which it is often compared. It evokes life in mountain basins and alongside tributaries of the Yangtze. In the Hunan Kitchen of Grand Sichuan, it comes to New York at about $25 a head. Those who recall when Chinese food first began to matter here, when it was a kind of joy to travel to Chinatown in search of raw authenticity and immense flavor, will discover similar joys here, though after a somewhat longer trip from Manhattan. Chen Gangyi, the chef and an owner, does not stoop to conquer. Cucumbers in scallion sauce could start your meal, refreshing and sweet before a small plate of smoked duck, or wood ear mushrooms in pungent vinegar sauce, or sweet hacked chicken with scallions and chili oil — or all three. A basket of “pumpkin cake” brings four small balls of mashed pumpkin rolled in panko and fried crisp: Changsha latkes, essentially. There is a pale yellow fish soup that evokes health and vitality, with slices of pale and perfectly cooked tilapia and wisps of pickled cabbage. Also a pork broth with red beans and yams that is impossible not to slurp and finish. These both taste of life beneath a warm blanket as, outside, sleet falls. Giant hot pots sit on many tables, each holding a carp head the size of a throw pillow. The fish is bathed in chili heat and a shimmering broth that is the very essence of its chief ingredient. “What kind of fish is that?” someone asked one evening. The waitress paused. “Big-head fish,” she said, and turned away. Diners new to the experience pause and blanch, take tentative bites and sips and are soon won over. There is remarkable flavor to be had amid the trial of getting the meat. There is lamb cooked soft in cumin and pepper, as gamy as if eaten in a mountainside hut and as glorious, better than the dry sautéed version of this dish you can find in some Sichuan restaurants; less salty, more fully flavored. Sliced cured pork comes wok-seared with dried turnips, a hash of nutty white vegetable bits and green beans run through with bacon and flecks of chili. Chicken with hot red pepper, the meat diced small either on or off the bone (state your preference with the waiter), arrives steaming with the breath of the peppers’ heat. It tastes entirely in alignment: fire against the sweet of diced ginger, with a faint sourness that makes the dish difficult not to hoard. Braised pork “Mao’s style” is a classic of the region, a thick cut of shoulder simmered into succulence with caramel and Shaoxing wine, and served with simple steamed baby bok choy. Star anise and five-spice round out the flavor. Mao Zedong reportedly loved the dish, and had his cooks prepare it for him in Beijing. You need only go to Queens. Sturdy frogs’ legs come in a hot-and-sour sauce that owes nothing to neon and all to vinegar and chili, a dish of velvet and as beautiful. White-pepper smoked beef offers wok-fried beef jerky in a dry sauce of preserved pepper  —  a dish out of the pantry rather than the fresh-food market. It’s forceful and good. (A bowl of stir-fried spicy smoked pigs’ ears comes from the same playbook, but the texture is about what you’d get running a football through a paper shredder. It is not for freshmen.) And plain green beans wok-fried with ground pork  —  “sautéed and dry,” in the parlance of the menu  —  is brilliantly done, neither crisp nor mushy, with excellent flavor. Best of all is the restaurant’s “BBQ” fish, a whole tilapia served crisp beneath heaps of yam and white potato, celery, peanuts, chili peppers and string beans, and bathed in a fiery sweet sauce ticked with star anise. A thatch of cilantro sits on top. The dish comes in a roasting pan about the size of a disposable lasagna tray, and is placed atop a portable butane heating element, so that it sizzles and steams attractively on the table as guests ladle vegetables onto plates and top them with hunks of fish. (You can get it with duck instead, or with pig trotters. This last item is a lip-smacker, fearsomely unctuous, very rich.) Beer goes well with this food, and it is funny to watch the waiters bring case after case of Tsingtao out of the kitchen in back to slake the thirsts of those who eat. (Tea goes similarly fast.) Dessert is the old pile of orange slices, same as it ever was. After the heat and the salt, they taste magnificent. Get out there and see for yourself.   Hunan Kitchen of Grand Sichuan ★ 42-47 Main Street (Franklin Avenue), Flushing, Queens; (718) 888-0553. ATMOSPHERE Modernist Mao.

297,The Fat Radish,1 star,"Feb. 1, 2011",Sam Sifton,Lower East Side,English,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/dining/reviews/02rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/dining/reviews/02rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THERE are two ways to look at the Fat Radish, which opened spare and loftlike on lower Orchard Street a few months ago. One is that it’s a smart little joint out of a Jamie Oliver photo shoot, a restaurant where almost everyone’s attractive, the cooking is good, the bill isn’t crazy, and you’d be a regular if you could. All are welcome, and the fries cooked in duck fat are superb. The other is that it’s a restaurant for good-looking youngsters on their third jobs and second apartments, single and raging, with summertime Montauk shares and memories of Belize and Gstaad. It’s nice, but not precisely for everyone. How you see it depends, as always, on who you are. Restaurants are tribal, above all else. The menu at the Fat Radish is British after a fashion, rustic at that, lighter than its promise, often more flavorful. The dining room is beautiful and airy, a space that might have been a sweatshop once but now belongs to art directors. (Really, it was a sausage factory.) Old plaster and hand-lettered signs are still visible on the bare brick walls, a city’s palimpsest. The entrance is through a chill and empty coffee bar that serves as a foyer. Coats hang on the wall in the hallway, as in a pub, and the dining room opens beyond them, wide and welcoming to those with narrow hips and no complaints about perching on benches or stools  for dinner. The crowd is elegant in mufti, nuzzling tight as if in on a secret. Along one wall, a marketing executive with feathered Madonna hair sat one night with friends and used her phone to photograph her food, a peekytoe  gratin off the specials list: soft, fat cubes of bread tendrilled with crab, moist and steaming, a Thanksgiving dream-dressing made real as February. (It looked good. It tasted even better. Here’s hoping it makes it to the permanent menu.) Two men sat beside her and gabbed poetry, the work of Robert Hass, and ate the pickled radishes that start every meal in the restaurant, crisp and tart. Behind them, a table of young women laughed together, six of them at once, necks swiveling. James Truman, once the creative director of Condé Nast, used a votive candle to light his menu, make it readable. He appeared tousled and schoolboy curious. He fit in just fine. Grüner flowed like water, and attractive servers in plaid shirts hustled this way and that, delivering food. It is mostly very good at the Fat Radish, an oft-changing list of farm-to-tabley salads and lightened-up gastropub standards and raw-bar treats. A salad of sweet carrots tossed with hijiki and crisp kale (the seaweed and winter green combining almost as if one were bacon and the other not, or vice versa) was a delight one night, especially alongside an English High Street marvel of pork pie studded with melting blue cheese. Sweet squash given the onion-ring treatment had enormous charm and flavor — fried food for the yoga set. And if that celery-root potpie could have used, say, a half-pound of ground beef amid the virtuous starch, at least it tasted sweet and buttery beneath its  flaky crust. Vegetarians, if not vegans, could love it hard. There was a Scotch egg that played pantywaist to the one April Bloomfield serves at the Breslin, but that was somehow charming for that — a bar snack played by Daniel Radcliffe, say, where usually the role would go to Daniel Craig. Its light crust of sausage allowed the egg’s flavor to shine more brightly, to the benefit of the contrast, at least this once. And on the other side of the coin there was a marvelously rich cut of duck rillettes to pair with onion jam, mustard and thick toast. It could be the restaurant’s best dish. The entree course brings a monkfish vindaloo to the tables of many, a deracinated version of the fiery Indian curry. The monkfish was well cooked, but the sauce was too thin and flavorless to stand up to its meatiness, and a bed of wild rice below the fish managed to taste at once under- and overdone. Pale, thick raita and flaccid long-bean chutney on the side did nothing to help. Better was a honey-glazed duck, sweetly crisp on the exterior and very rare within, served with kabocha squash that complemented it beautifully and wheatberries that provided a much-needed textural contrast for both. Ben Towill, the chef and a partner in the restaurant with Phil Winser (together they run Silkstone, a catering company), does a fine job with scallops, if they are on the menu, generally served with a sweet root-vegetable mash. They’re worth ordering. That’s true of another occasional special as well: Chatham cod, soft and yielding amid accompanying greens. Of course, there is a hamburger. At a place like this there ought to be one to offset the notion that incredibly skinny people don’t eat fat slabs of meat and cheese and bacon. (And pickles, too. They are like a salad to some.) And it is just the sort of hamburger you’d wish to eat in this setting, with a good crust and yielding interior, with oozing cheese. Still, it is overshadowed by those accompanying duck-fat fries, as large as a giant’s thumb. These are exceptional, particularly if consumed with the  house-mixed horseradish ketchup. (They are available as a side order, too.) Desserts are puddings, essentially, to use the British term: crumbly apple crisp; a soft bread pudding; caramelized bananas-and-cream. They’re perfectly fine, though the real sport is in seeing them consumed at neighboring tables, where they are much discussed, photographed, refused again and again, and then eaten in a blaze of glee and moderate self-loathing. The Fat Radish is a pleasant and pleasing restaurant for all this, however: a handsome young golden Labrador, camera-ready, hard not to like. To sit in its dining room as light plays off the huge mirror in back, candles flickering everywhere, eating rillettes and drinking wine, is to experience a small part of the New York that leads people here inexorably and always will. They get jobs and meet people at parties where they don’t know the host, start flirting with someone and end up talking about whether to go to dinner at the Fat Radish on Saturday night.

298,Anella,1 star,"Dec. 21, 2010",Sam Sifton,Greenpoint,"Italian, New American",https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/22/dining/reviews/22rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/22/dining/reviews/22rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ANELLA is an intimate little art house of a restaurant on a block in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, that might be a rough part of Paris or an old part of Boston, some forgotten corner of a city that can reach back into the 19th century for building stock and scale. The wind whips in off the East River there sharp as razors, and old women squabble in Polish on the street. You will need your adventure boots to get there, perhaps. But the narrow bar and dining room are warm as candlelight, decorated in that nice urban variation on farmhouse chic that is common to restaurants in north Brooklyn, all brick and reclaimed hardwood, with Edison bulbs hanging from the tin ceiling that cast shadows over pockmarked plaster and ancient paint. (Beards and cardigans abound at the tables, as well as vintage dresses, heavy clogs.) Service is easygoing, nice. And the food is a wonder: a tight and focused menu of simple, seasonally appropriate food from Joseph Ogrodnek, a talented chef who has been in the kitchen for almost a year. It is by no means a formal restaurant. There is a worn A.T.M. in the back. Drafts circulate in the winter’s chill, and the U-shape of the bar and dining room can lead to what traffic engineers call flow issues. Those Edison lights are so dim, it can be hard to read the brief menu. Still, for those amenable to a New Year’s resolution to travel the city more, to move beyond old familiar haunts to taste the new and delicious, Anella is a decent place to discover the nexus of geography and emotion. We are all in this maze together. Parts of it have really good restaurants. A flowerpot of bread will start your meal, the loaf served vertically within it in the manner of a cartoon mushroom, warm and cut into four wedges, with soft salted butter. It tastes of care and eccentricity combined, the work of a hippie mom in advance of a performance of madrigals: rich and white and plump. It calls for mulled wine; a wicked Manhattan does the trick as well, poured over plump little cherries steeped in brandy. (Wine can follow, off a reasonable list that runs at the Old World more than the New.) Mr. Ogrodnek is a skilled practitioner of the vegetable arts. Like Midas, who turned everything he touched into gold (and like Dave Pasternack at Esca in Midtown, who achieves similar results with fish), he elevates the simplest greens and tubers into realms more celestial than those we are generally used to in wintertime in New York City. “Roasted broccoli,” reads his menu. “Watercress, parmesan, lemon.” Well, yes. It has the flavor of everything good that can happen on a farm, with a pure vegetal sweetness enhanced in great measure by the peppery cress, the salty cheese, the acidic zing of citrus. A roasted beet salad achieves similar heights, with walnuts and baby greens, and little dabs of the mild, almost sweet blue cheese called gorgonzola dolce. So does a peppery green salad with apples, pecans and bits of sharp, nutty, English-style Cabot Cheddar, and another of sunchokes shaved thin, then served with orange segments, pebbles of pistachio and a few sheets of pecorino. This is dirt wizard food of high caliber, cooking that leads people to join community-supported agriculture programs and fill their homes with parsnips and kale. But Mr. Ogrodnek does not ignore the pleasures of the flesh. He put in time with Alain Ducasse at the Essex House,  then at Gramercy Tavern, followed by a turn with Jean-Georges Vongerichten at the Mark. He can cook with the confident sneer of a Frenchman. His steak tartare is a robust and flavorful thing, served beside crisp-cooked artichokes and a soft mound of oil-slicked herbs. His golden leg of duck confit with a pool of smoky, bacon-studded lentils happily straddles the crisp-soft divide. He takes sweet Chatham cod and pairs it with zucchini, broccoli, basil and a hint of chili fire, cooking the fish to beautiful flakiness, so that it slides apart under the least pressure from a fork. A fat pork chop, teamed with yams, maple syrup and pecans, nods to an America we all wish we lived in, where the pigs are fat and healthy instead of lean and terrifying, and yams taste of the earth and the sky, not marshmallows and despair. It may profile on the menu as too sweet because of the vegetable and the syrup. But there is harmony among  all flavors, and it makes a marvelous dish. There are pastas as well: a short rigatoni with pancetta, brussels sprouts and parmesan, the dish lightened with lemon juice; and a straightforward puttanesca that is a neighborhood favorite, a regular’s dish, suitable for weekly dinner at the bar, which was assembled from salvaged worktables from the Steinway piano factory in Astoria, Queens. (The regulars return in droves for Sunday brunch, which offers eggs and granola, crisp French toast and a hamburger that would do good service on the regular dinner menu, at least as an occasional special.) And do you remember when there was fried calamari on every third menu in New York, when those greasy rings were the sliders of their day? At Anella, the dish makes a return alongside silky anchovy mayonnaise as if to remind us why we once loved it. Steamed mussels come in a broth made fiery with soppressata and red onions, with delicate, earthy potato fries on the side. They are, likewise, a familiar dish made fresh in the execution. It is only in sweets that Mr. Ogrodnek stumbles, and then only in comparison to his work on the savory side. He makes a fine olive-oil cake, though, one worth ordering particularly after a dinner of roast chicken with crisp little fingerlings, creamy feta and a heap of salty, peppery wild arugula. The combination is bliss. “Sir, respect your dinner,” wrote Thackeray, thundering. “Idolize it, enjoy it properly. You will be by many hours in the week, many weeks in the year, and many years in your life the happier if you do.” Anella has no apparent ambitions beyond making this possible. Annoyingly, it takes no credit cards.. But Mr. Ogrodnek does his level best to make your trip worthwhile.

299,Riverpark,2 star,"Dec. 7, 2010",Sam Sifton,Kips Bay,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/dining/reviews/08rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/08/dining/reviews/08rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IT is hard to find places in Manhattan that are hard to find. But Riverpark qualifies. The chef Sisha Ortúzar opened this shimmery new restaurant, an addition to the empire of Tom Colicchio, at the end of a private street on the far eastern shore of Kips Bay in October. Cabs and pedestrians are reluctant to pass the broad brick gates at its head. They linger on the corner of East 29th Street and First Avenue, confused, wondering if they’ve found the right place. They have. Riverpark is down there all right, occupying a chasm between the New York University Medical Center and the sprawling wards of Bellevue Hospital Center, tucked away at the far side of the lobby floor of the Alexandria Center, a new medical building at the dead end of the street. ImClone, the cancer therapy outfit once owned by Sam Waksal and now by Eli Lilly, is the restaurant’s upstairs neighbor, along with a host of other biotech and pharmaceutical outfits. Night-time foot traffic near the restaurant is nil. Everywhere office lights glint, and potted plants sway in light breeze. The building’s lobby is, invariably, empty. You could set George Clooney and the writer-director Stephen Gaghan on the place to make a sequel to “Syriana.” Explosions and fire would look cool against all the glass and emptiness, with the darkness of the East River in the distance and, beyond it, the low twinkling lights of Long Island City. Cue black helicopters! Riverpark is not, perhaps, the sort of place that will easily develop a regular following beyond neighborhood residents (there must be some!) and a lunchtime crowd of doctors lingering over red burgundy with the people who sell them drugs. But it is a pretty restaurant all the same: a leather-filled and pin-lighted dining room with marvelous views, absolutely in the design mold of Mr. Colicchio’s other properties in Manhattan, though it is somewhat chillier in aspect, and with validated parking in the basement below. It supports a feeling of transience and anonymity, almost as in a dining room in a city far from your own. Jason Bourne, table for two. The menu is captivating, though, and the service amiable, professional and quick. The seating is comfortable and the noise level, even when Led Zeppelin is going in through the out door over the hidden speakers above, is low enough that conversation may remain at the center of a meal. If you haven’t been in the area since your child had ear surgery or after your aunt had that episode on the bus, Riverpark is a fine adventure to take. Certainly you can eat well. (Drink, too: The bar serves a wicked take on the Manhattan, with rye wisped through with single-malt Lagavulin, a smoky delight.) Mr. Ortúzar offers a dish of mackerel escabeche that is a good place to start, a kind of double-cooked ceviche on a bed of crisp paella with a blanket of the Ibérico ham known as pata negra. It is a Spanish-style trio with American heft. The acidity of the fish combines beautifully with the richness of the rice and slick, acorn-rich fattiness of the silky pork. He pulls off a similar trick with a tangle of braised octopus with cockles, using the bite of shishito peppers and a zap of lime to highlight the meatiness of the seafood. Also on the list of first courses, a mushroom consommé as deeply flavored as veal stock, with frisée for contrast and a Pecorino-dusted crouton for balance: winter’s bane. In the opposite direction, a salad of artichoke and fat knuckles of lobster, with orange and coriander, providing a taste of summer come late. Main courses follow with a Manhattan-requisite dish of diver scallops (fatty and sweet, here served with hen of the woods mushrooms, butternut squash and an excellent kale chutney), and another of pork chop (fat and juicy, alongside a tangy hash of brussels sprouts and apples, with a velvety parsnip purée). Roasted sturgeon, with sunchokes, radicchio, dates, pistachio and red wine, is a fabulous surprise, with its dense meat cooked into opalescent sweetness and accompanied by Middle Eastern flavors. And while dry-aged rib steak for two is an expensive shrug despite its accompanying truffled potato gratin, couples eating together may turn to a moist though riotously salty roast chicken with confitted potatoes, cipollini onions, Swiss chard, roasted fennel and gravy. Accompanying the steak on the debit side of the ledger: not much. The restrooms are in the building’s lobby, not the restaurant itself. This is a terrible trend, as more and more restaurants open as anchor tenants in office buildings and hotels. No one likes to leave one business to attend to another, then return. It is particularly awkward for Riverpark, which has but one small doorway at its entrance. Logjams happen there. Back at the tables, there is steamed branzino for those who wish to eat it. “Burnt” flour fettuccine, meant to approximate the slightly charred zing of great pizza, tastes only of ash despite its topping of Pecorino, cauliflower and bread crumbs. (Those seeking pasta should try the exquisite cavatelli with smoked lamb, mint and horseradish, which is strong-flavored and sweet, perfectly done, rich and fiery, a triumph of flavors.) And squab mole with grits and pistachio is a grim business in the bowl, with a mole that lacks the complexity of even Mexico’s middling efforts and a pigeon whose taste can’t support even that. It ought to be swapped out for the grits with country ham that occasionally adorns Craft’s menu. Wines are marked up moderately, even at the top end of the California cabernet spectrum, and offer some decent values for those willing to pad around the list awhile. The dessert menu sees its apogee in apple crisp and molasses poundcake. It is not trying too hard, which is welcome. So, are you going to go to this place? It is a sophisticated restaurant with an excellent kitchen, moderately priced, with good service, on a block that doesn’t show up on Google maps, more than a half-mile from the Lexington Avenue subway. The philosophical exercise of subjective idealism says it exists. A critical investigation suggests it’s quite good. But the success of Riverpark is still a mystery unfolding.   Riverpark ★★ 450 East 29th Street, Kips Bay; (212) 729-9790, riverparknyc.com. ATMOSPHERE Where are we?

300,Osteria Morini,1 star,"Nov. 30, 2010",Sam Sifton,SoHo,"Italian, Seafood",https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/dining/reviews/01rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/01/dining/reviews/01rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"MICHAEL WHITE cooks pasta and people go crazy. This has been the case since he was the chef at Fiamma Osteria on Spring Street in the early years of the century, and it remains the case at Osteria Morini, a casual new restaurant on Lafayette Street. Osteria Morini is dedicated to the food and drink of Emilia-Romagna, in the north of Italy. So Mr. White makes the little Modenese hats known as cappelletti, pillowy little numbers that he stuffs with truffle-scented mascarpone  and tops with garlands of wispy prosciutto. He serves them on a little grandma plate with a puddle of melted butter. You can sometimes hear gasps when people tuck into these, as they react to the feel of the dough in their mouths — the slickness, the taste, the excess in each bite. He rolls beautiful garganelli, squares of eggy pasta shaped into quills, and cloaks them in cream and truffle-scented butter, adds more of that prosciutto and achieves the same result. He cuts wide ribbons of tagliatelle and serves them floppy and coated with a ragù antica: onion, carrots, celery, tomatoes, beef, pork, veal, chicken livers, Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. It is Sunday sauce from some alternate world in which immoderation is only a starting point. Mr. White’s pastas glisten with pork fat, with butter, with cream, with oil. They are aggressively salted. They hang around on the outskirts of Too Much. That is true of almost everything on the menu of Osteria Morini, as it happens: of the fried Bolognese street snacks that can start a meal (little balls of molten béchamel, for instance, or skewers of mortadella, or squares of polenta topped with lardo), and of the immense affogato dessert (a cloud of zabaglione gelato, an ocean of espresso) that ought to end one. Mr. White puts Italian traditions through the American supersize machine. There is enough duck-liver mousse in his antipasto portion to spackle a room — and to engorge a diner’s stomach before his meal has even properly begun. He spit-roasts pork in a thick jacket of skin with rosemary and sage, then serves a huge disc of it, meat and fat in equal measure. He covers a fried veal cutlet with prosciutto and parmigiano, then cloaks it in truffle cream above a bed of buttered spinach. He threads sweetbreads and Hampshire pork onto a skewer and grills them as spiedini, with peppers, onions, sage and guanciale, the cured pig’s jowl sometimes known as face bacon. Polenta with wild mushrooms is a dish the size of a pie, and arrives from the oven the temperature of molten glass. It is all comically overmuch, a Pixar vision of Italy’s upper thigh, a place where everyone rides Ducatis down highways the color of egg yolks. This theater of excess plays well to Mr. White’s role as an ambassador of Italian cooking. Walking the dining room in a gleaming white chef’s coat, he is at once  huge and cherubic, a Midwestern football star proud of the skills he brought back from the restaurant San Domenico, outside Bologna, where he cooked for most of seven years. (His mentor was the chef Gianluigi Morini, for whom this restaurant is named.) Mr. White shakes hands and kisses babies, leans in to speak to customers, dances back to the kitchen to check on this or that, and then returns, arms spread wide, to welcome yet more people to the party. It would be a hard act to maintain for anyone, but it must be particularly difficult for Mr. White. He is the executive chef of no fewer than seven restaurants in New Jersey and New York, including the more formal Alto, Convivio and Marea, all in Midtown, and Ai Fiori in the Setai hotel on Fifth Avenue, which opened on Monday. When Mr. White was present at Morini this fall, the restaurant hummed. On nights when he was not, trouble could ensue. Pastas that had been brilliant once arrived at the table slightly overdone, or wildly salty, or insanely slick with butter or cream. A grilled branzino, with salsa verde, radicchio and roasted potatoes, became mush on the fork, and tasted of little more than its texture. That veal cutlet, transcendent on one visit, was served lukewarm under truffle cream that had already begun to set — a paint bubble drying, no longer wet, not yet dry. A roasted baby chicken courted irrelevance, mere protein and salt, barely crisp. Consistency matters. But with the exception of the hugely rich desserts from Heather Bertinetti, also the pastry chef at Marea, it is not a strong suit of the Morini kitchen. The restaurant is riotously loud above its terra-cotta floors, a cheery roadhouse filled with food maniacs, scenesters and a few Actual Italians. There are hefty farmhouse tables covered with paper place mats, heavy chairs in various colors, and everywhere knickknacks and curios and hanging copper pots and farm tools, framed photographs, books. Save for the thin brick-face wall on the restaurant’s north side, and the harsh light of the partly  open kitchen, it’s all very pretty. Rock music plays — a mix caught somewhere between the one you’ll hear at Babbo and the one found on the FM dial during a drive across country — and  efficient, knowledgeable waiters  toil beneath it, patient with the madhouse scene. Carolyn Defir, Morini’s manager, runs the floor with grace and skill. Even when the room seems ready to burst its seams, even with every third person shouting and friends swapping chairs as if they were at a wedding, meals proceed in an orderly manner, amid much good humor. There are bottles of lambrusco on practically every table. This frothy, purple wine is a signature of Emilia-Romagna, and the list at Morini —  assembled by Chris Cannon, the restaurateur who four years ago brought Mr. White back from a kind of exile in Wisconsin to be the chef at Alto and Convivio, and with whom he opened Marea in 2009 and Morini in October —  is rich in its various pleasures. For those who remember only the soda-pop flavors of the Me Generation lambruscos that once flooded the United States, a bottle of the Vittorio Graziano from 2005 will serve as an excellent starting place for a reintroduction. It is a truth of the restaurant business that you cannot make any money unless you expand. It is a related truth that expansion is dangerous, because it can stretch a chef too thin. Osteria Morini, for all its good nights and delicious wine, shows that danger plain.   Osteria Morini ★ 218 Lafayette Street (Spring Street), SoHo; (212) 965-8777; osteriamorini.com.

301,Lincoln Ristorante,2 star,"Nov. 23, 2010",Sam Sifton,Upper West Side,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"LINCOLN RISTORANTE is a large and glittery Italian restaurant that opened this fall under a swooping grass roof on the campus of Lincoln Center at a reported cost of $20 million, under the direction of the chef Jonathan Benno and his partners, the Patina Restaurant Group. That Mr. Benno can cook is hardly in question. He was Thomas Keller’s widely praised second in command at Per Se in the Time Warner Center, a restaurant that received four stars from The New York Times in 2004. He worked at Per Se until last January, when he left under a drumbeat of publicity to start Lincoln. Mr. Benno’s skills as a pasta technician are high. He is no slouch at the fish station either. His work makes it possible to eat well at Lincoln and, as at Per Se, to savor some bites as if they were sonnets. (The Vermont butter on each table at Lincoln is directly reminiscent of Per Se.) But such success in the kitchen does not mean Lincoln yet works well as a restaurant. On that score, Mr. Benno and the Patina Group still have some distance to go. They have built a restaurant that lacks a center — a restaurant in which it is possible to eat well without really having a good time. But, golly, is some of the food good. Mr. Benno’s cavatelli con vongole, for instance — which brings the rolled pasta into a warm bowl with soft razor clams and sweet peppers the same length and breadth as the pasta itself, with a little lemon thyme and a lot of butter — is a silky, luscious delight, the product of an exacting mind dedicated to sensual pleasures. His rigati, a hollow ridged noodle that he offers with Dungeness crab, sea urchin, peperoncini, a few sea beans and quite a few pats of butter, is similarly charged with excess, tasting of open ocean and marsh, and the milk of the cow standing upon the shore. Mr. Benno’s cod in prosciutto brodo is intense, a salty-sweet combination that lingers on the tongue. He coaxes immense flavor out of a veal chop, and pairs it with Roman-style gnocchi tight with cheese, sweet carrots and nutty chanterelles. His tasting menu recently featured a dish of malloreddus, the Sardinian ridged pasta, served with egg, parsley, lemon and a whole bunch of mosciame — tuna prosciutto, essentially. It was shockingly flavorful. The sticky black truffle sauce and dense soufflé of bone marrow that accompanied a serving of blood-red sirloin seemed almost spalike in contrast. He even does a nice eggplant parm, as if he were cooking on Bath Avenue for Grandma, and though you know she’d razz him for shaping it in a springform pan like a college boy, it has big flavor. But while restaurants are about good food, they are also about customer comfort, about space and its uses, cuisine and price, art and artifice. Lincoln at the moment, with its 150 seats just off the main court of the greatest collection of performing arts institutions in the United States, lacks those last two aspects most of all. With three separate dining areas that have no apparent hierarchy or separate personalities, the restaurant supports neither the genial clubbishness of its rival across Broadway, the more casual Bar Boulud, nor the elegant formality of Marea, the Italian restaurant on Central Park South that is in many ways its closest culinary cousin. It doesn’t seem quite comfortable in its dual role as both a cafeteria for the 3.7 million people who annually attend events at Lincoln Center, and a destination for the moneyed populace that, among other things, makes up the more than 400 board seats for Lincoln Center’s constituent organizations. The food is certainly fancy enough to qualify as destination fare. And the wine director, Aaron Von Rock, has built both a marvelous list of cocktails — including a make-your-own Negroni game that is a fine introduction to this delicious Florentine cocktail — and an interesting and value-heavy Italian wine list. But the service, which is competent if not particularly warm or solicitous, comes out of another restaurant entirely, one in which a good number of the people in the room need to get out the door in an hour either to make a concert or to relieve the baby sitter. The contrast can leave the customer feeling awkward and unsure. It is in no way lessened by the fact that so much of the focus at Lincoln is on Mr. Benno himself, displayed behind glass at the center of his immense open kitchen as if he were onstage, or a panda at the zoo. Servers refer to him with head nods, telling customers how “Chef” would like them to eat their food, and customers point at him as they walk past on the way to their tables, as if to introduce him to their guests as a concept: Artist at work! That protective glass in front of Mr. Benno is as much a shield as a proscenium, however. An occasional tense bark or shout leaks out from behind it. This keeps people moving along, their eyes front. Once trained on the menu, those eyes will pop at the prices, however. A single scallop, perfectly cooked alongside sunchokes and almonds, makes up an appetizer dish that costs $24. A wee bit of tripe and strozzapreti, elegantly paired with the crunch of herbed bread crumbs and some sweet tomatoes from San Marzano, goes for $28. (That eggplant parm is a side dish. It costs $16. Geddouttahere.) A blue-red dry-aged prime rib-eye runs $130 for two. In contrast, for $22, you could get a standing-room place in the orchestra of the Metropolitan Opera on Wednesday night to see Elina Garanca singing Carmen. Lincoln’s prices make more of a difference than they might anywhere that wasn’t the campus of a nonprofit organization dedicated to the promotion of the arts and education of the people. Yes, the food is terrific. But we go to Lincoln Center for both more and less than that. There are already a full dozen different arts institutions operating at Lincoln Center.

302,Lavo,0.5 star,"Nov. 9, 2010",Sam Sifton,Midtown East,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/dining/reviews/10rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/10/dining/reviews/10rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE imaginary mailbag this week spilled forth an imaginary request from an imaginary jock. I endeavored to answer him. Q. I need you to recommend a restaurant. I’m a 35-year-old professional in Manhattan, and I am looking for a place where I can take my boys from the office to meet this smoking-hot girl I hooked up with at Lily Pond in the Hamptons this summer. Me and my team, we’re big into that whole meatpacking district thing. We like steak, veal. Maybe Italian food? There’s one dude from Mexico City who eats only fish, which is weird. Maybe this girl would eat fish, too. I don’t know. We’ve been to something like 10 restaurants now, and I think her favorite foods are truffle fries and ketchup. But she drinks Champagne. So maybe bottle service? Speaking of, this place has to be exclusive. I need a little exclusivity to offset the fact that I’m taking a girl to dinner with six dudes who do math for a living, and not six girls who look just like her. Usually, she likes to eat in a room with women who look like beautiful giraffes and dudes tall enough to look down on them.  Which is, by the way, a message I totally endorse: I’m a former rugby back, 6-foot-3, 220!  Finally, if there’s a guy in the restroom who could hand me a towel after I’m done doing my business in there and washing my hands, maybe give me a mint or something? I would be into that. Old school! I would tip that guy $5 just for being there, you know? A. Broheim, let me set you up! Lavo is a large and almost luxurious new restaurant on East 58th Street, set above a nightclub, also called Lavo. It sits across the street from another nightclub owned by the same consortium, Tao. (You know Tao, Buddhaman. It’s where Kim Kardashian had her 30th birthday party.) The menu is Italian by way of a steakhouse, and if the food isn’t totally awesome, the portions are huge. You’ll love it. Lavo opened in September. The socialites and reality television personalities Tinsley Mortimer and Kelly Bensimon were both there on the first night and apparently put some kind of spell on the place, because roughly 70 percent of the women who eat at the restaurant look like one or the other of them. (An exception was the middle-aged woman in a teenager’s dress who smacked her older companion in the face the other night in the front dining room. She looked like Charo’s angry little sister and was immediately taken out to the street by two men in black suits.) There is a bar in the front of the place that moves from empty to packed at 5:30 p.m. and stays that way until very late in the evening. It serves as a holding station for people waiting for their parties to assemble: men in suits who’ve removed their ties, guys who worked in Brussels and don’t wear ties under their suits but sweaters, or little scarves. There isn’t a soft surface in the place, and the noise is cacophonous: it’s all raging id up there, a bull market in confidence, everyone waiting for the women to show. Beyond the bar, the room opens up beautifully, in debt to Keith McNally and his vision of what dining rooms in New York City ought to look like (imaginary Europe, with soft light and subway tile and old mirrors). There are tables everywhere, jammed one on top of each other as if to illustrate the concept of 110 percent, with a surprisingly high server-to-patron ratio. Which means you’ll rarely have trouble getting another $19 glass of Veuve. But it can be tough making your way through the room if you want to go to the restroom and dance with the man on the taps with the towels and mints. (Tell your lady friend not to forget her purse when she heads back there — she’ll need tip money for the matron handing out Now and Laters in that restroom, too.) The menus open up to almost the width of the table. You’ll want to get rid of these as soon as you can, if only to make room for wine. Here’s a cheat sheet: No one’s eating baked clams in this scene, but they’re the best appetizer, and you should stand strong for them. Fat littlenecks drenched in butter and garlic, they sit beneath bread crumbs funky with oregano. There is good sliced prosciutto as well, 18-month stuff out of San Daniele, served with a strange cornucopia of fruits and vegetables. Salads: huge. The mixed greens are the size of a throw pillow and come with pears and a gallon of sherry vinaigrette; the heirloom tomatoes with mozzarella comes with a full head of really cold cheese, like a softball on a plate. (Once there was burrata as a special: $32, and served just as cold.) There is even a retro number, with roasted beets with goat cheese and a sun-dried tomato vinaigrette. These are cold, too. Everything at Lavo that is served cold is served really cold — fridge cold. You want a meatball? You don’t, but they sell it as a signature item here, Lavo’s version of Nobu’s miso-marinated cod (not really!), a pound of Kobe rolled up into a too-salty ragu, or served with whipped ricotta or a salad. Better to order one of the oblong pizzas, which have a decent crust and which everyone at the table will eat. The lobster one, which unaccountably also arrives with roasted fingerling potatoes, is really not bad. Neither are the steaks: aged prime beef, grilled on the bone, with a wide selection of classic sauces and infused butters. Even if the evening falls apart, you won’t regret a beefy ribeye with green peppercorn sauce, served beside a cone of russet fries and a plate of sweetly bitter broccoli rabe. This is an expense-account meal, right? All in that will run a player more than $60. Other stocks rated buy include: The crisp chicken Dominic, with its dressing of white balsamic and chili flakes, and a wide footprint of veal parmigiano in a spicy marinara sauce. Avoid the rest, especially the gummy pastas, the shirt-cardboard veal Milanese. A roasted Chilean sea bass looks great going by under its sheen of sweet butter, alongside some tomatoes and a roasted portobello, and tastes good besides. But while I hate to say it, especially to you, we just can’t be eating those fish any more. Among other things, Jeremy Piven, they’re too high in mercury. Desserts, however, are designed with parties exactly like yours in mind. There are the standard gelati and tiramisu, just like a real Italian restaurant, a panna cotta cheesecake, like that. Most groups seem to order a huge Lavo log: an elegant Ho Ho, basically, with a toasted marshmallow sauce. It’s big enough to serve your table. They ought to be spinning music downstairs by now. Take your girl down and get some vodka on. Your boys as well. Courtney Love made an appearance last week.

303,The Lambs Club,1 star,"Oct. 26, 2010",Sam Sifton,Times Square Theatre District,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THERE was a table of fashion people having dinner at the Lambs Club on 44th Street the other night, men and women of letters and soft fabric drinking strawberry gimlets and celebrating lives that allow such pleasures. An enormous gas fireplace near the table roared away as if in a frontispiece drawing for a 19th-century comedic novel, and though no one could sit or stand before it for long, it was very beautiful. Red leather banquettes stretched far and wide through the black-walled room, beneath old photographs of Broadway and Hollywood legends, original members of the Lambs, a group that gathered until 1973 in this building, now the Chatwal Hotel. The venture is at once new and familiar, a clubbish offering from Geoffrey Zakarian, the silverback gorilla of Midtown hotel restaurateurs, who was, in 1989, the original chef at 44 in the Royalton Hotel, a block to the east. The scene at the Lambs can recall those days, the room filled with editors and artists, writers, models and hangers-on, along with Broadway actors and in-town rock stars and friends of Sant Singh Chatwal, who with Vikram Chatwal, his glamorous son, owns the hotel. They gather in contentment and good clothes first to drink old-school cocktails from Sasha Petraske, and then to eat Mr. Zakarian’s carefully prepared, wealth-friendly, vaguely internationalized comfort food, just as if it were 1989 all over again. Or, maybe better yet, 1962. For at night and during the day, the Lambs Club in 2010 does not recall 44 so much as it does the heyday of another clubbish restaurant on 44th Street devoted to the twin joys of celebrity and soothing luxury: the now-shopworn if still-beautiful Sardi’s. There is in both restaurants a kind of purposeful embrace of the neighborhood’s past at the intersection of show people and investors, aw-shucks tourists and savvy New Yorkers. The food is better at the Lambs Club, though, at least for the moment. (Hope springs eternal! You could build an empire out of the Sardi’s cannelloni au gratin.) The Lambs Club dinner menu offers food to fortify  the hearty as well as to charm those who eat only appetizers and head to the gym. A massive and tender arm of grilled octopus with lemon grass, turnips and potatoes, for instance, is an appetizer thrilling for its flavor and crust, its soft interior and delicacy. A bowl of simple pork-filled ravioli with peppery broccoli rabe and Sardinian pecorino intrigues and delights, since it is for once the taste of the vegetable and not the pasta or its filling that resonates in the mind and memory. There is, as well, a sweet and nutty beet salad with cool strings of stracciatella cheese beneath a drizzle of white balsamic vinegar. And if perhaps too much truffle oil has been drizzled over a plate of chilled melon and Serrano ham, the cracked coriander on the fruit makes up for it nicely. At least you’re not eating the lame and uninteresting Lambs Club salad, with its not-really-crisp “crispy-egg” dressing, notable mostly for a welcome hit of fresh tarragon. Of course, there is foie gras, a thick slice of terrine paired with country toast, with quince marmalade and nutty Concord grapes: perfectly acceptable. And there is yellowfin tuna, too, since no hotel-restaurant menu in 2010 could possibly be written without raw fish of some sort. Verdict: whatever. (Those interested in such will do better with the raw bar, which offers a good selection of oysters on the half shell, with a pungent house cocktail sauce served in a cleaned oyster shell.) Entrees are similarly mixed in intent and execution. Seared scallops with not-very-flavorful vadouvan sauce and porcini mushrooms represents the grim minority. But Joel Dennis, the restaurant’s executive chef, a veteran of the Alain Ducasse empire, has an excellent way with lamb: his roasted saddle meat, with polenta and pignoli, is musky and sweet, a gamy, rich pleasure. And his crisp Chatham cod cheeks with razor clams, Manila clams, little balls of fregola pasta and a hint of saffron in the briny sauce make up the restaurant’s best dish by far — an amazing collection of flavors and textures that is worth traveling some distance to try. Lunch plays the same game, if slightly more casually, with an excellent, tangy hamburger that is absolutely devoid of frippery, as well as a lobster roll, sweet and buttery, with estimable  chips on the side. And desserts, from the pastry chef, Elishia V. Richards, follow both meals as credits do a good film: obviously (profiteroles! Chocolate! A pot of cookies!) though with occasional surprises (a brilliant deep-dish lemon meringue tart, with lemon confit). Service at the restaurant is of the pleasant, professional, hotel-style sort, the kind that places efficiency and politeness over the actual sacrament. Which means it is fine except when it is not. At lunch last Wednesday, there were wobbles for some. A table of women was eating in a far corner of the restaurant, one of them known to me. I had asked her to record the pains and pleasures of her own meal against the possibility that, after a number of meals in the restaurant and a number of long and fruitful conversations with the restaurant’s beverage manager, Jordan Lari, I had been recognized. (Mr. Lari’s wine list is wide and immensely interesting, offering in one document a globe-trotting list of both values and bait for the sort of moneyed world travelers the Chatwals hope will fill their hotel and dining room.) The woman I knew ordered a hamburger and made a particular point about it to the waiter. She said she wanted the meat cooked rare. Very rare, she repeated. “Just off the cow,” she said, and her friends laughed. When her meat arrived, however, it was cooked to a gray pallor, very well done. The waiter retreated under a barrage of criticism. What seemed like “hours later,” the woman told me, “the right one came back, and very good it was too. But still.” So that’s a postcard from the front. Buyer beware. But still.   The Lambs Club ★ 132 West 44th Street (Broadway), Midtown; (212) 997-5262; thelambsclub.com.

304,Marc Forgione,2 star,"Oct. 5, 2010",Sam Sifton,TriBeCa,"American, New American",https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/dining/06rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/06/dining/06rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IN the imaginary New York of first novels and romantic comedies, there is often a restaurant like Marc Forgione, a brick-walled neighborhood spot glittering with candlelight and the promise of a third date going well. The restaurant is rustic and urban at once, a loft that might be in a town farther up the Hudson River. A long bar sits to the west, with a warm, rough-hewn dining room beside it. A couple sits at the corner table under mirrors, eating crisp chicken in a gleaming black pan, the meat sitting on top of golden potatoes draped with verdant broccoli rabe. In real life, they kiss. Around them sit other couples, young families, people on their way to that state. Later, the scene will shift toward off-work analysts from the counting houses nearby, local roués at the bar and shy visitors peeking at them over glasses of savagnin. Service is warm and practiced, the food about three times better than it needs to be. Marc Forgione, which opened two years ago on Reade Street just west of Hudson Street, is a model neighborhood restaurant in a neighborhood that has no shortage of them. Named for its chef, a partner in the enterprise with Christopher Blumlo, it was known as Forge when it opened, but a lawsuit threatened by the owner of a Miami restaurant of the same name forced a change in 2009. There are elements of Italian cooking on the freewheeling and often-changing menu, and French and Southeast Asian notes as well. You might start with a hiramasa tartare with avocado and Sichuan buttons, flower buds with a fiery, numbing taste,  then move on to scallops in a Thai curry, and finish with pumpkin pie. Really, you might. Mr. Forgione’s food is sometimes sweet. Other times, it is salty, sour or spicy. Sometimes it is all four — and loudly so. The brashness is deeply and above all American: an augmentation of international cuisines in a land of plenty. These menu predilections will come as no surprise to those who follow the bloodlines of professional kitchens. Mr. Forgione is a son of Larry Forgione, a precursor to the celebrity chefs of today whose cooking was so linked to the notion of a national cuisine that his flagship restaurant, founded in 1983, was called An American Place. Mr. Forgione the younger continues the family tradition. Recently there has been on his appetizer menu a dish called barbecued oysters, a riff on an old Paul Prudhomme recipe. Mr. Forgione naps four oysters in a Cajun béchamel, with a little bit of pepper-jack cheese and a dot of barbecue sauce, then runs them under the high heat of an industrial broiler. With a dusting of fiery spice powder — Ararat blend, from La Boîte à Epice — these come to the table in the manner of a postcard from Chartres Street, New Orleans. They taste of time travel, of a realization that sometimes the future lies in the past. Baked oysters under béchamel. With cheese! We might have forgotten all about that, those of us who generally sit in the sort of restaurants where people take pictures of their food. Two orders for four people would not be a mistake. Also on the appetizer menu: a TriBeCa take on Singaporean chili-crab, with the crabs swapped out for little cull lobsters cut into delicate bites, and the steamed buns that generally accompany the dish replaced with buttery Texas toast. The lobster swims in a fiery sauce of sriracha and butter, ginger, soy sauce and lobster stock, with a faint zing of lime juice. And what seems like really quite a lot of the stuff when the dish first arrives proves just enough for mop up with the bread at the end. Wait, these are just appetizers? Yes, and more of them follow, big boys with grace, as if they were Hells Angels dancing a jig. There is a kind of mac and cheese, for instance, with toasted orzo and gamy bits of lamb neck, marscapone flecked with black pepper and mint, and a garlicky crust of bread crumbs and melted Parmesan: a haute stoner’s reward. Also, a BLT salad that took up the very end of the summer’s tomato season, with beautiful fruit cut into fat dice, with long, crisp bits of fried pigs’ ears and a smoked onion rémoulade in the role of  —  what, mayonnaise, bread, both? (Who cares!) And perhaps best of all: a bowl of peppery gnocchi in a sauce of demi-glace keeping company with matchsticks of apple, micro-celery and knuckle-hunks of veal sausage made lively with coriander. Just like grandma’s. Main courses mostly steer closer to the center of the channel. But some, though not all, are quite good. (Scallops in a “lobster-Thai curry emulsion” ran hard aground.) The suddenly fashionable beef cut known as flatiron steak (it is the top portion of a cow’s shoulder, a steak that commercial butchers only recently figured out how to harvest effectively) was excellent, arriving on a wide plate with rich Maytag cheese butter and bordelaise sauce, along with chanterelles and black kale, its marbled meat tangy beside its sweet, salty accompaniments. Rounds of striped bass came wrapped in thin bacon, with mustard greens, cranberry beans and a soft, elegant broth. Mr. Forgione had deep-fried bits of the skin to make a kind of popcorn garnish for the dish. The texture raised the entire preparation higher. He paired a bit of pork tenderloin with pork belly and deep-fried nuggets of pig cheek, along with clams and matsutake mushrooms, then dusted the dish with black garlic powder so that it had a mysterious, almost smoky finish. This worked nicely as well. Mr. Forgione also excels at simplicity, however: That crisp, golden chicken with potatoes and broccoli rabe, cooked under a brick and served in that big black iron pan, is the restaurant’s best dish. The whole mess sits above a run of caper-shallot butter, dressed with chili flakes and parsley, and if it were a record you’d want to play it again and again. Eat it after a plate of those barbecued oysters, with a bottle of one of the restaurant’s big and fairly priced California reds, then finish with a dessert from Mr. Forgione’s pastry chef, Ashton Warren — a banana-split sundae, for instance, with fried banana and lots of chocolate. This all may leave you feeling a little rough in the morning. But you’ll be back, American.     Marc Forgione ★★ 134 Reade Street (Hudson Street), TriBeCa; (212) 941-9401; marcforgione.com.

305,Ayada,1 star,"Sept. 7, 2010",Ligaya Mishan,Elmhurst,Thai,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/dining/reviews/08under.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/dining/reviews/08under.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I KNEW Ayada was a serious Thai restaurant when I started weeping at my table. I had just tasted the som tum ($7), a pyramid of shredded green papaya studded with peanuts and doused in a ruthless dressing of raw garlic, fresh lime, dried shrimp, salty nam pla (fish sauce), sugar and a nigh toxic level of bird’s-eye chilies. (These are chilies so potent that the smell of them cooking once set off a terror scare in London.) One bite, and my eyes brimmed with tears. For a moment I thought my tongue was paralyzed. It was thrilling: so much of the Thai food in New York is docile, its spice neutered in a bid for Western palates. There were no such concessions here. But heat is just one weapon in the Thai culinary arsenal. And it’s not simply a matter of heaping on more chilies; that’s machismo. Great Thai cooking is stealthier: big flavors obtained by subtle means. The sour curry ($9)  was hot, too, if a tad less scorching than the som tum. But it was complicated, a sublime orchestration of tart and sweet, salt and burn. The curry was light as a soup, ruddy in color, saturated with mouth-puckering tamarind. A half-torn omelet with green veins (cha-om when in season, broccoli when not) bobbed on top, its frilly edges soaking up the broth. Dining in most Thai restaurants in New York can be frustrating. There’s  ketchup in the pad thai and  in many dishes  extra sugar, a practice commonly reserved to appease  children. But Ayada holds out a promise of satisfaction. Credit, in part, its  location, near Wat Buddha Thai Thavornvanaram, a Thai Buddhist temple in Elmhurst, Queens. The wat — whose blue peaked roof, scalloped in gold, rests atop a squat frame house like a beached spacecraft — is the epicenter of the neighborhood’s immigrant Thai community, which surely has some sway over the quality of the local food. Ayada feels like the  family-run places  in Bangkok, small but clean and neat, well cared for. The walls, painted celadon and cinnabar, are covered with nearly two dozen photographs of the Thai royal family —  formal portraits, vacation snaps, a 19th-century news clipping (in French) commemorating a trip to Belgium by the king of what was then Siam. The menu is encyclopedic, and there aren’t many overlaps — with the help of one of the patient waitresses, you can easily compose a meal in which each dish tastes wholly distinct. Better still, put yourself in the gentle but firm hands of the chef and owner, Duangjai Thammasat (known as Kitty), who hails from Pichit.  She’ll steer you toward anything with holy basil, whose flavor is sharp, less like licorice than cloves. Among the curries, she prefers panang ($8) to massaman ($8). (For the record, both are delicious.) You could happily confine yourself to the salads, which include a torrid larb gai ($8) made with ground chicken, shallots, mint, cilantro and a dusting of roasted rice powder for a nutty finish. Green mango comes with raw crab, to be sucked from the claws ($9), or with catfish that’s been flaked and deep fried so it looks like lace and melts instantly in the mouth ($10). Raw shrimp steeped in lime are arranged like petals, each topped by a hefty chunk of garlic ($9). They’re a doleful gray, gummy to the touch, and irresistible. At times Ayada has an almost town-hall atmosphere. Diners exclaim over the cuteness of children at neighboring tables, and Ms. Thammasat pops out of the kitchen to greet regulars. Some swing by just for fried bananas and leave crestfallen if none are available. Equally sought after is a dessert of mango (so ripe it’s nearly molten)  with sticky rice that’s been steamed with sweetened coconut milk until buttery ($6). Ms. Thammasat previously ran a grocery down the street.  Near the entrance to Ayada, she keeps a narrow bookcase stocked with tubes of durian paste and packets of dehydrated mango slices, grilled seaweed crisps and garlic bread. It’s a gesture of respect for the past, and perhaps a reminder of the importance of honoring your origins.   Ayada 77-08 Woodside Avenue (77th Street), Elmhurst, Queens, (718) 424-0844.

Joe Allen is a treat after a show, for lounging amid the posters advertising first-night flops. Sardi’s is best during one, empty and sweet, with Rialto lawyers arguing Guettel versus Sondheim over cannelloni au gratin. You can do well with charred meat at Frankie & Johnnie’s, or with fried shrimp at Gallagher’s, along with a steakhouse pour from the bar. For fine French home cooking, there’s Chez Napoleon. For garden-party tarrying, there’s Italian at Barbetta. A curry at Pam Real Thai? Sure, though you could end up looking like Elphaba if you’re not used to the heat. But the bulk of the pretheater restaurant scene is grim banquet food on polyester tablecloths: block after block of steam-table pastas and Diet Cokes; industrial salads; not-from-scratch chicken dishes; pound after pound of Sysco fries. Come in from Tinton Falls to see “Chicago” with friends, and it can be hard, if you haven’t conjugated all the malarkey or know someone who has, to figure out quite where to eat. Here is one place: Toloache, a Mexican bistro on 50th Street off Eighth Avenue. It opened in 2007 and looks terrible from the street, a cube-shaped restaurant under spectacular green-and-purple neon signage. You could easily walk by the place chuckling at the awning reading “Bistro Mexicano.” But nothing on Broadway is ever what it seems. Toloache is worth a second look. Julian Medina, the chef and an owner, is from Mexico City, classically trained in the kitchen, with a rich history in New York. He is a graduate of Richard Sandoval’s restaurants, a former kitchen boss at Maya and Pampano. He was the founding chef at Zocalo. (With Giovanny Campos, he also has the terrifically loud Yerba Buena restaurants downtown.) He is a marvelous interpreter of guacamole, of ceviche, of finishing-school tacos and wood-oven quesadillas. In Toloache (pronounced toe-lo-AH-chay, a kind of Mexican flowering herb), he has built up a nice restaurant. One of the great pleasures of the summer season in New York is to sit  at its comfortable tiled bar, drinking a fine house margarita or a tequila off the restaurant’s long and luxurious list, while eating a bowl of guacamole with the assistance of some tortilla chips, fresh, warm and salty. Follow this with a few tacos or quesadillas, cold beers and ceviche (the best is yellowfin tuna tuned up with jalapeño, Vidalia onion, radish and watermelon, in a dressing of Key lime juice). Suddenly, taking Aunt Miriam to “Phantom” doesn’t seem all that much of a chore. Three versions of the guacamole are offered. There is plain, of course, a fairly traditional mixture of roughly mashed avocado with some onion and Serrano chilies, a small dice of tomatoes and a sprinkling of cilantro leaves. A more fiery recipe offers chipotle and more tomatoes, a hint of queso fresco, some red onions. Best, though diners can happily argue the point, is the fruit-spiked version, in which the avocado slips around on bits of ripe mango and peach, with studs of pomegranate seeds here and there, the occasional crisp sliver of apple, of Vidalia onion. Thai basil offers a note of grace; habanero pepper a hint of sweet, serious fire. (A sampler plate brings all three.) The quesadillas are prepared in an ample wood-assisted oven in the middle of the dining room. It is the restaurant’s hearth and centerpiece. Two stand out, though all are fairly strong in flavor and execution: a manchego one with black truffles that takes on a doubly funky note from the addition of huitlacoche, a corn fungus; and a sweet and fiery shrimp-and-Chihuahua-cheese number with pineapple salsa and chiles de árbol. Tacos are likewise elegant and modern, fairly spare. You might try one with a filling of braised veal cheeks, onion, cilantro and a salsa spiked with chiles de árbol; another with maitake mushrooms and more huitlacoche, cactus and queso fresco. Some diners are keen on the Oaxacan-style filling of nutty dried grasshoppers with onion and jalapeño; more-vanilla tastes will run toward guajillo-marinated pork with grilled pineapple, or fried tilapia with jicama slaw and guacamole. The carne asada, with its grilled and salty skirt steak, is splendid. Entrees — what the restaurant calls platos principales — are less successful, too large and unwieldy for joy. Braised short ribs with an ancho glaze and celery-root purée, for instance, is muddy and wan; salmon with more of that huitlacoche-maitake mixture has almost the texture of pudding. You can do well, though, with a grilled skirt steak served with a cheese enchilada drenched in credible mole, with potato gratin (huh?) and a dab of guacamole on the side, or with shredded suckling pig from the oven, with a habanero-sour orange salsa, cactus avocado and a chicharron-spiked salad. Or simply stick to guac, tacos and quesadillas, and tweak the end of your meal with dessert — crepes with caramelized goat’s milk, Marcona almonds and banana ice cream is best, though many tables appear to stick to chocolate, scooping up a warm molten cake with dulce de leche ice cream before calling for the check. Reservations are an absolute must at Toloache, at least if you’re on your way to or from a theater. The restaurant has, in the three years since opening, built up a loyal following of customers who pack its main dining room and mezzanine in the minutes between 6 and 7:30 p.m. One reason for that is the food, of course, those entrees excepted. But it is also the service the restaurant provides, kindly and attentive to a degree that would be notable even in a business charging much more. The crew on the floor of Toloache works as well together as a bunch of old Broadway hands. They put on a good show, worth attending with a margarita in hand.","Guacamoles, hamachi ceviche, quesadilla with shrimp, tacos, quesadilla with huitlacoche and black truffles."
307,Tamarind Tribeca,2 star,"Aug. 3, 2010",Sam Sifton,TriBeCa,Indian,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/04/dining/reviews/04rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/04/dining/reviews/04rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IT is hard to know what to make of Tamarind Tribeca at first, seeing it rise up from the corner of Hudson and Franklin Streets, sleek and glass-fronted, like a bank. The restaurant is gigantic, occupying more than 10,000 square feet in the space where a sticky little coffee shop called Socrates and a grim sports bar used to be. (Nobu is across the street.) There are towering windows and acres of warm Brazilian teak, a run of marble at the bar, stairs up to a mezzanine. Roughly 500 staff members seem to be milling about in the mango-hued light. It hardly seems intimate. The foyer has enough room for a few dozen people. You can feel a little lost. Families are scarce in the dining room —  dates, friendships, too. Pressed shirts abound, and wide English ties. Suit jackets are thrown over the backs of chairs and bar stools. The restaurant seems almost ostentatious, with its excess of design and wide passageways: as if it might be a pan-Indian food mill for the professional class, of little use or interest to those who chase the delicious. The city has another Tamarind up in the Flatiron district, a decade-old exercise in sophisticated Indian cuisine, and when this TriBeCa version opened in April, it appeared simply to be a newer model of the first one, brought downtown to capitalize on the neighborhood’s wealth and proximity to the financial markets. But then! Here is a booth in which to sit, quiet and slightly removed from the bustle of the rest of the room, separated from others by a sheer curtain; or a little table in the restaurant’s back, like a small square off a town’s main one; or one of the tables upstairs on the mezzanine that looks over the dining room as if at a city. It comes as a surprise: Tamarind is an extremely pleasant place to dine, and despite the size of the room, it is possible for a group to have a conversation there as if in a private home. Here, too, is Gary Walia, the restaurant’s manager (nephew to Avtar Walia, the owner), directing his well-trained and helpful staff as if he were conducting an orchestra, greeting guests in the manner of a subcontinental Julian Niccolini, of the Four Seasons restaurant in Midtown. He treats strangers as regulars, and regulars with glee. The bar serves an excellent gin and tonic, cold and tall. And the restaurant has an extensive wine list, well suited to the cuisine, if a little vast and expensive at the high end. So, have a drink and consider some curry-laced crab cakes and crisp pomegranate samosas, and the promise beyond them of a menu that can take diners across India in the name of flavor, and represent that nation’s varied cuisine with pride and great skill. In London, where marvelous Indian food is as much a part of the culinary landscape as French restaurants or steakhouses are here, Tamarind Tribeca might rate a pleasant shrug. But in Manhattan, it is shaping up to be the best thing to happen to Indian food since Hemant Mathur and Suvir Saran opened Devi in 2004. The menu is more extensive than at Tamarind’s Flatiron branch. Under the direction of Peter Beck, the restaurant’s executive chef, it sprawls: cooking from Punjab, Goa, Hyderabad, Madras, Calcutta and Lucknow are all represented. And its desserts are ambitious, Westernized, recalling in sweets what the chef Floyd Cardoz has done at Tabla with savory Indian food, with a list that offers both a goat cheese crème brûlée and a brilliant coconut mousse “bombe” with a chocolate-Darjeeling ganache and pineapple butter cake. By all means save room for those. But begin your meal with an appetizer called bataki kosha, which offers a kind of rice-crepe egg roll of shredded duck scented with garam masala, mustard and onion, ginger and garlic, then deep-fried and served with tangerine chutney. Another, galouti kebab, traditionally made with mutton, brings small patties of lamb scented with dozens  of spices  —  coriander, cumin, cardamom and cloves are definitely four of them  —  that call out for Kingfisher beer and perhaps a second order. Nizami keema is a marvel: an appetizing sandwich of grilled and minced lamb, pungent with cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and a high pitch of lemon zest, in a small bun. As are turmeric-hued sautéed scallops, with poppy seeds and a bright lemon sauce. It is hardly soup weather. But Tamarind offers two worth tasting all the same, buttery and rich: a regal lobster with carrots and garlic, Cognac and cayenne pepper; and a silky butternut squash with fenugreek seeds, lemon grass and a low roar of green chilies. The entrees are as ambitious, though a simple, luscious, heat-infused chicken tikka masala proves a fine explanation of why this totally inauthentic dish might displace roast beef in the hearts of the British. Offset by a pile of goat-meat biriyani, funky and rich, some excellent stewed garbanzo beans with pomegranate powder, ginger and tomatoes, and some of the cheese-infused spinach known as saag paneer, it made for a memorable meal. So did lamb shank braised in Indian rum, with a soft, addictive sauce of onions, cashews, saffron and nutmeg, a perfect topping for the restaurant’s pillowy basmati rice,  and a good partner to a glossy bowl of dal makhani as well, lentils simmered with garlic, ginger and a great deal of clarified butter. Dry, chalky pan-seared halibut was disappointing, and a flavorful roasted lobster managed to appear on the plate as if it had been prepared in a wood-chipper. But sea bass cooked in the tandoor oven was breathtakingly well prepared, the intense heat of the oven somehow sealing in the flavor of the fish, and a dressing of thick yogurt, dill, lime zest and peppercorns enhancing it. Venison chops also benefited from the tandoor treatment, marinated in pickling spices, then coated in chickpea flour and yogurt before cooking. You might put these up against roasted lamb chops for a taste test, marinated in yogurt, cardamom, garlic, black cumin seeds and nutmeg. It’s a fair fight. Winner takes on the prawns: just charred by the oven, big and meaty, spiced to blaze mouths and bring laughter. Everyone wins.

308,The Lion,1 star,"July 27, 2010",Sam Sifton,Greenwich Village,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/dining/reviews/28rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/dining/reviews/28rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE Lion’s tale begins in 2006, with Graydon Carter. That year, Mr. Carter, the satirical-magazine outsider who had ascended Manhattan society to become editor of Vanity Fair, opened the Waverly Inn, a nostalgic West Village restaurant with no published telephone number and a dining room filled only with the people he wanted in it: the city’s media and celebrity elite. People were mostly friendly there. A fellow could introduce himself to a recognizable stranger — “Why, hello, Sir Howard!” — and no one minded. It was so difficult to get in that if you actually had a table, you were clearly in the club and welcome, at least if you didn’t pull out a camera or a notebook. (These were banned.) The food at the Waverly was basic and better than it needed to be. The chef, John DeLucie, served a toothsome chicken potpie, a fine hamburger. He did great work with beets. The restaurant was a hit, Mr. DeLucie became a star. Manhattan and celebrity being what they are, he now has his own restaurant, the Lion, a Waverly cub. Like its predecessor, the Lion is a renovation. (The space on Ninth Street has been many things over the years, including a grand old gay bar where Barbra Streisand got her start and, most recently, the restaurant Village.) Like the Waverly,  it serves mostly comforting, occasionally very good American country-club fare. The burger underwent an upgrade. The potpie took on sweet lobster meat to replace the chicken. But the Lion also seems to have swapped the warm exclusivity of the Waverly for a kind of populism that is more inclusive, but also far louder and less pleasant. Investors in the Lion include, among others, Dan Abrams, the chief legal analyst for NBC News; and David Zinczenko, the editor of Men’s Health. (Mr. Carter stayed home.) The owners may have hoped to ape the Waverly’s booking practices and serve customers whose names sometimes show up on the manifests of private planes. Les Moonves has made the scene there. But many JetBlue customers have come as well. There is a bouncer in front every night, standing on the stairs that lead down into the restaurant’s cool, dark entranceway. The bar is crowded beyond belief  with Delta Taus and other frat packers, men in distressed jeans aspiring to six-pack abs, women skating on the thin ice of fashion and yapping into mobile phones. Beyond them, down a hallway that leads past a busy open kitchen, is a dining room that soars up to a stained skylight evoking both Paris and the musical “Rent.” There are packed green banquettes, heavy tables and chairs, a stairway up to a private mezzanine and table. Art is on every wall, all of it hung salon-style and badly, with overlapping frames, a double-height gallery of prints: Basquiat; LaChapelle; a lot of work pulled from the photography archive of The Daily News. The bedlam of images is meant to evoke a modern history of New York. (Calvin Klein did a better job all by himself one night, staring out from his table of supplicants in back as if alone, or lost.) Beneath the frames sits the city’s present: a shouty crowd with corkscrew necks looking to see who will be next into the dining room, who next on the stairs. If that’s your glass of pinot, you can eat and drink well enough, all the way through to an excellent dessert of cheesecake in a jar, beneath a buzz of graham cracker. The Lion’s staff is well trained and patient, versed in the menu, accustomed to the eccentricities of Manhattan wealth and privilege. The sommelier is on her game. It can be a jolly space, and enjoyable. A yellowfin tartare with pickled vegetables and ginger-fiery lime vinaigrette is a pleasant way to begin a summer evening in the heat, and that lobster potpie — which you’d think too rich and creamy for July consumption — is its natural successor, surprisingly light and deeply flavorful. Asparagus may be long gone from your farmers’ market, but it is still growing somewhere: the Lion’s is served sweet, tangy and luscious, with trumpet mushrooms, a slow-cooked egg and a hollandaise of great delicacy. (In contrast, avoid the heavy béchamel with the restaurant’s already leaden artichoke fritters.) And Mr. DeLucie’s handle on the preparation of beets remains firm, in a pretty salad that combines them with their greens and an airy goat-cheese mousse. There are some pastas as well, the best of which comes with braised octopus, guanciale and a sauce of San Marzano tomatoes. (The loser is the sheep’s milk cavatelli, gummy and overdone.) For entrees, Mr. DeLucie offers a high-end, low-end menu similar to the one he used at Waverly: steaks and fancy fish on the one end; burgers and excellent fries at the other. The lobster aside, he generally does better in the meat department than in fish. Dover sole, while cooked to a buttery golden hue, is dry and mushy, far less interesting than the luscious hamburger he pairs with pork belly, provolone, smoked cheddar and caramelized onions. A rare Delmonico steak with béarnaise sauce and fries is superior to dry buttered scallops with crushed peas and a wax-bean salad. (Whatever you get, add fries.) Only a Berkshire pork chop with fermented black garlic and what the menu calls “applewood  smoke” really disappoints. It arrives at the table on a wooden cutting board, beneath a glass dome filled with acrid smoke. The flavor it imparts seems to be that which might have been achieved if someone had simply stubbed out a glowing Marlboro on the meat. Such a misstep rankles, and more than it might if the restaurant did not lack what Thackeray, in the actual “Vanity Fair,” called “the elegances of fine society and the confidence and affection of a home.” This was the true genius of the Waverly Inn, after all, what allowed it to serve truffled macaroni and cheese for $55 and have the world laugh. The Lion is a different animal. You can get a table there whenever you like, if only you call far enough ahead. And then that pork chop arrives. Who wants club food if anyone can have it?",
309,Má Pêche,2 star,"July 13, 2010",Sam Sifton,Midtown,Asian,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/dining/reviews/14rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/14/dining/reviews/14rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IT is a strange feeling, sitting in Má Pêche on a Friday night, well underneath Midtown in the basement of the Chambers Hotel, Modest Mouse playing at half volume on the stereo system as people drink wine and talk and stab at sticky pork ribs with chopsticks. The seats at the restaurant have backs to them. They are comfortable. There is plenty of space. There is nothing like this at the other restaurants in David Chang’s four-restaurant Momofuku confederation — of which Má Pêche is the newest, the largest and the first not located in the East Village. There is no extra space in the other Momofuku restaurants at all, no real creature comforts beyond the food and the service. There are just counters, nooks, sharp corners and little chance for intimate conversation, even at Momofuku Ko, which flies the standard of excellence for them all. (There, you just stare at the chefs and wait for the magic.) As such, Má Pêche is the first Momofuku restaurant truly suitable for dining with those the Internet calls the olds. (Though like some of its forebears, it takes no reservations.) Eating there is a little like visiting your formerly bohemian artist friend, whom you haven’t seen since he signed with Deitch and bought a double loft in TriBeCa. The restaurant opened slowly over the course of this spring, not serving dinner for months, gaining its footing, figuring itself out. Now there is even a pre-theater menu. There is an enormous bare-wood communal table in the middle of the dining room, shaped like an X, surrounded by smaller tables along the walls, beneath giant sails of pinkish canvas that stretch up toward a skylight. On one wall, near the entrance to the kitchen, hangs a large painting by the Mexican artist Miguel Calderón, which some may recognize from the Wes Anderson film “The Royal Tenenbaums.”Smooth concrete abounds. The food is not quite as precise and magical as it often is in the downtown restaurants, but it is recognizably Changish and strong: big flavors tied together with herbs and acids. Mr. Chang has installed Tien Ho, formerly the boss of the kitchen at Momofuku Ssam Bar, as chef at Má Pêche. Together they have ginned up a menu that nods in the direction of French-Vietnamese cooking, instead of the Korean-American-with-a-side-of-French cooking that first brought them fame. (Má Pêche means Mother Peach, in the Vietnamese-French dialect known as Tay Boi.) Accordingly, in line with a bistro, you may order from a raw bar — another first for Mr. Chang — offering oysters and clams, shrimp and Alaskan king crab, with a calamansi mayonnaise and a mignonette with a Thai basil bang. There is local fluke tossed with herbs and pickled pineapple, silky and difficult not to bolt. There is a flavorful squid salad as well, like a Vietnamese green-papaya salad born of the sea, cool and fragrant, chili hot. It is best to experience all these piled together onto a huge plateau fruits de mer, as if at some imaginary Balthazar in Da Nang. Keeping in that vein are Burgundy snails, rich and garlicky, in a sticky, satisfying sauce with pork sausage, a bass line below a tarragon melody: French food as cooked for French people. Steak frites also make an appearance, the beef run through a sous-vide machine before getting  a serious sear, crunchy giving way to soft, and a load of excellent, salty rice fries — stackable bars of rectangular, deep-fried rice noodle — on the side. And two people or more may share Mr. Ho’s giant roasted pork chop, basted with butter — a piggish rejoinder to the porterhouse at Peter Luger. There are also dishes that might have been airlifted from the Ssam Bar: fried cauliflower with mint and fish sauce, for instance; steak tartare enlivened by soy, scallions and yet more mint; a frisée salad with porky croutons and soft, slippery tripe. These make for a nice dinner, even if the cauliflower is perpetually overdone. With slightly smaller portion sizes, they make for an excellent lunch as well. (Best is a $25 prix fixe of luscious, crunchy-smooth shrimp spring rolls followed by a bowl of finger-thick rice noodles with spicy Iowa pork.) As at Momofuku Noodle Bar, where you can reserve seats for a massive fried chicken dinner, and as at the Ssam Bar, where a giant pork shoulder can be reserved, there is one large-format dinner available at Má Pêche: Beef Seven Ways, for $85 a person, with a minimum party of six. Mr. Ho has a marvelous hand with big cuts of meat, and the dinner is probably worth ordering once or twice in your life. Tongue salad with basil and plum vinaigrette starts the adventure, the plate paired with some seared wagyu with ginger-scallion sauce and radishes. These are followed by a charred and delicious côte de boeuf, with a huge pile of sliced lemon grass sausage cut through with Thai basil on the side. Yet more follows:  a pile of salty oxtails, along with a giant, soft and overwhelming braised shank of beef with crab paste and chilies that appears straight out of “The Flintstones”—  all of it served with lettuce cups, pickles and an array of condiments that will be familiar to anyone who has eaten in a Vietnamese restaurant. You get a shot of beef consommé at the end, a kind of palate cleanser, and you can, for $48 more, receive a fat round of stinky, ripe Époisses cheese, with plenty of warm baguette. It is a punishing meal, deeply satisfying and utterly over the top. (In a different economy, finishing it all would get you the dinner free, or at least a commemorative T-shirt.) No dessert follows it, though, because it is a tick of the restaurant’s that no dessert is served. You may buy a cookie or some soft-serve ice cream on your way out, at a branch of Mr. Chang’s Milk Bar, off the lobby. Service at the restaurant is of an extremely high standard masked by a casual mien, as is the norm in Mr. Chang’s shops. Cory Lane, who runs the service program for all of them, and Colin Alevras, the antic beverage director, who came to the restaurant from DBGB, patrol Má Pêche with grace and good humor, seeing around corners, anticipating needs. (What, you didn’t realize you wanted to drink some coriander-ish Leipziger beer with your steak and sausage?) Their staff members follow their leads. In the world of the restaurant-obsessed, the general assumption about Má Pêche has been that Mr. Chang was aiming for a place at the highest level of the mainstream — a coat-and-tie restaurant from rock ’n’ roll kids, as ambitious as his other businesses. Instead he has simply opened a very good restaurant for a Midtown business lunch, a celebratory steak dinner or a drink and some snacks after work. He and Mr. Ho may not at this point have any more ambitions beyond that. It makes the restaurant a success on its own terms, which may not be yours.

310,Balaboosta,1 star,"June 29, 2010",Sam Sifton,Nolita,Mediterranean,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/30/dining/reviews/30rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/30/dining/reviews/30rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"SO here is a young woman sitting in Balaboosta with her parents, explaining the menu to them. She has a boyfriend in tow. The two sides of the table regard each other warily over mash-your-own hummus, as a votive candle flickers against the dusk. The restaurant, a charming and casual Middle Eastern trattoria with Israeli roots that Einat Admony opened near the top end of Little Italy this spring, seems to be filled with such pairings: fathers and daughters, mothers and boyfriends. The older people look around wide-eyed and curious, as if children themselves. The children deal with this as best they can. Interspersed among them are neighborhood couples, weeknight office groups, friends meeting friends under warm wood, beside bookcases and white brick. The talk is of babies and work, Uncle Murray and this summer’s vacations. A pitcher of sangria slakes thirsts developed on the walk down Mulberry Street in the dank humidity of an early summer evening. Then a pizza resplendent in orange and green arrives. The orange is puréed carrot, spiked with the fire of chilies. The green is cilantro, laid over white clouds of goat cheese and lightning bolts of caramelized onion. The crust has a delicate skin that breaks open to reveal a chewy interior, deep in flavor, steaming hot. Possibly this is healthy food? It is addictive all the same. Later, the boyfriend wolfs his dessert, a floral malabi to make Claudia Roden proud. (There’s also a nice date and banana bread pudding.) He dabs at his mouth with a napkin, looks up at the parents in silence. They are drinking organic wine, of which the restaurant has a fine selection, inexpensive and interesting. There are some shy smiles. Who knows how it all will play out? Balaboosta, Ms. Admony has said, is  Yiddish for  “perfect housewife.” Quibblers will say it’s a Yiddish corruption of the Hebrew term “baal habayit,”  meaning the master of the house, or boss. The restaurant’s bookcases are in any event filled with cookbooks written by women. A large portrait of an aunt decorates one wall. There is a small bar up front, serving wine but no spirits. Ms. Admony, who also has a popular West Village falafel joint, Taim, stands in the partly open kitchen, her glittering eyes darting everywhere, her dark hair pulled back beneath a kerchief. She runs Balaboosta exactly as if she’d invited a room full of strangers for dinner, then told her family to be nice to them. The floor staff complies — they are professional, well versed in the menu, friendly, even kind. The intimate feel to the restaurant is real. But there is very little that is housewifey about its owner and chef. Her eyes flick this way and that, cutting like knives. Ms. Admony smiles sometimes. She can definitely cook. There is that semi-completed hummus to start, whole chickpeas rising out of a tahini bath in a marble mortar, crushed chickpeas beneath them, ready to be finished with an accompanying pestle. Dip warm, herb-laden pita into the mixture, sparkly with lemon juice, fragrant with roasted garlic. Consumed, it provides a taste of an Israeli idyll, the feeling of a warm breeze off the Mediterranean to ruffle your hair. (If you have hair.) Then pop a few fried olives into your mouth, crisp and salty beneath their skin, or drag them through a drift of thick, house-made labneh to soften their crunch beneath the yogurt’s tang. Have a ball of falafel wrapped around a tiny meatball, served with a green tahini sauce, a nod to Taim. Ms. Admony gently fries shrimp in a casing of shredded phyllo dough, then drizzles them with a dressing of flying-fish roe that accentuates the sweetness of the meat, the pure crunch of the coating. Three come to an appetizer plate. A moderately interested person could consume six and ask for more. There is an excellent dish of roasted cauliflower with currants and pine nuts, another of smoky eggplant on toast, with an herb salad dressed in a vivid citrus vinaigrette. A honeydew and cantaloupe gazpacho with almond brittle and a jicama-mint relish sounds preposterous. But Ms. Admony’s clever use of spice and heat to counter the fruit makes it a kind of summertime miracle, a soup you might want to eat for breakfast. (Or for that matter drink in the Nantucket high-summer  style, cut through with vodka, on a Wednesday afternoon.) Main courses can hardly compete against the starters and shareable plates. A fettuccine with tomato butter, zucchini, eggplant, sage and roasted garlic tastes studied and drab, redolent of  long shifts at the food co-op, a vegetarian mess. Lamb cooked three ways, with sunchoke purée and a Persian lime sauce, is perhaps two ways too many, though the soft sausage and chard-wrapped loin can do little to diminish the excellence of the roasted chop. And if slices of spice-crusted skirt steak are also wonderful, alongside a crisp and flavorful cumin slaw, there is still a thatch of gummy roasted sweet potatoes beside them, an underminer defined. (There are some roasted potatoes dusted with za’atar available on the menu of shared plates, accompanied by garlic aioli, that are a far better mate for the beef.) Better is a grilled branzino with asparagus, fennel and a citrusy salad, the fish served with a lemon-spiked dill sauce. Beautifully cooked, and firm and flavorful on the bone, it helps explain the enormous popularity of this farmed European sea bass, a taste of the Mediterranean recaptured by science. The restaurant’s best dish, however, is chicken under a brick: a sweet take on the classic preparation in which a half bird gets the squish treatment in a pan full of oil, its skin turning evenly brown and crunchy as its interior goes first pink and then juicy white. Served as it is here, with Israeli couscous, some dried apricots and soft leeks, and a small bowl of garlicky gremolata, it stands as one of the better chicken dishes found within the confines of Manhattan, and a league leader of the 10012 ZIP. It is a calling card for a casual, take-your-parents-or-a-date restaurant in a neighborhood that hovers just on the edges of chic. In cooking it, Ms. Admony shows herself to be a boss in full — 100 percent baal habayit. Balaboosta ★ 214 Mulberry Street (Spring Street), NoLIta; (212) 966-7366.

311,Takashi,1 star,"June 15, 2010",Sam Sifton,West Village,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/dining/reviews/16rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/16/dining/reviews/16rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"A LOBE of sea urchin sits on a small tile of raw, red, marbled steak placed on top of a single shiso leaf, the shape of the ace of clubs, and a rectangle of nori slightly larger than the meat. The package is meant to be folded onto itself, then touched to a low bowl of soy sauce and eaten in perhaps two bites: a raw surf-and-turf canapé, elegant and spare. Cool, uncooked chuck meat that has been chopped, chopped and chopped again  is placed in a delicate pillow over warm rice just scented with sweetened vinegar. The effect is meat sushi,  gorgeous and puzzling, red against the white of starch, the flavor of the protein almost indistinguishable to that of tuna. Raw tripe with a spicy miso sauce follows, salt and fire set against the spongy flesh, and a dish of flash-boiled shredded Achilles tendon, the tendrils fantastic in texture and taste. These might be dried tofu or cooked pasta, long mushrooms or pieces of ear: a magic, nervous-making dish. Cubed raw liver comes to the table as well, a chilled, lumpy stew dressed with salt and sesame oil. It tastes of lightning storms on the high plains, of fear and magnificence combined. It is faintly metallic, rich with blood. Still with us? Not feeling faint? These are all appetizers at Takashi, a modest and wondrous strange new restaurant on Hudson Street in the West Village that specializes in raw offal and Korean-style Japanese barbecue. They are simple exciting dishes: a taste of passion best consumed with cold sake and an open mind. There are electric grills embedded in the restaurant’s tables. A waiter will turn yours on when the appetizers are finished, then lower a narrow black exhaust hood over it. An element heats the mesh of the grill; the hood pulls heat and smoke silently away from the table, up to the roof. The whole contraption looks like a Swedish stereo system, or something out of an elegant German dentist’s office. Entrees to be cooked upon it include sheets of thin rib-eye steak, as beautiful as stamps or silk handkerchiefs; fingers of meat taken from between the cow’s ribs; meat from the short rib; skirt steak; smiles of cheek. There are sweetbreads, too, the shape of small clouds; papery disks of sliced tongue; accordion files of stomach and intestine; dark, crimson bits of heart. Put these all on the hot grill, one by one, bit by bit. Let them go crisp. Eat with raw Greenmarket vegetables, pungent kimchi, more of those shiso leaves. Takashi serves a dark-red pepper paste to go alongside the food. It is redolent of shrimp and sesame, garlic, ginger, fish sauce, the salty tang of fermentation. It amplifies the taste of all that it touches. The food beneath it is no less shocking if you eat it bare: it tastes wild, absolutely natural. In the thrall of its consumption, the whole dining room seems to pulse with life. Takashi Inoue opened this restaurant in April, with Saheem Ali. It is an intimate room of just 34 seats, all warm wood and clean lines. The style of the place is yakiniku, a kind of Japanese homage to Korean barbecue thought to have originated in Japan during the Second World War, when more than a half-million Koreans were conscripted into the Japanese army and brought to the island to work. Mr. Inoue is a child of that diaspora. His grandmother, who came from Korea, runs a small yakiniku restaurant in Osaka, Japan. He came to the United States three years ago to study English, and soon fell in with Mr. Ali, then a theater director who is now the restaurant’s general manager. Takashi is their first restaurant. Two philosophies are at work within it. The first has to do with the quality of the meat, which is superior to anything you will find in a traditional Korean barbecue restaurant, at least in Manhattan. (Mr. Inoue buys from Dickson’s Farmstand Meats in the Chelsea Market, and from the Pat LaFrieda outfit in the meatpacking district.) The second has to do with the diversity of the cuts of meat Mr. Inoue offers his customers. The overarching point of Takashi is to celebrate the cow in its entirety. There is even a whimsical mural on the restaurant’s southern wall that explains this, outlining Takashi’s devotion to horumon, a Japanese term for variety meats or offal that translates roughly as “discarded goods.” The meats are offered for grilling in one of two styles: either marinated in Mr. Inoue’s pepper paste or simply dressed with garlic, salt and sesame oil. Various soy-based dipping sauces come on the side. If seated at the open kitchen, it is easy to ask the chef which preparation is best for which cut: he is the muscle-bound fellow often wearing a baseball hat reading “Jack.”But if you’re alone and worried about what, say, “fourth stomach” tastes like, it is wise to ask for the marinade, which provides covering fire for those new to the texture. (For the record, fourth stomach tastes like the one scrumptious rubber chicken on the planet.) If you’re considering the rib-eye or skirt, you ought to stay with the plain salt, garlic and oil, which will allow you unfettered access to the taste of the beef. Make sure to ask for vegetables as well: a selection of Greenmarket beauties that make up a still-life that complements the meats. A raw baby carrot taken after a bite of the marinated grilled tongue, for instance, is a terrific combination; a soft, fragrant ginger shoot after a piece of simply dressed rib-eye is even better, a match that may haunt your memory for days. Consumed with one of the restaurant’s excellent sakes, adequate wines or seemingly mysteriously chosen beers (the Tusker Export is a nod to Mr. Ali’s Kenyan heritage), these have the ability to raise what might seem a stunt meal into a real one. There is but one dessert at Takashi: a soft-serve vanilla ice cream of Mr. Inoue’s devising, available with toppings that range from green tea to gold leaf, but which is best eaten plain. It has nothing to do with yakiniku culture, with Korean food or Japanese. It is simply a continuation of the restaurant’s cowish, idiosyncratic theme, a Zen riddle to consider as you pay the check. Takashi is probably not for everyone: too do-it-yourself and odd. But its eccentricity is honest,  its atmosphere winning and its food quite good. So there is large intestine on the menu.

312,ABC Kitchen,2 star,"June 1, 2010",Sam Sifton,Flatiron,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/dining/reviews/02rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/02/dining/reviews/02rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ANOTHER day, another restaurant from Jean-Georges Vongerichten. The latest is ABC Kitchen, a winsome sprawl on the ground floor of ABC Carpet & Home, luxe Manhattan’s best source for Ganesh statues and pillows marked with nautical signal flags. As has become custom for Mr. Vongerichten of late, it is very good. The notion of the place is haute organic and Hamptons sustainable. The restaurant is airy and open and relaxed the way the second homes of the wealthy often are, with LED-style lighting over warm floors. Ingredients for the cooking, as a position paper on the back of the chic cardboard menu declares, are “consciously sourced.” The breadbaskets were “handcrafted by the indigenous Mapuche people of Patagonia.” The words tumble out like refrigerator magnets onto the table. Everything here is: Fair trade! Globally artistic! Reclaimed and recycled! Soy-based! Post-consumer fiber! You meet people like this. Only when they are spectacularly good-looking and appear to be attracted to you are they manageable. ABC Kitchen pulls off the magic trick. The food is great and not terribly expensive. It is a pretty room. The crowd runs high-wattage with net worth to match. And the servers, who might be made up of the combined casts of “Glee” and “Friday Night Lights,”employ a fast-casual style that is a  variation on the one at Mr. Vongerichten’s Spice Market. The service at ABC Kitchen resembles nothing so much as what you’d probably get out of the house staff  at a weekend getaway with Barry Diller and Diane von Furstenberg. Shall we eat, darlings? For a farm-to-table restaurant, ABC Kitchen sure has a long diner-style menu: 46 items, from crudités with an anchovy dip at its top to baked endive with ham and Gruyère at the bottom. There are delicate farmers’-garden salads along the way, chewy whole-wheat pastas, college-educated cows and monkish chickens. It can be difficult to know where to begin. Here’s how: with  fiddlehead ferns roasted in the  wood oven, as fragrant and earthy as the forest floor, a complete rejoinder to the food world’s fascination with ramps. Also with a large hunk of toast slathered in rich, creamy chicken-liver mousse, or sweet, briny peekytoe crab meat. With roasted portobellos scented with celery leaves, one of the great underappreciated tastes of the refrigerator crisper box. Have these while you’re considering the rest of the menu, along with a bottle of Rolly Gassmann pinot noir, and life starts to look pretty good. Might head down to St. Bart’s next month after all. It’s much more pleasant in the off-season. The appetizers include a terrific plate of shaved fluke with grapefruit and tarragon, in which the sweetness of the fish melds perfectly with the acidity of the grapefruit, while the tarragon does a dance around the base. There are also baby leeks vinaigrette, one of those perfect French dishes Mr. Vongerichten sometimes throws into his menus  to establish a baseline  classical melody off which to riff. Dan Kluger, the restaurant’s executive chef, a veteran of Tom Colicchio’s kitchens and Danny Meyer’s, cooks it as well as the master, with real finesse. Oven-roasted asparagus is terrific as well, as is a salad of endive, Treviso radicchio and sugar-snap peas with tiny herbs and a dressing rich with Parmesan and cut down by Champagne vinegar. Taste that lime juice? That’s Mr. Vongerichten starting to play. Calamari coated in crushed pretzels is a failure, sadly, damp beneath its salty coating, with a whipped mustard aioli. But baby greens with sprouts, in a tangy dressing enlivened by lemon and yogurt, swings back toward success; a sweet mackerel sashimi fired by ginger and softened by mint pins the needle there. Pastas are only occasionally exciting, as in the ricotta-rich, black-pepper-showered cavatelli with guanciale, ramps, fava beans, peas and pecorino. But a few pizzas for your table would not be in error, starting with the delicious morels with Parmesan, oregano and a soft large-yolked egg. Clams with mint, parsley and fresh chilies was on one night sublime, about the best bivalve pizza on the planet: salty with a ping of fire, incandescent with flavor and texture above its soft, charred whole-wheat crust. It was overcooked and underseasoned on another evening, more like the third-best personal pizza available above 14th Street. The best of the entrees include a black sea bass with chilies, herbs, red bliss potatoes and spinach that can serve as an object lesson in Mr. Vongerichten’s and Mr. Kluger’s cooking. The fillet is scented with marjoram and mint, basil, dill and jalapeño, then roasted. The potatoes, meanwhile, cook in water infused with rosemary and tarragon, lemon zest, ginger. These all come together on the plate, with wilted spinach beneath a drizzle of olive oil and a bit of sweet lemon confit, with a soft yet crisp, sweet yet fiery precision. But steamed halibut with shiitakes, avocado and juiced asparagus isn’t chipped beef, not by a long shot. And while the strip steak is a chew, it still comes with brilliant glazed carrots and oyster mushrooms, worth ordering on their own. As at the Mark Restaurant by Jean-Georges, a restaurant Mr. Vongerichten recently opened on the Upper East Side, there is a hamburger on the menu. It is better here than uptown, with its tangy Akaushi-beef flavor, snappy pickled jalapeños, arugula- and basil-rich mayonnaise, sharp Cato Corner cheese and soft Eli’s bun. Also as at the Mark, there is a split-open, oven-roasted lobster, here seasoned with an almost-spicy vinaigrette that shines with lemon: sustainable luxury at $35 a throw. Desserts are quite plain at ABC Kitchen, as if  to avoid competing with the easy luxury of the surroundings and the deceptive simplicity of the entrees: fruit and sorbets; crumbles and pies. The best is a sundae comprised of salted caramel-peanut ice cream and candied popcorn, with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. It is the sort of thing you might eat on a Friday night as the traffic clears out on the L.I.E., before the drive out to Southampton for the weekend. Perhaps that sounds cynical? It sure wouldn’t if that’s what you were doing after the meal. And that’s the point of ABC Kitchen entirely: It represents fantasy, wealth without guilt, socially responsible hedonism.

313,Prime Meats,2 star,"May 25, 2010",Sam Sifton,Carroll Gardens,German,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/dining/reviews/26rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/26/dining/reviews/26rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THERE are really only two problems with Prime Meats, the very good and very beautiful Germanish restaurant in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. The first is that the restaurant accepts no reservations, which can wreak havoc on the evening schedules of visitors who come from beyond walking distance to eat there. You can see these people standing on Court Street nightly, staring through the plate-glass windows at a dining room packed with brownstone bohemians, third novelists, people with Web sites, with good art at home. They look slightly pained, these visitors from afar wondering about the life choices they made that put them in Chelsea or Park Slope or Montclair, and not down here in Carroll Gardens, this little Italian village off New York Harbor where life is obviously perfect. Prime Meats is not a new restaurant, precisely. It opened slowly over the course of 2009, and only recently completed the addition of a large dining room off the original bar that makes the place feel, at last, like a proper restaurant and not just a cool anomaly, a bar with good food. Streetlight reflects off Prime Meats’ shiny black exterior. The aesthetics are magnetic: Dutch paint, rubbed wood, old mirrors, brick, warm light out of the past. The man on the door smiles down from his perch, takes names and cellphone numbers, tells people he’ll call when their tables are ready. Maybe 90 minutes? A couple of hours? If only they lived on Clinton Street! They’d be eating right now. People want in to this restaurant so bad! And with good reason. Serious pleasures await within: a salad of greens slicked in bacon vinaigrette, say, with matchsticks of apple and crunchy lardons of bacon, followed by roasted La Belle Rouge chicken, the breast brined in pickle juice before cooking and the bird’s fat, luscious thigh meat shredded into a tangle with sautéed farmstand greens. It seems as simple a meal as you might find in a restaurant. But it is executed with a rare degree of excellence, from the salad with its silky nap of dressing and perfect, peppery greens  to the complementary textures and deep flavors of the chicken. The second problem with the restaurant is that it accepts no credit cards. This seems  slightly ridiculous in 2010. An argument can be made, perhaps, for a restaurant not taking reservations, particularly for locals, who come to Prime Meats early and late, but rarely at peak  hours. They use the restaurant for breakfast (oatmeal! French toast!) or for a terrific house-smoked pastrami sandwich at lunch. Learn the rhythms and you can avoid the crowds. Cash only, though? At a restaurant where a dinner for four might run a considerate host more than $400? Have a Manhattan made by one of the whiz kids back behind the bar, some mustachioed chemist with tattoos and an understanding of bitters that rivals a rabbi’s knowledge of the Talmud, then some brilliant oysters, fresh and clean and cold, tasting only a few hours out of the waters of  Cape Cod or the Gulf of Maine. Eat some roasted bone marrow with crunchy radishes, vibrant gremolata, caramel-like roasted garlic and toast; some malt-rich pretzels and fiery mustard; a spicy hunter’s sausage; a few scoops of snoutish pâté or thin-sliced smoked pork belly. Devour a steak or an excellent burger along with some salty, crisp fries the color of burnished copper. Drink some grüner with it all, or a few tankards of Sixpoint ale. But forget to line your pockets in the manner of a Biggie Smalls impersonator and you’re going to need to leave your guests before the end of it all, and walk to a bodega A.T.M. to rustle up enough cash to pay your bill. This is a grim feeling for a grown person to experience, right up there with walking around all day with a large knot of $20 bills in your pocket only because you’re going to dinner someplace that doesn’t take credit cards. Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli, who own and run Prime Meats along with the fantastic Frankies Spuntino up the street and another Frankies in Manhattan, are two smart fellows. They are in the highest tier of Kings County restaurateurs. It is time for them to deal with the presumably horrible paperwork that accepting credit entails, to eat the service charges the companies extract, and to join the modern age of convenience. There are really no other downsides to eating at their newest restaurant. The staff is exceptionally well trained and efficient, a crew of handsome men and women dressed as if ready to ride horses back home to Bushwick, where they trap beaver and make their own candles. And a meal in the restaurant proceeds with all the jollity and good manners of something scripted by Laura Ingalls Wilder and scored by the Grateful Dead. It is an extremely pleasant place. What to eat: a thickly torn, apple-wood smoked trout salad to start, served over a folded crepe made out of spelt, textured and rich, with pickled red onion, a buttermilk dressing thickened with quark and a mess of fresh greens. The Vesper Brett, a snack board of German cured meats with pickles, mustard and bread — it’s even better with pretzels. Sautéed mushrooms with a fresh egg softly turned into it as if it were dressing on a salad. Some phenomenal split-pea soup if the weather is even remotely cool, with smoked ham. Also: soft  weisswurst like a hot dog from a parallel and slightly more enjoyable universe. Crisp sautéed brook trout with fresh-shaved horseradish. A special of soft, sweet cod and firm, sweet spring peas. Sauerbraten in fragrant red cabbage, with pretzel dumplings. A massive côte de boeuf, for two people, served with a deep sear, bright red interior and awesome mineral tang. Spaetzle with Gruyère and ham. And another dish of it, with wild mushrooms and herbs. Dessert is an afterthought, really: decent crème brûlée; a warm chocolate cake; soft apple tart. But cheese is not. There is a nice selection of Northeastern cow, sheep and goat cheeses worth lingering over with a final glass of wine, before the application of an excellent cup of Stumptown coffee and the surrender of your table. Walk out into the soft Brooklyn night as the Jayhawks play over the speakers in the bar. The best restaurants give us a taste of the life we aspire to have.

314,The Mark Restaurant by Jean-Georges,2 star,"April 27, 2010",Sam Sifton,Upper East Side,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/dining/reviews/28rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/dining/reviews/28rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ONE of Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s newest ventures is a tangle of given names called the Mark Restaurant by Jean-Georges, in the Mark Hotel on East 77th Street. It lies behind a small bar filled with low-slung pony-skin chairs. Older men unsure of how they’re going to get out of them sit there, pondering the issue over vodka as cubs and cougars banter and text. Dinner seems unlikely. Past them, though, down a dark corridor that doubles as a modernist wine cellar, a very good restaurant blooms. Local burghers sit in the dining rooms alongside tight-faced matrons in vintage Halston, younger ones in diamonds and black pencil skirts. There are senior partners from white-shoe firms; publishing tycoons; one of the city’s premier public relations men, fiddling with an immense gold ring. One table the other night held a foursome openly gawking at Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn, who were settling into a table. A few evenings later, Paul McCartney and friends would be in their place, his knightship in sneakers. All were eating plainly as they sat on heavy, plush chairs under soft and flattering light, their faces glowing against the beige background, the whole earth-tone Mondrian scene of the Mark: comfortable as wealth itself. There were austere roasted meats and sautéed fish on some tables, hamburgers on another. There were Caesar salads, plates of simple pasta, bowls of soup. Conversation burbled along in the room like a stream swollen with snowmelt. There was occasional laughter. It is all very cheery in the Mark by Jean-Georges. Mr. Vongerichten himself has been present, on and off, standing by the passage to the kitchen, his hands clasped in front of his waist, dressed in crisp kitchen whites. What he sees before him surely matches the prospectus he offered the newly renovated hotel: a neighborhood restaurant for a neighborhood sorely lacking in neighborhood restaurants, with the prospect of hotel guests as insurance against those periods when the neighborhood is in Palm Beach or Paris, Nantucket or Gstaad. He turned on his heel the other night and disappeared. Perhaps he was heading downtown to look in on ABC Kitchen, the restaurant he just opened on East 18th Street. Or perhaps he was catching a flight. Mr. Vongerichten has 27 other properties operating under or near his name, from New York to Doha, Hong Kong to the Bahamas. He is a busy fellow. The menu at the Mark is a smart hedge against the possibility that his inattention would lead to a drop-off in quality there. It is so unambitious that it is difficult to fumble, at least as long as Pierre Schutz, a loyal Vongerichten lieutenant for decades who serves as the restaurant’s chef de cuisine, is there to keep a close eye on the plates. That doesn’t make it a bad menu. Four perfectly golden scallops, dressed only in salt and pepper, are a buttery, rich delight, enhanced by a small dab of a pink, sriracha-enhanced mixture of egg yolks, grapeseed oil, kombu seaweed water and orange and lime juice. This is served in a small bowl to the side and comes with all the “simply grilled” proteins, a separate category of the menu. Only the uncouth would call it mayonnaise. “The chef is known for his spices,” a waiter said one night, extolling the excellent lamb chops off that list. “These simply prepared items are for people who might be a little worried about that.” (Service at the restaurant is professional, if more casual than at the restaurant’s only real competitor in the neighborhood, Daniel Boulud’s renovated Café Boulud.) Caesar salad has been chopped into submission and dressed for a ball at the embassy, where anchovies are unwelcome, but a bowl of linguine served with cockles and parsley, slightly fiery in its salty, rich broth, is worth praising, even if it’s a recipe that riffs off one Mr. Vongerichten has cooked for years, and that appears in one of his cookbooks. Also recycled, pleasantly, is the pea soup, a purée of sweet green peas that taste of springtime and have the smooth texture of high-thread-count sheets; a version of it exists on the tasting menu at Jean Georges, Mr. Vongerichten’s four-star flagship near Columbus Circle. Blend in the accompanying cloud of Parmesan foam, and it’s like a lover sliding into bed: nice. An immodest little pizza of black truffles and fontina is an elegant and delicious take on the sort of puff-crusted pies Mathieu Palombino makes at Motorino, and worth a run through the excellent and deep wine list to find a pinot noir from Au Bon Climat to drink with it. Pizza at a Vongerichten restaurant? This one is exactly the sort to thrill a couple who hasn’t had a pizza since that time they needed to get takeout because there was a wreck on the Saw Mill up near where Hawthorne Circle used to be, and they didn’t get home from Tanglewood until nearly 9. And there is much to enjoy in the barely steamed shrimp salad with avocado and enoki mushrooms, dressed in a filmy Champagne dressing. The shrimp is slack and velvety against the firm, slick flesh of the avocado, as the nutty enoki bridges the two; it’s a magic trick of a dish. As is a fat cake of sweet peekytoe crab enlivened by ginger, with more avocado and lobes of pink grapefruit. It is as unmistakably Vongerichten’s as his fingerprint. A grilled veal chop served over rhubarb, peas and a spring onion fondue, meanwhile, is a pleasure worth gnawing, though doing so can draw stares in this room. So chicken with a Parmesan crust is a golden misfire, and a split roasted lobster with warm mushroom dressing is more self-indulgent than good. And so the cheeseburger, with its black-truffle dressing and melting Brie, falls into this camp as well. (It has a terrific pickle on it, though.) Erik Hubert, the pastry chef, will win hearts and minds with his cloudlike Grand Marnier soufflé and green-tea opera cake. Mr. Vongerichten’s great genius used to be how he used the spare aesthetics of Asian cooking to improve classical French cuisine. Then it became how he used the lessons of that experience to raid other larders, and to create steakhouses and street-food emporia, Japanese noodle bars and market-driven French bistros. Now he opens hotel restaurants all over the world. This one is hardly a risk. But it is a welcome addition to the Upper East Side.

It was after 10 on a Tuesday night, and the dining room was empty save for a table of four people finishing a collection of wan Italian food that, with a few glasses of wine, would cost them $593.37 before tip. Diner food at Champagne prices, one said. Though much of his senior staff wears suits, and many of his customers dress in luxe outfits from the upscale boutiques nearby, Mr. Balan was wearing jeans and an untucked shirt. His bleached blond hair was cut close and his expression was fierce, almost predatory. Mr. Balan stood amid sidewalk planters  of yellow flowers. These bring great cheer to the restaurant and to those passing by, as well. Flowers go far in explaining the appeal of Nello. Mr. Balan spat on the sidewalk and returned to the dining room, trailing smoke. He has claimed over the years to be a direct descendant of Vlad the Impaler. It seems entirely possible. Nello, which opened in 1992, is an ecosystem that is almost incomprehensible to those not a part of it. The food is not very good. Yet the restaurant’s customer base is built of the richest and most coddled people in the city, who love it for its elegance and, perhaps, simplicity. It is a private club of sorts, where the dues are paid nightly. The meetings are unadvertised. Nello’s dining room can be crowded at 3 p.m. or midnight. It can also be empty at 1 p.m. or 9 p.m. Regular patrons respond to whistles mere customers cannot hear. The table of four that night was made up of that latter group:  New Yorkers relatively new to the restaurant, unknown to the management. They ate crisp artichokes offered as carciofi alla giudia. These tasted of shirt cardboard. They ate sawdusty chicken livers lashed with balsamic. They sipped at lentil soup familiar to anyone who owns a can opener and shared too-salty saffron risotto, correctly yellow, of no particular flavor. They gummed at cannelloni with mushrooms that from the grit on them might actually have been harvested wild, as well as at rubbery swordfish drenched in mustard sauce, then laughed about  lobster ravioli so tasteless  it might have been prop food for an advertisement. Only an arugula salad with fontina and pears could have been mistaken for something good to eat. But for all that? There were more flowers inside the restaurant, sitting in vases on the linen tablecloths of every table, fragrant and beautifully arranged. The city looked fantastic beyond them, through the front window, which during the summer is mostly open to the street. It was, despite all, extremely pleasant in Nello that night. There were waiters and captains and busboys and runners standing at the ready, servants at an 18th-century court. They sprang into action at the merest gesture, smiles blazing, and soon returned with whatever the table needed: another bottle of water, say, or a glass of middling Sancerre, a gin martini. This began to add up. That water was $12; the glass of wine, $17; the martini, $22. The restaurant’s best dish by far is tagliolini with butter, truffle oil, shards of black truffle and Parmesan. It costs $100. If that is no matter, the pasta is extremely buttery and delicious.  Eat it and discover that Nello can be  a fair place to have dinner. The theater of the place is, in any event, magnificent. It is Stephen Sondheim’s city of strangers played for sociology and laughs: a middle-aged woman in hot-pink fur and very high heels almost wiping out at the stairway that leads from the dining room down to the bathroom. “Champagne,” she giggled in explanation, and tottered away. During the day, the crowd is women who shop and women who dress like their daughters and men who meet them for lunch. There are air kisses and the tinkle of tennis bracelets against wine glasses. The kitchen trades mostly in salad, wine and the occasional pasta or veal. (The menu is the same as at night.) If you desire more than a lemon-scented salad and don’t want to spare the $100 for the pasta with truffles, the best bet is a simple bowl of green and white tagliatelle served with prosciutto, green peas, Parmesan and pecorino. Not bad, if very rich. (And $38!) This is food for children raised in boarding schools. Vitello tonnato, meanwhile, looks good enough straight  from the kitchen. It tastes like sliced shoe, though, against a tuna sauce that carries a Miracle Whip tang. It’s grim, especially at $32. Rage can overtake a person at Nello: the place is what used to be called a rip. (And the desserts are stale to boot.) But if $32 means nothing to you, if it is the equivalent of the dollar the rest of us can spend on a slice of pizza off Times Square, the restaurant is welcoming and the people-watching  is nonpareil. There is nothing snobby about it at all, least of all the food. One night at dinner, there was a very tall woman in elegant  clothes, with skin stretched tight over her face in unnatural ways and glasses the size of salad plates to magnify that. She was eating with a small red-faced fellow with dark hair in a center part, who was  wearing an ascot and green Tyrolean coat. A cartoonist might render them as an awkward French giraffe and a mischievous Austrian chimp. The woman drank wine as the man devoured a plate of pasta in tomato sauce. (Decent, and, at $29, maybe a bargain.) They were a good couple. When he finished, she wiped at the corner of his mouth with a napkin. The man signaled to a waiter. He laughed and slapped the table with his open palm. “AAAH-gain!” he cried, happily. “Once AAAH-gain!” The waiter smiled and withdrew with the empty plate. Within 10 minutes the man was eating again. There were a great many black cars and luxury sedans out front blocking traffic that night. Across the dining room there was a long table of women in abayas, silently perusing menus. “Saudi princess,” said the maître d’hôtel. They sat on the banquette with their menus, waiting for a signal from her highness, who had the center seat. There at that table not covered in wines, they sat in two straight lines,  Middle Eastern Madelines. It was a picture-book moment in Manhattan, Nello at its finest.

316,Recette,2 star,"March 30, 2010",Sam Sifton,West Village,"New American, Spanish",https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/dining/reviews/31rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/dining/reviews/31rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"A GRAND parade streams along the West Village sidewalks, corner of 12th and Greenwich Streets, crossroads of a particular world. There are dog-walking flâneurs; Westbeth pensioners; the young and desperate en route to the meat markets of the meatpacking district a few blocks north. Here are cabs stopping to let out real housewives. There are young professionals walking home to small apartments filled with books. There is a restaurant, too, Recette. Jesse Schenker opened it a few months ago in the space that used to be Jarnac. It is small and crowded behind its windows, loud in the way that little Village restaurants can become loud, the sort of place men go wearing blazers, then pull them off halfway through the meal, where women flush and everyone leans into the table to talk. Mr. Schenker is 27, bearded, wildly tattooed, with time spent in Gordon Ramsay’s kitchen. For a while last year he ran Recette out of a Harlem bakery as a kind of private supper club, along with Christina Lee, his pastry chef. (Ms. Lee has bona fides of her own; she cooked at Per Se.) Now they’ve come downtown to go big: American food with Spanish flavors, cooked with French technique; small plates, high concept. The menu has a note at its top explaining that it was “designed for you to construct your meal in accordance to your appetite  — from one plate to a venturesome tasting.” This reads like something you might hear some poor sap say on television, serving six courses of three-bite plates to a judicial panel of restaurant hacks and dour comedians. Small plates, if you’re not  drinking sherry in Barcelona, rarely satisfy. What once were tapas are now things served on the Food Network. As in Chelsea galleries, though, perhaps so too in West Village kitchens: The artists who make the work are rarely the people who ought to explain it. The cooking at Recette is smart and imaginative, the food that results from it elegant and full of flavor. (The plates aren’t even that small.) The wine list is deep and the service friendly and able, if sometimes overwhelmed. You may have to ask for water a couple of times. There will be the occasional crash of a dropped wineglass. It is casual, almost to a fault. But Recette is a very good restaurant. Snacks, in the restaurant’s parlance, should start your meal. Order them the moment you sit, along with a glass of the restaurant’s excellent  grüner  veltliner, a 2003 Hirsch that has some character to it. You’ll want a platter of the restaurant’s cured and potted meats as well, along with some codfish fritters and a serving of cannellini beans with chorizo and white anchovy. The charcuterie plate offers slices of the small and peppery salami known as cacciatore and some melting sheets of Bayonne ham (air-dried in France, not New Jersey). These are unimpeachable. But Mr. Schenker’s foie gras terrine is revelatory, a single slice revealing a kind of glistening mosaic, perfect in its form, each lobe of the liver unmolested by the process: luscious, creamy, with a faint mineral tang. It’s a meat painting, an organ sculpture; like most complicated French cooking, it tastes utterly complete, perfect in the way a ripe strawberry is, or a fresh-shucked oyster. In that, the terrine plays ingénue to Mr. Schenker’s tête de cochon, also on the plate, a rough-hewn and big-flavored head cheese. There is some grainy mustard with it, a few sweetly pickled vegetables. These act as rings and scarves and kohl do for Jack Sparrow, played by Johnny Depp. They elevate toughness to beauty. The codfish fritters come beneath a drizzle of curried aioli, bright and lemony, and above a few tablespoons of fiery lamb-sausage ragù. This is a head-scratchingly good combination. You may wish for a double order, though the fish ’n’ meat combination is revisited with those soft white cannellini beans in their porky chorizo sauce, beneath anchovy hats. Brightness and fire combine again in the presence of acidity. Some more of that grüner would be nice with this. There aren’t really appetizers beyond the snacks, or main dishes. There is a short list of plates of various sizes, all ambitious in design and execution; the menu is remarkably free of stuff that’s available everywhere else. On the smaller, lighter end, a spring evening might suggest a salad of peppery wild arugula, with kumquats, mint, lemon, hazelnuts and a few shavings of ricotta salata for salt and creaminess. There is also an excellent little cigar of duck carpaccio wrapped around chicken liver mousse, accompanied by crisp apple and fragrant thyme. Pork belly, cooked with a sherry-laced caramel, with rock shrimp and roasted baby turnips, arrives alongside a spat of almondy, piquillo-fired romesco sauce. It’s terrific: Spain on a plate, as seen from Manhattan. And even the offal-phobic may be converted by a sweetbread fried crisp and to a melting interior, served with brown butter sauce studded with capers and dressed with lemon and parsley, aside some wilted escarole. It hits the flavor stations hard: salty and sweet, with an acidic bite at the end. Mr. Schenker’s ocean trout is sweetly nutty beneath its crisp skin, with an earthy dressing of smoked bacon and savoy cabbage, bluefoot mushrooms and a foam of emulsified shellfish broth that’s dated enough to be cheeky. It tastes of high tide and the sun. Pair it with a golden baby chicken served with soft grits and a rough mustard soubise. This makes for hearty eating and a strong case for more grits in your life besides. (Those obsessed with portion size will either rush toward or avoid entirely a single roasted scallop served with a smidgen of braised oxtail, earthy morels and a green-garlic purée, as in the Pacific Northwest. It’s phenomenally good, but you could eat it in perhaps two bites.) Ms. Lee, meanwhile, waits in the wings with her showstoppers. A roasted apple napoleon is one, served with caramel ice cream and a nearly savory Earl Grey milk jam. A deconstructed s’more that looks like an Elizabeth Peyton canvas is another, with graham-cracker ice cream, toasted marshmallow cream and a knife-cut of cayenne-hyped milk-chocolate ganache. This is what Girl Scouts taste camping, and what they spend the rest of their lives looking for at the end of meals. Ms. Lee and Mr. Schenker are going to be around for a while.

317,Strip House,2 star,"March 9, 2010",Sam Sifton,Greenwich Village,Steak Houses,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/dining/reviews/10Rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/10/dining/reviews/10Rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"EVERYTHING is new in New York save for that which is old, and when something goes from one to the other, the transition can be sudden and surprising: a wet foal that’s suddenly distinguished and large, a horse that rides with the weight of history on its back. Ten years ago, for instance, Strip House wasn’t a venerable steakhouse in Greenwich Village, with familiar cheesecake pictures on the scarlet flocked walls and 40-year-old men drinking Cutty at the bar, reminiscing about 30th birthdays spent there, how they’d stolen the racy Frette napkins off their table and taken the marrow bones the restaurant used to serve along with the steaks home to their dogs, now dead. They’d done the same thing at 32, at 36. (Maybe at 39, too? Such a history to the place!) No, in 2000, Strip House was just new and strange, a kind of simulacrum of a bordello restaurant in a city that might have been anywhere in America. All that was aged about it were the steaks and the sepia-toned portraits of forgotten opera stars on the wall, left over from when Strip House was Asti, an Italian joint made famous by its role in the Tom Hanks vehicle “Big.” It was a dining room for the green. William Grimes, in a review for The New York Times that year, wrote that Strip House wasn’t so much a steakhouse as “a catalog of hip references to the idea of a steakhouse.” He awarded the restaurant one star. Now it deserves two. Age has given David Rockwell’s design for the room a kind of gravitas, and with it the restaurant has gained some of the clubby appeal you used to be able to find at places like Gino,  on Lexington Avenue, which has a similar layout, or in the bar room at “21.” (As at “21,” there is great fun to be had in snooping about the place. In addition to portraits of Viennese strippers, torch singers and ancient celebrities on the walls, there is a signed portrait of Thurgood Marshall near the bar.) The service is professional and attentive, with none of the gruff theatricality that attends tables at Sparks or Smith & Wollensky. The wine list is comprehensive and interesting, with reds to surprise palates and draw the attention of expense-account auditors alike. And the food is generally marvelous, the steak often superb. Strip House belongs to Peter and Penny Glazier, the restaurant tycoons who own Michael Jordan’s in Grand Central Terminal, as well as mimeographed Strip Houses in Las Vegas and Houston, in Florida and New Jersey. The Glaziers buy a lot of meat. They use the leverage to secure excellent product. John Schenk, the executive chef at Strip House since 2006, makes sure of its use. He has his line cooks grill the steaks  tight and well, with a thick crust of salt and pepper that highlights the deep flavor of the beef. (The marrow bones may be gone, but a sprig of rosemary, stuck into a bulb of roasted garlic, still accompanies each steak.) Best is the New York strip, served on the bone and out of the short loin of the cow, 20 ounces of muscle that make up the bottom part of a porterhouse. The strip is the restaurant’s signature steak: beefy and rich, tender, with the kind of giant, mineral-tinged flavor that puts elbows on the table and calls as much for martinis as for wine. Paired with a colossal ovoid of potatoes fried in goose fat, and a vat of creamed spinach made chic with black truffles, Strip House’s strip is on its way to becoming an iconic New York City meal, perhaps one day to take a place near the pan roast at the Oyster Bar, or the Grand Marnier shrimp at Shun Lee. There are other cuts available: a catcher’s mitt of rib-eye, with perhaps a little too much fat for the Michelin inspector; a wide  porterhouse served in the Peter Luger style, with butter sauce; and a few versions of filet mignon, including a special that comes grilled on the bone. These last do as filet mignon generally does. They disappoint. (If someone insists on the filet, insist on a boat of Mr. Schenk’s excellent béarnaise sauce to go with it.) But a veal chop will work for anyone interested in a glorious reminder why we love grilled veal: it’s deeply sweet and tender beneath its crust, pale and pink, trembling good. And a rack of pungent, delicately fatted lamb in a mustardy bread-crumb crust, served with a soft white-bean stew, makes a strong case for inclusion on any table. It’s grassy and rich, not at all gamy, with beans that melt in their sauce. And while the goose-fat potatoes and truffled creamed spinach represent the top of the side-dish heap, it may also be worth considering a cone of golden fries; or a plate of crisp, gigantic onion rings; or even a baked potato with bacon, Cheddar, chives and sour cream that’s straight out of the American past.  Steamed broccoli? It sits on the table like a prude. Douse it in béarnaise immediately. There is more than steak and potatoes on the menu, of course. A terrific bibb lettuce salad with Stilton vinaigrette sits on the appetizer list beside  roasted bacon with arugula and Russian dressing, a sorority girl in her first low-cut blouse, across a table from a trader in broadcloth and loosened tie. Both are great. There is an irreproachable shrimp cocktail, a better crab cake, with bright corn salsa and a spicy rémoulade, even a beet salad that’s worth a strong look. (Avoid the house-made jerky, leathery and wan.) Yellowfin tuna with a green peppercorn sauce and a kind of sushi-bar vegetable roll is ruddy and rich, well cooked beneath a coating of sesame seeds. But pan-seared red snapper in a basil sauce, with a nice run of artichokes, pancetta and fingerlings beneath it, isn’t going to win the year’s sustainable-seafood award. For that, it’s still deeply flavorful, flaky and clean. You can always have lobster, fat beneath its hard shell, an Atlantic success story, a mess worth making. Desserts are of course available, but really there is but one to order, and for the table: a 24-layer chocolate cake the size of a stunt gift in the Neiman Marcus catalog. It’s neatly covered in ganache, fantastically rich and good, the size of a house cat formed into a triangle. Chase your portion with an espresso or tumbler of bourbon, maybe a glass of milk. It might make you feel younger. Strip House ★★ 13 East 12th Street (between University Place and Fifth Avenue), Greenwich Village; (212) 328-0000, striphouse.com.

318,Tanoreen,1 star,"Feb. 23, 2010",Sam Sifton,Bay Ridge,Middle Eastern,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"SATURDAY night in the neighborhood that once gave America fever, a Brooklyn that looks to itself for employment and has little time for the glittering island to the north.  A bridge rises out of it, a silver ramp, and you can see ocean beneath it, darkness running all the way to Portugal, and from there down the Mediterranean to the Middle East. Dinner time. Couples slide into tables at Tanoreen, Rawia Bishara’s marbled Levantine restaurant on the corner of Third Avenue and 76th Street in Bay Ridge, lately expanded from its tiny birth site in a storefront one block south. They join families with children, friends meeting friends. It is a lively, happy scene set beneath clouds of lamb, mint and garlic scents combined. Arabic music plays over speakers connected to a stereo set in back, and if this time it’s not the Lebanese siren Fairuz, singing “Al Bosta,” which evokes a village called Tanoreen, it might as  well be. Fairuz is known in the Middle East as “the neighbor to the moon.” Much the same could be said of Ms. Bishara, a Palestinian who grew up in Nazareth, in northern Israel, and who has been in the United States for close to four decades. She owns Tanoreen with her daughter, Jumana, whose eyes sparkle in the same almond shape as her mother’s. These  women rule over the kitchen and dining room with a kind of fierce benevolence. But it is the boundless cooking and endless, prodding hospitality of Ms. Bishara the elder that have defined the restaurant. At Tanoreen, she is celestial. Pickles come to the table first: delicate, sweet beets tangy with vinegar, lovely against a glass of mint tea. Palates jump to attention. They are greeted then by plates and plates of appetizers, or mezze. Sujok, an air-dried Armenian beef sausage scented with cumin and sumac, arrives in a small pool of spicy olive oil, bright with garlic. Eat a slice with a piece of the restaurant’s thin pita or crunchy zatar-spiced  bread, then take another bite of beet. Follow this with a bit of ethereal hummus, lightened with lemon juice to the point of being cloudlike, and some crazily flavorful tabbouleh, whose mint and bulgur combine into something that tastes very much like joy. There is baba ghanouj as well, smoky and rich in its eggplant base, and fattoush, a marvelous salad made of lettuce and cucumber, tomatoes and mint, sumac and parsley. It is dressed in olive oil, lemon and garlic, and layered in toasted wedges of pita, which Ms. Bishara uses throughout her cooking for texture, to great effect. Here now are some florets of cauliflower, browned to softness then allowed to cool, dressed in tahini and lines of pomegranate molasses, astringent sweetness against the flavors of sesame and vegetable. And a napoleon of eggplant, fried soft and sweet, then layered with baba ghanouj and festooned with tomatoes and — what’s this? — basil. Ms. Bishara’s translation of Middle Eastern cooking has Mediterranean accents, and occasional North American ones from her decades in the United States. And so the tang of cilantro enlivens some of her dishes, and the musk of basil, the welcome zing of jalapeño. In the opposite direction, she makes a simple spiced roast chicken with potatoes (and, for children, a mean plate of fried chicken fingers with French fries and ketchup), and a stuffed cabbage that your Uncle Murray who only eats tuna salad would devour. Tanoreen’s entrees are, in the main, less successful than the appetizers. Partly this is because the food doesn’t support the division of a meal into the Western tradition of starter and main course. After four or five delicious small plates, it’s difficult to do battle with a gristly lamb shank or one-acre lot of shepherd’s pie. It is smarter, perhaps, to order more from the appetizer lists — some small spinach or meat pies, for instance, and a plate of kibbe, the fried nuggets of ground lamb and spices that are meat’s answer to M&M’s, followed by some ridiculously flavorful stuffed grape leaves. Then  share sparingly of the main courses, along with some simply sautéed spinach or kale. The best of the entrees include lamb fette, traditionally a breakfast dish, here layered with toasted pita and yogurt, chickpeas and mountains of meat flavored with Ms. Bishara’s secret blend of Tanoreen spices (cinnamon, coriander, cumin, some nutmeg, dried ginger, rosebuds and pixie dust), with pilaf cut through with vermicelli. It would serve a platoon of Marines. There is also a terrific combination platter of grilled lamb and chicken, and another of delicate fried red snapper, and sautéed shrimp that is as redolent of garlic as that at any Italian ristorante on Sheepshead Bay. The kibbe entree is also worth a look — fried crisp on its exterior, with pillowy lamb within. The falafel sandwich is superb. Service  is professional if slightly scattershot — Ms. Bishara’s staff is still coming to terms, perhaps, with the larger room, which has 50 more seats than the old one, and a full bar besides. There are occasionally long delays between courses (another argument for investing heavily in small plates). You might need to ask for water a few times. But whenever spirits flag, it seems, Ms. Bishara appears at an elbow, eyes flashing and smile wide, to check in or apologize, to inquire after health and happiness, to see what might be done to improve the meal. This does a lot, as it happens, to mitigate a restaurant’s shortcomings. It is part of Tanoreen’s ethos. So, too, is dessert. Knafeh, or shredded phyllo dough stuffed with sweet cheese and topped with pistachios and rosewater syrup, is the  signature dessert. But sahlab, a sweet custard that nods to France’s occupation of Lebanon between the world wars, is worth a spoon as well, as is a plate of baklava, sticky with honey and rich with nuts. Tanoreen is, at the end, a deeply individualistic restaurant. Ms. Bishara is a Brooklynite, though also a Palestinian raised in Israel, where her brother served in the Knesset. Her restaurant has a Lebanese name. She sprinkles basil over her lamb. Is such cooking authentic? Yes, though no. It doesn’t matter and who cares. It’s mostly delicious. Authenticity, anyway, is almost always a lie.",
319,Motorino,1 star,"Feb. 16, 2010",Sam Sifton,East Village,"Italian, Pizza",https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/dining/reviews/17rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/17/dining/reviews/17rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THERE was a television crew in Motorino in Williamsburg a couple of weeks ago, Michelle Park from NY1 shooting a segment with the restaurant’s chef, the elegant young Mathieu Palombino. He smiled shyly in chef’s whites. There have been others. Fame stalks the restaurant, which has locations in Brooklyn and the East Village. Vice magazine came to film an episode of its “Munchies” program, which streams on VBS.tv. Frank Castronovo and Frank Falcinelli, who run the Frankies restaurants and Prime Meats out of a compound in Carroll Gardens, were the ostensible subjects, but they ventured to Motorino to eat pizza. They ended up spiriting Mr. Palombino back to their lair to make meatballs. Even the upstate media personality Rachael Ray has gotten in on the Motorino act, publishing Ed Levine’s and Adam Kuban’s lunatic cross-country pizza competition, a bracket-style run-up to the announcement of America’s best pizza, in the March issue of Every Day With Rachael Ray. (Motorino won in the eastern division; Pizzeria Bianco, in Phoenix, took the national title.) Ms. Ray is in the East Village outpost of the restaurant “far too often,” she told The Daily News. Motorino is having a moment. That seems fair. It serves the city’s best pizza. It does so consistently, at both locations, whether Mr. Palombino is cooking or not. Made to his specifications and cooked in the tempering heat of a wood fire, his crust emerges from the oven as a Neapolitan fantasy of crispness that is also pillowy and soft, sweet but not sugared, tangy without too much salt. Multiple visits to the restaurants confirm: Motorino pies are great hot out of the oven, 5 minutes later, 10. You can order too much, watch a pie go cool on the plate, eat it anyway and discover: terrific. You can order pizzas to take out, drive them across the boroughs in freezing conditions, get home and reheat the pies: still terrific. Even a slice in the morning, fridge-cooled mozzarella over tangy red sauce, exhibits the pliancy and flavor of bread, not cardboard. Pizza has been a big deal in New York since the first slice was folded. It has been a big deal in the upper reaches of the New York restaurant world since at least 2004, when places like Franny’s in Prospect Heights and Una Pizza Napoletana in the East Village first fired up their ovens at the dawn of the artisanal pizza age. There has been slippage since. Anthony Mangieri, the obsessive behind Una Pizza Napoletana, sold his space to Mr. Palombino last year and moved to San Francisco. Fads fade. And rise again. Later this year Keith McNally will open a pizzeria on the Bowery, Pulino’s, with Nate Appleman, lately of A16 in San Francisco. The debut is likely to be attended by some fanfare. Mr. McNally is to restaurant publicity as Emanuel Ax is to his Steinway. Motorino kept chugging along. And in the process, it became something more than an excellent pizzeria. It became a good restaurant. Of the two locations, the one in the East Village, small and built by Mr. Mangieri, is the less hospitable, though this does nothing to the quality of the pies. It is a narrow East Village storefront, with hard angles everywhere and an atmosphere that runs ever so slightly in the direction of an ice cream parlor. You can find a $175 Amarone on its wine list, which has been curated by Fred Dexheimer, a former BLT sommelier. To order it would be to render oneself a cartoon. Motorino is a good restaurant. It’s not that good. Better to take the L train the three stops into Brooklyn and enjoy the benefits of Kings County real estate: a large high-ceilinged room with warm incandescent lighting over wooden floors and soft-hued marble, the scent of the wood oven and the taste, against a cold Peroni, of transcendent pizza. A restaurant is more than a pizzeria, of course. Mr. Palombino, Belgian-born and a product of some of the city’s best high-ticket restaurants (for a time he ran the kitchen at BLT Fish), appears to understand that well. A meal in his restaurants does more than result in simply a Homerish mmm-good sigh at the quality of the margherita pie. (But, wow, that margherita pie is good: perfect-pitch dough with exactly the correct ratios of tomato to cheese to surface area to char to bubble and flat.) Mr. Palombino has put thought into appetizers: a wonderfully bright and flavorful farro salad, say; or a small plate of baby spinach and prosciutto spun together with stracciatella so that it becomes a new take on creamed spinach; or a plate of nutty, rich, fire-roasted mortadella that could serve as the explanation for the inclusion of fried bologna in the good-food hall of fame. His beet salad has a little red onion for acidity, some boiled egg for base, a little white anchovy for salt and tang, and ricotta salata to keep everyone cool. The dish never loses focus. It is a paragon of beet salad. (But he isn’t a god. His spicy roasted octopus and potato on East 12th Street tastes neither spicy nor roasted.) The margherita is Motorino’s baseline dish. Mr. Palombino provides two, one attached to an AOC designation as if it were a product of Naples. It features buffalo mozzarella along with tomatoes and basil. The regular uses plain old cow’s milk cheese. Both are outstanding. But a winter-special pie of brussels sprouts and smoked pancetta, dressed with mozzarella, garlic and pecorino, is like something from a magic act, a dog speaking BBC English. It is great and unsettling, far better than imagination would dictate. A cremini mushroom and spicy sausage pie, with smoked scamorza cheese, garlic, thyme and pecorino, arrives at the table ever so slightly watery, a little off-putting. Within five minutes it heals itself, and thus rewards the wait before eating. Choose white or red: a stracciatella pie, the cheese melted into the dough with patches of basil on top, with a drizzle of olive oil and a dusting of sea salt, grilled cheese for grown-ups; or a filetti one, with mozzarella, cherry tomatoes and a welcome bit of thyme that recalls the soft warmth of southern France. For dessert, there are bombolini — essentially jelly doughnuts, and delicious. These are a curiosity, as eccentric, welcome and interesting as Mr. Palombino himself: a celebrity chef who cooks pizza, a talented restaurateur who meets his modest goals with grace and wit. ★ 319 Graham Avenue (Devoe Street), Williamsburg, Brooklyn; (718) 599-8899; 349 East 12th Street (Second  Avenue), East Village; (212) 777-2644; motorinopizza.com.

320,Novitá,2 star,"Feb. 9, 2010",Sam Sifton,Gramercy Park,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/dining/reviews/10rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/10/dining/reviews/10rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"NOVITÁ is a designer shoe box of a restaurant around the corner from Gramercy Park, a basement room on East 22nd Street, a perfect neighborhood trattoria. It has excellent pasta. In any other metropolis in North America, it would be well known among that city’s best places to eat. In many cities, it would sit atop the heap. But in New York, a lot of people have never heard of the place. (How cool is that?) This is testament to the strength of our restaurant scene, to the sheer abundance of good restaurants here. And Novitá  is a very good restaurant. The restaurant’s walls are the color of old chamois. There are heavy windows along the street that look out onto the sidewalk as if they were part of a stage set for Audrey Hepburn. Flowers sit on their sills. Beneath them is a clientele that is perfectly New Yorkish: old and young and middle-aged, white and black, riotously Italian and fashion-forward,  Mitteleuropean and plain. For the uninitiated: Novitá  opened in 1994. (For those with elephantine memories, the space was once Huberts.) Marco Fregonese was an owner then as now, also the chef. He had cooked at Mezzaluna and Mezzogiorno before opening Novitá; he started his career in Milan cooking for Gualtiero Marchesi, whose restaurant was the first in Italy to earn three Michelin stars. Mr. Fregonese knows from fancy, as Ruth Reichl pointed out in a review of Novitá  in The New York Times, published in July 1995. He seemed “swept away by the desire to be creative,” she wrote. Ms. Reichl awarded the restaurant one star. It has gotten better since. Mr. Fregonese has moved away from some of the ornate, fussy preparations that used to mark his cooking and toward a plain and hearty style well suited to longevity. A plate of gramigna alla carbonara, for instance, thin strands of curled pasta with eggs, pecorino romano, guanciale and black pepper, arrives on the table as a riot of simplicity, a four-member noise band. It is outstanding, firm and pliant, salty and sweet, slick and sticky and rich. A simple appetizer plate of grilled portobello, shiitake and oyster mushrooms, with shavings of Parmesan over the top, is similarly plain  — and similarly packed with flavor. (Shiitakes stuffed with shrimp and scallions, then pan-fried, are more complicated  — and very hard to stop eating.) Breaded baby eggplant baked with tomato, mozzarella and Parmesan is like something out of a Bensonhurst fever dream. If served on a hero there, it would give veal a run for its money. Asparagus gratin you probably shouldn’t eat till spring, so as not to encourage FedEx farming, but it’s wonderful all the same, bright beneath its butter, nutty with cheese. And a small plate of hand-cut prosciutto with airlifted melon slices tastes like Manhattan’s past made living, like a delicious early dinner at Mezzogiorno, in fact, with Marlboro smoke drifting out through the open windows on Spring Street and people arguing about Mary Boone. There was quite a bit of meat on that plate, for the record, and no shortage of melon. The portion sizes at Novitá  are notable. They may surprise those who make it their business mostly to eat at the city’s newest kitchens, people with a genetic predisposition to this year’s model, people with cats named Umami and Speck. You won’t go away hungry from Novitá; the plates are food, not art. To this point, Mr. Fregonese has clearly thought about the visual composition of each dish. But none of the food at Novitá  looks as if someone spent a lot of time moving it around with his fingers, making it just so. That, too, is welcome. So is the restaurant’s wine list, which is of an agreeable size and breadth, with some nice reds out of the Veneto (including a nice “baby Amarone” from Allegrini, 2006) and Tuscany (try the vino nobile from Avignonesi, 2006) that offer good flavor in the $50 range. The pastas are just ridiculous: perfectly prepared, full of flavor, a rejoinder to low expectations. You might try a bright and floral pesto over the long cavatelli pasta known as strozzapreti, or priest chokers, studded with pine nuts and salted with Parmesan. Or a plain penne with roasted tomatoes, basil and mozzarella that tastes of triangular perfection, summer on a midwinter plate. Black spaghettini with mixed seafood and a spicy tomato sauce is worth a mini-fad in itself, with pasta that is  toothsome and a sauce made rich with lobster. Three more: little ears of orecchiette with spicy sausage and broccoli rabe in tomato sauce; papparadelle with lamb ragù and earthy porcini mushrooms; rigatoni with seared tuna, black olives, tomatoes and oregano. These are like postcards from an Italy of the mind, color swatches to recolor your world. Indeed, the best way to order them is as a table, asking the waiter if each person might get a portion of the other’s order. This is a very nice way to eat dinner. Main courses are less successful, though by no means off-putting. Seared tuna with a black pepper crust and lemon sauce may be the parachute pants of entrees,  but  it is perfectly done fish for that, under velvety lemon sauce. A filet mignon with more of that asparagus and a dark Barolo sauce is banquet food, but of the sort that forgives the banquet. But there is also a splendid veal Milanese with rucola and tomates, crisp and juicy, the sort of dish you could eat once a week, and a rolled chicken breast stuffed with spinach and prosciutto that revives confidence in both chicken breasts and stuffing them. Eat these, with some fresh berries for dessert, some lemon-mint sorbet, a creamy mille foglie,  cemented with custard, and savor a glass of amaro or a well-drawn espresso. Giuseppe Delpiano, the host and an owner of the restaurant, sits at the bar eating his own dinner as around him conversation gurgles, an urban stream. There is one older couple holding hands over their table. A man in a ponytail fiddles with his earring. Someone laughs. At times Novitá  resembles the lobby of the Angelika theater, or a late afternoon ride on the M102. It provides a jury pool that would understand completely what brought you to do what the prosecutors say you did. It is hard to eat there and not think yourself lucky.

321,Maialino,2 star,"Jan. 19, 2010",Sam Sifton,Gramercy Park,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/dining/reviews/20rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/20/dining/reviews/20rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"MAIALINO is the restaurateur Danny Meyer’s latest venture, a Roman-style trattoria at the Gramercy Park Hotel. It is warm and familiar, comfortable, a trattoria in an imaginary Rome where everyone comes from Missouri and wants you above all else to have a nice time. And what’s wrong with that? Maialino is a very good restaurant. The food is by Nick Anderer, who had been at Babbo and Mr. Meyer’s Gramercy Tavern. Mr. Anderer is a New Yorker, born in Indiana. But his cooking is the genuine article. You’ll find praiseworthy bucatini all’amatriciana on the menu, with a thick, spicy tomato sauce studded with guanciale, the excellent cured hog’s jowl known among the food-enthralled as face bacon. You’ll find rich spaghetti alla carbonara as well, with more of that guanciale, as well as eggs and black pepper. It’s breakfast, lunch and dinner in a bowl. You’ll find stracciatella, the Roman chicken soup with thick strands of egg, a cold remedy, a soul-warmer, a find. You’ll see offal, artichokes, mint. And of course you’ll find pork. Maialino, in English, means little pig. We’ll get to it soon enough: roasted, braised, fried. But first,  a drink at the bar, which sits near the entrance. It is long, wide and walnut, maybe the most cordial surface that the designer, David Rockwell, has ever put into a restaurant. Much of Maialino looks like a Pottery Barn. But the bar is custom work: elegant and spare. It’s as pleasant a place for a breakfast coffee or lunch salad as for an evening glass of Frascati. The combination is rare in a bar, especially for the Gramercy Park Hotel, where the breakfast special used to be vodka to cure the shakes. Once a high-bohemian enclave, the Gramercy had some tough dances in the 1990s. It almost disappeared before Ian Schrager bought the building in 2003, and enlisted Julian Schnabel to help design the interiors. Food followed, and Manhattan diners behind it. This took some time. (For a while the space that Maialino occupies was Wakiya, an upscale Chinese restaurant.) The dining room now opens to the west of the bar, showing weathered wood floors and oak wainscoting, past stations for bread and dessert, salumi and cheese. Here studious young men and women bend to the task of assembling cold antipasti and hot espressos alike, dressed in long bistro aprons and beanies: gastro-nerds studying at the University of Meyer. Graduates work as waiters beyond them; doctoral students as managers. The young professor Stephen Mancini, who was the sommelier at Mr. Meyer’s Union Square Cafe, is Maialino’s restless and enthusiastic wine director. He circulates  among the well-spaced tables, with their white tablecloths placed over blue-checked ones, talking diners through an all-Italian list filled with  crazy finds. “The way this guy releases vintages, it’s like he’s Neil Young releasing live recordings,” he said of Giuseppe Quintarelli, while pouring that vintner’s 1998 Ca’ del Merlo Valpolicella. “He only does it when he’s ready. It’s rare. It’s beautiful.” And, at $104, it was a rare splurge that turned out to be worth the coin on a stranger’s say-so. Start with salumi. Mortadella from Emilia-Romagna is particularly nice, nutty and rich, with Tuscan salami from Berkeley, Calif., as its foil. There is soppressata from Long Island City, Queens;  speck from the Alto Adige; and prosciutto from San Daniele and Parma. There is also one from La Quercia in Norwalk, Iowa. It matches the Italians in every aspect and exceeds them for lightness of flavor. Antipasti are also a strong suit: luscious quasi-Roman standbys bulked up to American standards. Fried artichokes with an anchovy-rich sauce make a fine introduction, and celery root with a soft-boiled egg and shaved mullet roe deepens the acquaintance. Mr. Anderer’s tripe is served in a tomato sauce with pecorino and mint. It’s light, delicate even, slightly sweet, with a backbeat. You can dance to it. Entrees bring a moist and flavorful plate of swordfish with mushrooms and fennel fronds, and another of crisp deviled chicken with black pepper and pickled chilies. There’s a fair dish of lamb chops with sunchokes and radicchio, a passable sea bass with mizuna salad. Side dishes range from bright, spicy Swiss chard to sour, amazing Treviso alla piastra, like turbocharged radicchio, pungent in the extreme. But let’s talk pig. It is at the heart of the menu. Mr. Anderer turns the legs of his suckling pigs into soft braised meat for a perfect pasta dish of torn shreds of malfatti mixed with arugula, nutty and sweet. The feet (no restaurant in Manhattan in 2010 fails to find room for feet!) are fried into delicate little appetizers, with beans and celery beneath them. The rest of the animal, meanwhile, is slow-roasted then cut into portions. Loin, belly, ribs and shoulder, these become the restaurant’s centerpiece meal, maialino al forno, which appears only to be listed as a special to avoid having a $72 entree on a menu that otherwise tops out at $32. The skin, blasted to crisp in a hot oven, is dusted in rosemary, cracked fennel, salt and pepper: an apparently unambitious preparation that tastes just great — pork at its best. Over roasted potatoes, the dish can serve three with ease. Maialino al forno is a sorry-grateful, regretful-happy way to eat dinner. It leaves a diner panting a little, ready for sleep. Have a slice of olive oil cake, like a poundcake just back from a junior year abroad, and you’ll barely make the cab. Better to revive yourself on the back of a simple affogato, vanilla ice cream drowned in espresso, or with the spirits of a strong grappa that cuts through all that maialino. Was New York City a better place when there were sad old men sitting at the bar in the lobby of the Gramercy alongside stooped former artist’s models, with smoke curling up toward the ceiling on exhalations of gin breath and despair? Probably not. But the era is worth recalling as you sit at Maialino, drinking prosecco or coffee and looking south toward Gramercy Park as cabs inch past. Yes, the impetus for change here was Mr. Schrager’s hotel. But it is Mr. Meyer who has brought New Yorkers to the room, to the view, back to the neighborhood. His restaurants have almost always done this in some way. They encourage their customers to appreciate what sits outside them, to rediscover Manhattan in the process. They direct attention to architecture, to parks, to the ideals of urban life. Mr. Meyer has changed the city with restaurants. Isn’t that something?","Salumi, fried artichokes, tripe, pastas, swordfish, deviled chicken, roast suckling pig. "

Also a soft-boiled  Scotch egg, the orb caked in sausage meat, then breaded and fried. Dinner follows. It begins with a cup of onion soup in which you could stand a spoon, and toast slathered in bone-marrow butter. There is also fried head cheese with sauce gribiche, king of mayonnaise. Your entree is a deep-fried stuffed pig’s foot, the size of a toddler’s leg. It is meant for two people. It could serve a table of four. For dessert, sticky toffee pudding and a marvelous version of Eton mess, meringue slathered in lemon ricotta cream. There is also eggnog as interpreted by someone interested in the intersection of hallucinogens and psychotherapy, all folded egg whites and sugar: liquid velvet, ecstasy in a cup. A shot of Sailor Jerry overproof spiced rum is down at the bottom of it, a base of caramel beneath the cloud of white. It is either an antidote or a force multiplier. It may be both. This is the Breslin on a Thursday night, a warm, crowded and vaguely British barroom off the lobby of the Ace Hotel: a bedlam of gastrotourists and scenemakers. It’s Hogwarts for hipsters. It is also the Breslin on a Saturday night, and on a Tuesday night, whenever you come in the door in darkness and hunger. The restaurant takes no reservations; it celebrates a democracy of the committed. Save for at breakfast, over pancakes and Stumptown coffee, the restaurant is almost perpetually jammed. At night, out in the bar, people dance in place, drink amber cocktails, listen to music that bounces smartly between rock and hip-hop. They wait endlessly for tables to clear. Their faces — mustachioed, unlined or dusted with glitter, behind geek glasses or Edie-style eyeliner — are filled with anticipation. At the tables in back, as they stare down shins and stomachs, sticky bits and syllabubs, they look a little scared. Nowhere in New York right now is the fetish for pork fat and dairy flavor more on display. April Bloomfield, the chef and an owner, is exhausting gallbladders nightly. Ms. Bloomfield is well known to food crazies in New York. She arrived in 2004 as the kitchen force behind the Spotted Pig, in Greenwich Village, helping to deliver Manhattan its first true experience of a British gastropub. In 2008, she and Ken Friedman, her partner in the Pig and now in the Breslin, opened the John Dory, a fish house in a narrow space on lower 10th Avenue. The restaurant didn’t work, but not because anyone faults the pairing of butter and fish. The partners spent about 30 seconds back on their heels. John Dory closed at the end of August 2009. The Breslin opened in October. Now it’s pig parts for Ms. Bloomfield: an entree of gently smoked pork belly that’s been roasted to tender goo, for instance, over a drift of buttery mashed potatoes, with cabbage and bacon on the side. This is excellent. Now it’s warm smoked salmon with bacon, chives and a rich garlic and butter sauce. There are terrine boards and piccalilli, parsley served over everything, a garnish exalted. There is a marvelous Caesar salad: an herbed-up version with anchovy croutons. And a rich, salty mussel soup with curry butter. It tastes like a date you don’t want to end. And it won’t, as it happens. The Breslin is the sort of restaurant you end up thinking about a lot, not always pleasantly, staring up at the ceiling at 3 in the morning in cold sweat and mild panic. Yes, the food is good. But it is monochromatically good: it is 10 colors of fat. Excess can become wretched, and fast. It’s cool to hook up with the Breslin, especially if you’re lucky enough to sit in one of the semiprivate nooks near the open kitchen. But we should see other people. It would be death to be a regular there. That said, there is the pig’s foot. Regardless of what it will do to you later, it is a non-negotiable one-time order for those who eat feet. For them, if not everyone, it is a must-to-consume. (Get the sea bass if you’re horrified. It’s cooked on a plancha and served with Treviso, along with some potatoes and anchovies; it’s rich without being ostentatious.) The French take a trotter and braise it forever, then coat the wobbly result in mustard and bread crumbs and fry it crisp. The Italians take the bones out, then stuff the skin with ground pork from the trotter and elsewhere — the same mixture they use for cotechino sausage — and sew it back into shape. Ms. Bloomfield somehow does both. She serves the fat result in gravy made of reduced braising liquid, thick with pillowy shallots and green flecks of deconstructed brussels sprouts. It’s very good: meat that is fat; fat that is meat. (Food that is sticky.) A lamb burger acts as a kind of diet plate in contrast, gamy on its sourdough bun, with feta, cumin-rich mayonnaise and a cone of  wonderful steak fries, cooked three times so that the exterior shatters under the teeth and the middle tastes of mash. An appetizer of skate and potato terrine is also weirdly light, with a garlicky aioli that can lead a person gently into Ms. Bloomfield’s worldview. For milder entrees, there is a baby chicken, full of bright flavor alongside sweet roasted pumpkin and mint. But avoid the beef shin with polenta and black cabbage at all costs. It’s muddy in flavor, terribly dry. The Breslin provides room service for the Ace Hotel. It is certainly pleasant to lie in one of the beds there, upstairs from the restaurant and nestled into a warm Pendleton blanket, looking out the window at the faux-Parisian top of Gilsey House across the street. To do so amid the detritus of a Breslin meal — that onion soup, for example, followed by a rich beef burger and fries, along with a can of Porkslap ale — is bliss. It’s faster to sleep that way, for one thing, and since there’s no pig’s foot on the room-service menu, there actually will be sleep. The Breslin is great for burgers and beer. In the morning, back in the dining room, there is steel-cut oatmeal with brown sugar and cream. The Sex Pistols are on the stereo, softly. For a moment, all is right with the world.

323,Casa Lever,2 star,"Jan. 5, 2010",Sam Sifton,Midtown East,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/06/dining/reviews/06rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/06/dining/reviews/06rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"HERE now is a new Italian restaurant of the Manhattan old school, built for socialites and those who finance them, staffed by handsome, rakish men with huge wristwatches. It’s the sort of place where in the movie, based on a novel as yet unwritten by Dana Vachon, you might cast Anne Hathaway as the lead and Diane Keaton as her mom. You’re welcome, too. For all this, Casa Lever is a deeply likable restaurant. It’s very New York. The setting is International, on the ground floor of Lever House, on Park Avenue in that gulch of skyscrapers north of Grand Central Terminal. Lever House was designed by Gordon Bunshaft. It was among the first curtain-wall buildings in New York, a triumph of glass volume over concrete mass, pure balance over specious symmetry. It’s the sort of building that makes you stand up straight. In 2003, Lever House restaurant opened in the space, all cold certainty that the Four Seasons was coming to an end, that there was room for a new power restaurant in Midtown. That turned out not to be the case. Lever House the restaurant closed in spring 2009. Gherardo Guarducci and Dimitri Pauli, the dapper pair behind the Sant Ambroeus mini-chain, took over the room and opened Casa Lever in October with  a Milanese-ish menu from Mario Danieli, their hard-working chef. They’ve made the restaurant warmer. Lever House’s spaceship vibe has been highlighted with wood trim, chandeliers, little red tables up front, soft carpets beneath the feet. There is a trove of Warhol prints on the wall, silk-screened reminders of Studio 54. These belong to the building, which in turn belongs to the collector and real estate burgher Aby Rosen. Wine racks between the honeycomb booths along the room’s western side refract light into a feeling of conviviality. The art to the east puts even  arrivistes directly at the center of a particular kind of Manhattan scene. There is a lot of cashmere and silk at Casa Lever, plenty of crazy wealth. (That’s Mr. Rosen over there now!) But it’s still fun in Spence-Chapin thrift-shop merino, in a Housing Works frock. The service is appealing, comic-opera stuff. And the food, while basic, is often quite good. The spirit of Sant Ambroeus, a restaurant born in Milan in 1936 and mother to the society rooms in the Village, on the Upper East Side and Main Street in Southampton, has never been more serene. Vitello tonnato, the classic summery antipasto of chilled sliced veal served alongside what amounts to a deep cloud of tuna-infused mayonnaise, with a few fried capers strewn about for salty crunch, is here offered as advertised, no more. That is right for the room and its aesthetic: silky tuna sauce and thin folds of veal, just as the grandmothers made, unchanged by time or fashion. A carpaccio of beef with a small tangle of wild mushrooms and delicate Parmesan chips is likewise flavorful, likewise welcome, as are  thinly sliced artichokes with soft baby arugula swaddled in bracing lemon, with more of those cheese chips. Micro-greens, those biosphere wonders too easily overcome by dressing, here stand up to little croutons and welcome a soft-poached egg, if not crisped prosciutto in the role of bacon or pancetta. Is an appetizer of seared scallops with white asparagus and black truffle a good use of $18? That’s a question to wrestle, and there’s no correct answer. It’s the culinary equivalent of wondering whether Ferragamo shoes are worth the scratch. If they are to you, they are. The scallops are certainly well cooked. In another direction there are the now-requisite raw-bar offerings of crudi. Of these, there is a shockingly flavorful mackerel plate, with lemon confit, slightly pickled red onion and smoked salt, the combination of which so heightens the flavor of the fish as to amaze. A simple dish of yellowtail tuna, pomegranate seeds and lime might be better consumed on a boat somewhere, with the fish still half butchered on the stern, but even still: it’s not unfresh. And there is a delicious and deeply attractive plate of king crab, sea urchin, pickled jalapeño and avocado. As young Mr. Ripley and  Dickie Greenleaf discovered in San Remo, it can be tough to share. Pastas are generally simple, with a few change-ups thrown into the mix, probably for market flair. These, along with a muddy stuffed chicken, are the missteps on the menu. Amatriciana, for instance, is another classic of Italian cuisine, a sauce traditionally made of guanciale, or jowl bacon, with pecorino and tomato. Here it’s rendered with tuna, and served with a fat sort of rigatoni from Gragnano. It’s interesting, not great. Paccheri served with a red snapper ragout, cherry tomatoes and baby artichokes is less interesting, and not good. But ravioli with sausage and burrata, draped in a fennel purée, is wonderful: creamy with a slight bite. There is a fine saffron risotto most notable for the pile of pulled veal that sits atop it, rich and salty, thick with fat. And spaghetti with little Manila clams and fresh tomatoes is a classic of the form. A sensible person might make a meal out of the above and avoid the high prices of Casa Lever’s meat and fish courses. These are meant to sate those who don’t look at menu prices. But there are splurges worth the price: veal Milanese, for instance, pounded wide and fried with a rare excellence. Also terrific lamb chops with polenta and dark, rustic mushrooms strewn alongside them. The restaurant’s bone-in New York strip is roughly the size of a hardcover Italian-English dictionary.  It’s cooked crusty and rich, as if for an audition at Peter Luger. It’s excellent. So too is the  Dover sole, with a Dijon sauce, vacationing from France and perfect alongside a glass of fragrant Ciallabianco, from Ronchi di Cialla in Friuli. Desserts are worthy of Sant Ambroeus: marvelous sorbetti and towering gianduja of hazelnut and chocolate; truffles of chocolate sorbet, with orange gelée; even  just a serving of cut fruit, designed for ladies who continue to lunch. None of the food at Casa Lever is particularly groundbreaking. It owes little to the recent trend toward Italian cooking of the sort found at Marea or Del Posto, all towering ambition and crazy imagination. That’s all right.

324,Purple Yam,1 star,"Dec. 29, 2009",Sam Sifton,Ditmas,"Asian, Philippine",https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/dining/reviews/30rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/30/dining/reviews/30rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ROMY DOROTAN, the chef and an owner of Purple Yam, stood at the bar of his restaurant, looking out at Cortelyou Road in the rain. It was just after Christmas, and there were still holiday songs playing on the stereo behind him. It was early afternoon and the place smelled of fresh flowers, vinegar and fried pork. He looked a bit like a ship’s captain: formidable, intimidating, kind. There was a long brick wall behind him reminiscent of the one that dominated his last restaurant, Cendrillon, in SoHo, for more than a decade. Mr. Dorotan and his wife, Amy Besa, closed it in March. They moved to Brooklyn, to Ditmas Park, a neighborhood of Victorian houses and discount stores, to start again. There was a family eating lunch at one of the booths in the back of the restaurant, across from its partly open kitchen, under a bead-board ceiling. Purple Yam serves lunch on weekends only. It makes the most of the opportunity. There was a spread on the table: eggs, garlic-fried rice and tocino, the sweetened cured pork known sometimes as Filipino bacon; thin rice noodles with chicken, pork and swirls of vegetable; Balinese fried chicken and a purée of taro and sweet potato as rich as softened butter. The kids were drinking mango juice. The adults were drinking chai lattes. Mr. Dorotan turned and regarded these people as an artist might a sketch. He went into the kitchen. A few moments later, he emerged with a small bowl of sambal, a kind of Malaysian ketchup, that he had cooked thick with coconut milk, brightened with lime. “This is for the chicken,” he said, and returned to his post by the window. The chicken had been served with two dipping sauces already: one sour and soylike, the other with the peppery kick of a traditional American hot sauce. These were excellent. The sambal number, however, provoked happy gibberish from those who ate it over the chicken, who spooned it into their mouths like fiery yogurt. Mr. Dorotan remained expressionless. He trimmed a few poinsettias at the bar, then returned to the kitchen. The dinner rush would be coming in less than six hours. He had work to do. Purple Yam is not precisely Filipino. Mr. Dorotan’s vision is too wide for such easy characterization. At Cendrillon, he used the Philippines as a point of reference for his cooking — Malay by nature, Chinese and Hispanic by curious nurture — and added European flavors to it. At Purple Yam, the menu has those old favorites but also looks widely across Asia for inspiration, most notably toward Korea, the cuisine of which provides both kimchi and  flavored sojus, a mean bibimbap and a spicy tofu soup. As at Cendrillon, the result is more than the sum of its parts. Purple Yam is a perfect neighborhood restaurant. True to its aesthetic, the menu is resistant to easy division into appetizers and main courses. There are kimchis and chutneys to order. There are vegetables and side dishes. There is pig — almost every part of it. And there are Cendrillon classics, ranging from a sublime chicken adobo to a faintly ridiculous wild-boar pizza. Ms. Besa can be found most evenings at the restaurant’s door, in front of the crowded dining room, making small talk with her guests and, when necessary, apologizing for the long  waits for a table or for food. There are date-night renters at the bar, kids from Ocean Avenue flats sharing an entree and a beer; local home-owning families eating out with neighbors; Filipinos who’ve driven in from other parts of bedroom Brooklyn; a few bewildered travelers off the Q train. The menu is studded with the sort of offerings that inspire craving. (Cravings are a key component to a successful neighborhood restaurant.) There is that chicken adobo, for instance. Adobo is a national dish of the Philippines, with probably as many recipes for it as there are islands in the archipelago. Some are soupy braises of chicken or pork in soy sauce and vinegar. Others are cooked down until almost dry. This is Purple Yam’s version: the chicken braised in rice vinegar, soy sauce, garlic and Thai chili pepper, and served in a vastly reduced pool of that liquid, now cut through and softened with coconut milk. Eat it with a bowl of fried rice anointed with bagoong, a kind of fermented shrimp paste, and it’s possible to  imagine it on the level of a neighborhood staple, up there with pizza or rotisserie chicken. Other necessities include those glassy rice noodles with chicken and pork, a plate of oxtails stewed in tomatoes and peanuts and another of deep-fried pork belly with pickled papaya. There ought to be sisig on your table as well, the restaurant’s fantastic, crisp meat salad: chopped pig snout, ears and jowls, crisp and fatty at once, in a slightly fiery lime dressing. (Go on: try it.) You’ll want some kimchi. Maybe a salad of jicama and green papaya, too. In a depressing nod to market trends, there are “sliders” on the menu, Korean-style meatballs in small buns flavored with purple yams. (These aren’t necessary. Nor are the restaurant’s Chinese-style ribs.) There is slow-cooked duck leg, almost a confit, wrapped in banana leaves. And there are marvelous desserts: rice pudding flavored with coffee and chocolate; flan rich with the nutty flavor of pandan. Best of all, there is halo halo, the Philippines’ answer to an ice cream sundae: a parfait glass of sweet beans, palm seeds, all manner of coconut products and  jackfruit, topped with flan and purple yam ice cream. The combination is hilarious, like an umbrella drink gone mad, and extremely delicious. Years ago, well before Cendrillon, Mr. Dorotan lived in Key West. There is something of that place in his restaurant, even now. Key West is where the American experiment sees its glorious proof: the poor living amid the wealthy; the gay amid the straight; the eccentric amid the strait-laced. Democrats eat side by side with Republicans in the Conch Republic, Latinos by whites by blacks by Asians. All humans swoon in the presence of a glorious sunset. (And a lot of alcohol.) At Purple Yam, a similar effect is achieved with adobo and halo halo. That is something worth experiencing, even if you’re not moving in down the block.

325,La Grenouille,3 star,"Dec. 22, 2009",Sam Sifton,Midtown East,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/dining/reviews/23rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/23/dining/reviews/23rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"LA GRENOUILLE turned 47 on Saturday, the last great French restaurant in New York. As on its birth night, there was snow outside the old stable at 3 East 52nd Street, and this made the soft, glittering light of the brocaded interior seem all the more inviting, the flowers towering out of the corners all the more welcoming, the sheer elegance of the place all the more arresting, important, rare. The decline of great French cooking in New York has been a subject of discussion among the food-obsessed for decades, since at least the closing of Le Pavillon in 1971. In the last decade the talk has turned funereal, with the demise of Lutèce, La Caravelle, La Côte Basque, Lespinasse. Brasserie cooking survives in New York, even flourishes under old mirrors and subway tile. We will always have steak frites. But the quiet opulence of the traditional haute cuisine that was first brought to New York by Henri Soulé for the World’s Fair in 1939 and which flourished at his Pavillon and other restaurants in the years that followed? The whole marvelous Tom Wolfe scene of it: blanquette de veau and Beaumes-de-Venise, and ladies in finery beside gentlemen in soft cashmere jackets and rolled silk ties? C’est fini! A series of recent meals at La Grenouille suggests that isn’t so. Not so long as Charles Masson, who has run it since 1975, greets his customers at the door, quiet and French and welcoming. Not so long as people can take a seat on a scarlet banquette at his restaurant, sit beneath a  spray of flowers and eat sumptuous food out of Escoffier. It has been this way since his father, also named Charles, opened the restaurant in 1962 with his wife, Gisèle. The crowd is amazing. There are city patricians, upscale travelers, romantics celebrating anniversaries, cads with escort-service friends, priests drinking Burgundy and spooning soup past their dog collars. There is jewelry everywhere, evidence of plastic surgery. There are Thackeray characters come to life in a modern age. Some have spent too much time in the sun, doing nothing much more than turning the pages of a book. Others, eyes darting back and forth, examine the restaurant and chart customers as handicappers do horses at Belmont: Are the flowers less resplendent than in years past? Perhaps, ever so slightly, yes. Is the carpet threadbare? Not in the least, though those waiters may qualify! Is that a daughter or lover in the corner with that old lion? Oh, please. Have the Montrachet to start? Back in the kitchen, the executive chef, Matthew Tropeano, spoons forcemeat pike into simmering broth. He naps the result with sauce and gives the plates to waiters who have known no other service. They present their customers a paragon of quenelles de brochet in the Lyonnaise style, a textbook example of classic French cuisine. The dish is executed perfectly, a kind of beige-on-beige masterpiece devoid of irony or deconstructionist camp. (Only those without heart would call it gefilte fish.) It is delicious without being overwhelming, without being much more than ethereal pike, light as mist, buttery rice, a shellfish cream sauce with just a hint of nutmeg, a dab of American caviar. It is wonderful to eat at La Grenouille. The revelations start early. A waiter brings an amuse-bouche, perhaps more perfunctorily than is currently normal in most New York restaurants. He neither issues a greeting nor attempts to make the action dramatic. “This is a split pea soup,” he says. The offering is roughly four spoonfuls’ worth. Each is a cloud of magnificent flavor  — salt that raises the vegetal from its depths, cream that makes it buoyant. It lingers on the tongue. The tiny dish expands the mind. It also concentrates its focus. For there will be no lemon grass foam to confuse matters on the menu of La Grenouille this evening, no huckleberry confit or magret sliders. This is a classic French restaurant (with classically high prices; a three-course prix fixe dinner starts at $95). Its strength is still, as Bryan Miller wrote in The New York Times almost 20 years ago, the excellence of its stocks, the basis of its magnificent sauces. Begin your meal with sweetbreads, then. They are the thymus gland of a calf, two lobes separated by a soft tube of flesh. (Someone always asks!) Here they are trimmed in the manner of miniature chicken breasts, then sautéed until crisp, leaving a creamy interior. Accompanied by a small bit of demi-glace made piney with rosemary, they provide an instant view of a world in which plenty is not nearly so important as quality  —  a world in which the point is to experience small, rich pleasures, one by one by one. In that line, there is also foie gras, of course, fattened duck liver seared beautifully and served with port, melting velvet in the mouth. There is a magnificent country terrine, studded with pistachios and served blessedly at the temperature of the room, so that it spreads easily and caresses the tongue. On a brisk winter evening, you might begin with risotto, now served with buttery wild mushrooms, each grain separate and pliant and rich. A slightly rakish salmon tartare arrives piled on a large and perfect blini with more of that American caviar on top to heighten the experience. (Ravioli with lobster and tarragon achieves a similar effect, plus cream.) And a simple endive salad highlights the bitter sweetness of the green, then sweetens it with slick pear, chalky walnut, the rough, salty excellence of Roquefort cheese. For main dishes, there are those quenelles. Also frogs’ legs sautéed in butter with parsley and garlic, a nod to the restaurant’s name (in France, une grenouille is a frog). The legs are delicate, flavorful, addictive and impossible even in this luxe setting to finish with knife and fork. (The waiter will bring you a finger bowl when you are done.)  There is an excellent plate of veal kidneys, sautéed in a flash of Cognac until just browned around the exterior, served with a thick, piquant mustard sauce. There is another of sirloin, crimson beef dominoes on a plate, with creamy pommes boulangère. There are beef oxtails of uncommon excellence, braised until sticky in red wine, a dish the late Pat Buckley once said she would choose as her last on Earth. And for those experiencing the restaurant for the first time, or returning to it for the first time in ages, there is Dover sole. Named for the English port in which it was first popularized, Dover sole is slightly less bathmat-shaped than its relative the flounder. It is prized by diners for close-grained sweet flavor, and by restaurants for ease of filleting, which is why it’s so often done tableside. Here, grilled and then sauced with butter, and served with soft, golden mustard sauce, it achieves a kind of transfiguration: France brought to Midtown, a vacation in a bite. It’ll change the color of your mood ring. Let us stay happy through the end of this meal. Wise diners will, as they order the sole, also ask for the preparation of a soufflé for dessert, perhaps the one scented with Grand Marnier. (The unwise will ask for tarte Tatin and receive a wan example in return.) During the winter of 1997, when La Grenouille was just 35, Ruth Reichl wrote in the restaurant’s most recent review in these pages that it was not for nothing that a parade of soufflés crosses the dining room each evening. “I don’t think there is a better soufflé in New York,” she wrote, and awarded three stars. That is still the case. It is a magic-trick dessert, a dreamlike concoction from the night kitchen: perfection unsullied. And it stands, in its way, for the importance of La Grenouille. This is the bastion now. It is worth the expense to put on your best and experience it. It is part of why you are here.

326,Madangsui,1 star,"Dec. 8, 2009",Sam Sifton,Koreatown,Korean,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/dining/reviews/09rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/09/dining/reviews/09rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THERE is a moment at the beginning of most meals at Madangsui, Manhattan’s best Korean barbecue restaurant, when someone at the table begins to laugh. A small army of workers has been filling the table with small plates of banchan, the side dishes central to Korean restaurant cuisine, for what appears to be a minute straight. They add to this bounty bubbling iron bowls of bean paste casserole and steamed eggs, and bring vast piles of bright green lettuce and slaw, small bowls of sesame oil and salt, soybean paste and  the fiery hot sauce known as kochujang. They offer savory oyster pancakes, kimchi pancakes, steaming piles of cellophane noodles, bottles of beer, glasses of tea and kettles of soju, a kind of low-alcohol Korean vodka. The table fills and fills and fills, and at a certain point it begins to be ridiculous — there’s no visible table anymore! — and someone starts to giggle at the crazy excess, the sheer weight of the experience. Korea was poor for much of the last century. It spent almost 40 years as a colony under the boot of Japan. It was physically divided in the aftermath of World War II and suffered mightily in the war that followed.   None of this was much good for the feeding of its citizenry. It should be no surprise that when prosperity finally came to the peninsula in the 1970s (came to South Korea at least), so too came a groaning board. As Americans well know, nothing says economic security like the inevitability of leftovers. Madangsui is not much to look at, really, just a long fluorescent-illuminated room with chocolate accents, almost barnlike, with exhaust hoods over the tables and a carpet down the center, leading to the tea station, the bathrooms and the kitchen. The clientele runs to groups of celebratory young Koreans texting as they eat, office parties and passers-by from local hotels; it is hardly a clear picture of fine dining in New York. But jiminy crickets, is the dining fine. There is kimchi among the banchan, of course: Napa cabbage fermented with chili peppers and salt, Korea’s national dish. There is also a zucchini version, a bok choy one, a wonderful bouquet of tiny pickled scallion shoots. There are cold boiled bean sprouts fragrant with sesame oil, and salty tangles of wakame dressed with sweet vinegar, soft on the tongue, a kiss in a rock club, right after the show. There is boiled eggplant; dried shredded squid fried with hot chili sauce; occasionally there is a strange cold cabbage dish with bits of hot dog in it, or a crab split in two. A fellow could pick at these with his chopsticks for an hour and be pleased with the time spent. There is raw beef as well, in a dish called yook hwe, slightly frozen and run through a grinder, then seasoned with sesame oil and raw egg: it’s a beef tartare, essentially, that literally melts in the mouth. The real purpose of the restaurant, though, is barbecue, to grill your own food right there at the table, on the gas grill built into its center, still covered in banchan, not yet lighted. That is why you are here. And you will get to it in due course: to fiery marinated pork and sweet, tender beef wrapped in lettuce and eaten as candy or tacos. But first, a warning: responsibility for the pace of a meal at Madangsui belongs to the diner alone. Service at the restaurant is brisk, almost brutally efficient. Order some appetizers to be sure. There is a long list on the menu, including steamed edamame, fried tofu and the Korean dumplings known as mandoo. Ignore these. Ask instead for some of those pancakes and for the restaurant’s silky, mushroom-studded jap chae, cellophane noodles stir-fried with soy sauce, vegetables and a few strips of beef. These, paired with that salty, voluptuous oyster pancake, are the correct introduction to the restaurant’s big, addictive flavors; they help to align the brain. Order, too, a bowl of kimchi soup, bubbling and restorative in its heat; alternatively, you might try the mool naeng myun, a pile of thin buckwheat noodles in an icy, bracing broth. But make sure not to ask for your barbecue, not yet. Diners who order soups and appetizers at the same time as main dishes at Madangsui will receive, far more often than not, the main dishes in advance of the appetizers. This throws a wrench into the works. Be firm on this point and be happy. Praemonitus praemunitus is what they say in Latin class: forewarned is forearmed. The barbecue is excellent: fresh, glistening butterflied short rib, thin-sliced ribeye, brisket, tongue. There is pork belly and there are giant mushrooms; there are jumbo shrimp. Some meats are served plain, for dressing afterward in a sheet of sesame oil run through with salt and pepper, with a dash of bean paste. Others are served in marinades, in either a soy-based, fruit-thickened number that is almost reminiscent of teriyaki or a garlicky take on kochujang that tingles in the mouth, leads to sweat and more laughter. It is particularly good on pork. Best, perhaps, is the plain butterflied short rib known as saeng galbi. The waitress redistributes the wealth on the table in such a way as to clear the stainless steel top for the grill. A runner then removes the top, and lights the gas hob below. This service tic is left over from the days when the grills were most often powered by glowing charcoal, brought in buckets from the kitchen by men with thick leather gloves. (There are still Korean restaurants in Manhattan that use live fire, most notably Kom Tang Soot Bul on West 32nd Street, which is a fine place to eat but does not match Madangsui for quality.) The waitress then uses tongs to place the meat on the grill top  — a kind of modified broiler pan  — and leaves it to bubble and spit. She will soon return to cut it with sharp scissors, and to turn it just so. Traditionally, waiters are responsible for the grilling in Korean restaurants. At Madangsui this can mean an almost manic attention to the progress of each piece of protein, a lot of prodding with the tongs. If you like a little more char on that bulgogi of yours, announce that you’ll cook it yourself. No eyebrow stays raised in the presence of grilling self-confidence. Now use your chopsticks to drag a piece of cooked meat through the mixture of sesame oil, salt and pepper. Place it on a piece of fresh romaine cupped in your opposite hand in the manner of a tortilla. Add to this some banchan, some slaw, perhaps a dot or two of bean paste or kochujang. Wrap and eat: heaven in Midtown, with cold beer besides. Dessert’s an orange cut into eighths. It tastes of magic and happiness.

327,Oceana,2 star,"Nov. 17, 2009",Sam Sifton,Times Square Theatre District,Seafood,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/18/dining/reviews/18rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/18/dining/reviews/18rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IT was almost the last lunch service at the old Oceana, on East 54th Street, in  mid-July, a quiet affair. For some there were oysters to start, for others an icy midday martini. One man had scallops, simply sautéed. For dessert: plain fruit. The room was full but hushed, the tables occupied by the sort of people who are particular about their food, who have bespoke shoes, who have worn white flannel trousers and walked upon the beach. It was an excellent lunch served by a restaurant that rewarded attendance with the privilege of real smiles and attention. Two friends in good suits sat as if aboard a ship making its way into New York Harbor, sad that the passage was ending, happy at its course. More recent meals in the new Oceana, which opened around the corner from Del Frisco’s in the McGraw-Hill building in August, reveal a different scene: a retort to all those who thought the old Oceana was cramped and outdated, a little too much actually like a steamship. It is now a massive restaurant, open and white and blue and tiled, with enormous lamp fixtures that throw light into every crevice of the room,   with giant flowers to soften that and beneath them deep leather booths with velvet backs and walnut trim. There is everywhere space and chatter, even a glassed-in private room placed between the bar and the dining room, where deal merchants can eat in teams. Oceana’s is the sort of dining room that dwarfs couples and double dates. It is more hotel than private club. Those who order carefully can partake of fabulous meals. They will certainly drink good wine, off a whites-heavy list that is ably negotiated by both waiters and sommeliers alike. But if the Oceana of old was a pleasant, shipshape room with elegant food and a caring touch, the new version is a high-functioning luxury mill, designed to service pre-theater crowds and to celebrate corporate success on expense-account dimes. It is in some ways a very good restaurant. But the room ensures that it is not entirely a pleasant one. The oysters are still perfect, however: fat boys from Widow’s Hole, out on Long Island’s North Fork, tasting of Peconic Bay’s briny tang, like a swim off a Shelter Island beach; and more from Glidden  Point in Maine, slippery as rock weed,  bright with the taste of raw ocean. So are the clams, doe-eyed on ice, and the shrimp and the periwinkles and the stone-crab claws that come arrayed across the raw-bar platters with them. It is a must to begin a meal with a few of these. Appetizers run in swifter currents. A fluke tartare with mangoes, cashews and young coconut makes for pleasant eating. It is almost a riff on the seafood cocktails that Bobby Flay offers at his Bar Americain a few blocks north. But Manhattan clam chowder with a hint of linguiça sausage and too much thyme is thin and almost metallic. A snapper ceviche, with roasted corn, hearts of palm and cilantro, is the sort of meal served on decks in Costa Rica to people sun-kissed and salty at the end of the day: nice. A smoked tuna roll is even nicer. But limp and flavorless fried calamari with an excellent house-made tartar sauce leaves a depressing aftertaste, a bad date in SoHo in 1992, when fried calamari mattered. Garganelli pasta with smoked shrimp, cranberry beans and pancetta is a revelation of flavor, a scalene triangle of smoke, salt and sweet. But a squid stuffed with   seafood sausage falls flat, bouncing slightly. All this yawing about is enough to leave a fellow slightly seasick. It is perhaps better to start with the raw bar and move directly into a main course. Oceana’s entrees have been divided into categories of preparation: composed, whole fish, simply prepared, sauces, meat, sides. For those who eschew fish but have somehow ended up at a restaurant devoted to their preparation, there is available a standard bone-in strip loin that ought to come with a cigar and a tee time. Also a tender and remarkably delicious roast chicken. Both would go well with an order of French fries, better still with the apple risotto or a wad of soft and fragrant wild mushrooms. Halibut saltimbocca is one of the composed numbers, a big fist of fish wrapped with a tight belt of prosciutto, with a tomato confit and a perfect blob of ricotta on the side. It certainly looks delightful, a dish of the sort that shows up on episodes of “Iron Chef” and gets the chairman excited. But its taste  leads to fast-cut reaction shots, judges raising their eyebrows, Cat Cora looking bummed. Smart money will aim toward the simply prepared and the whole. There is much to delight in these. Ben Pollinger, who has been Oceana’s chef since the old days of 2006, runs a crack operation. (Last year, the restaurant received three stars from Frank Bruni in The New York Times.) His grilled opah, for instance, a Hawaiian fish that is not generally a player in Manhattan, proves a lovely dinner companion, fresh, clean, fat in the best sense. A towering order of king crab legs is perfectly cooked and addictive; it would be easy, if there were money enough and time, to eat this dish weekly for a year. Crisp striped bass is beautiful if slightly overcooked, resplendent with a wash of romesco sauce. Halibut poached in olive oil? Simple trumps saltimbocca. Advantage: poaching. Among the whole fish, the most intriguing is the fried curried pink snapper, served on its belly, fried into a swimmer’s pose. When this thing shows up at the table, it is a guaranteed ooh-ahh moment. The fish is caught mid-thrash, and served with lotus coins and bits of cucumber, with cilantro strewn across its body as if it were seaweed. At BLT Fish, or for that matter at a greasy table on Mott Street, the waiters would luxuriate in the customers’ reaction and then take the fish apart with two spoons as simply as if they were folding a shirt or washing a dish. Oceana, however, appears to run more toward the u-pick-pumpkin school of fish service. “Have at it,” the waiter said, extremely pleasantly, and retreated from the scene. (The fish, eventually dismantled, was fantastic in its curried skin, superb with a side dish of spicy Napa cabbage with a lime-cut chili glaze.) Jansen Chan, the restaurant’s pastry chef, is hardly a restrained presence in Oceana’s new locale. His apple confit mochi cake, with coconut tapioca pearls and a horchata sorbet, is a delight of flavors, exactly what’s called for after a king-crab feast. His platter of doughnuts, too, in five preparations, can slay. Those Homers in the private dining room rip the things to pieces, then head out to the bar, tugging phones off their belts, calling for cars. This is a kind of excellence, anyway.

328,Aureole,1 star,"Nov. 10, 2009",Sam Sifton,Times Square Theatre District,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/dining/reviews/11rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/11/dining/reviews/11rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"CHARLIE PALMER opened a huge new restaurant in Manhattan this year, Aureole, a big, sprawling series of rooms on the ground floor of the Bank of America building on 42nd Street. He has around a dozen more, in Las Vegas, Reno and California’s wine country, among others, as well as a hotel, a catering outfit and a shop in Sonoma County that sells the sort of candles and bowls that you see in the homes of people who spend a lot of time shuttling among New York, Sonoma and Las Vegas. Mr. Palmer is a big-business restaurateur, a best seller, the Dean Koontz of the sauté and oven set. It wasn’t always so. In 1988, he was just a brash young chef who had cooked at the River Café, who struck out on his own to open a creamy, luxurious town house restaurant, Aureole, on the Upper East Side. The food was American, audacious, often excellent and expensive despite a sour economy. It was New York to its core. Bryan Miller, writing in The New York Times, awarded the place two stars in 1989, and three in 1991. (Eight years later, William Grimes took it back to two.  Some of us, without stars to give, covered it for free newspapers available in banks and bars and Laundromats.) Mr. Palmer wasn’t big business then. He was just talented and possibly brave. Times change. In 2007, Mr. Palmer announced plans to move the restaurant south, into bigger digs.  The result is a Las Vegas event restaurant airlifted into Manhattan, a corporate cafeteria with a soundtrack of smooth jazz in the George Benson style. The food can be quite good. It can also be the opposite. Aureole, as the New York expression goes, is meh. The notion may have been to cater to the corporate titans of Bank of America, as well as to the fashionable shoes from Condé Nast,  whose headquarters are next door. There is a formal dining room for their kind in the restaurant’s rear, placed behind glass walls as if at the zoo, with a big wine list and busboys standing ramrod straight in the corners. It is the most pleasant part of the restaurant, the sort of room where you might go to celebrate the imminent consummation of a deal or the arrival in New York of a client from far away, where such a dining room might count as both exotic and familiar. In that room, in the restaurant’s early days, you could find a terrific hunk of Alaskan halibut served with baby carrots, fresh garbanzo beans, preserved lemon and a saffron-hued mussel sauce. There was also a rich and quintessentially Palmer pairing of lobster tail and pork belly, the two fatties squaring off over summer squash and chanterelles, with gooseberries set against the fragrance of almonds and wine. An appetizer of pan-roasted shrimp with cauliflower, segments of blood orange, pickled ramps and curry butter arrived on the table extremely sweet and clean, with a mild bite from the curry. A main course of Colorado lamb loin with Tuscan kale, black garlic, lima and cranberry beans, with cherry tomato confit, was terrifically flavorful, straightforward and clean. It is nice in that dining room, quiet, and if your order goes well with the kitchen, you can have a good meal. If it doesn’t, you’ll be staring down a listless Wiener schnitzel, pale and greasy beneath a thick lemon-caper sauce, with too-tart applesauce. Or at dry veal tenderloin  with charred onions, sweetbreads cooked as if to explain why some don’t like them, sweet peaches, pickled ramps and a veal sauce run through with lovage: a meat dessert. One meal ended with a cheesecake made with blue cheese that tasted exactly like what you’d get if you mistakenly made a cheesecake with blue cheese. Your mileage may vary. Times are hard for Bank of America, of course, as for Condé Nast and for many of us besides. Is a fixed-price dice roll in Aureole’s formal dining room worth $84? We shall see. In the meantime, the bulk of the business is out in the bar, which takes up much  of the restaurant’s space. It’s loud out there, informal in the corporate sense of the word: men with their jackets off, their striped shirts shiny, their watches big, all of them eating burgers, sliders, fries, draining beer, smiling at clients, on the sell. It’s a tough scene. At every table someone’s either shouting or lap dancing his phone. It’s an extremely good hamburger, though, a big two-hander of rich beef, white Cheddar, applewood-smoked bacon and a pickled-ramp dressing that gives plain mayonnaise a run for its money. With it you’ll want some of the restaurant’s spectacular battered onion rings as well as an order of the papas fritas: a cone of excellent French fries beneath a shower of shredded aged Manchego, some chorizo bits and a saffron aioli that could use more garlic than those fellows eating it would ever abide. There are also fantastic little pastrami pork-belly sliders with raclette, coleslaw and Russian dressing (they’re even on the formal dining room menu at lunch now), three two-bite wonders that are smoky and wonderful, a funny little riff on a deli favorite. And of course Mr. Palmer’s signature appetizer, the sea scallop “sandwich,” which Christopher Lee, Mr. Palmer’s executive chef for the restaurant, who cooked at the old Oceana and received accolades for his command of Gilt, has updated with a napping of sugar snap peas, passion fruit and chives. There is much to enjoy about eating hamburgers on the company dime, of course, or in eating swordfish with creamed spinach, barley and Muscat grapes, especially if you’re drinking a delightful Oregon pinot noir from Domaine Serene along with it, and talking with friends. But note well those grapes, and the passion fruit above. Sweetness is all over these menus. There is apple with the crab cake appetizer (and a fine horseradish dressing as well); a great deal of honey in the mustard that accompanies a deconstructed beef tartare. Fluke sashimi arrives above a tight rectangle of diced edamame, with a yuzu eggplant purée and a shallot ginger dressing that is only slightly tempered by soy. There is caramel popcorn and a funnel cake to accompany the seared foie gras. All of this adds up, in more ways than one, even before you get to dessert. (Yes to the caramel panna cotta and milk chocolate pudding pie.) Everything on the table fits into a diagram of sweet, sour, less sweet, unspicy, plain. The restaurant is a love letter to an America we see reflected back at us in unflattering light:  relatively happy, unthinking, desirous mostly of sugar and fat. That’s Vegas for you. It’s not New York. * 1 Bryant Park, 135 West 42nd Street, (212) 319-1660, charliepalmer.com/Properties/Aureole/ ATMOSPHERE People who sell in the bar, people who own in the dining room.

329,Le Relais de Venise L’Entrecôte,1 star,"Nov. 3, 2009",Sam Sifton,Midtown East,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/dining/reviews/04rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/04/dining/reviews/04rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"LE RELAIS DE VENISE L’ENTRECÔTE is a mouthful of a restaurant that opened a few months ago in a canyon at Lexington Avenue and 52nd Street, convenient mostly to hotel guests and hamsters on the Midtown professional wheel. It has no real menu to speak of. There is only salad and steak frites. Some wine to drink and a dessert after. Women in French maid outfits serve the stuff as if they were characters in an early Preston Sturges film. And you know what? It’s terrific. The model is an old one, although new to New York. There are L’Entrecôtes in Paris and London, in Bahrain and Barcelona. The first was established in Paris, in 1959, in what had been a Venetian-themed restaurant called, naturally, Le Relais de Venise. The founder was a winemaker, Paul Gineste de Saurs, who thought having a restaurant might help build a market for the grapes his family had been growing for centuries. Le Relais de Venise did not flourish on the strength of its wine list, however. Lacking restaurant experience, M. Gineste de Saurs had limited ambition. He thought only to offer a salad to start, and then a grilled cut of sirloin the French call entrecôte (and which we call strip steak), with a rich, buttery sauce and a copious amount of fries. He took no reservations; you simply showed up and were seated. Those decisions turned out brilliantly. They were an assault on the tyranny of choice. The restaurant was instantly called by its meat name, not its geographical one: L’Entrecôte. Lines formed and have been there ever since, even as the family has broken into parts, and opened slightly different franchise versions of the restaurant all over the world. There is no queue yet at the New York outpost of L’Entrecôte, though like the others it takes no reservations. The room is too large, perhaps, for the neighborhood’s large transient market. But business has been growing. The plural of anecdote is not data, but visits over the past eight weeks have seen a more crowded dining room each time. “It’s getting better,” a waitress said one recent night. “It’s building.” That is grand. Customers enter the room, a brightly colored rectangle, near Lexington and 52nd, and it spreads south and west before them. Not very good paintings of Venetian scenes adorn the walls in that peculiar French manner that combines bad taste with deep sophistication. Banquettes line the place, with pockets of bistro tables set tightly between them, everything slightly smaller than it would be in a restaurant owned by Americans. A matron seats you, and before you know it, a waitress is there to tell you what’s what. “What temperature would you like your steak?” she asks, with the friendly, slightly bored cadence of a diner waitress or school nurse. (There are no men in L’Entrecôte’s universe, at least in the dining room.) You could be out of the place in 20 minutes if you like. Resist the alacrity with which this woman attends you. Diners may not have much choice in the matter of what they eat, but they can throw a brake on the speed with which they get it. So have a cocktail to start, insisting that you will order food only when you’ve had it. (Ordering food as you order a drink mostly leads to the salad arriving before the martini. This is a distressing state of affairs and should be avoided.) The glasses are proper-sized, which is to say they are not those giant tureens you find throughout the meatpacking district, and thus they encourage rather than inhibit good eating. You might also have wine. You should with the steak, anyway, which will be here soon enough. As it has been since the start, Château de Saurs is the bottle of choice, a cheap Bordeaux that the fancies might call plonk but which drinks well with the meal. Speaking of which, here again is the waitress, now bearing salads. (See? There’s no build of anticipation to this place at all. Order a drink and: Dinner is on!) It is a pile the size of a softball, mixed green and red lettuces draped in a mustardy vinaigrette that in early days here was nearly as thick as a mayonnaise. Lately it has thinned out into something closer to silk. Walnuts are strewn across the top, rich and oily. It all goes fast, leaving smiles. Your steak comes in two stages, on a relatively small plate: you eat your portion of meat, sauce and fries and then are served seconds. The beef is fine, sliced thin across the grain and as tender as cheap meat gets, a perfect midweek dinner with a friend. The fries rate higher on the crazy-good scale: salty and crisp, with tender interiors that aren’t mushy even when soaked in the sauce. On the subject of that sauce, much has been written. Little is known. To its credit, the restaurant keeps the ingredients secret. It is perhaps a variant on the gravy poured out at Café de Paris in Geneva since the 1940s: butter, basically, infused with herbs and mustard and cream, with a metallic tang of chicken liver running right through its middle. Whatever it is at L’Entrecôte, you could pour the stuff over a boot and still have an excellent dinner. Would you like some more? Those seconds are kept warm on racks that sit above votive candles, at service stations set throughout the dining room. The image that this presents, of women in uniform standing over dark wood and marble, moving platters of rosy steak and golden fries around over twinkling lights, is beautiful and slightly moving. It recalls a Manet painting. It’s the bar of the Folies-Bergère, minus the décolletage. Viewed  another way, it is Schrafft’s seen through a Parisian glass, a chaste Playboy cartoon. L’Entrecôte, though new to Manhattan, has a slightly nostalgic air. In part that’s because of the costumes, and the room. But it is also the food, which recalls an era of silver plate and good manners, the simplicity of salad, steak and fries, heavy on the salt and butter, rich as a cardiologist. (Pass on dessert, fridge-cold.) You can find better meat elsewhere, of course, but such satisfaction as you’ll find in a meal here is rarer by far.

330,Marea,3 star,"Oct. 20, 2009",Sam Sifton,Midtown,"Italian, Seafood",https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/dining/reviews/21rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/21/dining/reviews/21rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THIS recession’s over. At least that’s the message the knights in white broadcloth are sending out at Marea, the elegant Italianate restaurant Chris Cannon and Michael White opened this spring in the space on Central Park South that used to be San Domenico. Cue the prosecco. Take a look at that Dover sole! Here is Sumner Redstone scowling at shadows. There is Henry Kravis sitting like Dorian Gray. Everyone between them looks low-slung and comfortable in butter-soft chairs, 125 of them, with the M104 bus swinging by the plate-glass windows up front, street lights shifting into red against the distant darkness of Central Park. It is all very pleasant and warm: rosewood on the walls; silver-dipped conches and nautiluses on the window sills. That bar back is honey onyx. Restaurants are culture as sure as music or paintings. They say something about who we are. So never mind the bold-faced names, those old familiar faces. Civilized people on the subway home from the Met talk about opera, not who has seats in the parterre box. Marea says, settle down. When the market was low, we spent like crazies and now look wise. You like to eat? Watch what is going to happen to you. The very first item on the menu at Marea is ricci, a piece of warm toast slathered with sea urchin roe, blanketed in a thin sheet of lardo, and dotted with sea salt. It offers exactly the sensation as kissing an extremely attractive person for the first time  — a bolt of surprise and pleasure combined. The salt and fat give way to primal sweetness and combine in deeply  agreeable ways. The feeling lingers on the tongue and vibrates through the body. Not bad at $14 a throw  — and there are two on each plate. Mr. White arrived in New York in 2002 as the chef at Fiamma in SoHo, and showed himself to be an extraordinary practitioner of pasta. (At the unlovely Vento in the meatpacking district, he made a mean veal trotter.) Later, he teamed up with Mr. Cannon to make Alto a shrine to northern Italian food and L’Impero, now Convivio, a gallery for the best of that nation’s south. He cooks Italian food as if it were purely American: big and bold. While Marea is a seafood restaurant, it is not one that seeks to place a divide between that which swims and that which walks. It is perhaps more accurate to call it a restaurant inspired by seafood  — but by no means in thrall to it. Halibut arrives with a little more lardo mixed in with its retinue of Manila clams, sweet corn and spigarelli (like a mild broccoli rabe), and a chili oil that might as well be fresh-squeezed sopressata. Fusilli come with a sauce made of octopus braised in red wine  — and thickened by bone marrow. The marrow would be gild on a lily if it weren’t so flavorful, a more neutral demi-glace that is the perfect pairing for (who knew!) octopus. And the restaurant’s one beef offering, a sirloin from the terrific Creekstone Farms outfit, dry-aged 50 days, grilled rare and served with more of that marrow cut into a bread salad, would do epic battle with the beef at any steakhouse in town. But we get ahead of ourselves. The menu at Marea is divided into sections; diners may order a four-course meal for $89, plus perhaps a few add-ons for the table. That ricci, for instance, or a zeppole made of seaweed, shrimp and chickpeas that ought to be what people get when they order zeppole at street fairs. There is as well a crudo menu  — and a crudo bar along the restaurant’s east side, with seats for 20. It is not part of the prix fixe, but a geoduck clam with fresh chilies and lemon helps explain in one bite why men would dive amid huge swells to retrieve the things from the angry Pacific. You might also visit with the tuna and creamy (though creamless) oyster crema, with crisp bits of artichoke, or a hunk of striped bass acting as pack animal for a load of sturgeon caviar, drizzled in mussel vinaigrette. Mr. White treats antipasti as character studies. Knuckles of lobster arrive commingled with torn hunks of burrata cheese, the creaminess of both (literal in the case of the cheese, figurative on the part of the lobster) melding into eggplant cooked down as if it were mushrooms, with a grassy hit of basil on top. Monkfish cheeks orbit a slow-poached egg with a loamy mushroom ragù. Worthwhile pastas, in addition to the fusilli,  include a  rich spaghetti with crab, sea urchin and basil. There is sweet cavatelli with red shrimp, controne-bean purée and rosemary, a loose cotechino sausage cut into  risotto, silky with melted cod belly. You may pass on the seppia and shrimp ragù, mysterious as it is; cuttlefish, also part of an unexciting grilled main course, are not up to the treatments Mr. White puts them through. The main courses  —secondi di pesce, the menu calls them  — are the restaurant’s weakness. After the brilliance of the appetizer course and the winning flavors of those pastas, it is difficult to maintain focus on an architectural marvel involving porcini-dusted sea scallops. Adriatic seafood soup is laden with what might be the entire window display at Citarella. Too much. Better to hit shore for the steak (or a crisp roast guinea hen with asparagus) or upgrade into the whole-fish treatments: a few simply grilled langoustines, for instance, paired with a salsa verde, or that Dover sole with lemon. You want a simple sentence after the complex ones. Wine? You ought to have lots. Mr. Cannon has, with Francesco Grosso, conceived a fascinating, lengthy list. It may run unfamiliar to nonobsessives: lots of bracing whites heavy on coastal terroir, light reds good with fish. If you follow the Mark Bittman principle, which argues that the best way to order wine is to give the sommelier a price point and a challenge to match the bottle to the table’s order, you ought to do well. Service at the restaurant is superb: helpful, friendly and apron-clad rather than black-tied and imperious. (Also knowing: I was  dining anonymously, but was  recognized at the door.) Heather Bertinetti is Marea’s pastry chef. She doesn’t fool around. Hers is a rich torrone gelato with black cocoa cake; she makes a mean crisp-polenta number with blackberry compote. Order the affogato, though, for maximum wow: a float of zabaglione gelato with small pours of espresso and amaro on top. This is iced coffee for the smart set, fantastic to eat and drink. Marea is an ambitious restaurant, more so than any Mr. Cannon and Mr. White have opened. It is also in many ways a casual one, unfussy, as welcoming as a luxe clubhouse. It is not cheap nor meant to be. Art in Manhattan can be like that. Life is balance. You  read the notices for “Bye Bye Birdie” on Broadway?

331,The Redhead,1 star,"Aug. 18, 2009",Frank Bruni,East Village,"American, Southern",https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/dining/reviews/19rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/19/dining/reviews/19rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IN the beginning, which was less than two years ago, Meg Grace cooked dinner on Thursday nights. That was all that she and her partners in the Redhead — which they had opened as a bar, with the goal of turning it into a restaurant — could manage or afford. It was a way of honing their skills and building a following in their East Village neighborhood while they upgraded the kitchen and refurbished  the modest space. For more than six months Ms. Grace was a kitchen staff of one, more or less. As she put together her once-a-week  prix-fixe menus, which presented season-conscious comfort food that bore the stamp of her years in New Orleans, she did the ordering, the prep work — all of that. On Thursdays she’d get a helper    to plate the food and clean up, though Ms. Grace did as much of the dishwashing herself. She painted, too, joining her partners, Rob Larcom and Gregg Nelson, in 3 a.m. renovations, after the last tipsy customers left. This was done with as much improvisation as everything else. The ceiling that they installed was Styrofoam, cheaper than tin or tiles. Many pieces of furniture were hand-me-downs: chairs from the Tribeca Grill, banquettes from Montrachet. Mr. Larcom was still working for Drew Nieporent, a principal owner of those restaurants, and Ms. Grace and Mr. Nelson had worked for Danny Meyer. Much of the Redhead’s dishware was bequeathed from one of his restaurants, Eleven Madison Park. The boards for the pizzalike flatbreads were made by students in a shop class at the New Hampshire high school where Mr. Larcom’s father was the principal. Dad himself helped make the tables. The owners’ relatives chipped in with flooring, with plumbing, with whatever needed doing. Slowly the Redhead came together, until it looked every bit a grown-up restaurant and was serving dinner six nights a week. It has been doing that for about a year now, to a packed house. The Redhead remains a largely humble endeavor, with many limitations and its share of flaws, including a wine list sparser than it need be and service that’s often chaotic. But it is nonetheless the most inspiring  kind of restaurant story, happy proof of that hoary adage about wills and ways. It wasn’t a readymade brand from another city, it wasn’t the latest outpost in a burgeoning empire, it didn’t have big-name investors and big-statement décor. It had bacon peanut brittle, buttermilk fried chicken, house-made soft pretzels and three scrappy proprietors unafraid to beg, borrow and toil round the clock to realize their ambition of a neighborhood place with  an idiosyncratic flair. It isn’t exactly like any other downtown restaurant I know — its semi-polished, Southern-inflected pub grub is all its own — but it sharply reflects a few of the most prominent and rewarding developments in Manhattan dining over the years during which I’ve had the privilege of serving as The Times’s restaurant critic. Now more than ever, diners  find principled, distinctive cooking in places   where they wouldn’t have expected it before: dessert trucks, baseball stadiums, postage-stamp storefronts, wine bars, taverns and cocktail lounges. In fact the Redhead was mostly a tavern and cocktail lounge during that span of Thursday-only dinners, which exemplified the possibility of terrific eating with untraditional trappings and captured the sense of gastronomic serendipity that defines this culinary moment. With its first-come-first-served seating policy  and its televisions showing sporting events behind the bar, the Redhead speaks to the moment’s casual ethos. And it underscores the extent to which the East Village has become a center of gravity for young chefs intent on bold flavors. They clearly feed off of one another, a loose network of validation and motivation. It’s here that Marco Canora, Gabrielle Hamilton and David Chang rose to prominence. It’s here that Anthony Mangieri catalyzed the artisanal-pizza movement and that Sara Jenkins found her groove. And it’s here that Ms. Grace, 36, has taken a leap forward in her career, which is clearly one to watch, because of her  ego-restrained way of preparing familiar, even lowbrow fare with such exacting standards and such sagely chosen grace notes that it takes on an unfamiliar luster. She does potato chips with onion dip, both components made at the Redhead for a result that’s revelatory. Instead of croutons her terrific “one-eyed Caesar salad” has a piece of toast with an egg in it, its eventual fracture providing ooze along with crunch. The fried chicken is never greasy, almost always tender and unfailingly accessorized by something perfect: biscuits or cornbread or, my favorite, an onion-goat cheese bread pudding that’s like a dreamy amalgam of stuffing and quiche. A roasted pork chop is juicy, and gets its  own glorious accessory in the form of a wild-rice-and-foie-gras boudin. The concise menu changes frequently, in deference to the Greenmarket, and at any given moment has several salads and a soup — recently, sweet corn. Among the entrees, which are generously composed plates, there’s careful balance: red meat, fish, a pasta. The pasta isn’t usually memorable. And the meat dishes are usually superior to the fish, except for the shrimp and grits. Shrimp, grits and andouille sausage — there’s some meat in there, too. The combination speeds you toward the Gulf and the bayous and, with its shouts of butter and murmurs of brandy,  is nearly as good as any similar dish you’d find in Louisiana. Ms. Grace also makes the desserts, which are of a piece with everything else. A while back they included haute HoHos, a creamy, chocolate-y regression to childhood. A current standout is the caramel banana pudding — with her version of Nilla Wafers. The presence of   strips of candied bacon with a chocolate and peanut butter sundae came across as a gross caricature of the East Village’s porky preoccupations; besides which, the strips were hard as rock and impossible to integrate into anything else. Is Ms. Grace trying too hard for a follow-up to that irresistible brittle? Now that she’s doing a full menu to a full (and frenzied) house, are there a few more missteps? Yes. But the most expensive dessert is $6, the median entree is under $20 and that brittle, well, it goes a long, long way. It was there almost from the start, and my bet is that it will be there until the end, which won’t be anytime soon.

332,Locanda Verde,2 star,"July 21, 2009",Frank Bruni,TriBeCa,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/dining/reviews/22rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/22/dining/reviews/22rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"RENOWN in the restaurant world can dawn so suddenly and grow so quickly that many chefs get ahead of themselves, winding up a half-dozen paces beyond where they rightfully belong. For Andrew Carmellini, the opposite has been true. Now 38, he has lagged behind, without billing as prominent or a showcase quite as flattering as he deserves. Although insiders knew that he, as much as Daniel Boulud, deserved credit for the outstanding French fare at Café Boulud during his years there, the restaurant’s name told the world something different. And each superb dish he turned out burnished another man’s crown. When he left in 2005 to open A Voce, he got his own kitchen, where he did some of the city’s best Italian cooking. But A Voce’s coolly modern, oddly soulless cosmetics were more of a drag on his efforts  than a complement to them. And the atmosphere was tense — between him and his partners, that is. After just two and a half years they broke up, and he went from having a restaurant that didn’t do him full justice to having no restaurant at all. So he began to make plans for a little East Village pasta joint. I’m sure it would have been terrific. It also would have been a crime. Mr. Carmellini’s talent demands a bigger stage, and luckily for both him and us, Locanda Verde came along in the nick of time to give him that. It opened two months ago in the TriBeCa space inhabited briefly — and disastrously — by Ago, may it rest in peace. It has more than 100 seats and a crack team of partners including Ken Friedman, of the Spotted Pig, and Josh Pickard, of Lever House. And it has a kitchen and a staff large enough to execute a menu with about 35 dishes, not counting desserts, on a given night. But in keeping with the Carmellini story, Locanda Verde doesn’t amount to the exactly right situation or perfect fit for him. It’s not the Carmellini restaurant that many of us have been waiting and hoping for, though it has plenty to recommend it. Hit the menu’s strong spots and you’ll have a terrific meal at a reasonable price. Like the menu at A Voce, the one here is emphatically market-driven, as the restaurant’s name  (which means “green inn”) telegraphs. But the dishes in aggregate tend to be more rustic and less elegant, perhaps a reflection of Mr. Carmellini’s mood, certainly a reflection of the moment. By portioning and tagging roughly half of them as “cicchetti” (snacks) or antipasti, Locanda Verde sidesteps sticker shock; even the entrees tread cautiously, most $25 or less. And to go with the restrained prices there’s a casual mood — too casual at times. No matter how obviously I fumbled with a shoulder bag or clumsily shoved it under a chair, no one offered to check it. Has the restaurant taken a pass on that service? The prices aren’t that  gentle — and, for some diners, they won’t make up for the frenzy and noise on a crowded night. This is nonetheless a serious restaurant, so vastly superior to Ago that it’s sacrilegious even to mention the two in the same sentence. Here’s my groveling penance, a bent-knee litany of all that’s improved: The wine list. Assembled by Josh Nadel, it engineers a wide-ranging, cost-conscious tour of Italy. The Barolo scrooges out there will wish for more big reds and a little more age, but focus instead on how many northern Italian wines are under $60 a bottle and on what a fine selection of whites — sylvaner, Soave, ribolla gialla, arneis — there is. The décor. Mr. Friedman toned down the farmhouse and generic-trattoria elements and made everything look glossier and a bit more industrial. That suits and reflects the neighborhood,  into which the restaurant merrily spills, thanks to the elimination of exterior walls in good weather. The desserts. The Locanda team had the fantastically good sense to recruit Karen DeMasco, whose work at Craft established her as one of the city’s leading pastry chefs. The many standout sweets here include a toasted almond semifreddo and a rice custard gelato, which tastes like rice pudding in a smoother, colder, more comely guise. The rest of the food. There’s hardly a false step among the cicchetti and antipasti, some not that ambitious but most immensely appealing. The sheep’s milk ricotta that the restaurant imports from Sardinia is sublime, and so was the summer corn that joined mushrooms on top of crunchy bread. Anything involving crunchy bread is worth ordering, including a crostino of blue crab and jalapeño that underscored Mr. Carmellini’s willingness to stray beyond established Italian traditions. But don’t load up on crostini at the expense of an appetizer of meaty, tender grilled octopus, served with an almond romesco, or of the juicy lamb meatball sliders, this restaurant’s answer to A Voce’s duck meatballs. The pasta dishes and entrees weren’t as uniformly successful. While the “Sunday night ragù” on top of big, floppy gigantoni was a porky dream and while a dish called “my grandmother’s ravioli”— filled with short rib and pork and sauced with San Marzano tomatoes — made me want to swap ancestors with Mr. Carmellini, the crumbled mix of meats in a white Bolognese was a total washout, and the noodles in several dishes were slightly overcooked. Neither his grandmother nor mine would approve. I found myself wishing for the opulence of some of his A Voce dishes, and got a hint of it in the charcoal-grilled squab, lavishly attired in pancetta, Swiss chard, fennel and black mission figs. In a humbler but equally impressive vein, he does a sectioned chicken for two, prepared in the wood-burning brick oven, that was spectacularly moist on visit after visit, though the rosemary and garlic sometimes got out of hand. Maybe because the scene is more raucous, the ambience more casual and the emphasis on affordability more pronounced, Mr. Carmellini isn’t bringing the same precision to dishes here that he did at A Voce. He isn’t yet hitting his stride. So be it. His amble beats the impatient sprints of some of the upstarts around town.

333,Aldea,2 star,"July 7, 2009",Frank Bruni,Flatiron,"New American, Portuguese",https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/dining/reviews/08rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/08/dining/reviews/08rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"GEORGE MENDES is hardly the first chef to toggle, in the space of a relatively compact menu, between elaborate and straightforward impulses. And his new restaurant, Aldea, isn’t alone in presenting some dishes defined by their look-at-me artistry and others that simply go for the gut. But while most chefs and restaurants seem, in the end, to favor one school of thinking and eating over another, Mr. Mendes and Aldea are unusually ambidextrous, as comfortable whipping up ethereal foams as scattering hunks of pork anywhere they can be defensibly scattered. The cooking is precious, lusty, ultramodern, rustic and a host of other adjectives that don’t normally squeeze together but find themselves in a tight, mostly happy clutch here. Although Aldea has a clean, sleek and relatively spare look, it has a much more complex taste. One minute you’re nibbling on crisp pig’s ears. The next you’re carefully maneuvering your spoon under a translucent, quivering orb of concentrated mushroom broth — one of those liquid ravioli that the Spanish alchemist Ferran Adrià made famous — in an avant-garde consommé. The entree in front of you is a go-for-broke hillock of rice with duck cracklings and black olives. The entree in front of your companion is a refined, butter-soft fillet of wild bass that has been poached in a technique similar to sous vide and tucked under a billowing nimbus made from Arbois and air. For dessert there are doughnuts (though they’re labeled “little dreams”). But there is also “chocolate in textures,” a dark tableau that seems as ready for exhibition as for ingestion. The ethnic guidepost for all of this is Iberian, specifically Portuguese, because that’s Mr. Mendes’s heritage, and because Portuguese cuisine, I suppose, was awaiting its modernization, at least in New York, where it hadn’t yet met the fate of other foods. Spanish, French, Thai, Chinese — all of these and more have been put through the Manhattan culinary wringer, coming out the other side with some traditions intact and with generous, often specious measures of raw tuna, foie gras and pork belly folded in. New Yorkers want restaurants to spirit them far, far away, but not so far that they can’t glance over their shoulders and catch sight of a molten chocolate cake. So as Mr. Mendes tugs them toward Lisbon, he cushions the journey with faddishness and trusted friends. The current local affinity for the slow-poached egg is reflected in two starters: one that presents a mix of egg, potato and salt cod in an eggshell — it’s like a brandade mousse — and another that combines egg, bacon, peas and summer truffle into a sort of porridge of the gods. He puts a hanger steak on the menu — and, gratuitously, a sunny-side-up egg over the beef. I say gratuitously because the beef is also paired with “bone marrow-onion marmalade” and a potato and oxtail terrine. Mr. Mendes’s usually intelligent, intriguing and highly skilled work is undercut at times by a tendency to overwork his dishes. Before Aldea he cooked at Tocqueville, and before that at Wallsé and at Bouley, a restaurant whose influence can be seen in his fondness for sous-vide techniques and pliant, silky textures. He knows his stuff and it shows — as much in the simple creations as in the ornate ones. He does little more to Maine scallops than score them and then sear them on a plancha. And they’re flawless. At Aldea Mr. Mendes, 36, is the principal owner as well as the chef — it’s his baby through and through. Its name is a Portuguese word for village. Its look is muted but lovely, with a sense of sea and sky in the blue and white palette of a narrow two-story space with an open kitchen in the back and slender birches recessed into the walls. The structure of the menu plays things relatively safe, presenting such popular categories as snacks — called “petiscos” here — and charcuterie before moving on to appetizers and mains. Even so, the lineup of dishes is relatively succinct, and in light of that, one or two too many miss their mark. The citrus foam and ginger over littleneck clams didn’t draw out or frame their flavor, but rather masked it. For all the technique lavished on the mushroom consommé, the results were wan. That surprised me, because other dishes were intense flavor bombs: shrimp à la plancha made shrimp-ier with a concentrated shrimp-head jus; the intensely ducky, paella-esque rice, embedded with chorizo to boot; a superb goat entree in which crisp flaps of goat skin and tender squiggles of goat liver played robust parts. Had Aldea opened a year ago, it would certainly be charging more than $27 for that goat and $20 for that duck. This restaurant is something of a deal, straight through desserts, one of the best of which was a “strawberry tasting” with a semifreddo, a sorbet and a hefty wedge of shortcake — all for $9. That generosity made the stinginess of wine pours befuddling, but then Aldea’s wine situation is slightly frustrating all in all, with too many young reds and by-the-glass selections often bereft of anything you’re really itching to drink. But there’s plenty to eat, whether you’re hungry for something delicate or blunt. It establishes Aldea as a restaurant worth trying, and Mr. Mendes as a chef worth keeping an eye on.

334,Spice Market,1 star,"June 23, 2009",Frank Bruni,West Village,Asian,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"WHEN Spice Market opened its doors in the fleetly evolving whirl of Manhattan’s meatpacking district in early 2004, it was something else: the Asian mega-restaurant reclaimed from fatuous gaudiness; a theme park, yes, but an unusually classy one in which the cooking reflected nearly as much thought as the lighting. Other kitchens around town had done the spring rolls, satays, chicken wings, laksas and curries that Spice Market cunningly recast as high-gloss “street food,” but few had shown them as much respect. Spice Market suggested the possibility of excellence in a genre often content with frivolity. Today it suggests the steepness of many a restaurant’s decline once it has made its first, glowing impression, especially if the restaurant was conceived as, or destined to be, the parent of money-making offspring elsewhere. Said restaurant comes out of the gate strong, whipping up the buzz and establishing the brand, but once that mission is accomplished, its motivation falters. Its cooking deteriorates. Sloppiness creeps in. There are Spice Markets at this point in Atlanta, Istanbul and Doha, Qatar. That may be good for the residents of those places. But it’s not such a happy turn for the residents of this one, left with a Spice Market considerably less enjoyable than at the start, when it received three stars in The Times from Amanda Hesser. While it still looks gorgeous, sends out the occasional superb dish and delivers a measure of fun, much of its menu is executed in a perfunctory or even slapdash fashion. Once a compelling destination, it’s now a modest diversion. And it’s a testament to the frustrating career of Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who set Spice Market in motion and maintains the designation — spelled out on the restaurant’s menu — of owner and chef. (The chef de cuisine, since about nine months ago, is Anthony Ricco.) Mr. Vongerichten is equal parts proud artist and profit-hungry entrepreneur, on the one hand making big-hearted contributions to the city’s restaurant scene while on the other wringing as much lucre from his stardust as he can. Jean-Georges the Great helps finance and promote Wylie Dufresne at wd-50 and Jim Lahey at Co. pizzeria. He imports — and collaborates with — serious Japanese talent at Matsugen, a principled restaurant with remarkable prix fixe deals at lunch and dinner. He keeps careful watch over his outstanding flagship, Jean Georges. Jean-Georges the Not-So-Great presides too distantly and cavalierly over the likes of Vong, Mercer Kitchen and Spice Market. He’s clone-happy, and in 2006 established a special wing of his empire, Culinary Concepts by Jean-Georges, to supervise his swelling brood of restaurants in hotels worldwide. That wing oversees all the Spice Markets. And while it runs the one here efficiently, making sure that the sleekly costumed servers seat diners on time and get them their first rounds of drinks promptly, it bungles finer points. All my recent meals were spasmodically paced. And at one of them, a companion sat down to a place setting at which the empty bowl had some other diner’s leftover rice still stuck to it. It wasn’t a huge deal, but it was a clumpy little metaphor for the restaurant’s need to pay more attention. Spice Market’s bearings, the structure of its menu and many of its dishes are pretty much unchanged from the early days. The restaurant transports you to Southeast Asia, touching down in Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam and India. It envelops you in the flavors and perfumes of those lands — in lemon grass, ginger, galangal, coconut, Thai basil. And it celebrates the sweet heat of the region’s cooking. Mr. Vongerichten has long been fascinated by the ways he can make sugary and fiery notes snuggle, joust or play tag-team with one another. Although the restaurant presents a dozen relatively conventional entrees, it emphasizes appetizers, salads, soups and sides for sharing. And on a menu with nearly 50 dishes in all, there are winners. On the night my friends and I got the chicken samosas, we liked them so much we insisted on a second order. The meat inside was moist, the pastry shell was crisp and the cilantro yogurt with them was a tart, cool breeze. That same night we had “silken tofu” that fully lived up to its name and came with a dressing that wickedly, pointedly distilled all the flavors of pad Thai. And our gorgeous steamed red snapper eliminated any doubt that Spice Market’s kitchen has ample skill. It just doesn’t have nearly enough discipline. In many entrees, the protein at the center was so modestly portioned, overcooked or just plain dull that no measure or mingling of seasonings could save it. Spice Market’s red curried duck, for example, would have been an intense, joyous treat — if the duck hadn’t tasted like tough pot roast. Steamed lobster tasted like absolutely nothing, while char-grilled chicken — served with an intriguing kumquat and lemon grass dressing that deserves a better host and happier fate — managed the feat of dry meat under wet, squishy skin. Meanwhile, the calibration of some dips, sauces and soups wasn’t quite right. The lime dipping sauce for skewers of (rubbery) chicken was blunt and overbearing; a chicken and coconut-milk soup had a weirdly and unpleasantly astringent kick. I don’t remember those sorts of failings from a meal at Spice Market five years ago. I simply remember having a great time. Some of the reasons I did remain in place. There are fanciful cocktails with tropical ingredients. Although the opening pastry chef, Pichet Ong, only checks in with the restaurant every few months, its desserts — including those glittering “Thai jewels” of brightly colored tapioca over coconut ice — remain a cut above those at many theatrical Asian restaurants of this ilk. The theatricality here doesn’t go over the top. Balustrades, canopies and silk lanterns seem as authentic as they are flashy. The hundreds of seats on two floors are arranged and spaced out with clear consideration for comfort. And the lighting, seemingly none of it direct, is beyond flattering — it’s obsequious. Too bad the kitchen no longer follows suit.

335,Rye,1 star,"June 16, 2009",Frank Bruni,Williamsburg,"American, Bistros, New American",https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/dining/reviews/17rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/17/dining/reviews/17rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"AMBIGUITY and misdirection work well in novels and movies, heightening suspense and sparking the imagination. But in restaurants? They’re mostly handmaidens to frustration, a state of mind that Rye, which opened in coy stages in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, over the last two and a half months, seems rigged to foster. It’s a somewhat confused and confusing enterprise, starting with the location, just far enough off any main artery to recommend some clear, possibly ostentatious signage. Rye spurns that recommendation. Unmarked, it blends into the nondescript buildings around it, easily overlooked by someone walking at a brisk clip. That’s fair enough and even fun —  part of a rich tradition, captured in recent years by Manhattan hideaways like Freemans and La Esquina, of restaurants playing curiosity-piquing games of hide-and-seek. And in Rye’s case, the game fits in with the restaurant’s broader evocation of a Prohibition-era speakeasy. But the confusion doesn’t stop at the ill-advertised entrance. Maybe because Rye hasn’t quite worked out what it really wants to be, it confronts you with too many riddles, complicating your effort to plot a coherent experience and undercutting its considerable sexiness and charms. Although it’s a restaurant worth knowing about, it’s not as  simply and easily navigable as it should be. Much of its menu promises fine dining of a relatively tame, buttoned-down sort: a beet salad with micro arugula and goat cheese; duck confit with wild mushrooms; pan-roasted halibut with haricots verts and sugar snaps; roasted chicken with spring vegetables. But a disappointingly succinct list of wines  suggests that, alternately, the real point of Rye is its cocktails, some of which come with the currently fashionable allotment of one large cube  of ice, all of which can be savored at a long, gorgeous mahogany bar that visually dominates the dining room. To that end there is, wisely, a menu category for snacks. Only here, too, nothing is quite what it appears to be. The sliders — one made with pork belly, another with short rib — are in fact closer to full-fledged sandwiches. And a meatloaf sandwich listed with them is a snack the way Godzilla is a garden lizard. A “grill” category on the menu exists apart from categories for appetizers and entrees, where dishes are described in full, and it includes no detail whatsoever about the items it comprises. Does that mean the duck breast and hanger steak in this niche are merely grilled pieces of meat? No. These, too, are fully composed dishes — the duck, for example, is arranged around a hillock of couscous — and the server recites the unwritten details of them, but only if you happen to ask. The server also has to tell you which “grill” items are portioned as starters and which qualify as main courses, because they’re not presented in any particular order. Beyond these bits of mild nonsense and odd affectation are real merit and considerable merriment.  Rye’s owner is the chef Cal Elliott, whose contribution to the Williamsburg culinary scene has been significant. He cooked at Dumont and was one of the two chefs in charge of the kitchen at Dressler when it opened in 2006. He fashioned Rye from what had been a bodega, though you probably wouldn’t guess that. The dark woodwork and pressed tin ceiling  look like lovingly restored, freshly gleaming holdovers from some pub-brasserie hybrid going back decades. When the room is sufficiently crowded, it has a lived-in, age-softened feel. And when Mr. Elliott hits his mark, the cooking appealingly complements that atmosphere. It’s mostly a mix of bistro stalwarts and of-the-moment comfort foods like a side of macaroni and cheese, the non-slider sliders and the meatloaf sandwich, wet and wild enough to qualify as a sloppy Joe — an enormous,  fantastic one at that. The mix of meats in its crunchy embrace included beef, veal, duck and pork. A salad of house-smoked sturgeon, frisée, potatoes, pancetta and horseradish had enough flavor and zing for two or three dishes, concentrated here in one hugely satisfying appetizer. Just as satisfying was an appetizer-size portion of pork belly. At many restaurants, pork belly is soft through and through; at Rye, the slices of it came off the grill with crisp edges that provided a wicked contrast to the luscious middle. While the pork was thickly marbled with fat, the grilled duck breast was only thinly skirted with it: the right call. And it was expertly cooked, though that wasn’t true of everything. Rye needs to be more consistent. A rib-eye in a dark sauce inspired by beef Bourguignon was tender and juicy one visit, tough the next. A floppy helter-skelter assemblage of noodles, cheese and wild mushrooms that was being called lasagna should be renamed or, better yet, re-imagined. It was too wet and wild. The selection of desserts is strictly limited, but who cares when the doughnuts (more like doughnut holes, really) are this warm and crunchy? And when there’s a cordial as excellent as a vaguely orange-flavored mix of rye and espresso showcased here? Sipping it slowly during the last of a string of visits to Rye, I still couldn’t decide whether this restaurant was positioned to be, and best approached as,  a drinkers’ refuge with ambitious food or a proper restaurant with a particular vanity about its cocktails. I sensed some indecision and tentativeness — reflected, too, in Rye’s unusually extended “soft opening.” Maybe that’s a function of the neighborhood, whose hipsters are aging and being joined by more settled, stodgy types. Late last year that evolution produced Walter Foods, another largely grown-up, seriously handsome restaurant trying like Rye to balance formal and cheeky impulses. Neither place has mastered that trick, though Rye’ s divinely messy meatloaf sandwich will tug you, for a few minutes, past the point of caring — or for that matter even noticing.

336,Flex Mussels,1 star,"June 2, 2009",Frank Bruni,Upper East Side,Seafood,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/dining/reviews/03rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/03/dining/reviews/03rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"AT first glance the words “Flex Mussels” would seem no more than a silly play on homonyms — and something of a groaner at that. But read through this restaurant’s menu, on which one fanciful mussel dish leads to another and then another after that, and you realize that its name is actually a truncated manifesto, a decree of intent, which is to show off mussels as they’ve never been shown off before. You can have mussels in a skillet with chipotle, chorizo and calamari, or you can have them in a tall, hooded pot with pearls of roasted corn, diced country ham and a bourbon-inflected, mustard-spiked cream sauce. You can have the Geisha Girl mussels, which, as it happens, do not involve their transport to the table by a fawning, bowing server. The dish’s tag signals the presence of sake and pickled ginger. You can have the Acadian mussels, which spirit you to a moss-draped bayou, arranging the mussels over gumbo, or the Thai mussels, a Siamese expedition that recruits coconut and lemon grass. When it comes to perfuming and festooning the liquid used to steam mussels, Flex taps into a seemingly limitless larder: San Marzano tomatoes (for the Fra Diavolo mussels), kaffir lime (the South Pacific mussels), dark rum (the Negril mussels), Pernod (the Provençal). Flex approaches mussels the way Baskin-Robbins or Ben & Jerry’s approaches ice cream: as a starting point, a canvas, a vehicle for a pleasantly hyperactive imagination. And as you lower your spoon into one of the festively colored, boldly seasoned pools underneath mussels or dip hunks of thick, fresh bread into it, you realize that the restaurant’s name is also, in the end, a bit of misdirection. Flex isn’t entirely about the bivalve. It’s just as much about the broth. That’s as it should be. A mussel can only preen so much. Its cooking isn’t tricky, and its eating can turn slightly monotonous if there aren’t currents of additional flavor rushing in. At Flex there are currents and riptides and veritable tsunamis, and monotony is less of a danger than drowning. Tucked away in an unremarkably attractive, half-underground space on the Upper East Side that’s too far off Third Avenue to draw much foot traffic, Flex Mussels has nonetheless become a crowded neighborhood favorite since its opening late last year, when the restaurant economy had already turned sour. So it provides some interesting suggestions of what still works. Restaurants benefit from having a clear identity and making a claim that dozens of other restaurants aren’t already making. In Flex’s case, that’s mussel mania. And restaurants do well to give diners a clear path to a meal that’s relatively economical while also filling. That’s where Flex and its spotlighted fare really deliver, in that a hillock of the mussels, coupled with plenty of broth-soaked bread, makes for a sizable dinner without a sizable check. The mussel dishes — more than 20 in all — range from $16 to $20. For that top price you get a few chunks of lobster, either in a dish called the Maine, which also has smoked bacon and corn, or a dish simply called the Bisque, which has brandy, tomato and cream. The Bisque was among my favorites, and required the use of not just an entire second serving of bread but also the beginnings of a third. You can drink relatively affordably at Flex, too. The succinct but appealing wine list, which supplements a terrific international array of beers, has few bottles over $75 and many under $50. The rest of the menu isn’t priced quite as gently or coherently. The presence of some bacon on an iceberg wedge with blue cheese doesn’t make it worth $12, not in a setting like Flex’s, which for all its prettily framed photographs of seascapes and fishing villages remains windowless, low-ceilinged and slightly claustrophobic. In such a setting, appetizers of $16 (a mix of fried calamari, shrimp and oysters) and $17 (two crab cakes) seem just a tad exorbitant. Both of these appetizers, though, were better than what you get at many other citified fish shacks. That’s the genre to which Flex Mussels in many senses belongs. It has a changing selection of a half-dozen different oysters, and the kitchen, run by Michael Bicocchi, turns out the requisite chowder (respectable), lobster roll (serviceable) and fish and chips (good). Flex’s lineage, though, is distinctive. Has any other restaurant traveled the same migratory route? The original Flex Mussels is in Charlottetown, the capital of Prince Edward Island, which is to mussels what Alba is to white truffles. I had the good fortune of eating at that Flex twice during a trip to Canada in 2007, and I wish that this Flex, which gets its mussels from Prince Edward Island, did the same lobster tempura roll, dressed with a wasabi aioli, and followed its forebear’s lead in putting salmon as well as cod into the fish and chips. I also wish this Flex were as orderly, with service as smooth. At its busiest, the bottleneck of human traffic around the host station is impenetrable, and your table can become a lonely colony to which food is exported fitfully. One night a friend and I got the first of it — oysters — almost a full hour after we’d been seated. We never got the sauces (mignonette, cocktail) that the person who delivered the oysters said he would be back with, and when we later mentioned that to our waiter, he asked, “Who told you the sauces would be coming?” “The guy who brought the oysters,” I responded. “Well, when I tell you I’ll bring something, I do,” he said, as if the issue were a rightful apportionment of guilt. He even sounded hurt. How insensitive of us. But how lucky of us to find room for dessert. Most of Flex’s aren’t fancy, and that’s their  charm: they bypass much of the usual decorative hooey for a down-home appeal. That night we had strawberry shortcake, a classic too seldom revisited in restaurants. We also had a chocolate-and-cream-cheese homage to a whoopie pie. It’s called Making Whoopie, and it made me wish we’d had the Geisha Girl just beforehand, in the interests of semantic naughtiness.

337,Ippudo,1 star,"May 26, 2009",Frank Bruni,East Village,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"WHAT I love about so much of Japanese cooking is its cleanness: the purity of the ingredients; the lilting clarity of their flavors; preparations and presentations that allow them such unfettered voice. What I love about ramen is the opposite. I stare into a bowl of this noodle soup — sometimes almost translucent, sometimes cream-colored, sometimes tawny, sometimes edging up on black and glittering darkly — and can’t begin to know precisely what’s in there. Every restaurant’s ramen seems different. Even every batch of one restaurant’s ramen does. I breathe in a ramen’s perfume and I’m still lost, still guessing, though I can isolate certain top notes: maybe scallions, quite possibly garlic, in a perfect world some sesame. I can make out the porky essence of the broth. With my spoon I plumb its depths and take in a mouthful, but a few players remain beyond reach. A few nuances, too. The taste of ramen isn’t just layered and complex; it’s almost murky, but a good murky, an enthralling murky, the kind of murky in which greedy eaters contentedly lose their way. At Ippudo in the East Village, which is where many of the most devoted ramen fans practice their devotion, I would sometimes look up from my ramen and realize that I hadn’t acknowledged my companions for several minutes, and had in fact forgotten that they were there. With ramen like Ippudo’s at its finest, who needs conversation? For that matter, who needs company? Ippudo opened early last year, but seems to become even more popular and fashionable every month. Ippudo, Ippudo, Ippudo: lately, acquaintances mention it all the time, usually in order to crow that they’ve just been. It’s an insider’s favorite, enjoying its gastronome-darling moment. As a result the wait can stretch to more than a half-hour at lunch and more than an hour at dinnertime. Ippudo doesn’t take reservations, and that’s one of several annoyances. In the end there are challenges to the ramen bliss here. There are complications and compromises that you have to edit out of the experience. Some background: Ippudo is no local (or, for that matter, seasonal) product. It’s the first American outpost of a Japanese chain of more than 50 restaurants, a fact I find amusing. Chains are usually frowned upon by the food cognoscenti, as this one would be if it had arrived in New York via St. Louis and St. Paul. Since it came from much farther than that, it’s exempt. It came at the right time. Over recent years ramen worship has taken hold in New York, especially in the East Village, where Ippudo competes against Ramen Setagaya, Minca Ramen Factory and, yes, Momofuku Noodle Bar. Momofuku has been no small force in the ramen advance — another fact I find amusing, because the Momofuku empire evolved so quickly and thoroughly away from ramen, at once the genesis of the empire’s  amazing success story and, in the final analysis, an asterisk to it. As I made recent visits to Ippudo I circled back to Momofuku Noodle Bar, and for good measure I hit Minca as well. While there’s more pork in Momofuku’s principal ramen than in most of the ramen at its East Village rivals, and while Minca festoons some of its ramen dishes with colorful and flavorful accents like corn, Ippudo’s ramen dishes — most of them, anyway — were my favorites. I appreciated Ippudo’s slender, springy house-made noodles,   which  manage the trick of having presence and delicacy at the same time. I loved the vaguely and not-so-vaguely cloudy broths of the shiromaru ramen — with its slices of fat-stippled Berkshire pork and its hints of mushroom and its nutty whispers of sesame — and of the akamaru modern ramen, which takes much of the shiromaru template and adds miso paste and garlic oil, among other accents. The akamaru is thick, almost creamy and altogether sublime. Also worth trying is the kogashi miso ramen, darker, oilier and arguably too intense. The ramen dishes that incorporated chicken stock, on the other hand, weren’t intense enough. If you want chicken soup, don’t enter the rightful kingdom of pork. Pork is a useful compass for navigating Ippudo’s menu, which goes beyond ramen to an array of small and medium-size plates. If a dish centers or pivots on pork — the meaty, fatty, glorious Samurai ribs, for example — consider it. If it doesn’t, beware. There’s remarkable unevenness here, exemplified by the shockingly fishy black cod I had one night. There’s unevenness even to the ramen, in which the slices of pork can be tender or tough, and in which the noodles can be just a tad too soft. With the turnover and bustle at Ippudo, consistency is clearly a challenge. The crowd management could be better — warmer. During lunch on a recent day, nearly a dozen of us waited around the bar up front for an open table, but Ippudo hadn’t bothered to deploy a  single bartender or dispatch a single server to see if we wanted a drink or, say, a glass of water. Service on the whole varies, alternately relaxed and rushed, friendly and aloof. But the U-shaped dining room has some arresting decorative flourishes — gigantic murals, a many-armed bamboo tree — that humbler ramen restaurants don’t. It has more space, too. While a twosome can end up at a communal table, a foursome is as likely to get an oversize table or booth. You can actually spread out, and you can do so without confronting the kind of prices that usually accompany such comfort. Most of the regularly featured ramen dishes (there are also changing specials)  are $15 or less, and any of them can be a light meal in itself. An absorbing meal at that. You fish slowly for noodles with your chopsticks, twirling and slurping the minutes away. Then you trade the sticks for a spoon, to see what it might catch: some cabbage, some ginger, half of a boiled egg. As the ramen slowly reveals itself, you  submit completely to its spell.

338,Minetta Tavern,3 star,"May 19, 2009",Frank Bruni,Greenwich Village,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/20/dining/reviews/20rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/20/dining/reviews/20rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE minute you heard that Keith McNally was dusting off  Minetta Tavern — that musty, sputtering Greenwich Village relic from the late 1930s — you probably figured he’d get the look and atmosphere right. This is a project perfectly suited to a restaurateur with a gift for breathing fresh life into familiar genres, for grafting the present onto the past. You also knew he’d conjure buzz. He always conjures buzz. Where Mr. McNally goes, models, movie honchos and magazine scribes follow, because they’re sure to find themselves among other members of their slavishly fashionable tribe, coddled in an environment that’s as much stage set as mess hall. And maybe, just maybe, you counted on decent food. Even when his restaurants miss their mark, they usually reflect at least some culinary thought. He cares about cooking, more than he must. Balthazar, for example, has typically been about twice as good as it needs to be. But were you prepared for a côte de boeuf like Minetta’s, a sublime hunk of glorious meat that you dream about hours later, pine for the next day and extol in a manner so rapturous and nonstop that friends begin to worry less about your cholesterol than about your sanity? And did you expect that Mr. McNally, with the chefs Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson, would come up with the best steakhouse in the city? That’s what Minetta Tavern turns out to be. For starters it’s serving some of the most expertly aged, flavorful and exquisitely prepared prime beef in New York. This beef is showcased in one trailblazing burger and two titanic steaks, the côte de boeuf for two and a bone-in New York strip, that have for two months now been the incessant talk of insatiable carnivores, who can’t get enough of them. Are you better off with the côte de boeuf, which is more generously marbled with fat, or the strip, with its steelier, brawnier taste? You could ponder, discuss and dither over this question as long as you could any stimulus package, only it would be a lot more fun.  You could dedicate  half a dozen visits to Minetta in the service of a resolution and still it might elude you. Or you could abandon the debate  for a while and explore other areas of the menu — and you wouldn’t be disappointed. Although little of the rest of Minetta’s food rises all the way to the extraordinarily high level of the beef, much of it is terrific. Minetta’s claim to being New York’s best steakhouse rests in large part on its versatility. While Sparks has a justly renowned strip of its own, it doesn’t have appetizers as quietly sophisticated as Minetta’s creamy mussel soup. While the best porterhouse on the best night at Peter Luger can be an amazement, there’s no seafood there as fine as the tender, sweet lobster in a big, crisp salad at Minetta or as this restaurant’s trout meunière, buttery and bedecked with crab meat. And at Minetta the servers don’t bark at you. Minetta’s potatoes Anna, which are like a love affair between scalloped potatoes and hash browns, rival the best sides at Strip House, where the beef itself isn’t in Minetta’s league. Minetta has a succinct selection of American cheeses so accomplished you could mistake them for European — you don’t get that at Keens. It doesn’t charge tariffs as steep as Craftsteak’s or the BLT empire’s. And with just 70 seats in two rooms, it feels more intimate than, say, Primehouse New York or Porter House New York. Yes, it’s cramped and loud, but that’s in keeping with the genre and, as such, a facet of its charm. Minetta captures the clubby, chaotic spirit of a handsomely timeworn saloon to a T: the long, heavy wood bar up front; the glowing tiers of liquor behind it; the tiled floors; the tin ceiling. Plus there are all those framed etchings of celebrities on the walls and the gauzy painted murals in the back. Mr. McNally has buffed what needed buffing, added what needed adding — the dark red booths, for example, are new — and left the rest of the place intact. It’s high-gloss nostalgia: McNally assoluta. It finds him in a more ambitious mood than at other restaurants he’s opened over the last decade, in terms of what’s on the plate. Neither Pastis nor Schiller’s Liquor Bar seek to do any food as superior as Minetta’s meat, including the crisp lamb saddle and succulent veal chop. And Morandi doesn’t compete against the city’s Italian standouts the way Minetta takes on the most prized temples of sirloin. As Mr. McNally put this restaurant together with Mr. Nasr and Mr. Hanson, who are veterans of Balthazar and Pastis, the three arranged through the distributor Pat La Frieda to get their hands on the fantastic grain-fed Black Angus beef from Creekstone Farms, which has a richness that’s indulgent without crossing into unctuous overkill as wagyu sometimes does. They had Mr. La Frieda set up a special aging room where Minetta’s strips, its côte de boeuf and the rib-eye used in a blend (with short rib, brisket and skirt) for its much-ballyhooed Black Label burger are stored for six to seven weeks. And in the kitchen they installed a high-temperature broiler that gives the meat precisely the char it wants. The steaks don’t develop a surface that’s too crunchy, which can happen at Luger, and they’re not finished with an excess of butter, another Luger liability. They’re spot-on — at least the ones on   the “grillades” section of the menu, where the best cuts  are clustered. A lower-priced bar steak  elsewhere isn’t prime or  dry-aged. Wrongly, the Black Label burger has received more public attention than the steaks, on account of its $26 price tag. It’s without question a riveting experience, because burgers seldom pack the discernible tang and funk of aged beef. But for that same reason, it’s unsettling and arguably too intense. Besides, the Minetta burger, a blend of short rib and brisket, manages a comparable juiciness at a price of $16, including a heap of crunchy, salty, addictive fries. And with a burger, you look to be comforted, not awed. Comfort, all in all, isn’t this restaurant’s strong point. Good luck penetrating the bodies around the host station after 7:30 p.m. And good luck nabbing a reservation any time between 7 and 10 unless you have and use an inside phone line, which I didn’t. Minetta has additional drawbacks. The desserts need slight improvement, especially the coarse, flat-footed sorbets, though you’ll have no complaint whatsoever with the sumptuous chocolate dacquoise. The wine list, better than those at older and squarer steakhouses, can nonetheless be frustrating, with too few accessibly priced reds that beckon you. Should you want to tread more lightly than the $36 strip and the $90 côte de boeuf — both generously portioned and neither out of line with the cost of prime beef these days — the trout is $24. An equally fine grilled dorade is $21. A large carbonara-style pasta dish that’s better than three-quarters of what I had at Morandi is $16. The excellent fried pig’s trotter, served over lentils, is $19. Given his name and his stardust, Mr. McNally didn’t have to provide this reasonable a path through his newest restaurant, not even now. But at Minetta he’s made a series of decisions that go admirably beyond the bottom line. And he’s made the kitchen the focal point of a resuscitation that’s ultimately about eating more than anything else. By all means take delight in the vintage décor. Stay for the steak.

339,Fishtail by David Burke,1 star,"May 5, 2009",Frank Bruni,Upper East Side,"American, Seafood",https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/dining/reviews/06rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/06/dining/reviews/06rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ALTHOUGH the restaurant Fishtail by David Burke focuses, as its vain mouthful of a name suggests, on seafood, its defining dish has nothing to do with the ocean. And it comes along late in a meal, after the lavishly attired seafood tacos and the pretzel-crusted crab cake and the “calamari mac & cheese” and the “angry mussels” (who ticked them off?) and the potato-zucchini latke with a shot glass of applesauce. It’s a dessert called “can o’ cake.” And it indeed shows up in a can, this molten chocolate miasma that you can let your server blast tableside with toffee crunch and ice cream and what-have-you, although that’s not the odd or flamboyant part. No, the clincher is that along with the cake, which is really more of a fudgy and spectacularly cloying brownie, you’re given a mixing bowl and several batter-slathered mixing paddles. You can sweep the goo from them with your fingers. Or you can just dispense with such matters of stuffy etiquette, stick out your tongue and lick. If you find this prospect exciting — and apt in an establishment that charges more than $30 for many entrees — you may well take a bright, scaly shine to Fishtail. If not, consider yourself warned. While several lines of type on the restaurant’s elaborately segmented, deeply fatiguing menu trumpet its commitment to sustainable seafood, there’s at least as high a premium on silliness, and exuberance is everything. With Mr. Burke, the trailblazing inventor of the cheesecake lollipop, that’s often the case. Like many of his similarly successful peers, he’s as much showman as chef, though he’s a particular kind of showman, happy to act the clown, eager to play the prankster. You get the sense that if, at some pivotal juncture in his past, he had been handed a microphone instead of a spatula, he’d be doing stand-up now. He’s vain but not proud. Just a few years back he agreed to write the menu for Hawaiian Tropic Zone, a Midtown mega-restaurant — closed for renovations at the moment — where waitresses didn’t wear much. He further consented to pose for advertisements in which he, the beefy cook in white, was flanked by servers in bikinis. The type above the image said, “Beauty and the Feast.” Mr. Burke was the feast part. At Fishtail he takes a decidedly more serious approach, producing a restaurant with some real charms, among them its smooth, upbeat service and an attractive, comfortable setting in an Upper East Side town house that once housed Jovia. The deep, narrow downstairs has a slim lane for traffic between the bar and a row of booths for casual dining. Upstairs is a dining room with proper tables and more elbow room. The décor hews to the culinary theme, including cartoon-bright fish paintings and, behind the bar, a tank of jellyfish whose quick, constant movement is the tip-off that they’re fake. Not even Shakira wriggles that relentlessly. As for the eating, you can insist on a straightforward experience, paying more heed, say, to the extensive raw bar selections than to the elaborately composed dishes. And there’s some lovely fish under the menu heading of “Today’s Whole Fish & Simple Fish,” which signals that the saucing in these dishes is at least somewhat less likely to get out of hand. A fillet of halibut found here was delicate in texture and pure in flavor. A recent night’s appetizer special of Scottish langoustines and entree special of turbot did justice to the luxury ingredients. What’s more, some of the games Mr. Burke plays elsewhere on the menu are tempered ones with happy payoffs. It was a fetching pique that those angry mussels were in, because the chili oil and fried basil used in their cooking didn’t exist entirely apart from them — so often the case with the broth around bivalves. In this appetizer the seasonings had worked their way into the mussels, which had the additional virtues of being plump and tender. If Fishtail succeeded in preparing more of the food with the care those mussels and the halibut received, the silliness and exuberance of so many of Mr. Burke’s conceits might have a more endearing effect. But under the first executive chef, Eric Hara, and under his successor, John Tesar, the kitchen turned out plenty of clunkers: mealy octopus; a lobster carbonara with bits of bacon as hard as pellets; tough prawns arranged prettily but pointlessly over the gluiest, saddest, blandest little pesto ravioli you can imagine. It’s through the prism of these miscues that all the cartwheels the kitchen insists on turning can seem as exasperating as amusing. Are Mr. Burke and Fishtail spending their energy in the right way? Their fussing over crab cakes is to be expected, inasmuch as few foodstuffs have received as much fussing over time. You’ve no doubt had them broad and flat, as if they were pancakes, and tall and round, as if they were meatballs. At Fishtail their shape is less striking than their coating and accouterments. On my last visit I encountered the pretzel crusting, along with candied orange below the crab and honey around it. Pre-pretzel, the kitchen was tucking the crab in puffed rice. Both times, the crustacean itself was muffled. That’s the danger of Mr. Burke’s ablutions and his aggressive approach, better suited to meat. Or to vegetables. In fact the standout dish at Fishtail is a vegetable side: the cauliflower. It’s given one of those treatments popular with chefs of a superindulgent bent, who see no reason why vegetables should be any less rich than desserts. For an edifying primer head to the John Dory, in Chelsea, where April Bloomfield wickedly folds yogurt and orange blossom into carrots and has cooked sweet potatoes with marrow. Fishtail’s cauliflower gets so much cream it’s nearly a custard, so much cheese it could impersonate a quiche. It gets bread crumbs, and a special cradle in the form of a small sauté pan, plunked right down on the table. Go ahead and empty it, unless you want to save room for the cake.

340,La Fonda del Sol,2 star,"April 21, 2009",Frank Bruni,Midtown East,Latin American,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/dining/reviews/22rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/22/dining/reviews/22rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"JOSH DeCHELLIS is the opposite of a man without a country. He’s a man with possibly too many countries — on his résumé, at least. There’s France, where he apprenticed toward the beginning of his career as a chef, and Japan, a reference point for both Sumile, the New York restaurant that established him, and BarFry, a later failed bet on tempura. Then there’s Italy, the inspiration for Jovia, which came just before BarFry and also didn’t hang in there for long, partly because he never mastered any real fluency in Italian. Is Spanish the language that Mr. DeChellis — born, as it happens, in Colombia — was meant to speak? Is Spain his culinary home? During the peak moments of my best meals at La Fonda del Sol, which opened in January with Mr. DeChellis manning the stoves, I was inclined to say yes. Although the menu has weak spots, with a few too many dishes not from the heart but from a  marketing plan, his cooking here feels less forced and more exuberant than it did at any of the other restaurants where I tried it. More important, it reflects a steady, precise hand. A tried-and-true combination of octopus with potato seemed fresh again, because the kitchen got precisely the tenderness it wanted from the octopus and the firmness it sought in the potato, so that each was a textural mirror and mimic of the other. At lunchtime, when so many restaurants put on their B if not C games, La Fonda served me a fillet of wild striped bass so vividly white in color and melting in consistency it could have been a snowdrift. The fish got a thrillingly salty, nutty charge — and some nice crunch — from the pumpkinseeds scattered over it. Even better was a lunchtime braised chicken with saffron-seasoned rice, which sopped up juices and braising liquid from the bird. Packed into a deep bowl instead of arrayed on a plate, the dish negotiated some midpoint between coq au vin and paella, and it had some of paella’s gently smoky, porky accents. La Fonda del Sol takes its name and general bearings from a long-gone restaurant that opened in the Time & Life Building in 1960, well before Spanish food had as much cachet with  American diners as it has now. That original La Fonda was the creation of Joe Baum, he of the Four Seasons and other flashy enterprises that heralded an era of dining as conceptual extravaganza, during which the motifs would matter as much as the moulard. This restaurant is billed as a revival, along the lines of “Gypsy” or yet another Fleetwood Mac tour. But that’s more marketing gimmick than reality, even though one of the cooks from the first Fonda, Victor Broceaux, has been on hand to consult with Mr. DeChellis. La Fonda 2009 is in a different location, on Vanderbilt Avenue, smack against Grand Central Terminal. Its menu is more expressly Spanish and less pan-Latin. Its look isn’t remotely the same. That the new owners, the Patina Restaurant Group, mean business is reflected in part by their hiring of Adam Tihany’s firm to design the space, split into two distinct environments. Up front, looking onto the street, is a long room with a long bar and a festive décor that makes you want to drink sangria. This area doesn’t accept reservations and serves a menu entirely of tapas, except at lunchtime, when it also offers a few main courses, including those bass and chicken dishes and equally fine scallops with salsa verde. Up a half flight of stairs is a carpeted, plush, windowless dining room that makes you want to drink martinis. It serves a menu mostly of conventionally portioned appetizers and entrees, with some tapas thrown in. It’s up here in this somewhat glum hideaway that you can eat the superb scallops tiradito, a sort of carpaccio-cum-ceviche with flares of cilantro and chili, or a gorgeously brooding, thick soup of oxtail, white beans, bread and cheese. I preferred the casual front, which has the right feel, food and natural light (until sunset) for an easygoing lunch or a dinner that proceeds in improvisatory chapters of tapas, the final tally of food determined in part by the final tally of drink. With another glass of a refreshing blend of garnacha blanca and macabeo, I would ask for yet another order of the classic pa amb tomàquet, toasted bread with a jammy spread of tomatoes, olive oil and salt. Each time I had it, it was just about perfect. For less comfort but more adventure you can check out another Spanish newcomer, and the adventure unfolds on several fronts. There’s the location, a once-groggy block of Ninth Avenue suddenly swarmed by the food-obsessed, thanks largely to the new-wave pizzeria Co. There’s the food, which has included, on different nights, beef tongue and hake jowls and even a mix of beef tendon, tripe and pig trotters. And there’s the phonetics, a daunting barrage of t’s, x’s, k’s and p’s twisted into such pronunciation-defying dishes as txangurro (crab meat gratin), txiki txanpi (grilled cheese with mushroom and shrimp), txipiron encebollado (squid ribbons a la plancha) and txarripatak (the trotter-tripe-tendon jubilee). In honor of the Spanish region that guides the kitchen, the menu is written in the Basque language of Euskara, which also yields the restaurant’s name, Txikito (cheek-ee-toe), meaning “little.” And little this restaurant is — a boxy room whose dark blue paint works with reclaimed barn wood  and grayish tiles on other walls to produce a  drearier effect than the owners, Alexandra Raij and her husband and co-chef, Eder Montero, who is from the Basque area, could have intended. Ms. Raij used to be in charge of the food at the Chelsea favorites Tia Pol and El Quinto Pino, and justly amassed a loyal following through her wickedly enjoyable work there. El Quinto Pino’s uni panino will go down as an era-defining treat, pressing an exotic delicacy into the service of a paper-sleeved finger food to be eaten on the run. Her menu at Txikito maintains her focus on tapas-style dishes, including pintxoak (Basque canapés), but is by far the longest and most complicated she’s done — maybe too long and complicated, given the constraints of a visibly tiny kitchen. Across many meals here I had wonderfully memorable food (suckling pig as fine as any in New York beyond Eleven Madison Park’s); ridiculous food (a rib-eye so excessively fatty and undercooked it was almost inedible); food that fell somewhere in between (the crosscut spareribs, with too much bone and too little pork); and food that never tasted the same twice. The meatballs in a shellfish broth could be hard and dull or tender and nuanced. It depended on the night. Although the prices on individual items are low, the bill can climb surprisingly high, especially considering the plainness and tightness of the quarters. But the staff is cheerful and welcoming. The short wine list has many Spanish pleasures. And a terrific meal is definitely a possibility, speaking to Ms. Raij’s indisputable talents. Get two orders of her “crispy creamy croquettes” of béchamel and bacalao, which live up to both adjectives and have a way of disappearing fast.

341,Macao Trading Company,1 star,"March 31, 2009",Frank Bruni,TriBeCa,"Asian, Chinese, Portuguese",https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/dining/reviews/01rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/01/dining/reviews/01rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"TO the question of how a restaurant can season its cooking with an erotic charge, Macao Trading Co. has come up with a laughably unsubtle answer: Go with bare breasts, and throw in a dozen or so phalluses for good measure. The breasts belong to naked women in vintage photographs  — nothing like sepia tones to class up pornography  — on the walls of the restrooms. The phalluses are in a  locked wire-cage display case. Made of black granite, they’re supposedly Tibetan totems once used in fertility rites, but I assure you: your first thoughts when you spot them won’t turn to anthropology. As a waitress said when she overheard my friends and me discussing the erotica afoot, “I’m trying not to think about what working here is doing to my psyche.” To be fair, I’m describing the smaller, subterranean part of Macao, which has two levels: a PG-13 upstairs devoted principally to dining and this R-rated lounge where the focus is cocktails, though the full menu is available. But  the lounge captures a quality that pervades Macao’s not-quite-Portuguese-Chinese-fusion cooking; the menu’s structure and grammar; and the architecture of the main dining room, rimmed by a decorative balcony brimming with bric-a-brac. One of my companions put it best. “This,” he said as he alternated between bites of a  putatively Portuguese meatball (lamb) and of a Chinese one (pork), “is a deeply silly restaurant.” That’s what makes it sort of fun, and that’s what keeps it from being anything more than that. In the right mood, with the right stretch of the menu, lubricated by the right cocktails, and with the right tolerance for ear-decimating decibels, you can definitely enjoy Macao, in a minor way, especially now that it’s moved past a beginning for which clumsy is too forgiving an adjective. Macao was downright clownish  out of the gate. It’s improved steadily, replacing the bony spareribs it initially used for a “Peking-style” entree platter with meatier baby backs and refining an appetizer of quail stuffed with sticky rice so that you can actually detect the bird. Before, it was a mere notion playing hide-and-seek within a sweetly starchy bog. The restaurant’s silliness begins with the counterintuitive collaboration behind it. Macao brings together David Waltuck,  the chef and an owner of stately, stodgy Chanterelle, and the cocktail mavens who made Employees Only such an up-to-the-minute hit. That’s a little like hiring James Ivory to direct a Diablo Cody script. Together they pivot eastward, to the special administrative region of China that was once a Portuguese colony. What they find there, or at least contrive under its name, isn’t really a hybrid cuisine. It’s a parallel-tracks dining experience, during which you can eat Chinese, Portuguese or some of each. Seldom do the twain meet in one dish. The menu introduces many appetizers and entrees by naming  the centerpiece ingredient (e.g., meatballs, shrimp or mushrooms) and then giving you the choice of a “Portuguese style” or “Chinese style” treatment. You can have both styles, but that means ordering separate dishes. There’s no opportunity to compare and contrast in one polyglot presentation. That would make too much sense. Also odd: the rubrics under which these dishes fall. For the appetizers, the heading reads “Small Dish, Two Flavor,” though multiple dishes and flavors follow. For entrees: “Large Dish, Two Flavor.” Although a publicist explained that these phrases represent a faithful translation of a Chinese menu in Macao, they seem uncomfortably close to a lampoon of immigrant English. The menu also lists “House Small Dishes” and “House Large Dishes,” just to keep things visually confusing. In the countervailing interests of simplicity and directness, I’ll boil all of this down to some of what you should and shouldn’t order. Should: the chicken dumplings in chili oil. They were plump and meaty, and tasted much fresher than takeout. Shouldn’t: the Portuguese-style whole black bass, smothered in a “citrus and tomato” sauce that tasted like ketchup-infused cough syrup. Should: prawns, either grilled Portuguese-style (with garlic butter) or sautéed Chinese-style (with chili peppers). They too were plump and meaty, and weren’t excessively accessorized. Shouldn’t: the stir-fried lobster, which was overcooked and in short supply. Should: those Portuguese-style mushrooms, which are really rich croquettes filled not just with mushrooms but also with creamy béchamel and a racy whiff of white truffle. Also should: the bacalao fried rice, arrestingly fluffy. That last dish is a rare example of real fusion, folding a Latin staple into an Asian context. Another such example comes at dessert, when an Asian staple is folded into a Latin context. I refer to mandarin orange flan, served in a flan triptych that also includes espresso and dulce de leche. The desserts on the whole aren’t noteworthy. The cocktails, with names like drunken dragon’s milk (green-tea vodka shaken with coconut purée) and yellow fever (rye, Benedictine, egg white), are conceived with more imagination and mixed with more discipline than at many  restaurants of Macao’s flashy ilk, but they skewed too sweet for me. About that ilk: with its busy design, facile exoticism and ultradark lighting, Macao strikes a pose that’s familiar, and — suddenly and strangely — nostalgic. I think fewer New Yorkers these days are looking for restaurants that “ooze sex and decadence,” which is how the publicist explained the aim behind the erotica. But if New Yorkers are  looking for croquettes that do that, Macao’s their place. Macao Trading Co. * 311 Church Street (Walker Street), TriBeCa; (212) 431-8750; macaonyc.com.

342,Kefi,1 star,"March 17, 2009",Frank Bruni,Upper West Side,Greek,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/18/dining/reviews/18rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/18/dining/reviews/18rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"A FRIEND and frequent dining companion often complains of palate fatigue, that deadening of all response when too many of a restaurant’s dishes have too little nuance and a surfeit of the same bold —  even bullying — notes. During some meals at Kefi, a madly popular Greek restaurant on the Upper West Side, what I experienced was more like palate mononucleosis. The culprit was runaway saltiness, a sensation that came at me in the form of feta, olives, capers, caper berries, sun-dried tomatoes, anchovies, sausage and such, usually in some combination of two or three, occasionally in a combination of even more than that. An appetizer of warm feta, to be spread on pita, seemed to have most of those salty ambassadors. Start your meal with it and your palate may never get out of bed again. All of these ingredients are legitimate players in Greek cooking, and the chef at Kefi, Michael Psilakis, is a seriously talented Greek cook. But at this restaurant, he too frequently goes overboard, in terms of what he throws at a dish and how much of it he tosses around. It’s messy, obvious cooking, wholly unlike his work at Anthos and mostly unlike his work at Mia Dona, where the food I had occasionally veered in this direction but usually pulled back in the nick of time. Kefi is the most downscale, affordable of these restaurants, and that may well be part of the explanation. To keep prices low but satisfaction high, Mr. Psilakis is trying to tease big effects and full flavors out of dishes that don’t cost a fortune to make. Salty, cheesy players are helpful tools in this regard. They just shouldn’t be used with quite this much abandon. I admire him. That may seem an odd non sequitur, but whatever Kefi’s weaknesses — and it has strengths, too, to be discussed shortly — it’s a restaurant that’s a levelheaded, vanity-purged  response to the current economy and to diners’ appetites for comforting, affordable food. Both Mr. Psilakis and the restaurateur Donatella Arpaia, with whom he owns this place, are restaurant-scene darlings with enough heat on them right now that they might well have chosen to defy the economy and do something flashier. And they might well have made it a success in spite of the times. But with Kefi they’ve fashioned a restaurant for the masses (or at least the upper-middle-class, Upper West Side version of masses) and for its neighborhood, whose diners were putting more of a premium on value than on high fashion or culinary pizazz long before the Dow went into its current swoon. Kefi was such a monster hit at a first location, on West 79th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam, that  Mr. Psilakis and Ms. Arpaia decided to upsize significantly. In its new location on Columbus Avenue near 84th Street, the restaurant spreads out over two floors and has about 200 seats, more than double the former capacity. On many nights at 8, every one of them is full, and something akin to an angry mob gathers at the host station, glaring at the hosts. I get the sense that Kefi hasn’t quite aced the reservation book, or maybe there’s little way around the fact that on the Upper West Side, seemingly no one will be cajoled or corralled into a 9 p.m. dining time. By 10 p.m. on weeknights, the restaurant’s a ghost town. The meatpacking district, this isn’t. Once seated, diners are rewarded with cheerful service and food that’s filling and intermittently impressive for the price. An appetizer quartet of spreads, including vibrant tzatziki and creamy taramosalata, is several notches above what you’d get in most similarly priced Greek, Turkish or Middle Eastern restaurants, and it feeds two. Yet it’s just $9.95. Kefi’s meatballs, four hefty ones for $6.25, are made with a tender combination of beef and pork and come in a pool of tomato sauce with enticingly potent strains of garlic and olive. Another of the best appetizers, a warm potato salad, is a real textural triumph, the fat, soft fingerlings contrasting with thin, crisp green beans. And the measures of feta and olive in the salad don’t tip into salty excess. But the octopus I had here wasn’t nearly as tender as a similar appetizer I had just nights later at Taverna Kyclades in Astoria. Kyclades’s fried calamari was better, too. The Kefi dinner menu has a section between the appetizers and entrees for Greek or not-quite-Greek pasta dishes. While most are satisfying in a hyper-robust way, some have at least one and usually two ingredients too many. That was true even of my favorite, a dish of “tubular pasta” with sausage, peppers, onion, tomato and feta. And why such recklessness with bread crumbs? All three pasta dishes my friends and I ordered one night had them. The sheep’s milk ravioli I had another night was without bread crumbs, but in their place were fried shallots, and there were more fried shallots in a spinach salad that had plenty else going on: sun-dried tomato, hard-boiled egg, graviera cheese. Enough already. No entree is above $16.95. All are generously portioned. And the braised lamb shank, on an irresistible bed of orzo that sops up the lamb’s juices, could pass muster at $10 more, in a more ambitious restaurant. The short dessert list has clear winners: a dish of crunchy, honeyed pastry with orange spoon fruit; and an intense puck of chocolate mousse that, when eaten in bites that include some of the sesame sorbet alongside it, yields a treat much like, but more novel than, the combination of chocolate and peanut butter. The all-Greek wine list is as price-sensitive as the food, and the atmosphere is pleasant, if Greek-restaurant predictable: a white-and-blue color scheme, decorative ceramics, that sort of thing. Try not to sit at a table by the bar, where the human traffic is most snarled. And know that the scale and manner of the cooking Mr. Psilakis is doing here differ from what he’s done elsewhere around town — or what he did at the original Kefi. There, many of the same dishes were executed with more precision and restraint. It was a lesser stage, but it was a greater one. Kefi * 505 Columbus Avenue (84th Street); (212) 873-0200.

343,L'Artusi,1 star,"March 3, 2009",Frank Bruni,West Village,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/dining/reviews/04rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/04/dining/reviews/04rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ALMOST everything you need to know about the confidence that dell’Anima instilled in Gabe Thompson is written large, or rather loopy, in the vitello tonnato at his follow-up restaurant, L’Artusi, which opened to instant popularity three months ago. It’s the kind of dish that only a chef feeling a surge of confidence would come up with. It’s not vitello tonnato per se  — on the menu, those two words have telltale, caveat emptor quotation marks around them  — but an homage and improvisation, which in its case means an insult. In place of the tuna-infused mayonnaise of sorts that typically coats the veal, Mr. Thompson tops the meat with scattered dices of tuna so small they’re almost guaranteed not to make any impression. They’re joined by the yolks of quail eggs, which produce a sticky texture instead of the usual creamy one. As for the veal, it was pounded so thin when I had it that I could have read a Bumble Bee label through it, and it adhered like wet tissue paper to the plate. Its texture was off-putting; its taste, sadly muted. Dell’Anima (“of the soul”) opened in a modest space in the West Village in 2007 and has been packed ever since, its appeal attributable in large part to its intimacy, its seating arrangement (many high chairs at tall tables and counters), its wines, and a savory, hip analogue to the make-your-own sundae: the make-your-own bruschetta. You get to choose your toppings and spread them yourself. At L’Artusi, named for a renowned Italian cookbook writer, Mr. Thompson and his business partner, Joe Campanale, have moved well beyond the bruschetta. They have gone not only bigger  — with nearly 115 seats, L’Artusi is more than twice the size of dell’Anima  — but also bolder, and the uneven results are a lesson in overextension. If they turned a more skeptical eye to some of Mr. Thompson’s inventions, edited the menu to about two-thirds its current length and focused harder on the execution of what remained, they’d have an excellent restaurant. As it is, they have a fitfully enjoyable one. You can have a terrific time. Among nearly 10 pasta or pastalike dishes, which inhabit the strongest of the menu’s many sections, there are several  —  garganelli with a meaty lamb ragù; orecchiette with house-made sausage and bitter greens  —  that I yearn to eat again. What’s more, the restaurant has a charm  —  a buoyancy, really  —  that frequently papers over the food’s shortcomings. At some places the ebullience of the owners, managers and principal servers is palpable, putting you in a happy mood the minute you make contact with it. I’ve encountered some of that spirit at dell’Anima; L’Artusi positively brims with it. You can feel how much the players want you to have a good time. They also want you to be comfortable in a way that’s not as possible at dell’Anima, given its dimensions. They’ve furnished two floors of space previously occupied by the restaurant Maremma with pretty, padded seats, including some of the most comfortable bar stools I’ve encountered. All in all, there are nearly 30 stools at different counters. L’Artusi’s selling points extend to the wide-ranging, pleasantly surprising Italian wine list that Mr. Campanale put together and that Aaron Sherman, who worked at WD-50, helps guide you through. When was the last time you spotted a 1996 soave? L’Artusi had one, for $62, with the slightly nutty, racy personality I love in aged, oxidized whites. Most of the desserts by the pastry chef Katherine Lahr, who is married to Mr. Thompson, are first-rate. Her coconut semifreddo was beautifully realized, at once silky and dense. Texture is one of her strong suits, as she also demonstrated with a crème fraîche mousse  — similar to whipped cream, but with a touch more weight  — that accompanied a superb olive oil cake. And she mingles flavors astutely, accessorizing a vanilla-buttermilk panna cotta with pineapple sorbet and macadamia nuts. Ms. Lahr had only one miss, a dry walnut cake, while Mr. Thompson had many. It’s a puzzling show he puts on, caroming from success to failure and back again. His menu of mostly small- and medium-size plates is divided into crudo, a few salads, pastas, fish, meat and sides. Focusing on salads, pastas and sides increases your odds of satisfaction, though a few dishes in the pasta section  — specifically the gnudi and the gnocchi  — suffer from Mr. Thompson’s sometimes reckless hand with butter. He doesn’t grasp the nuances of excess as well as a Mario Batali or a Michael White  — doesn’t fully understand what’s splendid decadence and what’s just overkill. In general he’s indiscreet with salt, though you never know. During one meal, a side of crispy potatoes had just the right amount of it, while the similarly crispy potatoes alongside juicy slices of hanger steak were so salty they had me lunging for my water glass. The seasoning of some other dishes was also out of whack. Citrusy notes came on too strong in both sea scallop crudo and escolar ceviche. An entree of grilled quail had been splashed with an oppressive measure of red-wine vinegar. There were dishes that read more intriguing than they tasted. Oxtail calzone? It was like an elongated pot pie on a sludgy swish of béchamel. Wagyu tongue with cabbage and rye? A messy Jewish-deli mishap. But Mr. Thompson plays happier games as well. Rye crisps lent an unexpected ping and crunch to his beef carpaccio, which was the vitello tonnato’s more practical, presentable sibling. Pineapple and chilies combined to festive effect in fluke crudo, and chilies were used to fine, measured purpose in the orecchiette, in the garganelli and in squid-ink trofie with a calamari ragù. For a less zippy, blunter pasta dish that sticks to the gut in the best way, try the pizzoccheri, made with layers of buckwheat noodles, brussels sprouts, potato and melted fontina. This combined with some wine and a bar stool would make for a perfect impromptu, abbreviated meal. But then you’d be using L’Artusi the way so many regulars use dell’Anima, and I think Mr. Thompson had higher hopes.

344,Buttermilk Channel,1 star,"Feb. 24, 2009",Frank Bruni,Carroll Gardens,"American, Bistros",https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/dining/reviews/25rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/25/dining/reviews/25rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THERE is a script by which a restaurant can establish the food-world equivalent of street cred these days, and Buttermilk Channel follows almost every line of it. House-made pickles? They’re here, advertised — fashionably — in a box in the upper-left-hand corner of the dinner menu, under the heading “snacks.” That’s also where you’ll find the “maple & bacon roasted almonds,” a breakfast-meets-brittle indulgence in the spirit of the similarly piggy peanut clusters at the Redhead, an East Village redoubt for (potential oxymoron alert!) hipster gastronomes. Of course nothing says commitment like the curing of pig parts on the premises. Buttermilk comes through with its own bacon, grouped on the menu with such house-made charcuterie as head cheese and country terrine. And the restaurant goes a few local-and-seasonal paces better than many  other local-and-seasonal avatars by stocking only New York State beers. About a quarter of its wine list, meanwhile, is devoted to vintages from the Finger Lakes, the North Fork and the Hamptons. All of this makes Buttermilk Channel a restaurant of real standards, noteworthy ambition and uncommon slavishness to trends. It’s laudable and predictable in equal measures. And it was packed every time I went. That’s partly a function of its location near the border between Carroll Gardens and Red Hook, an area of Brooklyn not yet overstuffed with restaurants that flaunt a full range of contemporary bona fides and sophisticated grace notes, including special house cocktails for the start of a meal and ice wines for the end. It’s largely a matter of price. None of the decently sized entrees is over $22. Desserts that might be $10 at less cost-conscious places are $7, a steal when it comes to the pecan pie sundae, a blockbuster and gut buster as filling as it is irresistible. But the crowds that have descended on Buttermilk since it opened in November also speak to the kitchen’s efforts, the best of which are very fine indeed. Although one in three dishes widely misses its mark and the restaurant’s reach frequently exceeds its grasp, there’s the possibility of a terrific meal. There’s the probability of a pleasant one. And there’s the pecan pie sundae. I won’t stop mentioning it because I can’t stop hankering for it. Brace yourself for another invocation before we’re done. Among new Brooklyn restaurants that have attracted significant attention over the last six months, I’m more taken with Buttermilk than with the General Greene, which came out of the gate strong and then faltered, or with Bussaco, which doesn’t have Buttermilk’s warmth. Its name refers to the strait between Brooklyn and Governors Island, though the name also functions as a double entendre, buttermilk being deployed as an ingredient not only in the batter for fried chicken but also in the house-made ricotta that’s layered into an appetizer tart. The look of the restaurant, whose corner location affords it pretty windows on two sides, is on the polished side of homey. There’s nicely buffed wood, a spidery brass lighting fixture and a honeyed glow from it and handsome sconces along the walls. There’s also ample space between tables: the owner, Doug Crowell, isn’t trying just to jam in as many people as possible. But he does ask you to trade some comfort and convenience for the refreshingly low prices. The restaurant accepts reservations only for parties of five and up. On a busy night, the wait for a table for four can exceed an hour, the bar is standing-room only and the line for the sole restroom can be three- or four-people long. Companions who head there may go missing for a good 10 minutes. Some nice touches compensate. In place of typical bread Buttermilk presents popovers, the golden retrievers of baked goods: who doesn’t love them? And in addition to its own charcuterie items — a few of which are like earnest but clumsy culinary-school first attempts — it serves bratwurst from Schaller & Weber and Italian sausage from Esposito’s, both beloved New York institutions. Either comes on a grilled roll with fries, for $10. If you’re not after a huge, proper meal, that’s a good budget-minded alternative. The best ways to begin are with the croquettes filled with goat cheese and sweet potato, or the previously mentioned appetizer tart, in which the ricotta is joined by delicata squash. The chef, Ryan Angulo, apparently has a way with starchy, orange-colored vegetables. And he has a thing for anchovies. Leg of lamb gets an anchovy butter, short rib an anchovy brandade, mozzarella an anchovy sauce and a grilled kale salad an anchovy dressing, as well as a soft-boiled egg. A soft-boiled egg also pops up in a warm lamb and romaine salad. Whole eggs are big right now. So is bacon, which at Buttermilk is floated in an appealing cauliflower and apple soup and, separately, wrapped around brook trout instead of monkfish: a welcome change and an excellent entree. The restaurant finds its own twist for upscale meatloaf, using something with two wings instead of four legs; duck does the star turn, and it’s a juicy star turn at that. The fried chicken, on the other hand, is slightly dry, indicative of how unevenly the kitchen performs. It does particularly unimpressive work with sides, including creamed spinach that doesn’t benefit a whit from an infusion of celery root purée. And it produces an out-and-out debacle of a chocolate bread pudding, which tastes more like a chopped-up slice of dry cake. Bread pudding is an appellation being applied much too liberally of late, and it’s past time for a standards and practice board of some kind. That board would definitely issue Buttermilk a citation, accompanied by a hefty fine. You’re better off with the made-to-order, warm, crunchy apple cider doughnuts, but you’re best off with — you’ll never guess! — the pecan pie sundae. It’s audaciously true to its name, a treat that might have been invented by a toddler who smashed up his slice of pie and stuffed it into a tall glass with butter pecan ice cream. If that sounds haphazard and heedless, rest assured that the ice cream is local, from Brooklyn’s own Blue Marble. Buttermilk Channel has its pride, after all.

345,Corton,3 star,"Dec. 9, 2008",Frank Bruni,TriBeCa,"French, New American",https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/dining/reviews/10rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/dining/reviews/10rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ABOUT a third of the way into a recent meal at the refined, quietly elegant new TriBeCa restaurant Corton, something wholly surprising  — and altogether wonderful  — happened. I forgot about my food. I don’t exactly mean “forgot.” I was aware of what I was eating: juicy, sweet scallops with a sea urchin cream that showed a different side of the sea to beautifully complementary effect; sweetbread nuggets suitable for a master class on the ideal texture for these delicacies, best when neither too crunchy nor mushy. But to appreciate these dishes fully I didn’t need to conduct a mental inventory of their disparate ingredients, marvel over technique or puzzle over an  unlikely flavor combination on the precipice of foolishness. I could just let them wash over me. The pleasure they principally engineered was sensual  — and easy. And that surprised me because they were the work of Paul Liebrandt. Mr. Liebrandt, 32, is the kitchen prankster who did eel with crystallized violets at Atlas and, at Gilt, executed a menu that affirmed his talent but brought his judgment into question. He sometimes indulged eccentricity for its own sake or set off an exhausting surfeit of fireworks. At Corton he calms down and wises up, accepting that an evening in a restaurant shouldn’t be like a visit to a fringe art gallery: geared to the intellect, reliant on provocation. It needn’t demand raptness. And it must, in the course of whatever else it means to accomplish, leave a person eager for the next bite and intent on the one after that. In fact the best appetizer I had at Corton was an essentially classic, relatively straightforward torchon of foie gras. Yes, Mr. Liebrandt gave the torchon a distinctive beet and hibiscus glaze that left the circle of it before me with a ruby aureole. But in the end it was the creamy, sublimely prepared foie that got me and my companions. And the triumphant glory of a beef entree wasn’t any flamboyant embellishment but rather the richest, most tender and most flavorful fillet I’ve had in recent memory. Mr. Liebrandt’s benefactor and partner in this project is the restaurateur Drew Nieporent, who may well have something to do with the chef’s newfound restraint. Mr. Nieporent’s other restaurants include Nobu, Centrico and the Tribeca Grill, and used to include Montrachet, whose space Corton inherited and refashioned. He isn’t the type to let self-conscious artistry overtake good sense. And while he no doubt intended to head in a less bluntly and less broadly crowd-pleasing direction by teaming with Mr. Liebrandt, he obviously had some indication that Mr. Liebrandt was willing to play nice. At Corton Mr. Liebrandt finds the sweet spot between disciplined cooking and intricate, imaginative leaps. Intricacy and imagination are still there: in a simultaneously ethereal and earthy “risotto” that floats a white cloud of salt cod foam over a dark terrain of black trumpet mushrooms and riso pasta; in an “olive sponge” canapé  both lighter in weight and more intense in olive flavor than the laws of physics and gastronomy would seem to permit; in a seaweed butter, served with the  bread, that called to mind caviar in a whole new guise. And Mr. Liebrandt’s version of a seasonal salad breaks down to more than a dozen vegetables and fruits prepared in nearly as many ways. Parsley root is puréed, kabocha squash braised, baby brussels sprouts sautéed in browned butter, eggplant roasted, quince poached in white wine  —  and so on and so forth. But these exertions aren’t obvious or showy. They’re a generous attempt to orchestrate a varied medley of tastes both more and less familiar. And while dish after dish has subtle nuances or an inspired finishing touch, each succeeds primarily for simpler, more basic reasons: the happy marriage of squab, bacon and a chestnut cream in an entree that further reflects the premium Mr. Liebrandt places on the seasons; the exquisite moistness of butter-poached turbot in the center of an artful composition with many visual and textural fillips, all quietly beguiling, none disruptive. Corton is for the most part superb, and joins the constantly improving Eleven Madison Park as a restaurant hovering just below the very summit of fine dining in New York. It’s almost heroically less expensive than the legends on that peak. For at least two stages of canapés, three courses and some of the city’s finest petits fours, it charges $76, an out-and-out deal in light of its high standards. And its majestic French wine list includes a special section for bottles between $32 and $55. But Corton  —  named, like Montrachet, for a prized Burgundy  —   does have shortcomings. Chicken for two on a menu as succinct as this restaurant’s needs bigger payoffs than the brown bread jus and dark-meat croquettes that seemed to be this bird’s bids for glory. The Parmesan custard, pickled chanterelles and other effects in a peekytoe crab appetizer muscled the crab out of the picture. And among the generally lovely, finely wrought desserts by the pastry chef, Robert Truitt, only one rose all the way to the level of Mr. Liebrandt’s best entrees. Labeled a caramel brioche, it combined a sort of exalted French toast, banana, passion fruit and Stilton cheese to make something buttery, sweet, salty and wholly original. More than a few diners will be turned off by the pale-hued, pared-down room, especially if their sight lines don’t include the wine bottles around the entrance or a long, squat window with a teasing, effectively curiosity-piquing peak into the kitchen. The room’s white-on-white patterned walls and slender contemporary lighting fixtures make for  a beauty so  austere it verges on  sterile. One companion said he felt as if he were dining in the cafeteria of the Fortress of Solitude. But Corton’s accomplishments warrant more attention and give it a fighting chance, in a difficult economy, of success. Mr. Liebrandt deserves that, because he’s pulled off his most meaningful trick yet: a place where it’s a joy to eat.

346,Market Table,2 star,"Nov. 11, 2008",Frank Bruni,West Village,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/12/dining/reviews/12rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/12/dining/reviews/12rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"WE’RE all watching, all worrying, those of us who love restaurants and believe that the world is better off with more of them. How many will fail, and how quickly? Are the signs of a culinary slowdown already upon us? I look around an ambitious new Asian restaurant on the Upper West Side, note that only a third of the tables are occupied, and wonder: Is this because it’s Sunday night? Or because it’s the fall of 2008, a season for scrimping and hoarding? I look around an ambitious new French restaurant in TriBeCa. It has all the right ingredients for a buzzy, mobbed debut, but there are empty seats at a time when there shouldn’t be. Are the managers not booking the room entirely, so that the kitchen can adjust gradually to a full house? Or are dwindling expense accounts to blame? Then I look around Market Table, in Greenwich Village. It’s business as usual, which means brisk business, happy business, a reliable hum of robust conversation, an air of conviviality unpolluted by economic angst. In this restaurant’s second year, as in its first, on almost any night of the week, there’s not a perch to spare, at least not between 7:30 and 10:30 p.m. The cooks in the open kitchen work frantically, churning out starters of beet salad and sides of acorn squash and main courses of crisp-skinned roasted chicken, because who doesn’t love roasted chicken? If you want to know which restaurants are most likely to sail through these  straits, your answer is here. And it is, indeed, something of a cliché. What makes Market Table work are precisely those attributes supposedly prized most in anxious times. What makes it special is how expertly it embodies them. It’s warm. When you walk in you’re greeted expansively and made to feel that the restaurant is privileged to have you, not that you’re privileged to have it. It’s soothing. At night the votive candles on every table flicker like torches in a village without power: vital points of reference, and pretty much the only way to see. It’s humble. If diners want their seared scallops and their hanger steak, then Market Table will oblige, though it will find small, clever ways to distinguish itself in the process. The steak, marinated in sangria to tender effect, shares a plate with grilled romaine that’s dressed in the fashion of a Caesar, only what look like big croutons turn out to be diced potato. It’s unambiguous. Intent on big flavors and payoffs, it adds both goat cheese and a horseradish cream to the beets. It blasts Arctic char — whose skin is even crisper and more reflective of an ace kitchen than the chicken’s  — with cream and crunchy slivers of fried onion. It blasts cauliflower with capers and anchovy. There’s bacon with the skate wing and bacon with the brussels sprouts and pancetta with pork loin: pig upon pig. It’s generous. Many entrees have a bonus they could get by without. The root vegetable risotto beneath roasted halibut isn’t just faultlessly prepared; it’s like a dish within the dish, and an only slightly bigger serving could justifiably get its own billing. With grilled lamb chops comes something that visually resembles polenta but isn’t as easily diagnosed. It’s a Gouda-potato fondue, and it’s terrific. Market Table’s roots are in the smart, populist Jimmy Bradley-Danny Abrams school of unceremoniously fine dining, from which it has taken instruction and staff members. It’s the progeny in particular of the Little Owl, and might well be considered the Medium-size Owl, somewhat less consistent but also less cramped, with a prime corner location (the former site of Shopsin’s) that gives it enormous windows facing two directions. They’re like movie screens onto which Village life is projected. It started out as part store, part restaurant, its front room stocked with high-end groceries. That was a hot trend for five minutes 15 months ago, but the hankering for more seats at Market Table was immediate and intense, so last summer  it  eliminated the store to create 18 of them. It can now accommodate 60 diners. The kitchen — run by the chef Mikey Price, a principal owner along with the chef Joey Campanaro — has adjusted just fine. Prices, inevitably, have gone up. On a recent menu the median entree was $27. But that’s a fair deal, considering the portions. One  slice of “Grammy’s apple cake” could easily satisfy two people. One bowl of the pumpkin pudding could almost feed three. And the wine list has many bottles for $50 or less. This sort of restaurant — a comfy wool blanket, emphasizing good sense over high style — doesn’t have more intrinsic merit than an acrobatic dazzler or idiosyncratic pioneer. But with winter looming in more ways than one, it has a logic and an appeal that are potent. Durable, too. Market Table ** 54 Carmine Street (Bedford Street), Greenwich Village ; (212) 255-2100.

347,Bobo,1 star,"Nov. 5, 2008",Frank Bruni,West Village,"American, New American",https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/dining/reviews/05rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/05/dining/reviews/05rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"BOBO was like the new kid who showed up on the first day of school in perfectly torn jeans, with a perfectly cocked hip and perfect confidence that the right pose and prettiness were all it took to get by. Bobo was aloof. It didn’t bother with a sign outside its subterranean front door, an easily overlooked portal to two floors of a century-old town house with exposed brick, an antique piano and hexagonal bookshelves filled with Bellow and bric-a-brac. Admirers would find their way. Insiders would get the word. Bobo was self-impressed. How else to interpret its affected groaner of a name? If you asked what it meant, you were told that it was shorthand for the confluence of bohemian spirit and bourgeois success. And you winced, especially if you learned as well that the restaurant’s owner, Carlos Suarez, had dubbed its energy-efficient, recycling-sensitive ethos “coco,” for “collective conscious.” With food that yo-yoed between so-so and no-no, Bobo wasn’t earning the right to this much semantic cuteness, which it seemed to be bungling to boot. Conscious or conscience? You had to wonder. And you had to pause when the phone was answered “Bobo residence,” as it often was, and debate whether to make a reservation or, in the spirit of playing along, ask for Mrs. Bobo, making clear that Mr. Bobo would do in a pinch. But beneath all that nonsense, it turned out,  was a restaurant that cared about more than buzz and size 0 regulars  — that wanted, and was willing to work for, respect. Before it was four months old, Mr. Suarez dismissed his first, poorly reviewed executive chef and got a new one. Seven months after that, he nudged that new chef aside to make room for a culinary star in Boston who was willing to make a move to Manhattan. That star, Patrick Connolly, from the restaurant Radius, has been in charge since mid-August. And he’s given Bobo  something more than its looks to be vain about. In fact a few of his dishes  —  his appetizers, at least  — manage to steal attention from the votive candles lining the dark, narrow  staircase up to the main dining room and that room’s droopy lighting fixtures, which bring to mind gargantuan glass jellyfish. The Maine crab, for example. Mr. Connolly compensates for how wispy and insubstantial strands of sweet, delicate crab meat can be by stacking them into what looks like a cupcake,  and more or less icing it with cashew butter, which does the unctuous work that another chef might assign, less imaginatively, to avocado. Fried capers cut the richness. Avocado makes its predictable appearance with raw ruby-colored tuna, but even in this safest of starters Mr. Connolly shows some creativity. Each wedge of ahi tuna is on its own thick, crisp cucumber slice, the avocado a subtle purée between them. On top of the tuna, snapping everything to life, are sprigs of cilantro. The pork belly also stands out, another appetizer staple given a treatment that’s not routine. The belly, cut into strips, is interlaced with similar size strips of crackling, which just barely crest the surface of a lemon grass broth. With its citrusy spark, the broth makes an appealing foil for the fatty pork. All of these dishes demonstrate Mr. Connolly’s fine sense of balance when it comes to flavors and textures. The capers, cracklings and cucumbers all take what could approximate baby food and require you to bring some teeth to the party. And the tuna and pork appetizers speak to Mr. Connolly’s fondness for Asian inflections, an affinity that distinguishes his Bobo from the Bobo of his predecessors, who gave it a more steadfastly Mediterranean personality. But what carries over from previous incarnations of Bobo is a sense of caution, a feeling that the menu is driven too much by what diners on automatic pilot expect and too little by real inspiration. Sea trout (standing in for salmon), monkfish, chicken breast, a pork chop, a rib-eye: the array of entrees is entirely unsurprising. The cooking during my visits was often impressive, epitomized by the tenderness of that chicken breast  — served in thick petals with artichokes, mushrooms and a garlic and parsley sauce  — and by the crunchy-gooey contrast between the outside and inside of breaded, deep-fried veal sweetbreads, a preparation reminiscent of the restaurant Prune’s but even better. But seared daurade, served with ginger butter in a miso consommé, was slightly overdone, as was the pork chop one of the two times I tried it. And a gnocchi entree, arrestingly large in portion, was arrestingly bland in taste, its claims of sage and Parmesan notwithstanding. Bobo had some consistency problems that didn’t go away with dessert. One night the pumpkin mousse was cold and hard, as if it were a semifreddo that had been mislabeled on the menu. On a subsequent night it was creamy, silky: the mousse it had pledged to be. The best dessert was the yogurt and mascarpone “cheesecake,” presented in the manner not of a cake but of a custard, with a Concord grape glaze on top and, buried within, fried salted pumpkin seeds. At Bobo there’s thought and ambition and there are good intentions, reflected in a list of special cocktails less hackneyed than many others and evident in a less expensive “den menu” developed for the tables around the long bar on the lower of the two comely levels. But Bobo hasn’t wholly surrendered its attitude and put service before sheen. Interested in a red Burgundy, I ordered one for $69, well below the average for  bottles on Bobo’s excessively expensive wine list. The server said the restaurant was out of it, but offered to suggest another. “Let me guess,” I said, and pointed to a $62 bottle, the only similarly priced Burgundy. No, he said, explaining the restaurant was out of that, too. But “for a few dollars more,” he said, an even lovelier Burgundy could be ours. It cost $115. And Bobo didn’t do what another restaurant might have and offer, in light of the unavailability of cheaper Burgundies, to reduce that amount. Maybe the right kind of diner doesn’t sweat a price difference like that.   But at times like this, I found myself wishing that Bobo was a little less bourgeois and a little more bohemian.

348,Kanoyama,1 star,"Oct. 29, 2008",Frank Bruni,East Village,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/dining/reviews/29rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/29/dining/reviews/29rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I LOVE sushi for its straightforwardness and ease: one big bite; a few clear and clean flavors; nothing too florid, nothing too brash. I love it for its texture, at once firm and pliant, giving you something to chew if that’s your game, something that can almost be swallowed whole if you like. I love the combined silkiness and meatiness of some of it, the connotations of luxury in that. I love its completeness: protein and starch nestled together, with just a little something extra  — wasabi, shiso  — for spark. I love its light impact. It can fill you, but not with guilt. What I don’t love is the check. Sushi doesn’t come cheap, not if you insist on a modicum of quality, and not if you want to savor it in a setting with more aesthetic appeal than a Port Authority waiting area. Kanoyama, in the East Village, and Sushi Azabu, in TriBeCa, stand out in part because they’re navigable in ways that aren’t too financially wounding. They’re not low-end restaurants, not even close, and if you go at them full-bore, not examining their menus with an eye toward cost, you’ll pay dearly. But Kanoyama, a favorite of sushi savants for a while now, and Sushi Azabu, which opened this year, also present what might well qualify, within the economically skewed context of raw fish, as bargains. Kanoyama’s brimming, glistening combination platters  — labeled “sushi for 2” or “sushi & sashimi for 3” or other such permutations  — greatly reduce the $4 to $7 per piece that it (and many other restaurants) charges for most of its à la carte sushi. The fish it puts on these platters is first-rate, and doesn’t give you the sense you sometimes get at other restaurants that what you’re saving in money you’re sacrificing in freshness. At Sushi Azabu the fish wasn’t as uniformly impressive, but it was hardly run-of-the-mill. And about 10 kinds of it appeared in the $65 prix fixe  that  spanned half a dozen courses, with sushi and sashimi at their center. Beyond those relative bargains, both restaurants have virtues that recommend them in a crowded sushi marketplace. Sushi Azabu’s sublime setting is one of them. Sushi Azabu is a hidden restaurant, in the manner of Freemans and La Esquina. These hideaways are always catnip for ever-competitive New Yorkers, who relish inside tips and inside tracks that friends and colleagues don’t have. It’s unmarked, of course. To find it you enter an unremarkable-looking multi-ethnic  restaurant named the Greenwich Grill, tell the host just inside that you’re sushi-bound, and then wait for a server communicating with unseen co-conspirators via a headset to escort you to a staircase off the Greenwich Grill’s dining room. Down the steps you go to a dark subterranean lair  with a blond wood sushi bar, three enormous circular booths, a pebbled floor that makes you feel unsteady as you walk across it and a ceiling of tightly clustered, rounded pipes of bamboo. Like most Japanese restaurants of its kind, Sushi Azabu has a menu of composed cold and warm dishes in addition to à la carte sushi and sashimi and rolls. There are also omakase (chef’s tasting) options of varying lengths and prices. The one I tried supplemented sushi and sashimi  — some of it superb, some sadly ordinary  — with such dishes as a rich, gooey chawan mushi, which is a traditional steamed egg custard studded with ginkgo nuts, and a rubbery, dry miso black cod. This restaurant is erratic. Get the scallop sushi or the spicy tuna roll, lavished with sesame and a chili-spiked mayonnaise, and you’re in heaven. Get the crispy fried squid and you’re in a strip-mall sports bar. But the gracious servers and graceful sushi chefs almost outnumber the diners on some nights. It’s that kind of coddling that makes the $65 prix fixe more than reasonable. Service is Kanoyama’s great shortcoming, with comfort coming in second. Whether I was doing omakase at the cramped counter or a combination platter at one of the cramped tables, I too often experienced long waits for food, and the servers toting it  frequently seemed confused. Kanoyama’s vast, something-for-everyone menu has such stock items as chicken and salmon teriyaki, but it also has red snapper head and blowfish tempura. During a recent omakase meal, I was given  tiny baby sea trout, which were fried whole, and puffy, crunchy fried bits of tilefish, to be dragged through sesame seeds and salt, that could have been marketed as the cracklings of the sea. The breadth of this restaurant’s  fish selection is thrilling  — adventurous eaters will be happier here than at Sushi Azabu. Its sushi chefs know their stuff. The golden eye snapper, pike mackerel, jackfish, bonito and sweet white shrimp in an omakase meal were seasoned to perfection, with scallions, yuzu and wasabi all weighing in at the right moments in the right measures. If you take the omakase route, be sure to tell the chefs to stop at a dozen pieces, unless you’re O.K. with spending $100 or more a person. Many pieces cost $7 to $9. That underscores what a blessing Kanoyama’s combination platters are. A friend and I ordered sushi and sashimi for two, and I counted more than a dozen servings of sushi or sashimi for each of us, including fatty tuna, sweet eel and fluke. It cost $58, or $29 a person. For that price I can love sushi the way I really want to  — frequently.",
349,Candle 79,1 star,"Oct. 14, 2008",Frank Bruni,Upper East Side,"American, Vegan",https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/dining/reviews/15rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/15/dining/reviews/15rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"FOR all their talk about the health benefits, eco-friendliness and karmic sensitivity of their leafy ways, I’m convinced that many vegans are antsy about what they’re missing. I say this, admittedly, without benefit of any psychological data or a wide circle of vegan acquaintances. I say this on account of the menus. There are almost always some dishes defined in terms of meat, with the implicit assurance that they’re uncanny mimics of it. At the vegan restaurant Angelica Kitchen, in the East Village, there’s a Reuben sandwich bereft of corned beef and Swiss cheese, which sort of makes you wonder why it doesn’t just take a different name, like an Irving or a Bernard. Pure Food and Wine, on Irving Place, presents ceviche sans fish, not to mention cheeses without animal input. (Nuts fill in.) It also has a nominal burger, as does Zen Palate, where the tags hung on appetizers and entrees go so far as to prophesize extra-terrestrial ecstasy: “celestial tofu,” “shredded heaven,” “eggplant Zentastic.” Organic, orgasmic — it’s all the same. Candle 79, one of New York’s most ambitious vegan restaurants, takes a similar tack. On its menu there’s paella with smoked sausage and a piccata (à la veal or chicken) and, of course, a burger. There’s even ice cream for dessert. I’m here to tell you that all of that is a lie, or at least a consoling little fib; the sausage is made of wheat gluten, the burger of beans and brown rice, and the ice cream is entirely cream-less. I’m also here to tell you that all of that — well, all except the burger — is pleasurable and largely satisfying, leaving an omnivorous interloper with a sense not of deprivation but of relief. Can an experience this meatless really be this painless? If you hit Candle 79’s best dishes — which means bypassing that burger — it can. And it unfolds in a comfortable two-story town house on East 79th Street with many booths, a long banquette upstairs and a general air of relaxation that’s in sync with the low-impact cuisine. After a series of recent meals here, I’m not ready to relinquish my Roquefort or swear off sirloins: I’m just not that virtuous. But I’ll admit that I, like most of my restaurant-critic kin, haven’t given vegan cuisine its due. Candle 79, which has prospered for five years without benefit of major reviews, showed me the light, or maybe I should say lite. A vegan diet, for the less nutritionally erudite out there, bars not just flesh but the bequests of anything fleshy: eggs, dairy. It’s vegetarianism for real sticklers, a blessing to the colon but a hurdle for any hedonistic cook. Although tofu and coconut milk are lovely ingredients, they’re not about to usurp the traditional components of custard. Although a cashew cheese has its (modest) charms, it won’t have Brie running scared any time soon. But Candle 79 takes a limited larder and stages an impressive show, reminding the pork-stuffed, duck-spoiled diner how much else is out there, and how much of it has never relied on animals or fish in the first place. Hummus doesn’t, and Candle 79’s excellent recipe for it includes a generous measure of smoked paprika. The tawny, creamy (figuratively) spread comes with grilled paratha bread and olives, more than half a dozen of them, fat and green and irresistible. Candle 79’s guacamole timbale, a round mold supplemented with black beans, would do any Mexican place proud. The restaurant gets top-notch produce from top-tier farms, and it’s lavish with a laudable array of mushrooms used in a variety of ways. In one appealing appetizer there were grilled trumpet royale mushrooms, served with crispy onion rings. In another there were fried oyster mushrooms. Candle 79 leaves no part of the garden untouched, no patch of the forest unplumbed. As for that wheat gluten, it’s called seitan and it indeed does an honorable impersonation of meat when massaged into the form of a cutlet, as it was in an entree of seitan piccata, vibrant with lemon and salty with capers, which are what a piccata is really all about. Chicken and veal needn’t come to the party. It’s only slightly less festive without them. Spiced thoroughly enough, seitan can sub effectively for sausage, as it did in the paella, which traded shellfish for summer corn and found all the additional flavor it needed in a saffron and red pepper sauce. But seitan didn’t work as well as skewered kebabs with a chimichurri sauce. The kebabs weren’t thick enough to create as chewy a mass as they seemed meant to, and they lacked seasoning. Lamb would do better at this party, which is something of a bust without it. That’s the drawback of a vegan menu: for a meat eater, such comparisons are inevitable, and they’re encouraged by the meaty nomenclature. And across a meal at Candle 79, there can be considerable redundancy and some monotony. In late summer I had more corn and tomatoes coming at me than I had the appetite for. A chickpea cake entree represented a few chickpeas too many. Some ideas don’t pan out. The burger didn’t hold together — it was more a sloppy Joe, or messy Jim — though it had a clever touch. The bottom side of the top half of the bun had been partially hollowed out, so that the loose patty could rise into it rather than being squeezed out the sides when you grabbed hold of the sandwich. The cashew cheese and cashew sour cream with zucchini enchiladas didn’t banish longings for dairy, and the crust on a peach and apple pie was a bland, mushy disappointment. But cinnamon ice cream could have been the real thing, and a chocolate and peanut butter dessert — recently replaced by a chocolate, almond and coconut one — could have passed muster in a less restrictive restaurant. There are interesting wines and beers, priced reasonably, as is the food. Servers communicate genuine enthusiasm. I can’t speak to their diets away from Candle 79, but they seem sold on the regimen that it and a nearby sibling restaurant, Candle Cafe, adhere to. That regimen has its rigors, but it’s not without its rewards.",
350,Socarrat Paella Bar,1 star,"Oct. 7, 2008",Frank Bruni,Chelsea,Spanish,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/dining/reviews/08rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/08/dining/reviews/08rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IN addition to such usual talents as nimble wine pouring and patient order coaching, the servers at Socarrat Paella Bar have to possess a gift for shoveling. Much of their evening is devoted to that task. Here’s one of them now, hovering over my shoulder and my paella, telling me that I’m missing the best rice, the ever-so-slightly burned  rice, those crunchy, sticky grains at the bottom of the pan that won’t be pried loose with any lazy little flick of the wrist. “Work the spoon like this,” the server admonishes, wresting the oversize metal utensil from me, then pushing it down and scrape-scrape-scraping until, lo and behold, a final, reluctant layer is released, then transported to my dinner plate. I feel humbled. Then again I feel jubilant: there’s more to eat than I had counted on. And it is the most rewarding part, with nutty, toasty nuances. It’s so distinctive there’s a word for it. What I’m enjoying is called the socarrat, and it’s definitely adding to my enjoyment of Socarrat (so-kah-RAT). Physically, this isn’t much of a restaurant. The presence of the word bar in its name reflects something other than a slavish observance of trends. (Bar Boulud, Bar Blanc, Bar Q  — need I go on?) It’s a clue that this is a tiny space with an unconventional seating arrangement. All 24 perches are stools, all but 4  of them at a two-sided communal table, long and narrow as a bowling lane, that runs from the front of the room to the back. The table has a dark reflective surface, and the walls nearby are adorned with oil paintings, framed mirrors, Mason jars and a network of quaint cabinets with handsome latches. There’s plenty that’s pretty to catch the eye. Just don’t expect any privacy for your conversation. And know that you may well get bumped by a fellow diner shimmying toward or away from his or her own paella. With that last sentence I’m making an ordering assumption, but I think it’s a safe one. Socarrat Paella Bar is, fittingly, all about paella. It has a menu of some 20 tapas as well, but they’re not under the spotlight, and don’t really deserve to be. The paellas do. There are eight kinds, and in aggregate they dispel many a paella misconception. Seafood needn’t be a part of paella, and may not have been at the very dawn of the dish. In fact, Socarrat’s paella Valenciana, named for the Spanish region most closely associated with paella, has only turf and no surf: pork rib, rabbit and snails. Rabbit and snail have as rightful a place in paella as shrimp or mussels. According to some of my research, they got to paella first. But shrimp and mussels made their own paella inroads, and they’re present at Socarrat in an all-seafood paella and in the house paella, which takes from land and sea in almost equal measure, using chicken and beef as well. It also has fava beans. Many of the paellas at Socarrat include something green: maybe favas, maybe peas, maybe asparagus. There’s a vegetarian paella.  There’s a paella made with squid ink, which turns the rice black. And I haven’t even gotten to my two favorites. One is a meat paella (pork, chicken, duck) in which a mushroom soffrito contributes an earthy kick and thick coins of chorizo a spicy one. The other is fideua (fee-day-WAH),   which will confound the paella neophyte, because it dispenses with rice. Thin, crisp strands of pasta take the rice’s place. They’re like a much softer, supple version of a Chinese noodle basket, cradling shrimp and cuttlefish and mussels, and they yield an irresistible socarrat of their own, more pronounced than the rice’s. These aren’t perfect paellas, not nearly. Sometimes the meat or seafood is overcooked. But they’re better than the paellas at many other Spanish restaurants in New York, where paella doesn’t always fare so well. The rice above that blissful ultimate layer isn’t the least bit dry, and it’s thoroughly infused with oil, with seasonings, with the flavor of whatever’s around it. Socarrat’s tapas, intended as a prelude to paella, aren’t as impressive. Most are straightforward  — gazpacho, house-made potato chips, fried artichokes, potato and egg omelet, squid à la plancha  — and only a few stand out. I’m partial to the shrimp sizzling in a garlicky olive oil with a heady perfume, and to the Cabrales croquetas, but then I’m a sucker for blue cheese. There are additional limitations to this restaurant, run by Jesús Lolo Manso, who is also the chef-owner of La Nacional. Socarrat  doesn’t take reservations, and has nowhere for the people angling for a stool to wait. They stand on the sidewalk. Occasionally they pop their heads in, making you feel that you’re on a paella stopwatch, filling you with paella guilt. The restaurant’s wine list encompasses just two dozen reds, whites and sherries  and there’s no hard liquor. But there are also unexpected highlights, like a fruity red sangria that isn’t too sweet. For a restaurant this small there’s a respectable selection of a half-dozen desserts, including a wonderful Catalan cheesecake of sorts that’s served, like a custard, in a round crock. And paella is such a worthy undertaking that any place doing it as well as Socarrat deserves note for that reason alone. The paellas are sized for two people or more, and their prices  — $21 to $23 a person, depending on the kind  — strike me as reasonable. The broad, shallow,  black cast iron pans in which they’re cooked are put on pedestals in the center of the table, and at the height of the dinner hour, they form a line stretching deep into the restaurant. It’s a glorious sight. And it’s accompanied by a glorious sound, the clanking and scratching of all the long spoons against all those pans. Servers look to see who’s making a mess of this work. Then they swoop in to help, doing the most important digging themselves.

351,Delicatessen,1 star,"Sept. 23, 2008",Frank Bruni,Nolita,"American, Diners",https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THOSE of us in the restaurant criticism business, if it can be called that, tend to throw around words like genius and inspiration only when traversing the starrier realms of our universe, only when quivering over Per Se’s “oysters and pearls” or gee-whizzing over the latest novelty from the WD-50 laboratory. We downplay the downscale, but let’s remedy that right now. Let’s pause to praise an invention of the new restaurant Delicatessen, whose audience isn’t so much grizzled epicures sniffing out luxurious treasures as it is frazzled night crawlers looking for foodstuffs that double as alcohol sponges. This invention is called the cheeseburger spring roll, and it’s just that: a spring roll with the makings (ground beef, melted American) of a cheeseburger inside, or rather four such spring rolls, because that’s how many come per order, nestled in their look-how-plain-and-functional-I-am metal pail and ready to be dipped in the ketchup nearby. And the point of them, the brilliance of them, isn’t how they taste, which is sort of vacuously oily, crunchy and beefy, truth be told. It’s the name, the idea, the tidy wedding of classic diner staple and trendy Asian canapé. They promise comfort with a bit of spin and a dash of international sophistication, comfort with a cheeky tweak. And in doing so they crystallize the appeal of this seriously mediocre but ingeniously conceived restaurant, a delicatessen that’s not really a delicatessen, in the same way that its forebear, Cafeteria, isn’t really a cafeteria. Both are calorie-laden, fry-happy, reliably mobbed feeding grounds for young diners who want a sleek theater, a fashionable crowd and permission from the style gods for messy eating. A knowing 25-year-old I toted with me for brunch at Delicatessen explained it best. As she washed down a Reuben fritter (Swiss cheese, sauerkraut and corned beef inside a densely battered shell) with a bloody mary, I asked her to play the Margaret Mead of downtown meatloaf, which Delicatessen and Cafeteria both serve. “Sometimes,” she said, “you need a greasy spoon, but without the grease-splattered booths.” I nodded, then motioned toward and arched my eyebrow at a man straddling a nearby stool. From the ankles up he was dressed one way: dark slacks, dark pinstriped jacket. On his feet: pink-and-orange flip-flops. “Easy,” she said. “He was out all night. He hasn’t been to bed. He got home, kicked off his shoes, decided he was hungry and put on the flip-flops that were right by the door to head back out. I’ve been there.” Cafeteria, in Chelsea, and Delicatessen, at the nexus of NoLIta and SoHo, don’t have precisely the same lineup of owners, but there’s overlap, and a shared sensibility. Before Delicatessen’s cheeseburger spring rolls came Cafeteria’s macaroni-and-cheese spring rolls: similar impulse, more carbs, more of a stretch and therefore less of an accomplishment. Both are open into the wee hours and compassionately priced, two smart ways in which they market themselves to, and win the loyalty of, their intended demographic. Both are mentioned in the right style-conscious magazines. They have clean, uncluttered, almost monochromatic looks to go with their archly prosaic names, and they have long exterior walls that open to the sidewalk  — and to all the pedestrian traffic on it  — in warm weather. There’s people watching within, and people watching without. Delicatessen’s particular gimmick, manifest across some but not most of its menu, is to present what Katz’s and Carnegie do, but under dimmer lighting, with throbbing music and with occasional improvisations. While the pastrami on rye is pastrami on rye and the chopped liver exactly that, the Reuben is reborn as finger food, with the Russian dressing as a dipping sauce, and matzo ball soup has several small balls instead of a big one, along with chunks of chicken and a bevy of fresh dill. In a “blintz trio,” one is filled with banana and Nutella, another with sweet corn and ricotta. These dishes are joined by all-purpose crowd pleasers (Caesar salad, Cobb, grilled lamb chops, Belgian waffles), hearty gut busters (pork schnitzel, buttermilk fried chicken, fish and chips) and desserts that go for gooey abandon. The Delicatessen version of s’mores involves marshmallows crusted with panko and graham cracker crumbs. They’re for dunking in chocolate sauce and  — what do you know? — they’re fried. You get the sense that if you sat still for too long, some kitchen hand might come along and fry you, too. Many of these dishes are clever, but their execution is usually matter of fact and sometimes quite sloppy, with few exceptions, notably the fried chicken, crunchy and juicy. The pastrami was unusually dry, which gave it something in common with the rye bread that sandwiched it. A dish of short ribs stroganoff was blandly seasoned, too heavy on the egg noodle and too light on the short rib. As for service, there were frustrating waits: for a reserved table to be freed up; for a drinks order to be taken; for the drinks to arrive; for a glass of grüner veltliner that hadn’t been requested to be replaced by the chardonnay that had; for an appetizer order to be taken. How to pass the time? During dinner I enjoyed watching the Delicatessen pirouette, a 360-degree spin some patrons perform on the way to their seats, allowing them to appraise the room fully and be fully appraised by it. During brunch  — when, in fact, service was fleet  — I enjoyed grilling my meatloaf anthropologist, along with one of her friends. They had already been to Delicatessen, in its first five weeks, because they had read that it was affiliated with Cafeteria, a onetime “Sex and the City” backdrop that serves Angus sliders and a Buffalo chicken sandwich, even at 4 a.m. And they had heard about Delicatessen’s cheeseburger spring rolls. Cheeseburger spring rolls! “How can you not want to try one?” one of them said to me, and I was stumped. Until you discover how overdone the meat is,  and how indistinct the cheese, how could you not? “But did you like them?” I asked. “Yeah, sure,” one of them said, and then they turned back to the more pressing matter of the hostess’s short, spiky haircut, and how her pink cable-stitch sweater didn’t go with it.

352,James,1 star,"Sept. 16, 2008",Frank Bruni,Prospect Heights,"American, European",https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/dining/reviews/17rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/17/dining/reviews/17rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"MANY people have had an indirect hand in the small, sweet new restaurant James, starting with James Calvert, for whom it’s named. A great-grandfather of the restaurant’s chef, Bryan Calvert, he too made his living as a cook in New York, setting an example, showing the way. The list goes on to include  the writer Susan Sontag, who died in 2004, and the photographer Annie Leibovitz. Bryan Calvert worked as their personal chef at their country house upstate, where he tried to satisfy both Ms. Leibovitz’s desire for farm-fresh, unembellished fare and Ms. Sontag’s affinity for French flair. The menu at James balances the two. But I like to think that we owe James to Britney Spears above all others. Through his affiliation with Ms. Leibovitz, Mr. Calvert occasionally catered celebrity photo shoots, and he still vividly recalls a session involving the onetime priestess of teen pop. He said he unveiled the usual bountiful spread, only to be informed that Ms. Spears ate nothing but BLT sandwiches for lunch. So he hustled back into the kitchen and re-emerged with a stack of these, only to be told that he’d erred anew. He’d used mayonnaise. That wasn’t how she liked her BLTs, and that  wasn’t how she was going to eat them. Is it any wonder that he retreated to the everyday agita of the restaurant business, where the customer is perhaps always right but the customer seldom has an eccentric  nutrition regimen and an entourage on guard against rogue condiments? James, tucked among residential buildings in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, is the kind of modest, warm refuge produced by a chef who wants to simplify things, to personalize things, to work on a scale that doesn’t require or invite the meddling of too many outsiders. Mr. Calvert owns and manages it with his wife, Deborah Williamson. They live in the apartment smack above the space it inhabits, which used to belong to  Restaurant Sorrel. When Sorrel went out of business they pounced, recognizing an easy commute when they saw one. For the renovations they didn’t hire decorators. They themselves decided to reclaim the pressed tin ceiling that had been obscured. They chose the chocolate color of the banquette against the white brick wall opposite the long bar. They picked out the 16-armed translucent lighting fixture in the center of the room. And they didn’t reach to consultants for help with writing the succinct, appealing menu, which takes advantage of herbs they grow themselves in an outdoor garden adjacent to their apartment, on the roof of a garage next door. James is a Mom-and-Pop operation for the Alice Waters era, giving locavores sage, basil, oregano and rosemary they can feel especially virtuous about. It’s also an example of how quietly sophisticated the food at restaurants fashioned as affordable neighborhood bistros has become. No bigger, brasher restaurant around town served me an heirloom tomato salad this summer that I enjoyed any more than one at James. The tomatoes were bright and juicy and didn’t taste of the refrigerator, and the warm goat cheese fondue with them was a perfect tangy, creamy counterpoint. It marked the dish as the product of smart thinking and skilled execution, not just righteous purchasing. Locavore letdown alert: the tomatoes didn’t come from the couple’s limited garden. This is a densely populated section of Brooklyn we’re talking about, not Sunnybrook Farms. A spinach salad was similarly impressive. Could spinach salad sound less sexy, or more like an ascetic Midtown lunch on the go? I loved James’s. Each gorgeous, unblemished leaf was crisp and only lightly dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette, and shiitake mushrooms and Parmesan cheese made sure there was plenty of umami afoot. The salad had a deep, satisfying flavor. The seared scallops over a watercress purée in another appetizer and the grilled prawns over a sunchoke purée in yet another had been cooked with care and dressed up with restraint and sound judgment. Mr. Calvert’s time years ago in the kitchens at Bouley and at Union Pacific was well spent. For the most part he combines flavors sensibly, and he doesn’t lose sight of a dish’s centerpiece attraction. An entree of roasted chicken, brightened with lemon thyme, hit its mark  — crunchy skin, tender meat  — both times I had it. A roasted loin of lamb was even better, its powdery coat of pine nuts and rosemary enhancing the luscious meat without eclipsing it. And for a sweet finish both a chocolate ganache cake and a grilled lemon pound cake provided the uncomplicated pleasure I sought in this kind of setting, steering clear of the excessive fussiness of a few other desserts. James certainly has weak spots, inconsistencies, befuddlements. Mr. Calvert seems to be struggling to nail the rhubarb honey glaze with crispy sweetbreads: it was medicinal one time,  borderline cloying another.   His  fettuccine with shiitake  and Manchego was a dry,  bland heap of pasta crying out for something wet,  something more. The restaurant’s  brief wine list, while sensible, won’t wow anyone, though James  provides a full bar, which many restaurants like it don’t. And it mixes a few winning cocktails, including one with gin, St. Germain, lemon juice and fresh mint, often plucked from the garden nearby. Vice linking arms with virtue: that’s a partnership we can all surely toast. James * 605 Carlton Avenue (St. Marks Avenue), Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, (718) 942-4255.

353,Michael's,0.75 star,"Sept. 9, 2008",Frank Bruni,Midtown,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/10/dining/reviews/10rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/10/dining/reviews/10rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"UNTIL a recent dinner at Michael’s I thought California cuisine was about lightness and brightness, about not mucking up and weighing down the centerpiece ingredients of a dish. Then I had this restaurant’s jumbo shrimp appetizer. The shrimp were entombed in a dense, soggy beer batter and interred in an almost monochromatic landscape of goat cheese, puddles of dark miso aioli and shavings of summer truffle that might have been shavings of summer rubber for all the flavor they had. California cuisine? More like gloppy, affected pub grub, for which Michael’s charges $25. That’s what happens when a restaurant starts throwing truffles around, and that’s probably one reason this restaurant does it. Until that dinner I thought Michael’s prided itself on produce. Then I had its appetizer of peekytoe crab with spears of white asparagus, which might as well have been spears of white wax for all the flavor they had. As for the crab, its mushy texture and watery taste put me in mind of confetti after a rainstorm. If I were a peekytoe, I’d sue for slander. Dinner, granted, isn’t really the point of Michael’s. For that matter food is no longer the point of Michael’s, which functions primarily as a power lunch and power breakfast spot, a Midtown nexus of influence and affluence and fodder for Page Six. But Michael’s presents itself as a serious restaurant. It certainly charges like a serious restaurant, levying a tariff of $35 for a lunchtime burger that’s not Kobe and doesn’t ooze foie gras. So it should perform at the level of a serious restaurant. These days, it usually doesn’t. Across a series of visits I had some enjoyable food, notably the renowned Cobb salad, less a salad than an entire ecosystem, vast and verdant, with enough avocado to feed three I.C.M. agents or five Vogue editors. But I also had many more duds and disappointments that violated the very spirit of a restaurant originally cast as an ambassador of certain West Coast culinary values when it opened in Midtown 19 years ago. I had an overly vinegary tangle of sunflower sprouts, slightly dry cod, repellently chalky hamachi and a lobster dish that could have passed for a salt lick. I had a brown sugar shortcake that tasted more like dough than cake, as if it hadn’t spent nearly enough time in the oven. And I had unsatisfying wine counsel, one sommelier responding to my request for a non-oaky Chardonnay by suggesting I switch to Sancerre and another guiding me to a Chardonnay that was oaky. It’s not that the acclaimed chef Michael McCarty, who owns this restaurant, along with its southern California forbear, neglects it. He was there when I went for breakfast. He was there when I went for lunch and there when I went for dinner, not in chef’s whites but in street clothes or business dress. He roamed the dining rooms, which are pleasantly awash in natural light during the day, and pressed the flesh of the well-heeled regulars at the well-separated tables under all the eye-catching contemporary artwork. And his jolly, gregarious demeanor set a tone for service that was upbeat, solicitous and typically deft. To its credit Michael’s doesn’t exude the sort of attitude that sometimes characterizes restaurants this popular with entertainment-world luminaries and the media elite. But it also doesn’t muster anything close to the consistency that it should, given its lofty prices and respectable history. The original Michael’s opened in Santa Monica in 1979 and established Mr. McCarty as a pioneer of a nascent style of American cooking.  This Michael’s opened a decade later, and won plaudits — including two stars from Ruth Reichl in The New York Times in 1995 — for the quality of its vegetables, the profusion of them and the subtlety of some of its preparations. Those were all hallmarks of California cuisine, a phrase that went away as the principles it connoted took permanent root and became less exceptional, as restaurants far and wide exalted the local and seasonal and turned away from elaborate saucing and gut-busting richness. Michael’s still tries to out-roughage the rest of them, some of its dishes looking as if their route from kitchen to table took them through a deciduous forest. In the context of New York restaurants today much of the food is actually on the embellished side. Some of it is too embellished, period. The cod came with a slightly intrusive saffron vanilla beurre blanc. The hamachi was awash in a mushroom beurre blanc and pumpkin seed oil. Roasted trout fared better, flattered by all the fresh dill with it, and nicely cooked.  Seafood plays a prominent role at Michael’s, taking up much of the menu’s real estate at lunch and dinner. But my best experience here was breakfast. An omelet stuffed with sour cream and avocado was fluffy and luxurious. The tomatoes on top of a vegetable frittata were vivid and sweet. And chicken-apple sausages were lighter, sunnier alternatives to traditional pork links. The restaurant seems to lose culinary steam as the day progresses. Lunch is better than dinner, inasmuch as it presents items like the very fine Cobb salad and decent Niçoise and hanger steak salads that aren’t on the nighttime menu. But there’s uneven execution, and it’s sloppier still at dinner, a mix of some dishes that reflect high standards and others that bespeak carelessness. One night I had a prime New York steak that was advertised as — and indeed tasted — dry-aged, unlike so many steaks billed that way. But all that was distinctive about a rack of lamb on another night was the shockingly arid ricotta cannelloni beside it. Had the cannelloni languished under a heat lamp? Should a diner paying $45 for this entree forgive such a lapse? And shouldn’t a diner paying $38 for sea scallops get more than two, situated at opposite ends of a long hillock of sautéed snow pea leaves? Maybe that’s enough for a businessperson having a light lunch on a big expense account. For anyone else, it isn’t. Michael's SATISFACTORY 24 West 55th Street; (212) 767-0555.

354,Perbacco,2 star,"Aug. 19, 2008",Frank Bruni,East Village,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/dining/reviews/20rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/20/dining/reviews/20rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"FIRST a friend mentioned it. Then a popular blog mentioned it. And then it came up in a conversation with a new acquaintance, who said he’d just tried it, and what do you know? He was wild about it, too. What was going on at Perbacco? I went first on a Friday night. It was full. That’s no sure thing in the summer, especially this summer, when tough economic times, coupled with the usual weekend exodus, have left many restaurants with many empty seats. But it wasn’t just the crush of diners that struck me. It was the attention they seemed to pay to their food. It was the particular energy coursing through the dark-wooded, softly lighted room. My companions and I wanted to learn quickly what these diners knew, so we asked our server to steer us to his favorites. Out came “crème brûlée di Parmigiano,” an eggy, savory Parmesan custard with caramelized brown sugar on top, plus a splash of reduced balsamic vinegar. Strange? Not when you think about the way a plate of sharp cheese is often embellished with sweet and tart sidekicks. This little dish was a big riot of complementary effects, in closer proximity than they usually are. After that we had prosciutto e melone, which may not sound unusual. But wait. At Perbacco they’re not partners in an antipasto; they’re partners in a pasta dish, tortelloni filled with prosciutto and mascarpone cheese and sauced with mint, butter and cubes of cantaloupe. Another surprise. Another winner. Not every dish at Perbacco succeeds. But something is indeed happening here, and apparently has been for four months, since the restaurant welcomed Simone Bonelli, a 26-year-old chef brimming with ideas and ambition. He came from Italy, but more to the point he came from the northern city of Modena and the kitchen of Osteria La Francescana, where Italy’s old guard meets Spain’s New Wave and traditions of the Emilia Romagna region are refracted through an avant-garde sensibility. In fact something I once had there came to mind when I was eating Perbacco’s Parmesan brûlée. At Francescana, the acclaimed chef Massimo Bottura combines, in one dish, Parmesan of different ages and textures: a sauce, a foam, an air (essentially a foam of greater dissipation), a frico. He takes Italian staples and toys with them, delivering familiar flavors in unfamiliar ways. On a more modest stage and in more modest ways, that’s what Mr. Bonelli does at Perbacco. It opened five years ago as a less edgy restaurant and looks, from the outside, like a conventional trattoria. It has about 40 tightly wedged seats, including stools at high tables. But it’s no longer conventional. It’s experimental, Lupa meets WD-50. Across much of the menu, Mr. Bonelli plays games. Next to the tiers of a Caprese salad with the usual ingredients (buffalo milk mozzarella, tomatoes) he adds an eccentric echo: tomato gelatin studded with tiny cubes of buffalo milk mozzarella. For an entree of expertly grilled swordfish, he doesn’t scatter capers over or around the fish. He sets a caper gelato to the side. Although its temperature and texture prevent its easy integration with everything else — the mound of braised baby eggplant in one corner of the plate, the tomato and black olive salad in another — it’s nonetheless enterprising, attention-getting. Sometimes Mr. Bonelli’s cooking plays out that way, more curious than compelling, more strenuously creative than revelatory. But just as often it doesn’t, and what he’s fashioned in this humble setting in the far East Village is a trove of surprises, of dishes that don’t duplicate anything anywhere else in Manhattan. Some of what I ate lingered in my thoughts for days: a special of agnolotti, for example. Mr. Bonelli blends oven-roasted tomatoes into dough for the pasta, stuffed with shrimp, shiitake and ricotta, then sauced with butter and shrimp stock. That’s less a technical accomplishment than a triumph of flavors that wind up working terrifically together, and of superior cooking. The same holds true for a dish with baked columns of fresh pasta spiralled around speck, buffalo milk mozzarella and béchamel. Mr. Bonelli dribbles an intense truffled zabaglione around the lip of the bowl, so you can incorporate as little or as much of it as you wish. He revels in the basic glory of mild, milky cheese with cured meat, and keeps coming at this marriage in fresh ways. A recent appetizer special wrapped braesola around cubes of burrata, each embedded with summer truffle and set on arugula pesto and thinly sliced tomato. Many of Perbacco’s best dishes are indeed specials, which supplement a written menu divided into about two dozen small plates, followed by pasta and main courses. Most of these dishes are more or less straightforward: marinated artichokes, arancini, meatballs, fusilli with tomato and olives, a fennel-crusted rack of lamb. Some of them are unremarkable. I couldn’t find a dessert to love, certainly not the deconstructed cannoli, its shell presented as disconnected triangles. But servers are enthusiastic and the prices are definitely right, especially for cooking this distinctive. Almost all of the generously portioned pasta dishes cost less than $15. A memorable main course of pork belly with a honey and black pepper sauce is $18.95. The wine list provides a sufficiently thorough tour of Italy’s regions without impoverishing you in the process. Two caveats: Perbacco tends not to answer its phone before 5 p.m., so reserving can be tedious. And Mr. Bonelli is on vacation for another week. But a recent meal suggested that Perbacco does fine without him. And with him, it has graduated to a whole new level, worthy of its name, which means “wow.”",
355,Scarpetta,3 star,"July 30, 2008",Frank Bruni,Chelsea,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/dining/reviews/30rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/30/dining/reviews/30rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I’VE often suspected that David Chang has some preternatural bond with the pork belly, David Pasternack with the swordfish and Jody Williams with the fava bean. Now I’m wondering about Scott Conant and the tomato. Is any other chef coaxing more or better from it than he? I ask that on the basis of his new restaurant, Scarpetta, and in particular on the basis of a simple, tersely described dish on the pasta section of the menu. “Spaghetti, tomato and basil.” That’s all it says. That’s pretty much what it is. But however Mr. Conant is choosing and cooking the Roma tomatoes with which he sauces his house-made spaghetti, he’s getting a roundness of flavor and nuance of sweetness that amount to pure Mediterranean bliss. And what he’s adding to the sauce  — the aforementioned basil, along with a red-pepper-infused olive oil and Parmesan cheese  — contribute measures of zip (just a little), saltiness (a little more) and smoothness (a lot) that are inarguably right. I had this dish twice, and twice it stacked up against any spaghetti al pomodoro I’ve had in Italy. More than that, it underscored the wisdom of his work at Scarpetta: he’s getting back to the tomato. I mean that not literally but figuratively, in the sense that Mr. Conant, whose cooking took a precious turn when he opened the restaurant Alto in 2005, is mining a more straightforward, soulful vein. He’s not standing rigidly on a frosty mountaintop in northernmost Italy, the region that Alto showcased. He’s letting his gaze drift southward, and he’s letting more sunshine into his food. That’s by no means an inherently superior approach. But it’s a looser, less self-conscious one that suits and serves him better. Under his stewardship, Alto, which means high or tall, left you coolly impressed. Scarpetta  — which means little shoe, but refers to a hunk of bread you use to sop up lingering  sauce  — leaves you stuffed and happy. It’s not exactly a rustic trattoria with exalted peasant food: Mr. Conant’s methods are more refined than that. He presents osso buco without the bone, as a sort of veal roll-up splashed with marrow. And his terrific chilled pea soup includes crab meat and currents of riesling. But Scarpetta’s answer to Alto’s sous-vide Guinea hen with a foie gras emulsion is roasted baby chicken in a bath of chicken liver, almonds and dried currants. The dressing has a coarser, blunter flavor that’s no less appealing. Some Conant 101, for less chef-obsessed readers: he achieved citywide fame and nationwide acclaim with the opening of L’Impero in 2002, and followed that success with Alto. More than a year ago, he split with his partners in those enterprises, wandering away and taking a break. The chef Michael White replaced him in both kitchens. Alto almost instantly became a warmer, more satisfying experience. L’Impero was transformed into Convivio, a more casual restaurant that opened earlier this month. Part of what Mr. Conant does at Scarpetta, which opened in May, is resurrect the all-stars in his L’Impero lineup, some with and some without significant tweaks. He brings back an appetizer of creamy, cheesy, buttery polenta with morels and preserved truffles that’s one of the best, most decadent things ever to happen to cornmeal. He brings back an entree of baby goat, predictably meaty and reliably musky but much more tender than most chefs manage to make it. The spaghetti, too, is from L’Impero, and it’s not the only dish with which he demonstrates his tomato sorcery. There’s an appetizer of mozzarella in carozza  — basically, a prettified, pedigreed mozzarella stick  — on a king-size bed of stewed, shockingly vibrant baby tomatoes. And there’s an entree of black cod with slow-roasted tomatoes and caramelized fennel that I especially admire. It reclaims this fish from all the Nobu clones candying it with sweet miso and the like, and it gets a more controlled sweetness from the tomatoes, which also provide a countervailing acidity. It’s Nobu by way of Naples. Almost all of the pasta dishes are excellent, and they’re smartly varied in terms of their intensities, their sensibilities. For full-throttle northern Italian opulence, try the agnolotti, filled with a mixture of ground chicken, veal and pork and more preserved truffles, along with melted fontina cheese. For a less rich alternative with some hints of the south, go with cavatelli, tossed with chickpeas and bitter greens. And for briny blasts of the sea, you can savor the mussels, clams, shrimp, squid and sea urchin roe entwined with calamarata, a thick noodle with a shape and weight that recall a squiggle of calamari, explaining the name. Even on this section of the menu, Scarpetta’s strongest, Mr. Conant’s kitchen occasionally wobbles. Both times I had the tagliatelle with peas and lamb, the pasta was overcooked. And there are dishes whose presence seems to reflect marketplace caution more than epicurean inspiration: the seared scallops (lovely) and sliced sirloin (perfectly fine) among the entrees; a dessert of what is essentially molten chocolate cake, except that the pastry chef, Gary Minos, comes up with an interior so spectacularly rich and gooey that molten doesn’t quite cover it. Let’s call it lava-licious. Mr. Minos’s work is utterly solid without being notably ambitious. I was most intrigued and delighted by a Key lime “cheesecake” that is not, in fact, a cheesecake. It tastes more like Key lime s’mores. Although there are many broader, more august Italian wine lists around the city, Scarpetta’s at least gives you plenty of options in the $40 to $80 range. My main concerns about this restaurant have to do with its setting. The dining room is handsome enough, with its brown leather banquettes and its oddly accessorized mirrors, which wear dashing orange belts. (Are there matching scarpette in a closet nearby?) But a retractable glass roof gives the restaurant little control over the level of light before sundown, and that light can be harsh. Then there’s the neighborhood: the meatpacking district. As an evening progresses, Scarpetta’s front bar area (with first-come-first-served tables) sometimes grows crowded and chaotic, threatening the smoothness with which the restaurant operates and ratcheting up the noise level. The restaurant’s already plenty tough on the ears. I could all but feel Scarpetta trying to hold back the district’s ripped  tide, and I hope it succeeds. Mr. Conant has been reunited with his best instincts. He deserves the right home for them. Scarpetta *** 355 West 14th Street, (212) 691-0555.

356,Szechuan Gourmet,2 star,"July 23, 2008",Frank Bruni,Midtown South,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/dining/reviews/23rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/23/dining/reviews/23rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"“NOW this is just sort of cool and refreshing,” I remarked to my tablemates as I pinched some more of the sectioned cucumbers with my chopsticks and ferried them down the hatch. “It’s a nice, clean little break from the fire, and it ...” Hold on. Wait a second. Something was starting to happen in my mouth. First came a few flickers, then a few more. This blaze was perhaps gentler than the one sparked by the sesame noodles moments earlier, though maybe more forceful than anything the glistening orange oil beneath the pork dumplings had wrought. It was sneakier than either, that much was certain. And it definitely wasn’t a reprieve. At Szechuan Gourmet, a restaurant on a drab Midtown block that fans of Sichuan cooking should be visiting in greater numbers and with greater frequency than they are, the heat is almost always on, and it comes at you in different ways. Sometimes it hits you full blast with your first bite of a dish and never lets up. Sometimes it starts small and builds, a late bloomer. And sometimes it lies in wait, biding its time before stating its case. It’s fickle, tricky, fierce. It can light a match to your tongue, numb your lips, snap you to attention and do a job on your stomach that lasts a good long while. “I feel like I ate a wolverine,” wrote one friend in an e-mail message after a lunch there, and what struck me wasn’t the sentiment. It was the time stamp. The message had been sent six hours after the meal was over. Sichuan’s inimitable heat is a big part — for me, the main part — of what makes this cuisine such a riveting adventure. And up until a few weeks ago, I thought I had to go to the Flushing section of Queens to enjoy that adventure to its fullest in New York. Flushing is home to Spicy & Tasty, local Sichuan lovers’ justly designated shrine. Szechuan Gourmet is in Flushing, too, and has been since 2002. But neither that location nor the Manhattan branch — added in 2004 — commands quite as much reverence as Spicy & Tasty. And while the Manhattan branch’s cooking isn’t exactly as bold as Spicy & Tasty’s, it’s close enough to raise the question of why this restaurant, though recognized, isn’t more of a rage. My own theory is that it’s too convenient for cult status and adulation. For food pilgrims who don’t live in Queens, a meal at Spicy & Tasty is a shinier badge of honor; proof of a willingness to invest travel time and head in unglamorous directions for great food. A meal at Szechuan Gourmet, situated within a few blocks of about a dozen different subway lines that converge around Times Square, doesn’t feel as much like a reward for a sacrifice. But the lighting, from many red paper lanterns, is kinder. The décor is less blunt. And servers reliably do the one thing above all others that you want them to when you’re eating family style — which you most definitely should — and depositing portions of so many different dishes on the tasting plate in front of you. Just when that plate begins to resemble a painter’s messy palette, the colors bleeding into one another, the servers replace it. The menu sprawls to more than 100 selections — it’s too much, but then at this genre of restaurant it’s always too much — and focuses on Sichuan, with some nods to other Chinese traditions as well. It allows culinary daredevils to strut their stuff, giving them stir-fried duck tongue and stir-fried frogs (the whole critter — chopped — not just the legs) and stir-fried pig intestines. It coddles tamer eaters, too. There are honey-glazed spare ribs, for heaven’s sake. But don’t get those. Please don’t get those. Get something that showcases the fabled “ma la” of Sichuan cooking, the tingly-fiery effect of Sichuan peppercorns and chili peppers, often infused into sesame oil, the results pooling at the bottom of a dish, a multi-toned sunset, maroon, bronze and ochre. Get, for example, the braised beef or fish fillets with Napa cabbage. There’s a thick dust of ground chilies on top. But neither the cooking nor the spicing here is one dimensional; there’s more than just heat coming out of the chef Cheng Zhong Huang’s kitchen. (Mr. Huang is also the owner.) What you’ll notice before the chilies in an excellent appetizer of sliced pork belly is the garlic, lots of it, along with a sweetened soy sauce reduction that vaguely mimics balsamic vinegar. You’ll notice the cumin coating crispy fried lamb fillets (my favorite entree) and you’ll be riveted by how loud and clear it rings. You’ll notice, mixed into the soybean paste around a whole striped bass, ginger as well as garlic, and you’ll detect star anise in other dishes. I found the tea-smoked duck at Szechuan Gourmet more tender than at Spicy & Tasty, and I encountered an addictive dish I’d never seen or tasted before. It was shredded potatoes stir-fried in hot oil, from which they emerged as slick, firm, noodle-like strands: stand-ins, apparently, for daikon radish in a more traditional treatment. Although I’ve repeatedly invoked Spicy & Tasty, a better point of reference for many Manhattan diners may be the estimable Grand Sichuan restaurants, and I swung by the newest one, in Greenwich Village, between visits to Szechuan Gourmet. It paled in comparison. The ma-po tofu was less creamy and — no surprise — less spicy. The sauce on the sesame noodles traded sizzle for sweetness. Szechuan Gourmet wouldn’t do that. It has its limitations: no hard liquor, a short list of wines you won’t yearn to drink, an even shorter list of desserts so negligible that servers don’t bother to  ask if you want one before dropping the check. Meals here can be rushed, especially at lunch, when the restaurant is busiest. But they’re full of surprises, and the wolverine among them won’t kill you.

The blade is, as the name suggests, a shoulder cut. The shoulder here comes from pigs nurtured by the Virginia farmer Bev Eggleston, whose outrageously fine swine  have ensorcelled many of New York’s more discerning cooks and carnivores. The blade meat is left on the bone, cut thin and broiled. It’s so intensely porky it’s like a sprawling horizontal sausage, and that intensity is one reason to follow servers’ suggestions and order the arugula salad, then dump it on the steak. The arugula blunts the meat’s punch, while Parmesan in the salad brings saltiness to the brawl. A salty charge is also one of the virtues of a dish at Gottino that rivals the blade steak in my affections. Dish isn’t the right word; it’s a pair of crostini, toasted bread slathered with a pesto of walnuts, olive oil, thyme, a dab of sun-dried tomato and some Parmesan, Italy’s indispensable utility player. The topping is as addictive as crunchy peanut butter, and might well be considered the grown-up answer to it. Terrific in and of themselves, the pork blade and  walnut pesto are noteworthy for an additional reason. Neither is served in what would conventionally be considered a restaurant. With stool seating, a focus on small plates under $10 and lengthy selections of wines by the glass, Terroir and Gottino are better described as wine bars, though that term, too, doesn’t fit, because the best of the food rises so far above the gussied-up sandwiches and glorified snacks with which wine bars once made do. Terroir and Gottino exemplify a wine-bar evolution so thorough that nomenclature can’t keep up. And they reflect the increasing degree to which distinguished cooking pops up in the unconventional, informal settings that many food lovers often prefer. Major-league chefs like  Marco Canora at Terroir and  Jody Williams of Gottino are not only accommodating this sensibility but also taking advantage of it  — being liberated by it. Their menus  aren’t self-promoting showcases for finesse and imagination. They read like unfussy compendia of what Mr. Canora or Ms. Williams might want to wolf down late at night when hunger strikes and a properly set table isn’t in the cards. He: bruschette with braised black cabbage and pork sausage, or lamb sausage wrapped in sage leaves and deep-fried. She: speck, Parmesan and rosemary bignè (essentially, savory beignet), or crostini with fava beans and sheep’s milk ricotta. Both are trawling an easygoing confluence of Italian soul and finger food. And they’re reeling in  enough— both menus have dozens of options beyond salumi and cheese  — to force the question, are Terroir and Gottino restaurants in wine-bar drag? Ms. Williams seems terrified by that notion. On the phone recently she caught herself using the words lunch and dinner and quickly reversed course, saying she didn’t want customers looking to Gottino for an actual meal. “Just squeeze in, eat and drink, because it’s not a restaurant,” she said. “I don’t want people to have restaurant expectations. But if I tell people just to squeeze in, eat and drink, it’ll all be O.K.” Her demurral strikes to the very real limitations and discomforts of both Gottino and Terroir, where space is tight, the mood is agitated, reservations aren’t accepted and you could easily wind up standing and waiting 45 minutes for the privilege of straddling a stool. (Gottino also has a dozen or so chairs at tables in a forlorn back section.) There are few desserts and little that passes for an entree. The overall dining experiences are abbreviated, and not suited to many occasions, and the prices only partly reflect that. You can easily spend $30 a person assembling enough small plates to sate your hunger. But the food is restaurant food, carefully sourced and thoughtfully prepared. It’s the primary draw for many customers, and much of it deserves notice as much as the fare at larger restaurants that play by mustier rules. Gottino, which has just added breakfast and lunch hours, is the prettier destination, with a few elegant touches: a white marble bar, neckties on the servers. Menu categories include not just crostini but vegetables, typified by a tangle of asparagus, feta and almonds; fish, such as potted salmon in olive oil or whipped salt cod; and meat, along the lines of thin slices of leg of lamb with crushed olives. Ms. Williams’s compositions reflect a gift for balance, and she reaches in many directions for the ingredients she wants. From Italy she gets the stracchino cheese and sun-dried tomatoes that she uses on crostini. From Philadelphia she gets Capogiro gelato. She’s not just finicky but fetishistic, using a red Berkel slicer for  prosciutto di Parma, aged 24 months. Virginia ham (12 months) is carved by hand. The broader, shallower room of Terroir is bare bones. The food captures the spirit of — and even resurrects a few dishes from — the version of Craftbar that Mr. Canora once helmed. You’ll find Craftbar’s panino of duck ham with mushrooms and taleggio; you’ll find an even better one of grilled radicchio, smoked mozzarella and red pepper. You’ll find Craftbar’s soft, moist meatballs of veal and ricotta; you’ll also find an equally memorable salad of calamari and smoked chickpeas. The wine list, by Mr. Canora’s business partner, Paul Grieco, is more diverse than Gottino’s, and Mr. Grieco’s ebullient, evangelistic guidance is reason enough to drop in. But you’d be silly to visit Terroir or Gottino and not have a bite, or better yet a meal. Despite  what Ms. Williams says, you’ll probably have a satisfying one.

New Yorkers who love pizza will endure a lot to get a good one, like standing in line for an hour outside Totonno’s Pizzeria Napolitano or watching the time pass as Domenico DeMarco at Di Fara slowly hand-grates cheese, pizza by pizza. This behavior can be interpreted as a sign either of culinary focus or of lunacy. Now, the dedicated can add a new pizzeria to their rounds, one with only two menu items: pizza margherita and chocolate chip cookies. There is a bar, but no takeout, no slices and no delivery. Granted, both items are delicious. Although sometimes inconsistent, South Brooklyn’s $12 pizzas usually come from the coal-fired oven with the right amount of char on a crunchy crust, which is slightly thicker than what one might find at the end of a long wait at Di Fara. The pie is oval, slicked with olive oil and bright with San Marzano tomatoes and a nudge of basil. The cheese is predominantly fresh mozzarella, although bits of fontina and Parmesan play supporting roles. Jim McGown is the man behind the pizza. He’s a real estate developer who fell in love with both a Carroll Gardens woman and her neighborhood. Two years ago he bought the bar P. J. Hanley’s, which came with an old coal oven in an adjacent 19th-century townhouse. He refurbished it and became obsessed, making only one thing. That is, until one afternoon when his girlfriend’s sweet tooth started talking. So he assembled some chocolate chip cookie dough and baked it in the oven. The resulting cookie ($2), doughy and in desperate need of a milk chaser, became the second menu item.  KIM SEVERSON  REVISIT Artisanal 2 Park Avenue (entrance on 32nd Street); (212) 725-8585. You’d assume it was cheese that beckoned me to Artisanal, but I actually went for steak. Earlier this year the chef Terrance Brennan, who owns and guides this great milky citadel, announced that he was going to expand its selection of prime beef, and that a côte de boeuf aged for 60 days would be among the new dishes. I made a note, a resolve and then a reservation. And even before the meat appeared in front of my friends and me, I was happy I’d come. At its best Artisanal is like an uptown (really, Midtown) Balthazar with less noise, less crowding and, true, much less of a frisson. It has a handsome interior with Art Deco flourishes and, even better, several kinds of fondue (small, $24; large, $40) with a range of ingredients for dipping. I recommend the kielbasa ($5.50) and the fingerling potatoes ($4.50). Beyond all this cheesiness lies a relatively full-service brasserie that performs quite admirably at times. Our chicken ($23.50), cooked under a brick, was superb. Our lamb shank ($26.50), which rose from a pool of goat cheese polenta, was almost as good. And that côte de boeuf for two ($110)? It didn’t send us into the sort of rapture we expected for that price, but it indeed tasted aged, and it indeed tasted prime. A subsequent visit to the restaurant was less satisfying. If there were wild mushrooms in a risotto putatively built around them, they were the tamest ones in the forest, and made little impression on the dish, which was excessively, well, cheesy. Artisanal has some consistency problems, and it has a wine list with both pros and cons. Because Artisanal makes every wine available by the glass, it doesn’t keep many bottles with age on them around. But more than seven years since it opened, it remains an alluring destination for all kinds of gustatory debauchery. Cheese is only the gateway indulgence.  FRANK BRUNI  ",

I think she was focusing on the oil mural painted on one of the walls and on the way the restaurant’s Art Deco flourishes and situation in a 1911 building give it the feel of old New York. “Balthazar,” said someone else, responding to different cues: the lemony light of a brasserie, the cramped seating and the merry commotion.  The memo apparently went out, and those New Yorkers versed in showing up at the right new places right when they’re supposed to have descended on Commerce in style and in droves. That makes it either exhilarating or enervating, depending on your age, your mood and the strength of your eardrums. Both friends were right. Commerce in one sense evokes the Waverly Inn and in another emulates Balthazar. But in the end it isn’t like either of them, which becomes  clear when the menu arrives and, in its wake, the food. There are oysters, as there must be, but not presented the usual way, with a mignonette nearby. You can have them with a green-apple gelée on top or smothered in a sauce of Champagne, potatoes, leeks and glittering orange salmon roe. There is roasted chicken, in accordance with the commandments, but it’s a bird of a different, more decadent feather. Stuffing is scattered around it, and that stuffing is redolent not only of the bacon and onions in which the hefty cubes of bread have been sautéed but also of the foie gras with which they’ve been coated. It’s a bruising wallop to the gut. Although the visual and auditory signals that Commerce sends out create certain expectations, the chef, Harold Moore, one of its owners, doesn’t feel the least bit bound by them. He bows only somewhat to classics and bends only partway to comfort foods, coming up with a polyglot menu and intricately wrought dishes that let him strut his stuff in a way that a more archetypal bill of fare might not. In doing so he creates a rankling dissonance, his dishes beseeching a closeness of attention that the frenzied atmosphere doesn’t easily permit. And he errs. While there’s some wonderful food that reflects the talent he showed and the experience he received at Montrachet and then March, there’s also some food that’s not cooked or seasoned as it should be, and there’s food that’s too fussy, not just for the ambience but also for its own good. You spot a porterhouse for two on a menu and you prime yourself for the raptures of thick, charred bone-in beef that you can really sink your teeth into. But at Commerce the meat comes without the bone, trimmed of too much gristle and fat and sliced nearly as thinly as London broil. Those slices snuggle up to a red wine and shallot steak sauce that’s already on the plate, whether you want it or not, and that’s sweetened  —  too much so —  by a raisin purée. Refined? I suppose. Satisfying? Not completely. That’s not to say Commerce doesn’t have its pleasures, beginning with its location. It’s tucked into one of those patches of the Village with an unusually intimate scale, and it occupies a building with palpable history. Back during Prohibition, this space was a speakeasy. Then it was the Blue Mill Tavern, then Grange Hall and then Blue Mill again, briefly. It takes its newest name from its street. It’s more pretty than comfortable, and its menu is more interesting than trustworthy, though no evening is likely to be a bust. Mr. Moore produces just enough winners to guard against that, and if all else fails there’s the bread basket, which is some bread basket, a throwback to the days when carb wasn’t a four-letter word. In it you’ll find at least six kinds of bread, most made in house: buttery bread and salty bread, crunchy bread and spongy bread, irresistible bread and even more irresistible bread. I always vowed not to polish it all off, and I always ended up staring at crumbs. The carbs get less reliable after that. Among the half dozen appetizer or entree-size pasta dishes, several were letdowns. Both times I tried the spaghetti carbonara it lacked the peppery charge that the menu promised, and the second time the spaghetti was overcooked. So were the noodles under a “ragu of odd things,” the welcome oddities being oxtail, trotters and tripe. The kitchen did right, however, by sweet potato tortelloni, which were showered with hazelnuts and pomegranate seeds, and mushroom and Fontina ravioli, which were bathed in a Parmesan emulsion. With those nimble, elegant dishes Mr. Moore paid homage to Italy. With another nimble, elegant dish he honored Thailand. Beautifully cooked red snapper was placed in a gorgeous broth in which lemon grass, curry, coconut milk and saffron all wafted in and out of the picture, lending their beguiling nuances. That was one of my two favorite entrees. The other underscored what a broad spectrum of sensibilities Mr. Moore works: it was a fatty veal breast stuffed with pork shoulder and speck, and it had the homey appeal of pot roast, though its ingredients were more exalted. Commerce doesn’t add up neatly. It doesn’t always add up sensibly, either. Having four entrees, including the porterhouse and the chicken, that  require the participation of more than one diner is too much, especially when one of those entrees, braised beef shank, requires the participation of at least three. In a city as fiercely individualistic as this one, that’s a culinary quorum that’s unlikely to happen. Like much else about the restaurant, desserts are ambitious and unpredictable. They include a chocolate and peanut butter marquise with a scoop of celery sorbet, which is a cute touch, inasmuch as it brings to mind celery stalks slathered with peanut butter.  The sorbet  does nothing, though, to burnish the appeal of the marquise, and thus illustrates Commerce’s occasional failure to strike the right balance between pleasing diners and flattering its lofty sense of itself.",
360,La Sirène,1 star,"March 19, 2008",Frank Bruni,SoHo,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/dining/reviews/19rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/19/dining/reviews/19rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"AT the oddly compelling little bistro La Sirène, you might be able to order profiteroles. Then again you might not. It depends on Didier Pawlicki’s mood. Really, it depends on the online feedback that Mr. Pawlicki, the restaurant’s chef and owner, monitors compulsively. The first time I ate there, he was brooding over a complaint on yelp.com about the chocolate sauce’s bitterness. “Americans expect Hershey’s!” he lamented, informing my friends and me that he’d yanked the profiteroles from the menu rather than bastardize them. He had his principles. We told him that we’d been primed for the dessert by raves elsewhere. We pouted. He relented. “You can have it!” he harrumphed, adding that if we found the sauce too bitter, well, we’d been warned. On top of which, we’d be wrong. In fact we loved the way its sharpness was a foil for the sweetness of the vanilla ice cream inside the pastry, the way its darkness made the colored sprinkles on it glitter more brightly. But I suppose it wasn’t just the sauce we were responding to. It was the riddle and spectacle of Mr. Pawlicki himself, a scolding, coddling, hyperactive presence who ricochets so rapidly through the restaurant’s cramped quarters  — from the kitchen to the dining room and even into the basement, where he keeps diners’ coats — that comparing him to a pinball flatters the pinball. I don’t want to oversell La Sirène, which opened last spring. It operates on a shoestring, doesn’t have a liquor license and doesn’t ace many of the dishes on its relatively short French menu. The escargot, covered in buttery bread crumbs, is better than the beet salad, doused with too much truffle oil. The gooey dark chocolate cake outshines the wispy chocolate mousse. And drawing attention to La Sirène runs the risk of overcrowding it. It has only about 25 seats and not an inch to spare, so if your table isn’t ready you have to stand outside, where you’re treated to an intimate view of cars streaming into the Holland Tunnel. But this scrappy restaurant, where you can hear the bell every time a dish is ready and heat from the kitchen steams diners’ eyeglasses, will charm many people turned off by the vacuous polish and higher prices elsewhere. With no corkage fee, it’s a solid option for wine drinkers seeking liberation from restaurant markups. It deserves a moment of notice, and so does Mr. Pawlicki, 49, a transplanted Frenchman as proud and dedicated as his more celebrated peers, which means just about all of them. Although he has a few kitchen helpers and servers, he may well be the one to take your coat, to decide which of your bottles of wine should be opened first, to open it, to recommend the duck breast, to sear the duck breast, to serve the duck breast and to guide you to the tiny restroom, in the back corner of the kitchen. “Voilà!” he’ll say as he deposits you there. It’s what he says at the end of almost every sentence. When he’s not working in the restaurant, he’s working the Internet. For each of the dozens of comments about La Sirène on newyork.citysearch.com, there’s a response from him, profusely thanking a diner or apologizing to a diner or pontificating about the restaurant’s merits and limitations. In one comment a diner articulated disappointment at not having seen him in the restaurant and surprise that one waitress handled all the tables. Mr. Pawlicki’s rebuttal, in his imperfect and erratically capitalized English: “For your Protection Didier and the Other waitress were dismissed! By the Law of ‘good sense’ and NYC Health and Mental Hygiene, you couldn’t work with public (especially food industry) if you have the FLU or Whatever contagious things going on.” In another comment a diner said the crab cakes “looked like two fried nickels.” “No body is perfect!” Mr. Pawlicki answered. “But express yourself to me!” The diner, he admonished, should have complained on the spot. He lives in Jersey City, near the other end of the Holland Tunnel, so he can zip back and forth on his motorcycle, sometimes toting supplies. He named the restaurant after the siren of classical mythology, portrayed on its Web site as a bare-breasted mermaid in an arresting state of aquatic ecstasy. He decorated it, so to speak, with a ship’s wheel, an anchor and French travel posters. His menu emphasizes seafood: a hearty stew of monkfish, butter beans, mushrooms and onions; skate seared in butter and swimming in mushrooms and red peppers; steamed mussels with various broths, including one with Dijon mustard and heavy cream that begs for the bread  on the table to be dipped in it. But my two favorite dishes were hanger steak and cassoulet. Like the skate, the steak is seared in butter, and like most everything else, it’s seasoned with garlic. As with other generously portioned entrees, it comes with sides, usually including a carrot purée (buttery) and mashed potatoes (garlicky). The cassoulet isn’t the swampy kind. The duck thigh, fennel sausage and bacon don’t drown in its depths, and the big fat white beans aren’t cooked to mush. The dish gets crunch from bread crumbs, and at the bottom the fat from the different meats pools. Scooping some into each bite is mandatory. But pace yourself. There may be profiteroles ahead. Speaking of which: if Mr. Pawlicki wasn’t prepared to serve them, how did he prepare them so fast? Maybe he’s a pastry whiz. Or maybe he’s just a consummate performer.

361,Bar Boulud,2 star,"March 12, 2008",Frank Bruni,Upper West Side,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/dining/reviews/12rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/12/dining/reviews/12rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"MUCH of what you need to know about the direction of fine dining these days is distilled in Bar Boulud, where one of the most accomplished French traditionalists on this side of the Atlantic stages a production whose weakest facet is the conventional three-course dinner. It’s not just white tablecloths that have fallen by the wayside at Bar Boulud, which extends the chef Daniel Boulud’s trajectory toward ever-more-casual restaurants, mirroring the culture around him. Gone, too, is the notion that sitting at a proper table and ordering a proper sequence of dishes is the way you want to eat. You can certainly take that route, which in fact has rewards enough for anyone who does elect it. But unlike Mr. Boulud’s other New York restaurants — Daniel, Café Boulud and DB Bistro Moderne, in their order of birth and descending degrees of formality — Bar Boulud doesn’t press that path on you. Many of its roughly 100 seats are stools at a high, long counter or chairs at a circular communal table. The fraction of menu real estate claimed by entrees is only about a quarter. And the restaurant’s twin emphases are its terrific wine list and formidable selection of charcuterie. Bar Boulud is a terrine machine, a pâté-a-palooza, dedicated to the proposition that discerning New Yorkers aren’t getting nearly enough concentrated, sculptured, gelatinous animal fat, at least not of a superior caliber. I’ll buy that, and I’ll buy it on the basis of the restaurant’s smooth pâté grand-mère (chicken liver, pork, Cognac) and coarse pâté grand-père (foie gras, pork, port), both of which are such pure joy to eat — on their own, on toasted bread, with mustard, without — that they sent me on a search across the menu not only for close relatives but also for distant cousins. I was ready to ingest the entire extended family. The charcuterie is the work of a Frenchman named Sylvain Gasdon, who is a protégé of a Frenchman named Gilles Verot, who is to head cheese what Yves Saint Laurent is to the tuxedo jacket. Bar Boulud’s salty, meaty head-cheese terrine, as it happens, stands out, though it has fierce competition from a terrine of lamb leg with eggplant, sweet potato and north African spices, and from a beef-cheek terrine with onion confit and pistachio. That’s not to mention the “tourte de canard,” which layers figs, foie gras, duck breast and a duck jelly within a pastry crust. There’s also cooked ham, cured ham and sausages, including a boudin blanc, its center as soft as foam, that’s tucked into a bed of truffle-flecked mashed potatoes. From all of these you can assemble an oversize snack or undersize meal, to be rounded out with wine from a list that’s a knockout in terms of its tight focus, its enterprising selections, its elegant organization and its price range. Most of the wines are from Burgundy and the Rhone. Most of the ones that aren’t use Burgundy or Rhone varietals. You can find appealing bottles for under $50, and if you raise the ceiling to $80, you’re swimming in choices. Ask one of the sommeliers to point you in the right direction. They make solid — sometimes even bold — recommendations. In fact wine lovers on a budget have cause right now to rejoice, because both Bar Boulud and Adour Alain Ducasse, which recently opened in the St. Regis Hotel, keep smaller spenders in mind, at least when it comes to the pricing of full bottles. Bar Boulud’s devotion to wine is reflected in the design of the restaurant, situated just across Broadway from Lincoln Center and ready to pick off members of the artsy herd stampeding into and out of performances. The tunnel-shape room — much longer than it is broad, with an arched ceiling — evokes a wine cellar. On one wall, above honey-colored wood booths (the most comfortable perches), hang framed crimson blots that represent wine stains. They look as much like forensic evidence as like art: “C.S.I.: Beaujolais.” And they reflect some physical oddities that don’t serve diners well. For instance there’s no real bar, since the long counter is set aside for eating. If you’re waiting for a seat, you’re left to compete for standing rights at one of four tiny, chest-high tables against the all-glass front facing Broadway, and you can easily feel as if you’re on the sidewalk itself. Servers and diners travel a single artery running the length of the restaurant, and serious traffic quickly develops. It’s not the most peaceful backdrop. The prices to some degree reflect the hubbub, the informality. A rich, brightly seasoned bisque with butternut squash, mussels and saffron was $11, while all but one of the entrees on a recent menu were under $30. That’s a clue to the limited ambitions that Mr. Boulud and his executive chef, Damian Sansonetti, have for the dishes beyond the charcuterie, and that’s the context in which their efforts and output should be evaluated. Sure, there’s little wow from the kitchen, which turns out treatments of salmon, sea bass and roasted chicken that, while not quite losers, are definitely snoozers. But I was delighted to find chicken livers in my frisée aux lardons, making the frisée’s real purpose — as gluttony’s camouflage — all the more transparent. I was smitten with the coq au vin, in which I encountered more bacon, along with a bevy of mushrooms. I was blown away by a side of spinach — and that’s a statement I never imagined making — because it was sort of creamed, sort of not and, in its irresolution, sort of magnificent. And I relished a chocolate and coffee tart, which was more intense, although less flamboyant, than a floating island also among the desserts. All of that was fare I sampled in the evening. I actually prefer Bar Boulud during the day, when it serves an amazing Croque Monsieur and a fantastic Croque Madame, so cheesy and luscious they seem to be experiencing delusions of quiche grandeur. Daniel Boulud finding more glory in lunchtime sandwiches than in dinnertime lamb stew? It’s a new era, and Bar Boulud belongs to it.

362,Second Avenue Deli,1 star,"Feb. 13, 2008",Frank Bruni,Kips Bay,Deli,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/13/dining/reviews/13rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/13/dining/reviews/13rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IN time, we’d get to the pastrami sandwich, and we’d quibble over its height and quarrel about condiments. Condiments are personal. But first came the matzo ball soup and the chopped liver. Already, consensus eluded us. Ed deemed the entire soup good, while Nora reserved her praise for the perfectly round, snowy matzo ball itself. But Laura couldn’t get on board with any of it. She found the soup too salty, the ball too weighty. Ed liked the liver well enough, while Nora thought it should be chunkier, like the liver at her beloved Barney Greengrass. Laura had a broader plaint. She grouped restaurant chopped liver with store-bought birthday cake: inherent failures. “They have to be made at home,” she said. Nora said: “That is so untrue!  My grandmother’s chopped liver and the chopped liver at Barney Greengrass are on a par with each other. I’m not kidding.” We were at the Second Avenue Deli, newly reopened and newly misnamed, since it’s now on East 33rd Street near Third Avenue. But its location doesn’t matter. What does is that after a two-year absence it’s back, rejoining Katz’s and the Carnegie among a handful of old-timers devoted to Jewish deli food, which isn’t just about eating. It’s about tradition, nostalgia and (my favorite part) the sport of friendly bickering over what’s orthodox, what’s not, whether there’s room in this short life for lean sandwich meat and who has the best tongue in town. So for lunch there recently I recruited three latke-loving New Yorkers with appetites and opinions: Ed Koch, the former mayor; Nora Ephron, the writer and movie director; and Laura Shapiro, the author of several books about culinary history. The Second Avenue Deli we visited is about half the size of the East Village original, which lasted from 1954 to early 2006, when it was done in by rising rents. A nephew of the original owner is in charge, and he’s made changes, but not too many. He’s added smoked fish appetizers. On every table sits a free bowl of gribenes, chicken skin fried in chicken fat. In the past you had to ask for it. Now you just have to atone for it. The restaurant remains kosher, unlike Katz’s and the Carnegie, and still prides itself on cooking as well as sandwich making, a vanity supported by the meaty kreplach and the chicken soup, brimming with fresh dill, that I had at a later  lunch. But Ed, Nora, Laura and I focused instead on the foods that each of us  associated most closely with the Second Avenue Deli. “It had a great hot dog,” Nora said of its East Village incarnation, “with a major skin thing happening, and a burst of juicy meat inside.” She had a dreamy look. When the waiter swung by, she  asked: “What’s the hot dog situation?” The waiter said flatly, “We have them.” She pressed for details. “It’s not skinless,” he said, “so it gives a nice crackle.” Her eyes widened. “This is very exciting!” she said. “You’re saying the right words! You’re singing the song!” After two bites of it, she judged the texture ideal, the seasoning less so. “I’m looking for more garlic,” she said. “I’m looking for more, more, more courage in this hot dog.” The brisket was a bigger hit, especially with me and even more so with Ed, who homed in on its transcendent virtue. “I happen to like fatty delicatessen,” he said as he bit into the fatty, messy sandwich, which he washed down with Cel-Ray soda. He had made a bib of his napkin, and wore it over his blue dress shirt and gold-striped tie. “I will order the fattiest pastrami they make,” he said of his approach to deli food, and I nodded. I saw Nora and Laura nodding too. On this we agreed: life was too short to go any other route. Our pastrami  — on rye  — turned out to be plenty fatty. It was borscht red. It glistened. The machine-carved meat was also stacked very tall, which troubled Nora. “One of the reasons I like Barney Greengrass so much is that they don’t overload the sandwich like this,” she said. “This is veering into Carnegie country.” “I grew up poor,” said Ed. “I like overloading.” “See how many schools of thought there are when it comes to delicatessen?” Nora said. “It’s like a religion, and it has sects.” Both Ed and Nora swooned over the meat itself, tender and smoky. Nora expressed relief, saying that a few years ago she’d had a pastrami sandwich at the Second Avenue Deli that “tasted like steamed rubber bands.” Laura said that it could be spicier. “The mustard brings everything out,” she said, “so maybe that’s O.K. But if you’re a purist you want to eat it plain.” “No, no, no!” said Nora. “A purist eats a pastrami sandwich on rye with mustard.” She was adamant. I was ashamed. Should I confess that I, too, wasn’t much for mustard? I was saved by the   latke, whose arrival  shut down conversation about all else. It was scary: bigger than my foot, with an inside like cold mashed potatoes. “It’s a school of latke,” Nora shrugged. “The hockey-puck school.” “This is shocking,” said Laura. “Shocking.” “You’re going with ‘shocking,’ Laura?” Nora teased, then wondered if there was rice pudding for dessert. Nope. There was chocolate rugelach, which Nora said wasn’t quite as good as the raisin rugelach at Zabar’s. Laura mentioned something about a deli near Boston, where she grew up. Ed flashed back to corned beef and knishes from the different boroughs and decades in his life. And I realized that we weren’t so much eating in a specific restaurant as passing through a communal storehouse of memories, on a bridge of babkas from the past to the future. Ed, the most deeply rooted New Yorker among us, said that at the Second Avenue Deli, “I feel very much at home.” “I walk out,” he said, “and I feel warm, no matter how cold it is.” Second Avenue Deli * 162 East 33rd Street.; (212) 689-9000.

363,Ilili,1 star,"Jan. 30, 2008",Frank Bruni,NoMad,Middle Eastern,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/dining/reviews/30rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/30/dining/reviews/30rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IN addition to its considerable charms, intermittent disappointments and svelte-letter palindrome of a name, the new restaurant Ilili presents a case study: how do you try to turn a medium-profile cuisine into a big-time event? The answer isn’t revelatory to anyone who’s been foraging in trendy, splashy New York restaurants in recent years. You throw foie gras at the problem. Raw tuna, too. You write a menu that permits diners to build a nibble-of-this, nibble-of-that meal from a lengthy succession of small plates. You add pulsing music and lavish décor. And you set aside a prime chunk of space for the bar area, where you serve cocktails with catchy, cheeky names. Anyone for a “not-so-bloody martini?” Or is the “from Beirut with passion” more to your taste? The latter drink’s tag sounds like the working title for a James Bond script with a double-crossing belly dancer in the mix. The drink itself weds passion fruit purée and vodka in a bowl of a glass deep enough for an entire university of goldfish. And the city it references is the giveaway of Ilili’s geographic orientation. In this theater of more than 300 seats, about a third of them in an amber-glowing main dining room whose walls resemble a network of illuminated cubbyholes, Lebanese food gets the sort of stylish trappings accorded to Thai at Kittichai, Chinese at Buddakan and Japanese at Megu, Matsuri and so many other mega-restaurants around town. In fact Ilili is probably the atmospherically grandest excursion into Middle Eastern cooking that New York has seen, easily surpassing Layla, the Drew Nieporent production that ran for many years in the TriBeCa spot now inhabited by Centrico, which replaced hummus with guacamole. It’s intent on giving that cooking  — or rather a tweaked, contemporary version of it  — a newly luxe sheen. Its strategies for doing so aren’t particularly daring. Foie gras is  folded into spiced ground beef to create a kafta, or elongated meatball, that goes for $24 per enjoyably decadent skewer. There’s the inevitable unveiling of a Lebanese tuna tartare, which combines  — to modestly appealing effect  — bluefin tuna with couscous, mint and parsley, among other ingredients. And the kebab choices include not only lamb and chicken, but also wagyu beef. That’s a way of telegraphing class, and of pushing the average check appreciably higher than if the very fine baba ghanouj, which is smartly studded with pomegranate seeds, and the crunchy, light falafel were allowed to command center stage. The chef in charge of Ilili’s mix of traditional and untraditional fare is Philippe Massoud, who previously cooked at Neyla in Washington. I once lived just a few blocks away, and dropped by frequently for the sultry crowd and killer mojitos. Neyla, at least then, was Beirut by way of Havana. Ilili is Beirut by way of Istanbul and Athens and even Barcelona: a broad swath of the Mediterranean comes into play, though the tropes, scents and seasonings of the Middle East remain squarely in the foreground. Several dishes get a splash of tahini or a dose of a zaatar, a spice mixture showcasing thyme and sumac, and in the case of sautéed black cod, the dose was fatal, overwhelming the fish. Lamb plays a recurring role, appearing as succulent cubes of grilled loin on a bed of pita; in bouncy, juicy and vibrantly spiced mekanek, or sausage; and mixed with beef inside Lilliputian purses of pasta known as manti. The manti were a muddle, their yogurt dressing excessive. The menu is essentially divided into four categories. The first is for meatless dishes, including the falafel, the baba ghanouj, hummus (silky and lemony) and tabbouleh (with parsley getting more play than bulgur). In general Mr. Massoud does better with these sorts of straightforward dishes and preparations than with more creative riffs. The second category, for fish, proves the point. Like the black cod, branzino suffered from too assertive an intervention  — in its case, tahini, blood orange, orange blossom water and more. But red mullet, fried and touched with just a bit of tahini and lemon, was superb. The third category, for meat, is a similar see-saw between joys (fried beef kebbeh with a wealth of pine nuts) and sorrows, none sorrier than the duck schwarma. Duck is another of the proteins restaurateurs deploy to add cachet to a cuisine. Mr. Massoud would have been wise to present it in a less oily, overcooked guise. But the fourth category of the menu, devoted to kebabs and kaftas cooked over a charcoal grill, is a nearly unbroken chain of successes. All the meats I sampled  — the lamb loin; the beef with foie gras; chicken  — were juicy, smoky and flavorful. Despite missteps elsewhere on the menu, Mr. Massoud is running a kitchen capable of discipline and finesse. In recent days the Ilili menu was changed in a way that suggests a possible shift in diners’ appetites. Many of the dishes previously available only as small plates can now be ordered as main courses. That’s the same kind of adjustment made by the restaurant Tailor after it, too, had been open a few months. Restaurateurs are apparently discovering that some diners are wary of grazing and ready to linger over larger portions, and that it’s no sweat to present different sizes for different sensibilities. Desserts at Ilili come in just one size, and my favorite among the concise lot of them is the essmalieh, a sweet, creamy nest of shredded phylo pastry with the scent of roses. Make it the coda to a dinner focused on the first and fourth categories of the menu and you’re in for a very good night, provided you can relax in a setting this vast, this potentially noisy and, in terms of the service and the flow of human traffic, this occasionally confused. I suppose a certain degree of chaos goes with the territory.  I’m alluding not to the political turbulence of the Middle East, but to the dining rituals of Manhattan.

364,Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill,2 star,"Jan. 16, 2008",Frank Bruni,Clinton,"American, Asian",https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/dining/reviews/16rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/16/dining/reviews/16rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THERE are rules by which a vigilant diner lives. There are dictums of common sense. You don’t order the pan-roasted mahi-mahi at a restaurant that prides itself on steaks. You don’t order the shrimp tempura roll at a restaurant that showcases marrow bones and fried chicken. And at a restaurant that serves and celebrates all of the above (as if such a restaurant could be imagined)? You run. You run for the hills. But rules are made to be broken, and there’s a compelling reason for breaking them just a half block from Columbus Circle. In defiance of common sense, this restaurant’s  menu includes everything I just mentioned. Against all odds, every one of those things is terrific. I have to qualify the odds part: there’s actually cause to suspect that this juggling act will work. It’s performed by Eric and Bruce Bromberg, who’ve been practicing their bold culinary eclecticism for more than 15 years. They’re the Blue Ribbon brothers, and their new  venture, Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill, in the shadow of the Time Warner Center, is a compendium of the many Blue Ribbons before it. With about 115 seats, it’s the biggest of the five Blue Ribbon restaurants  —six if you count the market on Bedford Street  — in Manhattan. (Another two abut each other in Park Slope, Brooklyn.) With more than 100 cold and hot dishes, chops and fillets, and sushi and sashimi tableaux, it’s also the deepest, broadest grab bag of the bunch. But it’s of a piece with its predecessors, which speak in the unpretentious voice of the unbound Brombergs. Their come-on usually goes something like this: Here’s the kind of stuff that we like to eat and that we think we make well. It’s a magical mystery tour of our culinary affections from our New Jersey boyhoods through our education at the Cordon Bleu in Paris up to the present. Retrace the route if you like. See if it’s as much fun for you as for us. It frequently is, and the fun started in 1992, when the Brombergs opened the Blue Ribbon in SoHo on Sullivan between Prince and Spring streets. It dared to supplement country pâté with matzo ball soup, raw-bar platters with pu-pu platters. I went back for a pu-pu the other night, and found myself warming a chicken drumette over a blue-orange flame. I felt like I was 11 again, and I felt great. The following night I dropped by Blue Ribbon Downing St. Bar, the littlest Ribbon. It opened last February, preceding the Columbus Circle outpost by nine months. I had a slider stacked with musky goat meat; toast spread with honey and Manchego; a deviled egg of sorts with a confetti of pickled peppers on top. Has Spain captured the Brombergs’ fancy? Downing St. Bar is essentially an Americanized tapas bar  — and an irresistible one at that  — with an expansive list of wines from pretty much every wine-making country that matters. That’s another Bromberg blessing: serious attention to wine, creatively selected and accessibly priced. Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill tests whether the Blue Ribbon charm can translate in a large-scale setting uptown, which is new turf for the Brombergs. During my initial visits I had doubts. I had to traverse the lackluster lobby of the 6 Columbus hotel to get to the restaurant, a series of windowless rooms with pale wood everywhere you look. It could be Kublai Khan’s sauna. Service was rocky. The restaurant repeatedly ran out of dishes  on a list of specials tucked inside the regular menu, and servers repeatedly failed to mention that fact until minutes after the dishes had been ordered. But that stopped happening as the restaurant matured. And the food has been consistently first-rate. Much of it also reflects the Brombergs’ winning playfulness. On the Japanese side of things, the Brombergs and their sushi chef, Toshi Ueki, present what they call whole fish sashimi, arranging the artfully carved squiggles and dominoes of flesh (flying fish one night, sea bream another) around the fish’s skeleton. They also provide a make-it-yourself assembly kit for hand rolls: rectangles of nori; white rice; a tangle of shiso; and petals of salmon, tuna, yellowtail and more. The composition of each roll is up to you. In terms of pure quality, Blue Ribbon’s sushi and sashimi aren’t among  the very best in town. In terms of basic deliciousness, the fried chicken, made with matzo meal in the crunchy coating and seasoned with paprika and sansho pepper, may well be. The Brombergs are clever, concocting a dynamite sauce of cream, sake, miso and cracked black pepper  — it tastes like a low-impact Asian béarnaise  — for a gorgeous New York strip steak. The steak, grilled, came with onion tempura: a low-impact Asian answer to onion rings. The mahi-mahi got a sauce that essentially tweaks a beurre blanc by substituting sake for white wine and ginger root for shallots, then adding fermented plum. It had richness, faint sweetness and zip, and the tender fish was beautifully cooked. So that you don’t have to tunnel for it, the marrow comes in bones split lengthwise, and the shaved bonito and fried shiso with it do everything you want coarse salt to do and much more. The Blue Ribbon restaurants sought to popularize marrow bones before many other New York restaurants followed suit, and they still have a special way with them. Desserts aren’t especially distinctive, and the kitchen seems never to ace a meal from start to finish. One night the salt-and-pepper shrimp were overcooked; another night the shrimp dumplings were somewhat leaden. In a restaurant of this scale with a menu this diverse, that’s probably inevitable. And the freewheeling spirit of the place, which serves that entire menu from noon until 2 a.m. and doesn’t take reservations, poses an additional strain on consistency. But for now the Brombergs are doing an impressive job, their spicy lobster sushi roll and their star anise-marinated pork chop making equal claims for attention  — and proving equally deserving of it. That’s not the norm, but the Blue Ribbon brood has never put much stock in conformity.

365,Barbuto,1 star,"Jan. 9, 2008",Frank Bruni,West Village,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/dining/reviews/09rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/dining/reviews/09rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I’VE had the roasted chicken at Barbuto when snow was blowing against the restaurant’s glass walls, and I’ve had it when summer sun streamed through. I’ve had it before 6:30 p.m., when the restaurant was just stirring, and after 10:30, when it was at full tilt. I’ve had the roasted chicken when it came with the salsa verde, which leans hard on parsley and basil, and I’ve had it with a mixture of lemon and juices from the roasting pan, which is how Barbuto serves it around this time of year. I’ve had it after a salad, when I was ravenous, and after spaghetti carbonara, when I wasn’t. None of this made any difference. I’ve devoured it every time, because it’s always been terrific: crunchy, meaty, tender, glossed with oil. Over the four years since Barbuto opened in a former car garage with concrete floors on the western fringes of the West Village, this restaurant has developed a track record with roasted chicken so impressive that it’s arguably cause for scientific study. It’s certainly cause for a review. It’s also cause for befuddlement, because so much else about Barbuto is so much less reliable. When my colleague Eric Asimov wrote about it in the “$25 and Under” column in The Times in early 2004, he bemoaned inconsistency in its cooking and service, and that problem apparently wasn’t just due to a wobbly start. It persists, undercutting the restaurant’s formidable charms, which nonetheless manage to win out in the end. And it was joined recently by a new annoyance, a jolting example of culinary self-congratulation in a city now largely accustomed to them. While more than a few chefs have displayed copies of their latest books, Jonathan Waxman, the chef at Barbuto and its co-owner, went  further, putting a gigantic picture of his book’s cover over the bar. You couldn’t miss the title: “A Great American Cook.” But if you somehow did, it was also at the top of the menu, where a plug for the book (“now available: $35”) preceded the list of the night’s dishes. In restaurant circles Mr. Waxman, 57, has long been a vivid figure, adept not only at poultry  — he’s been linked to noteworthy chicken for decades  — but also at weaving a mystique around himself. The restaurants in his past —  Chez Panisse  in the 1970s, Jams in  the 1980s — are legendary. But in opening Barbuto, he decided to give his cooking, which is rooted in California cuisine and puts a premium on seasonal ingredients, a humbler showcase. With its unfussy Italian orientation and shuffling spirit, Barbuto seems designed to let him wind down, his aggressive book promotion notwithstanding. Those exterior glass walls — actually garage doors — roll up and down, a gift on warm nights. Not all the chairs match. And the open kitchen isn’t a neatly framed stage set; it’s just a bunch of guys moving fast and making noise near a really big oven. In the coolest way possible Barbuto (the name is the Italian word for bearded) feels wholly relaxed, and that’s a big part of why I’ve eaten here so often. But I’ve also been drawn by the possibility of a satisfying meal for a price that’s not stratospheric. It’s higher than at the start, when critics complimented Barbuto for keeping all entrees under $20 and most appetizers under $10. Now the median price for an entree is about $25, but you can still get the chicken for $19. What’s more, your chances of a meal that’s much more than satisfying improve substantially if you learn the tics of Mr. Waxman’s rapidly changing menu and obey a few rules. The appetizers  — usually about a half dozen, among them several salads  — should get less of your attention than the few pasta dishes. The kitchen’s rustic strengths come through in its hearty ragùs. Gnocchi were sauced with sweet pork sausage. The ragù on top of rigatoni had hunks of wild boar. But a lighter dish of lemony spaghetti tossed with sweet shrimp from Maine was just as memorable. In fact it was a knockout, the tiny shrimp cooked only slightly, so that none of their sweetness or delicacy was lost. Among main courses, I’ve had good experiences with fish, done  on a plancha that the kitchen, upgraded over time, didn’t initially have. Pork and duck have been uneven. A better bet is beef. Barbuto favors hanger or skirt steaks. It accessorizes  them with olives or onions or chili peppers or combinations of those, putting salt and heat into play. The best end to a meal is  the restaurant’s creamy, sharp chocolate budino, or pudding, the only dessert that comes through time and again. It’s the rightful coda to the chicken. The chicken is Rule No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 of eating at Barbuto. It’s Rule No. 4 as well. I called Mr. Waxman to ask him the secret. He said the birds aren’t sourced from some obscure provider; they’re Bell & Evans organic chickens from Pennsylvania. He cuts them in half, salts and peppers them, and throws them in the oven. The oven, he said, is crucial. He bought it from “a wacky dude in upstate New York” whose design  — a steel outside, a brick inside, two decks  — creates different areas with different temperatures, ranging from 500 to more than 1,000 degrees. The chicken cooks at about 500. That ensures crisp skin, and that means a cooking time short enough so that all the  chickens can be made to order. As Mr. Waxman went through this, he cast himself less as a great American cook than as someone who had great luck shopping for kitchen equipment. How self-effacing. And how typical of Barbuto, where you can never be entirely sure what you’ll encounter, unless  your path heads straight for the poultry.",
366,Harry Cipriani,0.25 star,"Nov. 14, 2007",Frank Bruni,Upper East Side,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/dining/reviews/14rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/dining/reviews/14rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"OVER the years the Cipriani restaurant family and its employees have faced charges of sexual harassment, insurance fraud and tax evasion, the last leading to  guilty pleas by two family members in July. But the crime that comes to mind first when I think of the Ciprianis is highway robbery. Based on my recent experience, that’s what happens almost any time Harry Cipriani on Fifth Avenue serves lunch or dinner. In this gleaming room in the Sherry-Netherland hotel, the Ciprianis charge $22.95 for asparagus vinaigrette — 12 medium-size spears, neither white, truffle-flecked nor even Parmesan-bedecked — and $34.95 for an appetizer of fried calamari. That’s at dinnertime, I should clarify. At lunch there’s a whopping $1 discount per dish. A dinner entree of fritto misto costs $48.95, even though it amounted to an extra-large portion of fried calamari with a few decorative shrimp and token scallops strewn, to negligible effect, among the generic calamari rings. I assure you of the accuracy of those numbers, and of these: $66.95 for a sirloin, $36.95 for lasagna, $18.95 for minestrone. It’s tempting to devote the rest of this review to a price list. Nothing else I can present is nearly as compelling. Besides, prices are the point of Harry Cipriani, which exists to affirm its patrons’ ability to throw away money. It’s the epitome of a restaurant whose steep tariffs justify themselves, subbing for membership dues and assuring that the spouse, in-law, client or canine psychic being treated to a $16.95 piece of chocolate cake will be impressed. Regulars accept and revel in this, or have bit by bit deluded themselves into believing that the $36.95 spaghetti with tomato and basil has something special to recommend it. (Trust me: it doesn’t.) But what of the uninitiated New Yorker or innocent tourist who sees the Cipriani name, with its connotations of extravagant banquets and extraordinary privilege, and waltzes through the doors expecting something magnificent in return for a king’s ransom? These victims in the offing deserve a heads-up on what they’re likely to find, which is service so confused and food so undistinguished it wouldn’t pass muster at half the cost. During one of my dinners, servers first tried to deliver another table’s veal chop to ours, then began to deliver our entrees before they had cleared our appetizers. Another night servers gave me rabbit although I had asked for duck, and then, after a profuse apology, neglected to bring my companions and me one of our desserts. But what I remember most vividly about that particular night is the potatoes. And I hasten to add that I’m taking it on faith that they were potatoes. That’s what they visually suggested, those desiccated yellow-beige coins that had somehow acquired the texture of Brillo and could almost have been used to scrub whatever pan they had emerged from. They weren’t, in fairness, representative of the restaurant’s other vegetables, like the assortment in a transcendently vapid risotto alla primavera, cooked to a state of depressing flaccidity. But while the veggies can be mush, the empire seems to be solid: bigger than ever and growing all the time. This past summer the family opened the restaurant Club 55, which joined its many other gilded dining establishments in Manhattan. Outside New York the Ciprianis have restaurants in London and Hong Kong, and they’re establishing resort hotels in Miami Beach and Beverly Hills. Of course it all goes back to the 1930’s and to Harry’s Bar in Venice, where the bellini and beef carpaccio were reputedly born. But on this side of the Atlantic, the progenitor and lodestar is the Fifth Avenue clubhouse, which opened in 1985 and was last reviewed in The Times in 1991, when Bryan Miller raised it to two stars from one. It’s a different restaurant now, literally. In June 2005 it closed for renovations, and when it reopened last May, the visible changes included more than fresh coats of lacquer on the lustrouus wood-paneled walls. The bar had been moved to the northern side of the restaurant, a rearrangement that helped make way for about 30 additional seats. The hosts can now cram about 130 people in. And cram they do. At times they place the Frisbee-size tables for four so tightly together that Harry Cipriani seems to be doing an haute impersonation of Prune or the Spotted Pig. It’s a bizarre mix of indulgence and deprivation, the crisp white jackets on the servers communicating an ostentation that’s contradicted by plenty else, including the brusque manner in which those servers sometimes hustle diners through a meal. Even in an enclave this expensive, there are things seemingly done on the cheap. I can’t think of a credible motive other than cost saving for serving an appetizer of turkey tonnato in place of veal tonnato. That’s for $27.95. Although steak Rossini typically involves foie gras, what Harry Cipriani puts on top of a gigantic (and, it should be noted, juicy) filet mignon are chicken livers, chalky when I had them. That’s for $55.95. Among the scores of straightforward dishes, some had appeal. Calf’s liver was flavorful, veal sweetbreads tender and roasted branzino moist. I liked the oil-glossed octopus carpaccio, and cakes were dependably fluffy. But the kitchen’s blunders outnumbered its successes, which were modest in any case. The wan tomatoes beside buffalo milk mozzarella didn’t have a drop of sweetness. Main courses of lamb and salmon were overcooked, as were the meats in several pasta sauces, including an oily veal ragù over green tagliardi. Pasta sauces by and large were washouts, seldom registering much presence or any nuance. An amatriciana had no zest, no zip, and the meat in it looked and tasted not like guanciale or pancetta but like ordinary cubed ham. The selection of wines by the glass — a small carafe, really — is pathetic, and that fabled bellini is $19.95 for a restrained ration of white peach juice and prosecco. But the people-watching is nonpareil. You rarely see blondness this improbable, cosmetology this transparent, wealth this flamboyantly misspent. And while that isn’t cause enough to visit Harry Cipriani, it’s consolation if you must. Harry Cipriani POOR In the Sherry-Netherland hotel, 781 Fifth Avenue, (60th Street); (212) 753-5566.

367,Moim,1 star,"Oct. 24, 2007",Frank Bruni,Park Slope,Korean,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IN an age of countless food bloggers and tireless restaurant scouts, I’m not sure how a worthy restaurant winds up flying under the radar anymore. But that’s where the new Korean restaurant Moim finds itself, no doubt against its wishes, certainly against its interests. It opened in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn four months ago, the gutsy dream of a talented chef who came to professional cooking late in life, and it hasn’t attracted much notice since. During my recent visits no more than half of the 60 or so seats in its front lounge area and back dining room were filled. That’s a shame, and that should change. Moim does a tempered, tweaked version of Korean cooking that’s still rarer — still more of an exciting discovery — than you’d expect, given all the Momofuku mania. Many of its dishes, distinguished by a beautifully modulated and lingering heat, are compelling. Most are at least satisfying. They’re served in the kind of sleek, contemporary setting well suited to young urbanites who favor drinks with -tini suffixes. Moim even has such drinks: sojutinis, which use the clear Korean liquor soju in place of vodka, come in a half-dozen flavors and are terrific. And the prices at Moim — $4 to $10 for small plates, $8 to $22 for larger ones — amply reflect its liberation from Manhattan rents. With a little more maturation, a rethinking of a bit of its menu and better service, Moim could join the increasingly populous club of Brooklyn restaurants, like Franny’s and Al di Là, that Manhattanites rightly and badly covet. Upscale Korean food remains a relatively somnolent genre, no matter the borough: many diners haven’t moved far past the grill-it-yourself, Woo Lae Oak branch of the cuisine. And while Moim’s grilled beef ribs — marinated in sake, mirin and a vegetable stock infused with pears and apples — are a tender wonder, the menu reaches in less conservative directions as well. The restaurant’s chef and owner, Saeri Yoo Park, uses kimchi — that spicy, tangy tangle of fermented vegetables — in many of her dishes, where you’ll be happy to find it. Pan-fried dumplings are stuffed not only with ground pork but also with kimchi and tofu, another staple of Korean cuisine that Ms. Park eagerly embraces. Tofu, kimchi and pork are stir-fried together for another appetizer that, like so many dishes, has exactly as much heat as you want and not a flicker more. In terms of the amount of Korean red pepper paste that Ms. Park puts into the kimchi and the pork marinade, her judgment is flawless. Two of the best appetizers, though, are less fiery ones. A tricolor salad of pickled bell flower root (red), blanched watercress (green) and braised water fern (brown) has all sorts of tart, salty and nutty currents, thanks to strategic deployments of vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil and sesame seeds. And a mix of crab and bouncy noodles made from a kelp gelée has a fleeting, fugitive, now-you-taste-it-now-you-don’t sweetness. What’s its source? Cubes of chayote squash are pickled with sugar, and there’s a dusting of crystallized ginger. These dishes spark the appetite without sating it. For sating, the superb bi bim bop, a classic Korean rice dish, does the trick. At Moim it comes in a broad, majestic stone bowl that brims with shiitake, zucchini, carrot and chunks of marinated flank steak, not to mention a big poof of fried seaweed on top. A thick sauce with potent blasts of red pepper and garlic generously coats the rice at the bottom of the bowl. Some dishes at Moim don’t go with the rest of the menu. They’re mainstays of the modern New York restaurant that  haven’t been adequately passed through Ms. Park’s Korean prism. An underseasoned duck entree, which was also overcooked when I had it, is one example. The spicy chicken wings, no more distinctive than the spicy chicken wings at restaurants of other ethnicities, are another. They’re a sop, a surrender. Sometimes a chef just has to go with the conformist flow. Given Ms. Park’s prudent realization of that, what’s amiss? Moim means gathering; why aren’t more people gathering here? The service is a serious issue. On several visits the time that elapsed between our waiter’s visits to the table was so great — and those visits took on such a rare, eventful air — that my companions and I came to think of him as a comet. More than once one of us asked another: “Any idea where Halley is?” I think Moim also suffers from having an entrance a few dozen feet from Seventh Avenue and not on the main artery itself. And Ms. Park hasn’t found ways to give the restaurant a vibe as exciting as the best of its food. She’s new to this. A Korean immigrant who worked for 13 years as a graphic designer, she decided six years ago to become a professional cook, enrolling in the French Culinary Institute. Jobs as a line cook at Spice Market and Café Gray followed. And in June, at the age of 48, she dared to open her own place. Its shortcomings suggest she has a way to go as a restaurateur. Its strengths demonstrate that as a chef she has traveled an impressive distance already. Moim * 206 Garfield Place (Seventh Avenue), Park Slope, Brooklyn; (718) 499-8092;  moimrestaurant.com.

368,Gemma,1 star,"Sept. 26, 2007",Frank Bruni,East Village,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/26/dining/reviews/26rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/26/dining/reviews/26rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THERE must at this point be a glossy instruction manual titled “Italian Restaurants for the Equinox Set”  — they’re the arugula, artichoke and orecchiette stations  that youthful New Yorkers visit after crunching, spinning or downward-dogging themselves into pasta-worthy states  — and the folks at Gemma evidently have it in their mitts. In fact their grip on it is so tight, their knuckles must be white. It decrees fried squash blossoms, swollen with a warm white cheese. It makes a strong case for fritto misto, though the misto being fritto are subject to the chef’s discretion and ambition. It suggests imported burrata, filleted branzino, chicken cooked under a brick and a veal chop cut extra thick. The setting should have studied rustic details  — tables that look instantly old, ceilings with chunky wood beams  — but an overall, paradoxical polish: trattoria chic. These are the makings of Gemma, a cheat sheet of a restaurant whose proprietors take fewer risks than a hurricane-insurance agent in Nebraska. They’ve turned to a fundamentally earnest cuisine for calculated purposes, and they know that many diners sprinting to the newest hot spot don’t really want to find anything new. They want reassurance that they’ve mastered what’s worth knowing. That applied to knockoffs of French bistros and brasseries in past decades and it applies to post-red-sauce evocations of Italian enotecas, osterias and the like in this one. The moment-conscious diner now talks of salumi, not charcuterie, and if he or she is feeling blue, it’s for Gorgonzola more often than Roquefort (with Cabrales making inroads). Nothing confirmed this shift better than the opening in February of Morandi, where the restaurateur Keith McNally, an enduring arbiter of downtown gastro-cool, turned away from France and toward Italy. Gemma recalls Morandi in many ways, but it’s Morandi with a chef, Chris D’Amico,  less accomplished  than Morandi’s Jody Williams. It’s also Morandi in a smarter, sexier outfit, with more charismatic,  fluid service. That’s its saving grace. While not too many dishes rise far above pleasant and some don’t reach that bar, Gemma has an unlabored panache that makes an evening go down very easy. When I and several similarly long-winded  friends rose to leave on the last of my visits, we were stunned to discover we’d spent more than four hours in one of the restaurant’s comfy semi-circular booths. The tables here aren’t scrunched together as tightly as they could be, and the noise level is more bearable than at many fashionable peers. Gemma is on the ground level of the new Bowery Hotel, which has put the words Bowery and fashionable closer together  than they ever seemed destined to be. Two of the main proprietors of the hotel and restaurant are Sean MacPherson and Eric Goode, who are also behind the revamped Waverly Inn. They joined forces with Graydon Carter on that project. On this one they get an assist from Taavo Somer, one of the owners of Freemans. He  provided design input, so he must get  at least partial credit (I mean that sincerely) for all the candles. Gemma loves candles the way Liberace did. There’s one big fat candle flickering on each table  — no tentative votives for Gemma  — and rows of big fat candles on high shelves, each cylinder of wax unlighted and fixed in a half-melted state, its drippings dangling low like stalactites. They reflect an attention to detail that’s not always evident in the food, which is distributed, inevitably, across a profusion of menu categories. From a category for crudi you can order sea bream with crispy sage and pine nuts or sea bass with capers and grapefruit, both served on beds of ice, a theatrical flourish that  rendered the fish too cold. A cluster of serviceable crostini has topping options that include lardo, chicken liver purée and a black olive tapenade with goat cheese. An array of cured meats (capocollo, soppressata, prosciutto di Parma) hangs together in another section of the menu, while 10 cheeses (taleggio, La Tur, Asiago vecchio) congregate in yet another. The squash blossoms  — or zucchini flowers, in Gemma’s parlance and case — are among the antipasti, and they were terrific: crunchy, and oozing with ricotta and Parmesan. Some of that crunch would have improved the fritto misto, which starred calamari and  overcooked shrimp. Gemma has a wood-fired pizza oven, which works best as a design element. The pies I tried, including a classic margherita and a heartier mix of spicy sausage and onions, had floppy, one-dimensional crusts. But among the pasta dishes and main courses, there was plenty to savor. Soft, light gnocchi met a meaty Bolognese, while the rich, salty sauce of pork sausage, tomatoes and cream over one night’s special of squiggly strozzapreti was superb. Twice I had the chicken, and twice it was impeccable: crisp skin, tender meat. A grilled rib-eye  — juicy on one visit, drier the next  — didn’t hold up as well. Gemma went two-for-three with seafood entrees, the bland swordfish spiedini, or kebabs, being the only disappointment. A fillet of grilled salmon, served with white asparagus, had more flavor than salmon often does these days. And the branzino, roasted and served on a cedar plank, had an almost buttery texture that made me want to take a spoon rather than a fork to it. I wanted to take a shovel to a dessert calzone filled with ricotta and Nutella, the kind of shameless crowd-pleaser to which a table of otherwise civilized diners lays quick, messy waste. It’s a better bet than an almond cake or a mascarpone tart. Gemma isn’t reaching out to epicures, who will likely be turned off by  a no-reservations policy that’s clearly meant to ratchet up the hubbub at the long copper-topped bar, where people waiting for tables jostle and pose. They’re expert at it. And they’re rewarded by well-mixed drinks, including a classic of prosecco, Aperol and club soda  that’s an aptly fizzy pause before a pretty hostess shows the way to an attractive table, where the food won’t prove much of a distraction. That’s by design, and by the book. Gemma * In the Bowery Hotel, 335 Bowery (Third Street); (212) 505-9100.

369,Peter Luger Steak House,2 star,"Sept. 19, 2007",Frank Bruni,Williamsburg,Steak Houses,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/19/dining/reviews/19rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/19/dining/reviews/19rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE restaurant Peter Luger has been around for an astonishing 120 years. None of them have paid it the kind of tribute that the last five have. One after another, Luger clones have opened, operated by former Luger cooks or managers or waiters, all of whom trumpet their association with it, all of whom appropriate its traditions. Any day now I expect a news  release announcing that a Con Ed worker who checked Luger’s meter is starting a steakhouse, and I expect the menu to spotlight porterhouses for two, three or four, served with butter and blood pooling beneath them, reminiscent of the porterhouses at Luger. If imitation is indeed flattery, then Peter Luger Steak House has cause to blush for the next 120 years. But not to gloat, and not to coast, and I’m convinced that this venerated and venerable New York institution is doing some of both. I say that as someone who has loved it for a long time and wants to keep loving it but needs Luger to give me reasons: more consistent food than I’ve had there over the last few years, less dismissive service than I’ve encountered over the last few months. Has Luger grown tired of us? Or have some of us just grown tired of it? It’s certainly impossible not to be swayed by the proliferation of steakhouses in New York, so many of which Luger sired or inspired. What Luger serves we can get elsewhere  — at Wolfgang’s Steakhouse, Benjamin Steak House, Ben & Jack’s Steak House, Blair Perrone Steakhouse, MarkJoseph Steakhouse  — and while it may not be exactly the same, it’s sometimes close enough. We can get it in less brutally illuminated dining rooms and pay for it with credit cards, which Luger still doesn’t take. We can get it in more accessible locations. Or we can explore a new generation of steakhouses that have real wine lists  — it’s time, way past time, that Luger seriously upgraded its own  — and that are less narrowly focused on a mere handful of dishes. At Craftsteak we can begin a meal with terrific raw-bar selections. At BLT Steak we can have a side of sunchokes. At almost any of these other places we can receive service warmer than Luger’s. The dour crew at Luger’s host station should lighten up, and the waiters should learn the difference between swagger and menace. One of them punctuated a recent lunch there by hurling the restaurant’s signature chocolate coins at my companions and me, turning a before-you-go thank-you into a get-lost pelting. But on my next and last visit, a night when Luger summoned nearly all of its charms, a different waiter’s gruffness was pitch-perfect, a polished act instead of a peevish attitude. Three friends and I wondered whether one of us should order fish, just to try it. “Do you go to Hawaii to ski?” the waiter huffed, letting us know that the only sensible decision  was steak for four, along with creamed spinach, of course, and German potatoes, naturally. What a steak it was. Even before I saw it I could smell it  — the acrid top note of its char, the funky bottom note of properly aged beef. I could even hear it, still sizzling from its time in one of the high-temperature broilers. It was already sliced, and the waiter buckled down to the familiar Luger ritual, putting some filet and some sirloin  on each plate, then spooning the pooled juices over it. The beef had a subtle tang, an intense mineral quality, a crazy richness and a spectrum of textures: crunchy at the edges, tender at the bone. I had to keep reminding myself to take it easy, to slow down. No other steakhouse serves a porterhouse so breathtaking. In several visits leading up to that one, Luger didn’t, either. Sometimes the steaks had a pronounced char and sometimes just a faint one. Sometimes I could taste the aging of the beef, sometimes not. Sometimes they were medium-rare, just as I’d requested, and sometimes they were slightly overdone. I’ve traveled a similar road with Luger’s lunchtime hamburger, a mix of ground chuck and trimmings from the aged steaks. It was sumptuous on one occasion, serviceable on two. And while variability along these lines is common even at principled restaurants, it’s at odds with the legend that Luger trades on, with the ultra-high expectations it creates. It’s not something I recall from visits to Luger a decade ago, shortly after it received three stars in The Times from Ruth Reichl in 1995. And it opens the door to additional qualms. When the porterhouse is dead-on, I don’t notice how little sweetness there is in the fat slices of tomato with the fat slices of onion, even in the thick of tomato season. When the porterhouse is off, I do notice that, and I notice how excessively sweet the steak sauce is, along with how little flavor the shrimp cocktail has. I notice that the Caesar doesn’t have as cheesy and salty a punch as the one at Wolfgang’s. That the Canadian bacon, while satisfying, isn’t as smoky and juicy as at Harry’s Steak, where it comes on the bone. That the lamb chops, while robust, don’t hold a candle to the mutton chop at Keens Steakhouse. Luger has fierce competition, new and old. I’m certain its proprietors want it to be the best. I’m certain they care. They’re completing some renovations and adding another dining room. Whenever prime beef is in short supply, as it has been this year, they serve less of it rather than serving lesser meat. In late spring and early summer, for example, they scaled back the restaurant’s hours and the number of reservations it accepted. And to compensate for the dearth of top-notch porterhouses, they added a rib steak to the menu. I’m told they’ll keep it there, and they should. It was excellent both times I had it. They almost always get the fries right, making them thick and crisp enough to withstand the soggy plunge into the steak juices that many of us give them. They rightly present, among the desserts, an irresistible hot fudge sundae, because the only proper coda to gluttony on the scale of a Luger porterhouse, which impresses even when it doesn’t awe, is more gluttony. With these strong points Peter Luger keeps up with its progeny and its peers. But that’s not the same thing as staying ahead.

370,Soto,2 star,"Sept. 5, 2007",Frank Bruni,West Village,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/dining/reviews/05rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/dining/reviews/05rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IT’S a wonder humankind found its way to certain foods, given the homeliness of the creatures that bequeath them. The lobster? It’s like a waterlogged cockroach with a thyroid condition and a mean streak. The octopus? A grabby mutant better suited to a monster movie than a dinner plate. But the sea urchin may be the most repellent delicacy of all. It’s the hedgehog of the deep, a bristly orb that’s clearly designed to wave off the hungry, not to invite them to dig in. So I believe special thanks are due whoever first dared to scoop out its orange roe and discovered the haunting flavor  —  briny nuances, sweet undercurrents, an overarching richness  — of this inimitable grainy custard. And I believe that Sotohiro Kosugi would second me on this. Sea urchin roe  — or uni, as it’s known in Japanese cuisine  — appears in dish after dish at his new restaurant, Soto, an unipalooza like none I’ve encountered. Uni is spread like a sauce over thick sheets of yuba, or tofu skin, that recall pappardelle. It’s whipped with langoustine stock, miso and truffle oil for a mousse that caresses slender layers of steamed lobster. It’s also available in conventional, rice-bottomed pieces of sushi, but anyone who limits himself to Soto’s sushi and sashimi is missing not only the best of this restaurant but also the point of it. Go elsewhere for what you already know and like. Come here to eat more adventurously. Mr. Kosugi is an enterprising chef. He’s also a prickly one  — maybe he’s emulating his beloved urchin  — and you get some sense of that just by looking at him, a stern figure standing vigil behind the restaurant’s sushi bar, an odd expression of displeasure on his face. For 11 years he ran a restaurant in Atlanta, where he drew national attention, created a cult of local devotees  — one couple reportedly named their cat after their favorite dish  — and earned a reputation as a cold fish with a sporadically hot temper and a fastidious streak. According to an article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that bemoaned his departure from the city, he was known to bark at his staff and harrumph at customers with the audacity to ask for Diet Coke. When he traveled to Aspen, Colo., and prepared sushi at Food & Wine magazine’s annual showcase there, he placed the fish on pedestals of mashed potato because he worried that rice wouldn’t cook right at such a high altitude. The new theater that he has constructed for himself at sea level in Greenwich Village is minimalist, a white slip of a space with a long maple sushi counter on one side and tables at an even longer banquette on the other. One detail of the décor stands out: a peekaboo facade, facing Sixth Avenue, that permits only partial glimpses of what’s inside, creating an air of mystery and a promise of discovery for anyone who ventures beyond it. Soto keeps that promise. Many of the roughly 30 dishes spread across the first two pages of the menu, one devoted to cold plates and the other to warm ones, are vibrantly seasoned and intricately composed, works of culinary and visual art that make you pause before your first bite and pause anew between subsequent ones so that you can appreciate them as fully as they deserve to be. Arguably, the best of the cold dishes showcases  — you guessed it  — uni, pairing it with another of the ocean’s cosmetic outcasts. Slender petals of squid are arranged into the shape of a flower that’s about to bloom. The uni is the colorful secret in its folds, and there’s more color and luxuriance in a quail egg, perched on top of the flower, that ruptures as you peel the petals back. Soto underscores the sweetness of raw, almost translucent white shrimp by brightening them with yuzu, placing them in a broth inflected with the zip of ginger and the earthiness of shiitake, and adding salty notes of mullet roe. A salad of geoduck clam gets a bitter blast from spicy radish sprouts and nuttiness from sesame seeds, while Hawaiian kampachi tartare has a tier of crushed pine nuts above it and a soy sauce meringue beside it. At Soto the earth’s harvest is deftly pressed into the service of the sea’s. And the hot dishes, under the supervision of Mr. Kosugi’s wife, Maho, provide as much pleasure as the cold ones. An assortment of tempura (shrimp, asparagus, shiitake, kabocha squash) couldn’t be crisper or lighter. It reflects a yen for deep-frying that’s also evident in a whole deep-fried flounder; a deep-fried shrimp cake; and a combination of shiso-wrapped scallop and shiso-wrapped fluke, deep-fried and set in a shiitake broth. I loved the scallop, minty and succulent. Lobster is prepared several ways, one involving that remarkable uni mousse. But it’s langoustine that’s the triumphant standout, lightly broiled and dressed for excess with a coat of mayonnaise flavored with shiitake, scallion, chili pepper and smelt fish roe. Its price, $18, seems restrained only until you see how little langoustine it buys. If you’re a hearty eater, you’ll need at least four dishes to fill up, especially because the lone dessert, mochi ice cream, may not tempt you. And that could lift your bill for food alone well above $65, which creates an expectation of service less sluggish and absent-minded. On several occasions servers had to circle back to the table with the bad news that selections already made were unavailable. Also bear in mind that the quality of nearly three dozen kinds of sushi and sashimi on the third and final page of the menu isn’t exceptional. But one of nearly a dozen sushi rolls shouldn’t be missed. It combines tuna, Asian pear, avocado, cucumber, pine nuts and scallion for a riveting medley of textures and accents. Its real ingenuity, though, is its wrapping. In place of nori,  Mr. Kosugi uses white kelp, which is stippled with green. The resulting sections of roll resemble squat candy canes. And they’re an example of food that looks every bit as good as it tastes. Soto ** 357 Sixth Avenue (Washington Place), West Village; (212) 414-3088. ATMOSPHERE A long, minimalist room accommodates 12 people at a maple sushi bar and another 30 at tables, most of them along a banquette on the opposite wall. SOUND LEVEL Moderate.

371,Rayuela,1 star,"Aug. 22, 2007",Frank Bruni,Lower East Side,Latin American,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/dining/reviews/22rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/22/dining/reviews/22rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ARE there no suitable rocks in all of New York State? What about New England? If I have my trivia correct, New Hampshire is called the Granite State. That sounds pretty flinty to me, and it’s a whole lot closer to Manhattan than South America is. But when rounding up smooth stones with which to decorate the splashy subterranean bathroom   at the new “freestyle Latino” restaurant Rayuela on the Lower East Side, the  proprietors turned to Peru. When looking for the right tree to plant in the middle of the restaurant, they combed  California, finding a bifurcated olive that reaches with two long, leafy arms through openings in the first-floor ceiling to the main dining room on the second floor. I’m not sure how Rayuela fares in terms of food miles, but its décor miles are off the charts. And they’re an indication of how determined the restaurant   is to turn heads and make a statement, how much questionable energy it puts into superficial gestures that are less important in the end than the kind of diligence and discipline Rayuela doesn’t always muster. It’s a beautiful, fascinating, frustrating place, its cosmetic showiness echoed by dishes that are also all over the map, in terms of their appeal as well as their geographic and ethnic tethers, and in the way they throw ingredient upon ingredient and seasoning after seasoning at you. Sometimes this frenetic energy serves Rayuela  (pronounced rye-u-WELL-a) well. And I’ll say this about its long list of brightly hued special cocktails, its sprawling roster of festively tinged ceviches, its rethought paellas and retooled empanadas (a skate one as well as a steak one, as if the menu were driven by anagrams)  — they won’t bore you. Exhaust you? Sure, especially if the music is thump-thump-thumping, and the appetizers are taking so long to reach the table that they might as well be coming from Tierra del Fuego, and your second glass of white wine reflects a pour as paltry as the first. At moments like those it’s easy to overlook the silky, spicy magic of the coconut-milk broth for an Ecuadorean seafood stew. To discount all the nuggets of crab studding an excellent guacamole. And to deny Rayuela and its executive chef, Máximo Tejada, who cooked at Patria and Chicama, the credit they rightfully deserve for bold imagination, for flavors you don’t encounter all the time, and for the menu’s successes, which outnumber its failures, but not by all that much. Spacious and glittery, Rayuela confirms the fashionable bona fides of the Lower East Side dining scene, extending this pleasure zone to a stretch of Allen Street where there wasn’t much shimmer before. Its name means hopscotch, and that, along with the freestyle Latino tag it has given itself, is a clue to the abandon with which Mr. Tejada taps into not just Spanish, Mexican, South American and Caribbean cooking, but also Asian cuisine. In fact one of my favorite appetizers, called a tuna rellena, would be nearly as well suited to a Japanese restaurant. Thin slices of tuna form a pouch around crab, shrimp and a chipotle aioli, and that pouch brushes up against sliced cucumbers and soy sauce. The crab and shrimp provide sharper flavors than the glistening pinkish-red tuna alone would; the tuna in turn contributes a luscious mouthfeel that the shellfish can’t. The aioli helps as well in this regard, and its richness is held in check by the soy sauce. Although recklessly busy, the dish stays balanced. The same is true for one of my favorite ceviches, the “lobster revolution,” which arguably qualifies as an oxymoron, prompting mental images of Che at Per Se. It yields layers of effects, the sweetness of grilled pineapple and the tropical waft of coconut and lemon grass giving way to a blaze of jalapeño and a tickle of ginger. I could almost see this dish on a menu by Jean-Georges Vongerichten, though I think he’d edit out an ingredient or two. Rayuela’s menu is divided into about 10 ceviches, six   soups  and  salads, a dozen other appetizers, about as many entrees and another half dozen dishes that are either sides or additional entrees, depending on your appetite. This more-is-more ethic pays off in some dishes. Mr. Tejada’s arroz con pollo comes at the pollo in several ways, slices of breast fanning out around the paprika-seasoned rice, which is itself chock-a-block with chicken sausage and cubes of dark meat. It’s tremendously flavorful. So is the grilled beef tenderloin, though it teeters in the final analysis into overkill. Does the tender meat need both the cheesy fondue below it and the crab chimichurri above it, not to mention the mushrooms and bone marrow in the mix? It’s like a megalomaniacal steak Oscar. In several instances a dish with nicely calibrated seasonings was undercut by the flawed cooking of central ingredients. The seafood stew  — in which curry took the foreground while saffron flickered in the background  — had tough shellfish. The thick cracklings of skin in an entree of crispy pork would have been an ideal foil for tender meat. But what cowered below them could have passed for pork jerky. And artichokes, golden raisins and caramelized shallots couldn’t obscure or redeem the dryness of chicken livers in a throwaway appetizer. I’m certain that Mr. Tejada and the rest of the Rayuela crew care about making this restaurant special. Those colorful cocktails, developed by Junior Merino, are better than they have to be. Try a piña colada variant with cucumber, or a rye-based cocktail with mint and agave nectar. It’s pride, not cunning, that produces house-made bread as fantastic as Rayuela’s, which combines yucca flour, cheese, milk and butter. And in that upstairs dining room, the goal of the soft couches that nestle up to many tables and the linen curtains between them is not just style but also  comfort. If only the climate were drier. One night my companions and I dodged the drip-drip-drip of water from an overhead conduit and wondered why our deadpan (and sometimes deadbeat) server wasn’t more visibly concerned. We decided to chalk the drizzle up to an exotic treat: the deliberate evocation of a tropical rain forest. We definitely don’t have those in New York, New Hampshire or any point in between. Rayuela ★ 165 Allen Street (Stanton Street), Lower East Side; (212) 253-8840.

372,Cafe Boulud,3 star,"Aug. 15, 2007",Frank Bruni,Upper East Side,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/15/dining/reviews/15rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/15/dining/reviews/15rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THERE was no reason to dally. So on the first of my recent visits to Café Boulud, I dug right in and got pasta. I figured it would tell me a lot about what the restaurant had lost and how it was faring now. I braced myself. What, in a nominally French restaurant, justified this approach? Well, the last time I’d dined at Café Boulud, the person running the kitchen was Andrew Carmellini, a young Italian-American chef who left in 2005 to open his own place, A Voce. Under Mr. Carmellini Café Boulud had thrived: for many diners, it was the most consistently enjoyable of the restaurants owned by Daniel Boulud, more relaxed than Daniel, less scattershot than DB Bistro Moderne. And under Mr. Carmellini Café Boulud  evolved into a trove of not only French treasures but also Italian delights, including the sublime pumpkin ravioli and the risotto with white truffle I’d savored just before he left. If the French chef Bertrand Chemel, Mr. Carmellini’s successor, could meet and match him on Italian turf, it would bode very well for the rest of Café Boulud. A beef ravioli special on my first night in Mr. Chemel’s house would be my bellwether. It arrived with two other starters  — peekytoe crab with watermelon gelée and chilled pea soup  — and I briefly lost my nerve, sampling them before the ravioli, delaying the moment of truth. The crab was superb, and while the distinctive sweetness of watermelon can run roughshod over its cohorts, the gelée was restrained, subtle and tempered further by the gentle kick of daikon radish. The creamy pea soup tasted as green  — as vibrant  — as it looked. O.K., the ravioli. It was time for the ravioli, each a tiny purse with flutes and wrinkles all its own. I plopped one in my mouth, and instantly my whole body smiled. The pasta was al dente, the braised short rib inside moist and bursting with flavor. The tomato compote with which it was sauced — in a measured fashion, because there’s no point or wisdom in smothering ravioli like these — hit an ideal balance of sweetness and acidity. I was smitten, relieved and well on my way to the firm conviction, bolstered by subsequent visits to Café Boulud, that it promises about as much pleasure in the present as it did in the past. Credit for that should go not just to Mr. Chemel, who was Mr. Carmellini’s sous chef, but also to Mr. Boulud, who may not be in the kitchen nightly but promoted Mr. Chemel and watches over the restaurant. He’s had a stressful year, fighting and settling a discrimination lawsuit by  employees at Daniel and getting ready to open Bar Boulud, his first new Manhattan restaurant in six years. But Café Boulud, which opened in 1998 and received three stars from Ruth Reichl that year, hasn’t suffered at all. It fields and trains servers with unusual poise and even dexterity: one night I raptly watched one of them use the heel of her hand to scoot a used fork from the edge of a plate to its center. With this fluid gesture she avoided touching any food, making any noise or dropping anything as she carted the plate away. And that — more than the white cloths on the tables or the warm madeleines at the end of a meal — is the kind of grace note that puts restaurants like Café Boulud in a league of their own, a league that’s no less fun to visit in this informal dining era. Sometimes even the scruffiest of us want to feel grown-up in an Upper-East-Side kind of way, and Café Boulud permits that without any off-putting cinching, any superfluous pinching. The dining room looks better than ever, thanks to a renovation that replaced the bar with several high communal tables of burgundy marble. They add contemporary flair and are beautifully suited to sipping a drink while your table is being set. The dinner menu encompasses about 25 appetizers and entrees, and it’s divided — as it has been from the beginning — into four sections: traditional, seasonal, vegetarian and global. Although the kitchen gets explicit international license in that last section, where you’ll find a shrimp salad with Thai accents and grilled lamb with Greek flourishes, Café Boulud steals glances toward Japan, Spain and Italy elsewhere on the menu. For my money the global section is the least sure-footed; the traditional section, the most. I’ll say this for vegetarian: it’s where the handful of pasta dishes, including ricotta-stuffed ravioli with earthy shiitake mushrooms and zingy currents of lemon, make their happy home. The dishes at Café Boulud are united less by ethnic orientation than by the kitchen’s skill and by embellishments that reliably turn what’s already enjoyable into something remarkable. A côte de bouef for two was such gorgeous meat, so gorgeously pan-roasted, that it could easily have prospered on its own. But it came with an exquisite sauce choron: béarnaise blended with a confit of fresh tomatoes. Mr. Chemel is tomato-struck, kissing the crisp skin of succulent roasted chicken with a glittering orange foam made of smoked tomato water and butter. Just about anything that had the potential for succulence realized it, including pink Arctic char with some of the crunchy, fatty skin left on and a leg of lamb baked in a thick layer of salty dough, then released from it and surrounded by braised chanterelles. Like most of his peers, Mr. Chemel hasn’t divined a noteworthy use for monkfish, which was on the menu anyway. Not every dish was a hit, and that was especially true of desserts, though the soufflés — strawberry with vanilla ice cream one night, apricot with pistachio ice cream another — were terrific. The wine list is epic, eclectic and not without mercy: there’s a section  titled “Bottles under $60.” And the guidance through it is expert. In a telephone conversation with Mr. Chemel after my visits, I learned that the beef ravioli was essentially a holdover recipe from the Carmellini days. But, he said, the lemony ricotta ravioli was his, and so was the Meyer lemon arancini — fried balls of risotto mixed with a mascarpone paste and goat cheese — that the restaurant served as an amuse-bouche. They elated me. And they persuaded me, as much as anything else, that Café Boulud hasn’t lost a step. Café Boulud *** 20 East 76th Street; (212) 772-2600.

373,15 East,2 star,"July 11, 2007",Frank Bruni,Union Square,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/11/dining/reviews/11rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/11/dining/reviews/11rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"SHIATSU, deep-tissue or maybe even Rolfing: Which manner of pummeling becomes a cephalopod most? I asked a server at 15 East, and he looked at me as if I were some nutcase troublemaker. But he had started this, volunteering that the restaurant’s slow-poached octopus was so tender because “it’s massaged 500 times.” I was just posing the obvious follow-up question. I can’t tell you the answer, which I never got. But I can tell you that this octopus is outrageously good. Its tentacles are cut into thick, thick coins and arrayed beside a hillock of sea salt, which you can sprinkle on the octopus or, if you dare, dredge the octopus through. It accentuates the sea creature’s distinctive meatiness. “What have they done to this?” marveled one of the two friends with me the second time I tried it. He hadn’t been around the first time to hear about the massaging, which gives new meaning to the phrase spa cuisine. The other friend responded: “I think they’ve turned it into lamb.” Whatever the precise trick, it’s a reflection of the serious efforts behind a meal at 15 East, which manages to stand out in a crowded marketplace of Japanese restaurants that focus on uncooked seafood. It does this in part with cooked dishes, like the octopus, that augment the selection of sushi and sashimi. It does this with the sushi and sashimi itself: carefully sourced and carefully assembled, the rice  warm, the seasonings sensible. It does this with gracious service; with around-the-edges embellishments like a respectable list of wines in addition to the very fine sake selection; and with a split-the-difference atmosphere that’s neither overblown extravaganza nor underdressed broom closet, the extreme directions in which some Japanese restaurants veer. The space near Union Square that 15 East inhabits used to belong to Tocqueville, which moved just a few dozen feet down the block last year. It’s owned by Marco Moreira and Jo-Ann Makovitzky, the same husband-wife team still behind Tocqueville. They have put a gleaming sushi counter roughly where Tocqueville’s bar was and gray paint on walls that were once yellow. In the process they’ve achieved the look of a high-priced dermatologist’s waiting room, which isn’t a bad thing. Both environments soothe the nerves while flattering the complexion. They have also recruited Masato Shimizu, who worked at Jewel Bako, to supervise that sushi counter, where he’s doing exemplary work. Be sure not to miss the sweet shrimp, delicate and almost translucent; the  scallop, bathed in yuzu; the needlefish, slick and substantial; and the jack mackerel,  wrapped in a shiso leaf, whose perfume remains even after it’s peeled away. The top surfaces of pieces of barracuda and o-toro sushi, the latter of which came with a $75 bluefin tuna flight, were seared by a torch, and that char brought the richness of the fish into relief. Away from the sushi counter, 15 East’s performance was markedly uneven. An appetizer called “BBQ frog’s legs” did a riff on Buffalo chicken wings that should never, ever be done again. The name of “Grilled Bigeye Tuna Waldorf” piqued the curiosity, which was rewarded  —  or, rather, not  —  with a humdrum hunk of grilled fish beside a Waldorf-like salad using Asian pear in place of apple. Be still, my beating, cholesterol-spared heart. With Honmura An gone but not forgotten, there’s a soba lacuna in the land, and 15 East addresses it with excellent hand-cut buckwheat noodles done up different ways on different days. It also serves a squid-ink risotto with a rising orange center  —  hello, my beloved friend uni  —  and small ringlets of squid. At 15 East the uni was terrific; at Ushiwakamaru, which the chef  Hideo Kuribara opened on Houston Street about two years ago, not so much. Ushiwakamaru is like that: for every two examples of faultless sushi or sashimi there will be one that doesn’t measure up. The restaurant was recently promoting, as a special, Copper River salmon, but there was nothing special about the fish, which had a weirdly flat taste, shadowed by nuances that suggested it had been sitting around a bit too long. So why mention Ushiwakamaru? The fish that’s terrific is terrific at lower prices than at 15 East, and finding first-rate sushi that’s not grievously expensive is getting tougher all the time. What’s more, the restaurant’s proudly ragtag subterranean setting stole at least one ventricle of my aforementioned heart. Ushiwakamaru has an underdog charm that’s irresistible, with its bilious green walls; its artlessly clumped-up plastic wrap over displayed fish; and its spindly, unsmooth chopsticks, the kind that make you worry about tongue splinters. It also has some intriguing dishes you don’t often find, like turban shell, a sea snail cooked and served in a well of dark liquid in its natural spiraled domicile. You keep lowering a tiny spoon into the well and coming up with fleshy nuggets, more of them than you expect. Some vaguely recall geoduck clam in texture and taste. Others are livery. Still others stake a claim to being anointed the sweetbreads of the sea. The sushi and sashimi selection is also adventurous, including banded blue sprat, halfbeak and saury. But you can decide to stick with the usual suspects, and here a piece of o-toro sushi is $8 instead of the $12 at 15 East, while amberjack is $4 instead of $6. You can have a chef’s selection of 15 pieces of sushi for $49. That’s meaningful compensation for the cramped seating, negligible desserts, limited beverages and an octopus therapy program that  —  as best I could tell  —  isn’t quite so lavish with the pressing and kneading. 15 East  ** 15 East 15th Street; (212) 647-0015. 15eastrestaurant.com.

374,Landmarc,1 star,"June 27, 2007",Frank Bruni,Upper West Side,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"YOU can look at the new Landmarc in the Time Warner Center as just another meat-mad, wined-up refueling station for New York’s sputtering masses, a place willing to surrender any intimacy and many niceties in the interests of accommodating serious traffic. With 300 seats, it’s three times the size of the original Landmarc in TriBeCa, whose menu and competent cooking it replicates but whose warmth it largely lacks. You can alternately see it as the climactic chapter in an instructive story about the way overblown dreams in this overachieving city yield,  as they often must, to practical realities. As an acknowledgment that even well-heeled New Yorkers can’t live on caviar alone. With its straightforward steaks, build-your-own omelets, daily pasta specials and Caesar salads, Landmarc had no place in the grand initial plans for the preciously named Restaurant Collection in a mall that rejects that label. (The Time Warner Center, mind you, is a vertical retail environment, and I do gastronomic humanitarian work.) The third-floor space Landmarc inhabits was supposed to go to the renowned Chicago chef Charlie Trotter, who would be joining a pantheon of slavishly worshiped gods, all under one Columbus Circle roof. Thomas Keller, conducting nine-course tasting menus at Per Se, and Masayoshi Takayama, orchestrating $350-a-person sushi extravaganzas at Masa, led the charge. Jean-Georges Vongerichten pitched in with V Steakhouse, a frilly spin on a beefy genre. Gray Kunz clambered aboard with Café Gray, whose mirrored columns, $34 short ribs and stiff competition for prime-time reservations belied its purportedly casual vibe. But among all this ambition and all these egos, there wasn’t anywhere for someone ambling out of Sephora with an exciting new exfoliant to grab an unplanned hamburger, pick at an unlabored salad. The Restaurant Collection tipped into opulence overload, as much a caricature of extravagance as a paean to it. That may be why V Steakhouse didn’t make it, bequeathing its spot to Porter House New York, a less fanciful enterprise. That probably factored into Mr. Trotter’s late-hour decision not to join the fete. And that surely directed the attention of the Time Warner Center’s developers toward Landmarc, which opened in TriBeCa in early 2004, and Marc Murphy, its chef and one of its owners, who was looking to expand. For the Collection’s excessively refined air, they needed a blast of his populist oxygen. That’s just what Mr. Murphy has provided: a no-nonsense, low-impact restaurant so purged of airs it seems at times to be a repudiation of much of what preceded and surrounds it. It’s open from 7 a.m. to 2 a.m. seven days a week. It doesn’t take reservations for groups smaller than six. It serves food that’s seldom much flashier than the fare at a Midwestern Marriott. And that, in fact, is its strength and appeal. This city too often frustrates diners searching for familiar dishes, made with decent ingredients and a minimum of showboating, at prices that don’t pinch too hard; the Restaurant Collection, as initially configured, was an exaggerated but telling example of that problem. Landmarc fills a gap and a purpose. The new branch is less attractive than its downtown sibling, because the restaurants’ stripped-down industrial décor has a drearier payoff in a larger setting. In addition, one long glass wall looks onto the glare of adjacent stores. The food in the new branch, too, struck me as inferior, probably also a result of the restaurant’s scale. It’s a rare establishment that can do this kind of volume and maintain truly high standards. Several of the pasta dishes I tried — bucatini all’amatriciana, spaghetti cacio e pepe — were overcooked. And beneath the restaurant’s crisply grilled steaks, which were wholly satisfying despite Landmarc’s use of choice instead of prime beef, cowered droopy, almost chilly fries. The menu is all about sections: for appetizers, for salads (which are sizable), for pasta, for steaks (hanger, strip, skirt, fillet, rib-eye), for tame entrees like grilled salmon on a raft of ratatouille and roasted chicken with crushed potatoes and green beans, and for another set of entrees called “Landmarc specials,” including sweetbreads and calf’s liver. There  are sections for eight sides, and for five sauces to go with mussels, and for seven cheeses to go with burgers, which are charred on the outside, luscious on the inside and definitely worth considering. What else, besides the steaks, is worth it? The chicken was expertly cooked both times I tried it, and a grilled pork chop with caramelized onions hit the spot. In general I found the salads more rewarding, and a better way to start a meal, than the appetizers. Endive was rendered irresistible by a plethora of blue cheese and walnuts. Sautéed shrimp studding a tangle of frisée and artichoke were bouncy and juicy. Gorgonzola and roasted peppers amplified the charms of strips of grilled skirt steak, flavorful enough to have gotten by with much less. And here’s another consideration: go for lunch instead of dinner. Although Landmarc’s windows don’t afford much of a Central Park view, they let in a lovely midday light. At lunch (as at breakfast) the fine omelets are available, along with hearty sandwiches like ciabatta stuffed with Italian sausage, onions and both sweet and hot peppers. At all times Landmarc takes an unusual approach to dessert, serving small portions only for $3 a pop. This discourages gorging, though the even bigger discouragement is the mediocrity of most of the items, with the notable exception of the tiny cones of Laboratorio del Gelato ice cream. The wine list, in contrast, is a boon to consumption. Landmarc famously doesn’t mark its bottles up nearly as much as other restaurants do.  Just don’t expect to purchase a glass: the restaurant serves only half and full bottles. And don’t expect too many rare, startling finds. Why should you? Landmarc doesn’t strut like that. It lets Per Se do an “oysters and pearls” appetizer laden with caviar. To Masa it cedes a caviar-spangled toro tartare. For itself it claims a perfectly respectable niçoise salad. Sometimes that’s as much refinement as you want — or as even the most self-conscious mall needs.

We could wake up one dark chocolate morning to an East River of cocoa and a Hudson of hot fudge, slices of banana bobbing on its surface. The streets would be paved with bonbons, the skyscrapers bricked with fudge. Calorie counts would skyrocket. And a pox of tooth decay would descend. Max Brenner is well on his way to making that happen, and he doesn’t even exist. He’s a concept, Willy Wonka as hairless imperialist, and in the past year, Manhattan has welcomed not one but two chocolate-covered restaurants flying his banner. They’re called Max Brenner, Chocolate by the Bald Man, and belong to a chain spawned in Israel by a pair of businessmen, Max Fichtman and Oded Brenner, who conflated their two names into that of one quasi-fictive candy man. Mr. Brenner indeed happens to be bald, so there’s some follicular truth in the advertising. But there’s no ready clue that Max Brenner is now owned by an Israeli food corporation, which has succeeded in establishing it in Singapore, the Philippines, Australia and the United States. It’s been saluted in People magazine and featured on cable television news broadcasts. And the Max Brenner restaurants in Manhattan have often been packed, an affirmation of a strategy that strikes me as both novel and shrewd. Max Brenner exploits the automatic respect that diners feel for a principled culinary artist and hitches it to a mass-market endeavor as gimmicky as Planet Hollywood. It’s Planet Valrhona, a faux-artisanal juggernaut. Beautifully decorated chocolates for sale near the door and scattered bits of writing about this half-imagined character’s chocolate rapture suggest a labor of pure love. Assembly-required desserts more flashy than appealing reveal a more calculating commercial enterprise. And the substantial menu of dishes other than desserts — omelets for breakfast; salads, sandwiches and quiches for lunch and dinner — show that the standards aren’t particularly high. A congealed lasagna Bolognese could have been the work of that great Italian artisan Chef Boyardee. Even if you treat Max Brenner  as a destination for just dessert — as a steroidal Serendipity — you can wind up disappointed. Much of the milk and dark chocolate used in its confections lacks the richness or sharpness that great  chocolate has. Of the two Max Brenner restaurants  — one just off Union Square, the other a few blocks to the east — the Union Square spot is by far the bigger and more theatrical. It has vats of gurgling chocolate inside the entrance, where shelves are stacked with bars, powders and toppings as well as the decorated chocolates. Pipes along the ceiling are painted dark brown to convey the idea that they carry chocolate. And everywhere you look — on panels of glass, patches of wall or the riotously busy pages of the spiral-ring dessert and drinks menu — you see chocolate musings, chocolate mottos. Max Brenner is “creating a new chocolate culture.” Max Brenner invites you to “watch, taste and smell my love story.” Max Brenner has “freed chocolate from its cage.” He’s a poet, our make-believe Max: Wonka by the way of Wordsworth. And he’s audacious, not only taking advantage of chocolate’s known permutations but also finding new assignments for it. Chocolate subs for cream cheese on a bagel, for tomato sauce on a  waxy “pizza,” for chicken stock in a so-called soup. The fullness of Max Brenner’s commitment to its theme is impressive and, at times, amusing. Traditions are tweaked. Hot chocolate  — dark, milk or white —  comes in a handle-less “hug mug” shaped so that you have to cradle it in two hands, the way you would a child’s face. I liked the feel of the cup and the frothiness of the dark chocolate. If you want to check Max Brenner out — and a spectacle this extravagantly sugary perhaps warrants a gander — an off-hours hug mug is the way to go. You’ll be out only $3.95 and 20 to 30 minutes. To my surprise Max Brenner ably lures adults, who outnumbered children by at least four to one whenever I went. Many seemed to be tourists. But it’s best suited to the young, who regard it the way potheads do Amsterdam: as a naughtiness bazaar. My nephew Gavin, 6, and niece Bella, 4, let out ear-piercing squeals as soon as they walked in. Their parents promptly ordered chocolate martinis, made of creamy milk chocolate and vanilla vodka, with gummy  bears instead of olives on skewers laid across the surface. There was an edict that real food precede sweets, so we turned to that menu, much shorter. Most of the options represent some form of open or closed sandwich: a waffle covered with kielbasa and melted Cheddar; a crepe  with smoked turkey and melted Swiss. In terms of both skill level and results, this was essentially toaster-oven cuisine, reliant on runny cheese to redeem any and all sins. The elaborate desserts for their part rely on Lilliputian beakers, caldrons and grills to give them an excitement that the chocolate itself doesn’t always have. Max Brenner is a fantasy land for the aspiring pyromaniac, who will find a flame inside the egg-shaped cradle of the suckao, a chocolate drink that requires you to mix shavings of milk chocolate (dull) or dark chocolate (more appealing) into heated milk. Neither Gavin, Bella nor their adult chaperones could get the chocolate to melt, so the children just spooned the soggy shards into their mouths, with the spillover dribbling down their shirts. GapKids should open a  store next door. A humdrum chocolate fondue was stroked by fire, so that bananas and strawberries would have a warm bath, and there was more fire for the roasting of the marshmallows in a s’mores dessert that had the benefit  not only of crisp graham crackers but also of a gooey peanut butter spread. Gavin and Bella were rapt. I was a nervous wreck. And then I felt a crackling spreading down my throat, because a piece of chocolate I had grabbed from a sampler plate was studded with candies like Pop Rocks. As I waited for the tracheal fireworks to subside and wondered if excess was a word in Max Brenner’s vocabulary, I saw Gavin double over, his hands on his stomach. He let out a pathetic little moan, accompanied by words as true as any I’ve heard spoken. “Not everything,” he said, “should be made into a dessert.” Max Brenner, Chocolate by the Bald Man SATISFACTORY  841 Broadway near 13th Street; 141 Second Avenue near Ninth Street: (212) 388-0030.

377,Morandi,1 star,"April 25, 2007",Frank Bruni,West Village,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/25/dining/reviews/25rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/25/dining/reviews/25rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"AT this point in his justly storied career, Keith McNally could probably open a lemonade stand on a runway at La Guardia and have normally proud New Yorkers groveling for tarmac. So the crowds at his new restaurant, Morandi, didn’t throw me. The chaos did, and it was underscored by the desperate way a host implored two companions and me to squeeze even tighter against the mass of bodies at the bar so that servers hustling from the kitchen could get by. We were blocking the “food highway,” he told us, and as we subsequently watched the couriers of tagliatelle alla bolognese barrel down it, we realized that we had nearly become roadkill. I suppose that’s a danger at many of Mr. McNally’s breathlessly thronged productions: Balthazar, Pastis, Schiller’s Liquor Bar. But those restaurants present clever, dashing stage sets that find some poetry in the commotion. Morandi — with its low ceiling, inconveniently situated columns and hokey visual motifs — presents a riddle: how did Mr. McNally and his collaborators come to deem this an alluring destination? He’s miscalculated with this restaurant, which doesn’t have enough atmospheric magic to distract you from the insane decibel level, absence of elbowroom and uncomfortable chairs. Teaming up with the chef Jody Williams, who cooked at Il Buco, Giorgione and Gusto, Mr. McNally is making his first foray into Italian cuisine, and he plays with Italian conceits the way he did with French ones at Balthazar. But while Balthazar’s evocation of a brasserie bespoke an adoration of France, Morandi’s incarnation of a trattoria suggests something more like amusement with Italy. The restaurant strikes an odd tone, starting with the recorded voice on the phone line, as broadly accented as that of Father Guido Sarducci on an old episode of “Saturday Night Live,” and extending to row upon row of straw-bottomed Chianti bottles lining the walls. Is this tribute or burlesque? Against the hackneyed backdrop Ms. Williams’s menu — including fritto misto, vitello tonnato, bucatini cacio e pepe and a gargantuan veal chop smothered in prosciutto and fontina — sometimes plays less like a loving repertory of classics than a failure of imagination and nerve. Most food-savvy New Yorkers have repeatedly encountered dishes like these in a setting of cheeky rusticity like this, and that compels the Morandi kitchen to perform at a higher, more consistent level than it does. Even so, the food has been getting a worse rap than it deserves. Ms. Williams is an earnest, talented chef, and there’s sufficient evidence of that across the menu’s discrete categories for fried versus other starters; for fresh versus dried pasta; for meat versus fish. Begin with the fried stuffed green olives, which pack in pork sausage, ground pork, pecorino and egg. I could nibble on these all night long. But then I’d miss the grilled octopus, and I wouldn’t want to. New York has turned some sort of octopus corner. Not only is octopus challenging squid as the multi-tentacled cephalopod of choice, it’s being cooked more expertly than it once was. At Morandi it’s crisped on a gas grill and paired with black olives and — the inspired, just-right touch — celery. Ms. Williams did this dish or versions of it before Morandi, and the same goes for another great appetizer, a bright-tasting salad of fava beans, escarole and pecorino that’s given a lively dose of mint. My favorite dishes among pasta and its kin were the troffiete al pesto — nicely doughy squiggles entwined with crunchy green beans — and risotto sotto bosco, whose name translates literally as “under forest” and flags the presence of porcini, blueberries and blackberries in a blend of rice, butter, Parmesan and herbs. The interplay of earthy, fruity and salty effects was fantastic. The sage butter on top of spinach and ricotta ravioli and the thyme butter on top of porcini ravioli had been applied with a generous hand, making each dish feel like a bit of a cheat — but a happy cheat. Morandi doesn’t take many chances with entrees, either. There’s grilled chicken, grilled hanger steak and grilled branzino, none seasoned in a revelatory way. The roasted veal chop stands out, courtesy of that decadent hood and a juicy core. Then again, it should. At $45, it’s far and away the most expensive item on a menu that, like those at Mr. McNally’s other restaurants, admirably gives diners strategies for keeping the check under control. But the most impressive entree also reveals how erratic Morandi can be. It’s salt cod cooked in milk, festooned with raisins and placed on polenta. The notes of saltiness and sweetness integrate beautifully, but while the cod was moist and flaky when I first tried the dish, it was repulsively tough the second time around. The polenta had taken its own nose dive, plummeting from creamy to runny. The kitchen’s miscues and misjudgments are frequent: a little too much lemon on the grilled chicken; a lot too much lemon in an egg and cheese sauce over lackluster lamb chops; a deficit of pepper in the cacio e pepe (pecorino and black pepper). Many savory dishes, like the décor, are disconcertingly off key. Morandi does a steadier job with desserts, most of them likable but none really lovable. Once again a greatest-hits approach prevails: tartufo, zuppa inglese, gelato, granita. I had particular luck with tarts, including one with lemon, almond and ricotta. The kindly priced wine list explores all of Italy, not only in the selection of bottles but also in the wines available by the glass, half carafe and carafe. There are exactly 20 of these, one from each region of Italy. A catchy approach? Sure. But a gimmicky one, too, reflecting this restaurant’s treatment of Italy as theme park — as what the British writer John Mortimer once called Chiantishire. Morandi’s overworked Chianti bottles and its canopy of brick arches  — no matter how old the brick — aren’t whimsical; they’re just clichéd. Unlike Balthazar and Pastis, which Mr. McNally cunningly sculptured to look old before their time, Morandi can simply feel tired before its time, and not quite worth the struggle to get in and stay upright in the scrum.

378,Esca,3 star,"April 18, 2007",Frank Bruni,Clinton,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/18/dining/reviews/18rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/18/dining/reviews/18rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"GIVEN all the talk about horse whisperers and dog whisperers, it’s impossible not to wonder: is Dave Pasternack a fish whisperer? Does he enjoy some preternatural rapport with the sea’s creatures, an extrasensory insight into which might benefit from a raw appointment with coarse salt and which are fated for frying? Can he  tease out their greatest performances? On the evidence of Esca, I’d have to say yes. At few other restaurants, for example,  does swordfish take such meaty, moist form. The  paces he puts it through must be charmed, though they don’t actually sound all that  magical. He brushes the fish with olive oil. Rolls it in a blanket of fried bread crumbs seasoned with lemon, parsley and garlic. Throws it on a gas grill. And comes up with something nearly as succulent as bluefin tuna. For the tuna, he sees another possibility. He sees a Bolognese sauce. That’s usually the province of red meat, but Mr. Pasternack understands when surf can do the work of turf. To the tuna he adds Spanish mackerel, pancetta and tomatoes, among other ingredients, then ladles this mix over housemade fettuccine. The tuna gives the dish a cool luxuriousness all its own, while the mackerel provides a blast of the sea. And what about the scorpionfish he’s been serving of late? Many other chefs would no doubt bypass this species, understandably deeming it too bland. But Mr. Pasternack appreciates how  custardy its texture becomes when it’s cooked with care.  And what if it’s given a contrasting, crunchy shell, courtesy of a light batter of milk and flour and a bath in sizzling olive oil? He showily presents the results whole and upright, or at least what would qualify as upright for a fish: belly down, head pointed forward, tail stretched in the opposite direction. And he throws a few capers its way, for extra saltiness, and some lemon, for a necessary brightness. In a 2005 profile of him in The New Yorker, the 7,500-word fact of which spoke to the respect he has deservedly won, Mr. Pasternack, 43, defined his talent as “knowing when something needs a little something.” But the profile established that he knows a lot more than that: the waters and weathers in which certain fish prosper; the vendors, large and small, with the quality of fish he demands.   He’s an honest-to-God fisherman, in love with the ocean, and Esca is his ongoing ode to it. I lived outside New York and didn’t eat at Esca when it opened in 2000 and received two stars in The Times from William Grimes. But I’ve dropped by  over the last three years and especially the last two months. And in my experience it just keeps getting better. It’s not that Mr. Pasternack, one of its principal owners as well as its chef, latches on to many new tricks as the years go by. He’s had no follow-up to Esca’s one big innovation: introducing New Yorkers to the delicately seasoned raw fish compositions known as crudo. But by all appearances his dedication to Esca has never waned, and apart from a brief dalliance with Bistro du Vent, a French restaurant that failed, his attention has never really been divided. Sure, he’s about to  publish a book, “The Young Man & the Sea,” with recipes and recollections. But by current standards that’s more an obligatory rite than a serious bid at branding. On almost every occasion when I’ve called the Esca kitchen to interview him, he’s answered the phone.  When he hasn’t, he’s usually been right near it.   I’m skeptical of reports that he has a home away from Esca. I’m convinced he sleeps with the fishes. He’s tinkered with the restaurant’s look, keeping the lemony walls and chocolate color of the upholstery but redoing the  oak floors and moving the bar. That last change  was a mistake. The bar is too small; on a crowded night, there’s nowhere comfortable to wait for a table. The dining room closest to the bar   feels inferior to the larger room just inside the entrance, and the patio, smack against a hulking brick tower of Manhattan Plaza, belies  the lovely promise of outdoor dining. Friends have complained of inattentive service during off hours, and while I’ve never experienced that, the range of servers’ demeanors can be jarring. Some dart around nervously and struggle to recall ingredients. Others swan about, making grand pronouncements. But Mr. Pasternack’s kitchen is a steady, well-oiled trawler moving through placid seas. Be it weakfish or wolffish, the catch I’ve had at Esca has always tasted fresh. Whether black bass, wild striped bass or golden spotted bass, it’s almost never been overcooked or undercooked. Mr. Pasternack has partners in Esca, including Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich, and there’s a straightforwardness,  an air of conviviality and a Mediterranean orientation that link it to other Batali-Bastianich productions. But it’s Mr. Pasternack’s show, more low-key than most of its brethren and more tightly focused. In an era when too many restaurants try to be everything to everyone, Esca has a specific agenda: show what the sea can yield. To scan its long menu is to feel like you spend most of your time nibbling in a shallow tidal flat and ignoring deep waters beyond. From those waters comes orange marlin, seared and served with fava beans, as well as pink snapper, grilled and presented in its natural cloak. You can trust Esca to leave the skin on when it should be and to turn it crispy if it can be. For the terrific fritto misto, Esca marshals not just two or three players but a diverse team: skate, halibut, cod, steamers, oysters, octopus, shrimp. And not each gets the same shawl. For some it’s bread crumbs; for others, flour and cornstarch. At many other restaurants, one category of the menu outshines the others. At Esca, it’s a toss-up between the crudo preparations, the fish entrees and even the desserts, few but memorable. The  wine list alone is potent bait (the translation of the word esca), taking in much of Italy and keeping the prices in check. And the pasta dishes, sometimes overlooked, shouldn’t be. Esca’s maccheroni alla chitarra, fat housemade noodles, are sauced with an emulsion of olive oil and sea urchin roe that takes on a gorgeous salmon color and tastes like a  light and briny cream. Lump crab meat rounds out the dish. Bucatini  provides the right strong support for   “Rita’s spicy baby octopus,” the tenderness of which Mr. Pasternack attributes to a secret he learned from the Neapolitan woman for whom the dish is named. Into a tomato-based stew he adds one used wine cork — removed at the end — per pound of octopus. He can’t say why this method works. But intuition  tells him it’s best.  So does the octopus. Esca ***  402 West 43rd Street; (212) 564-7272.

379,Rosanjin,2 star,"March 28, 2007",Frank Bruni,TriBeCa,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/28/dining/reviews/28rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/28/dining/reviews/28rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE greeting you get from Jungjin Park, the owner of the strange and sometimes wonderful new Japanese restaurant Rosanjin, starts out uneventfully enough. He flashes a grateful smile. Musters a cheery voice. Makes an instant offer to take your coat, your bag, anything you might want to fob off on him, with the possible exception of an unruly teenager whose upkeep includes tuition at Dalton. Then things get weird. There’s an inquisition: how did you learn about Rosanjin? You had friends who tried it? Which friends? Did they tell you about all the little, predetermined courses? Are you sure? That’s followed by an apology: don’t expect much. The restaurant is still finding its way. He’s most comfortable serving just one table a night. There are two tables now. Be patient. Such hedging and hawing would be odd in any context. It’s especially bizarre in light of how much Mr. Park is asking you to shell out: $150 a person before drinks, tip and tax. That kind of price usually entails a promise of magnificence, not extended hand-wringing about whether you’ve come to the right place at the right time. But Mr. Park’s jittery posture reflects the peculiarity of the elaborate ceremony — called kaiseki — that he’s orchestrating at Rosanjin. Not many Manhattan restaurants offer it, and even fewer try to do it on the level that Rosanjin does. Mr. Park is taking a gamble, and he’s a man apparently incapable of a poker face. A kaiseki meal spans many small courses, which arrive at precisely timed intervals and in a carefully plotted order: soup often toward the beginning; rice, pickles and something grilled usually toward the end. Vegetables take center stage. Fish can play an important role. Meat usually doesn’t. And no matter how fresh  the ingredients, their vessels may come close to upstaging them. At Rosanjin, named after a celebrated Japanese potter,  there’s a quietly dazzling succession of lacquered wood bowls and brightly colored, amusingly shaped ceramics, no two exactly alike. The presentation of just a few morsels of food can necessitate a chalice on a small plate on a larger plate on a tray.  While a kaiseki meal is designed for, and promises, a measure of spiritual uplift, that state of grace doesn’t extend to whoever is doing the dishes. Mr. Park, who is Korean, took over the easily overlooked nook in TriBeCa that Rosanjin inhabits about two years ago, and early last fall he finally started doing catering and delivery from the kitchen in the back. He opened the front dining room as a restaurant in December — long enough ago for him and his chef, Koji Ishii, who is Japanese, to be up to speed by now. A liquor license finally came through last month. Rosanjin’s selection of sakes is short but terrific, and it will be supplemented soon by wines that aren’t the sorts of throwaway choices at many tiny Japanese restaurants. And Rosanjin is indeed tiny: seven well-spaced tables in a room of subdued luxury with no lounge, no bar, almost nothing to distract from what’s going to appear  in front of you. Mr. Park wants you to focus. He actually instructs you not to dally or prattle and to eat your food as soon as it arrives so you’re ready for the next wave. Although other restaurants have surely been tempted, Rosanjin is the only one that’s ever given me a gag order. I soon understood why it did. The dishes at Rosanjin demand concentration, because their glory is in the details: the curves of the leaf-shaped, leaf-colored plate on which a grilled scallop with grated apple dressing rested; the golden brilliance of a slightly sweet egg-yolk paste coating a braid of precious uncooked baby shrimp; the way the bouncy texture of yuba, which is tofu skin, perfectly echoed the bouncy texture of the delicately cooked baby octopus with which it was paired. All three of these dishes and a tangle of scallions and sliced mushrooms in a sesame paste were part of the first course. Later came what I can describe only as a bouquet of sashimi, because the squiggles, cubes and dominoes of raw fish — squid, toro, mackerel and more — were arranged as painstakingly as roses or orchids in a gorgeous spray. Tissue-thin slices of silvery fluke fanned out like the feathers in a bird’s tail. Near them were orange curlicues of carrot, snowy curlicues of radish and purple shiso flowers, which Mr. Park told a companion and me to crush and sprinkle into a pool of soy sauce. In a subsequent course, pieces of toro and sea eel sushi sat in the center of a matte black disc sprayed with what looked like dew drops. Those drops communicated an idea of freshness, and the sushi, like the sashimi before it, didn’t contradict that message. While the specific courses changed from night to night, one of them was always a minced fish cake, its texture a marvel of light sponginess, with enoki or hon shimeji mushrooms in a faintly smoky broth. There was invariably tempura at some point. It was always crisp, never sodden and, in the case of one piece, completely eye-opening. A shiso leaf had been wrapped around uni, then battered and fried. I’d never had anything like it. But while the softness of uni was preserved by that treatment — indeed, the uni became a molten surprise at the core of so much crunchiness — it was banished in a dish that placed and baked uni on top of a split lobster tail. The lobster itself was tough and bland. And it reflected a tendency at Rosanjin for later courses and conventional cooking methods to yield letdowns. There’s no crescendo of pleasure here, though the tiny glass of mango juice that accompanied the fruit medley for dessert was a shot of pure bliss. At Rosanjin you cannot order à la carte, but you can call ahead for a vegetarian menu, which is $105. I did this once and wouldn’t recommend it: the spectrum of flavors was too narrow, at least for anyone whose stomach doesn’t go pitter-patter at the mention of burdock and bamboo. Even the usual meal can verge on excessive subtlety and daintiness, leaving you hungry two hours later despite all the money you’ve spent. But while you are in the middle of it, breathing in the steam rising from a miso soup, anything blunter and heavier seems heretical. The delicacy of this food and the precise rhythms of its presentation have the soothing effect of meditation. If enough diners discover that, maybe Mr. Park, too, can relax.",
380,Sfoglia,2 star,"March 7, 2007",Frank Bruni,Upper East Side,"Cafes, Italian",https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/07/dining/reviews/07rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/07/dining/reviews/07rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"WE don’t do right by lunch. We don’t even come close. We don’t pause long enough, relax fully enough, allow ourselves a real meal and allow that meal to renew us to the extent that it’s meant to. These were my thoughts as I sat over a bowl of fusilli in the restaurant Sfoglia on a recent afternoon, and I confess I was well into my second glass of wine — and, quite frankly, near the bottom of it — when I began thinking them. The fusilli bore some responsibility as well. A dish of pasta this fantastic, its sauce of cream and vin santo applied with restraint and leavened cunningly by shredded carrot, convinces a person that whatever path led him to it should be embraced more often. In this case the impulse to enjoy an unhurried midday meal had taken me there. That, and the very lucky decision to enjoy that meal at Sfoglia. Sfoglia is great for lunch. One reason: light streams through its big picture windows, burnishing the gigantic bowls of vegetables and fruit that sit on or near its proudly mismatched tables, where places are set with dish towels instead of napkins. Another reason: you’ll never get in for dinner. Well, you’ll get in, but only if you plan a month ahead, and only if you’re O.K. with eating before 6:30 or after 9:30. Since Sfoglia opened a year ago, it has amassed a sizeable following, and for these devotees it’s not just a restaurant. It’s a religion. Is that really any surprise? This city is chock-a-block and clangorous with big restaurants, brash restaurants, restaurants laden with gimmicks, restaurants defined by the hot design firm that chose the filament bulbs or by the celebrity chef  — present in spirit more than body  — who conferred his blessing upon the braised short ribs. And along comes little Sfoglia, with its comparatively short  menu, spirited individuality, Venetian-style glass chandeliers, fewer than 40 seats and humble location:  Lexington and 92nd Street. “Why’s it all the way up here?” my lunch companion asked me, her plaint less geographic than moral. She wanted an explanation for Sfoglia being so far from the limelight in which she felt it belonged. Sfoglia is where it is because of what it is: not a showy bid for greatness but a sensible attempt at goodness by two seemingly earnest restaurateurs who want to make a go of it in Manhattan, where success doesn’t come easy. Ron Suhanosky, 35, and Colleen Marnell-Suhanosky, 36, met in 1994, when she wasn’t hyphenated and they worked a few feet from each other as line cooks in a Boston restaurant. One look at her, he says, and he saw it all: marriage, a restaurant of their own. It took him about six months, he says, to bring her around. They now have two children, with a third on the way, and two Sfoglias. The first opened in Nantucket in 2000. Many of its summer patrons reside on the Upper East Side, so the couple figured that a second Sfoglia (an Italian word referring to a sheet of pasta) would have a ready-made fan base in this neighborhood. He’s savory and she’s sweet — I speak of their menu assignments, not their dispositions — with one very notable exception. She’s responsible for the house bread, a union of crunchy, generously salted exterior and pillowy interior that’s the very definition of a happy marriage. Sfoglia puts me in my mind of two other Italian restaurants I admire. One is Spigolo, also on the Upper East Side, also small and also run by a young husband-wife team, with desserts by her. The other is Al di Là, in Park Slope, Brooklyn, which has husband-wife proprietors as well, though the wife, Anna Klinger, is the principal cook there. Like Al di Là, Sfoglia hits a sweet spot between simplicity and sophistication, both in its look and its food, and does so now much more ably than it did early last summer, when I encountered erratic food and dismissive service. What was flawed has since been fixed; what was good has remained so or become better. I remember being disappointed by the stinting application of a dry meat sauce to the pappardelle alla Bolognese, but in a recent visit, the sauce was luscious and there was just enough of it. At Sfoglia it’s made with veal, lamb, pork and chicken livers, and it has wonderful shadings of meaty flavor. I remember chicken al mattone — chicken cooked under a brick — being crisp outside, juicy inside and enlivened by currents of lemon. This time around it had all of those virtues plus a fiercer blast of pepperoncini, the heat of which jousted memorably with the lemon’s tartness. The pappardelle and the chicken are mainstays on a menu of about 20 dishes, including sides, that gets revised twice a month but always reflects a discernible commitment to fresh ingredients — salads here are dreamy — and more good ideas than bad ones. The carrot in that fusilli was a terrific idea, providing relief from the richness of the sauce and from the intensity of crunchy bits of guanciale that were also in the mix. So were the pomegranate seeds that added bite and brightness to thin cutlets of lamb that had been dredged in rice flour, sautéed and coated with pistachios. The moistness and tenderness of most of the meat and seafood that came out of the kitchen reflected enormous care. That was true of orata cooked in parchment and bejeweled with slices of candied orange; of rock shrimp with roasted apples on a bed of creamy polenta. Sfoglia always has a frittata on hand, though the vegetables in it change. The restaurant makes its own mostarda, a recent version of which included apricots and currants and appeared on top of robiola cheese and toasted brioche in a mixed appetizer plate. Sfoglia also makes mistakes. Gnocchi with braised pig’s feet was dull, as was a vegetable soup with pretty beads of olive oil skittering pointlessly across the surface. The use of tumblers as wine glasses is a rustic touch too far, and a few of the servers behave in a distracted manner, their aloofness recognizable from other restaurants with crowds at their doors. Being wanted can wreak as much attitude in a putatively modest restaurant as it can in a transparently immodest one. But the best of the desserts — a milk chocolate and hazelnut semifreddo and a gooey, loose bread pudding that’s reminiscent of crazily decadent French toast — end any meal here on the right note. And there’s something about Sfoglia’s scale, coupled with the warmth of its cooking, that make you want to call this restaurant your own and return here time and again. With so many other New Yorkers sharing that desire, what can you do? Lunch. It’s the civilized way to go. It’s also the smart one.

381,Pera Mediterranean Brasserie,1 star,"Feb. 14, 2007",Frank Bruni,Midtown South,Mediterranean,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/dining/reviews/14rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/14/dining/reviews/14rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"CERAMICS, carpets, baths: certain things are done better in Turkey than in many other countries, and that list includes  — and could arguably be led by  — the marinating, seasoning and grilling of meat, especially if it’s skewered. Turks live to skewer. If kebab production were a principal criterion for European Union membership, Turkey would have been admitted a decade ago. And if kebab production is what you look for in a restaurant, then hustle over to Pera Mediterranean Brasserie, where cubes of lamb and chicken are front and center. Reflecting the spirit of Turkey and often doing justice to it, Pera excels at grilled meats, a noteworthy sampling of which are available as part of a family-style meal called “the Pera tradition.” While it’s somewhat audacious for a brand-new restaurant to speak of its own tradition, it’s right of Pera to showcase this meal, which, at $46 a person,  is a noteworthy value, given the array of food, the size of the platters and the appeal of the meat. When I tried it, the lamb cubes had a welcome tang from their yogurt marinade. A dusting of paprika and coarse salt added just enough character to the chicken cubes. Both the lamb and the chicken were tender inside and smoky around the edges. Best of all were tiny lamb ribs, yet another component of the generously portioned platters. Each rib didn’t yield much flesh, but what was there was succulent and enormously flavorful: a happy change of pace from bigger, meatier chops. And Pera is, for the most part, a happy place. Happy but uneven: stray beyond the “tradition” and you risk disappointment, or at least boredom. Some of the mezes, salads and entrees that have been put together by the executive chefs, Sezai Celikbas and Jason Avery, struck me as menu filler, and Pera’s performance with seafood was spotty. Its jazzy look and feel are unmitigated delights, and jazzy isn’t so easy to come by on its patch of Manhattan, in the shadow of Grand Central Terminal. Pera has a spacious bar area up front, an open kitchen positioned like a stage in the back and, in between, a long, tall orange-tinged dining room filled with a good-looking polyglot crowd. The restaurant’s scale and liveliness possibly explain the brasserie reference, but then what isn’t a brasserie these days? The word gets tossed around so liberally that I could justifiably call my small kitchen and nearby table for six a brasserie. Drop by for oysters and choucroute garnie. All major cards accepted. The brasserie fare at Pera, which also takes inspiration from Greece and the Middle East, includes hummus (chunky and disappointing), octopus salad (rubbery), smoked eggplant dip (nowhere near as good as Sip Sak’s), beef tartare mixed with bulgur (a nifty twist) and tiny pizzas, which it calls pidettes, made with thin, floppy bread and toppings like ground lamb (terrific) and kasseri cheese (even better). Pidettes come as a midcourse in the family-style meal, further recommending it. And while some of Pera’s grilled meats were slightly tough when I dined there just after its mid-November opening, they improved quickly and markedly. Pera is a restaurant good enough at what it does best to argue for at least a moment’s consideration. DENNIS FOY is too. It opened shortly after Pera, serves French-inflected food in a subdued setting in TriBeCa and like Pera is a worthy but low-wattage addition to the New York dining scene: an “if you happen to be” as opposed to a “you have to try” restaurant. You don’t have to try most of the dishes at Dennis Foy, but if you happen to be in its part of town and you’re in the mood for a place less assertively and clangorously stylish than many of its neighbors, you’d be wise to treat yourself to its gnocchi, perfumed lavishly with sage and chives. Or its crab tian, a sort of crab cake that manages to lose the cake without unraveling. Or its salty, intense terrine of foie gras. These three dishes cover nearly half the appetizers: the menu at Dennis Foy is blessedly short. Given its succinctness, it should have a better ratio of compelling dishes to pleasant ones. Among eight or so entrees, including sea scallops with a parsnip purée and braised short ribs with cabbage and carrots, few really grab you, though roasted loin of lamb bested many peers around the city, and a strong dose of nutmeg exalted a fillet of Arctic char over spinach. The restaurant is named for its chef and co-owner, who cooked previously at Mondrian and EQ, both long gone. Mr. Foy also paints, and he brings a painter’s eye to the composition of dishes on plates, which bear swirls and Lilliputian orbs of indeterminate nature and flavor. In the desserts, by Kimberly Bugler, you’ll also find a visual flair that, in a few cases, outpaces any other payoff. A pumpkin napoleon with cardamom ice cream was more intriguing to behold than to ingest. Dennis Foy occupies the elegant, creamy space that belonged to the excessively self-conscious restaurant Lo Scalco. Mr. Foy has enlivened the atmosphere with affable service and splashes of color, courtesy of his own landscape canvases and of curving red, green and blue beams that have a playful, circuslike effect. Dennis Foy provides a rare example of a culinary enclave moving toward France from Italy and actually jettisoning airs in the process.

382,Gordon Ramsay at the London,2 star,"Jan. 31, 2007",Frank Bruni,Midtown,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/dining/reviews/31rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/31/dining/reviews/31rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE chef Gordon Ramsay has a British television show called “The F Word,” an American television show called “Hell’s Kitchen” and, by all accounts and appearances, the kind of foul mouth and foul temper those titles suggest. You might expect his debut New York restaurant to be brash and any of its shortcomings to be attributable to audacity, not timidity. You’d be wrong. Step into Gordon Ramsay at the London, so named because it inhabits the London NYC Hotel, which used to be the Rihga Royal. Look hard for any vibrancy, any color. The walls, which resemble mother-of-pearl, are less a hue than a mood: coolly, even icily, elegant. The flowers on and around the dozen tables are white. Against this monochrome, red letters above the doors — the ones spelling exit — exert the most potent tug on your attention. Those aren’t promising signs. The cautious palette foreshadows a cautious menu, as reliant on default luxuries and flourishes like foie gras and black truffles as on real imagination. Most ingredients are predictable, most flavors polite, most effects muted. Mr. Ramsay may be a bad boy beyond the edges of the plate, but in its center, he’s more a goody-two-shoes. And for all his brimstone and bravado, his strategy for taking Manhattan turns out to be a conventional one, built on familiar French ideas and techniques that have been executed with more flair, more consistency and better judgment in restaurants with less vaunted pedigrees. An appetizer of caramelized sweetbreads with creamed artichoke had a textbook luxuriousness, but it didn’t venture into any new or particularly gripping chapters. An entree of roasted chicken for two was adorned with a sufficiently flavorful fricassee of bacon, onions and prunes, but it was still just a roasted chicken for two. Mr. Ramsay is probably England’s most famous chef, draped in Michelin stars. His arrival in Manhattan reflects his continuing global expansion — he’s also in Tokyo, also in Dubai — while looking forward to the seemingly inevitable day when your top-tier restaurant choices in a major destination on one continent are much the same as those in a major destination on another. Ramsay? Ducasse? Vongerichten? Perhaps you just go with the restaurant of your countryman, supporting the home team. That’s the route suggested by the makeup of the dining room at the new Ramsay, where British visitors were abundant. It’s comforting to know that Americans aren’t the only tourists who travel far from home and then stay and sup in reminders of it. There are actually two conjoined restaurants under Mr. Ramsay’s supervision and banner in the hotel; the other one, through which visitors to the inner sanctum walk, is called the London Bar. It’s bigger and more casual, with a shiny retro look that makes you feel as if you’re inside a gargantuan vintage car. The London Bar’s menu of small plates — three to six make a meal — yielded an equal number of hits (a layered parfait evoking the components of a B.L.T. sandwich) and misses (a layered parfait of warm avocado, ice-cold crab and sweet corn sorbet). The barroom has a more adventurous spirit than the formal dining room, which makes you feel as if you’re in a space capsule floating through a supra-national limbo. The accents of the servers are English, French and German (or was it Dutch?), as if the entire European Union was tapped for the right cast of characters to stride across the restaurant’s carpeted floor. And they stride with grace and good sense, finding the right note of solicitousness, not intrusiveness. Their deftly calibrated pitch reflects the restaurant’s success in presenting most of the coddling staples of traditional haute dining — the service carts, the tableside anointments — without the full degree of pomp. Without too  crippling a cost, either. The $80 that Gordon Ramsay charges for a three-course prix fixe  is entirely reasonable in this city’s current dining climate, considering everything the restaurant provides: croutons with foie gras and truffled cream cheese spreads at the start of a meal; a flurry of first-rate petit fours at the end; genuinely helpful guidance through the restaurant’s comprehensive lists of wines and other spirits. But the restaurant fails to deliver the most important thing of all: excitement. And it’s impossible, given Mr. Ramsay’s reputation, not to be primed for it, and not to be rankled by the low-key loveliness that you get in its place. The cauliflower beignets in an appetizer of caramelized sea scallops were adorable, but they were playing cameos in a dish whose stars turned in dutiful, forgettable performances. Among roughly eight appetizer selections on the prix fixe menu most nights, the only bold standout was red mullet, served as pan-fried fillets that were framed and tamed perfectly by the brightness, acidity and sweetness of a pink grapefruit vinaigrette. Among a similar number of entrees, there was a similar dearth of inspiration. While chorizo and artichoke lent plenty of personality to a beautifully roasted fillet of black bass, a bitter chocolate sauce and a beet fondant didn’t jazz up slices of venison loin quite as much as they needed to. The dish’s music remained faint. And there were a few off-putting concoctions, like a cloying, gummy wedge of turbot poached in St. Émilion and a bizarre appetizer combining delicate little langoustine tails with indelicate nuggets of boneless chicken wing, crusted with hazelnuts and sweetened with maple syrup. Eric Ripert, meet Colonel Sanders. The best desserts by the pastry chef, Alistair Wise, were terrific: a tarte Tatin with crisp pastry, and a flawless apricot soufflé with sugary almonds and almond ice cream. Mr. Wise and the chef de cuisine, Neil Ferguson, are running a serious kitchen here and capable of impeccable work.  And that makes the restaurant’s tentativeness and its bad decisions, which were too numerous, all the more frustrating. Why did envelopes of raw, thinly sliced, unpleasantly papery red beet, which were stuffed with ricotta and sprinkled with pine nuts, appear so often? They showed up as a trio in a dish on the London Bar menu, as a duo in a course on an extended  dining-room tasting menu and as individual amuse-bouches for the dining room’s  prix fixe. Seldom have such frail shoulders been asked to carry such a heavy load. And seldom has a conquistador as bellicose as Mr. Ramsay landed with such a whisper. It’s not an unappealing sound, but it’s nothing that’s going to prick up your ears. Gordon Ramsay at The London * * The London NYC Hotel, 151 West 54th Street; (212) 468-8888 or gordonramsay.com.

383,The Waverly Inn,1 star,"Jan. 24, 2007",Frank Bruni,West Village,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"TO: Graydon Carter, grayisgood@vanityfair.com FROM: Frannie Von Furstinshow, furstinshow@guccipucci.net First, dear, a quibble: Demi? On the cover? Back when she was large (and naked!) with a child destined for a nutty celebrity-spawn name, it made sense. But if “Bobby” is a comeback, I went to a state university. Now, applause: Waverly. Love it. I laugh when I hear it called a restaurant, as if it were anything so mundane and (apologies to Demi) pregnable. How can they call it a restaurant when the official phone number yields a recording that doesn’t take messages or even acknowledge that the place  has opened?  Of course, we’ve all been eating there since early November. It just isn’t open to anyone and everyone. Someday it will surely have to be. Someday the people who know you and the people who know your key staff members and the recognizable or attractive people who take the trouble to stop in, willing to submit to a visual once-over and try to make a reservation in person  — someday there won’t be enough of these people to fill the seats, and you’ll have to take all callers and comers, and it will all be so much different. But for now, well, we have a Toots Shor’s of our own, a Stork Club without the plumage. I think back to that night in London at the Groucho Club (remember how everyone was trying not to stare at Martin Amis’s new teeth?!) and how we agreed that New York needed an English gentlemen’s club that didn’t take English gentlemen as members. You could write the book on playing coy. Or at least a key chapter in the annals of playing coy. The big red letters saying “preview” on not only every page of the menu but also on every page of the wine list? The constant public nattering about the Edward Sorel mural not being done? (Looked good to me.) The refusal to let newspapers and magazines take pictures beyond the front bar area, as if there were still dropcloths and paint cans scattered about? Brilliant. Just brilliant. I heard you even held your ground with The Times, denying the photographer access to the dining rooms. How in the world will they get around that? I dropped in the other night. My eleventh visit, I think. (Is there some kind of frequent flier program? Kidding! But if there is. ...  ) That front bar area was poignant: all those strivers with Blackberries but without reservations, waiting for a tap on the shoulder that would never come. I heard a woman who did have a reservation  — her table wasn’t ready — tell her companion that they should sell it on eBay.  There’s a traitor in our midst. No wonder so many want in so badly. If our house up in Rhinebeck had the coziness that Waverly does, I wouldn’t make Herbert go up there alone as often as I do. The quaintly uneven  wood floors, the low ceilings, the four fireplaces, the red banquettes: Waverly is like a rumpled, wrinkled dowager who  found some late-in-life glamour, who   got a great tailor and the best laser peel money could buy. What was it before? Ye Waverly Inn? Graydon, ye somehow managed to keep the sense that it dates back to the 1920s while losing the mustiness. Everything about it, and everyone in it, glows. I even like the rear garden, with its high glass ceiling, handsome brick walls and forest of plants. Siberia was never so verdant. I’ve dawdled in getting to the food, because I hate to complain. But does it have to be this good, Graydon? Isn’t that a strategic blunder? When word gets out that your chef, John DeLucie, is doing some of the best tuna tartare in town (all that creamy avocado and zingy  heat!), plus a hefty and juicy pork chop, a classically blissful Dover sole, an addictive clam chowder, a gorgeous fillet of wild salmon (with those adorable little beluga lentils) and such feloniously fatty short ribs, won’t there be even more lemmings tumbling down the steps from Bank Street and through the door? Won’t we have some of the Little Owl and August crowds on top of the folks who’d mow down their grandmothers for invitations to the Vanity Fair Oscar party? Sure, this isn’t attention-getting cuisine. It doesn’t take much to steam an artichoke or whip up chicken liver mousse. The world could do without one more frisée aux lardons, one more blizzard of goat cheese (yes, I saw, Humboldt Fog goat cheese) on one more landscape of crimson beets. Apple crisp and crème caramel aren’t paths to Epicurean glory. But I’ve been to Cafe Cluny, and it doesn’t pull off a similarly modest menu of comforting favorites as well. Except for the dull chicken pot pie and the humdrum crab cakes and the functional strip steak, Waverly is like the cooking I’d do at home, if I had the time and, well, O.K., if I could cook. And it’s not just me who thinks so. I heard this drone at a nearby table prattling to his hostages — excuse me,  friends — about the crispness of the Amish free-range chicken’s skin and how the bird had real flavor and how the moist meat was a barometer of a conscientious kitchen. What was he? A restaurant critic? He actually asked if the $55 macaroni and cheese with shaved white truffles could be ordered without the truffles. He didn’t get it. The whole point is the  comedy of getting — and being seen getting — something so absurdly costly. No truffles, no deal. No kidding, Graydon, Waverly is sweet. It’s not just about an A-list daisy chain of writers, actors, models. It’s not just about ringside seats to the latest Perelman-Barkin smackdown. It’s about the ease and privilege of being among people who reflect your brainiest, prettiest sense of self. And it’s got manners: the bartenders stand on their toes and peek over the front row of revelers to try to take drink orders from the bleachers, no matter who’s there. The waiters smile as they deliver those wonderful biscuits, even if the recipients don’t have boldface names. It’s like a gracious nightly party, Graydon, that you host in spirit even when you’re not there in person, though you often are. It’s just a few steps from your home to the Waverly, to this vision of Greenwich Village as it’s often been romanticized but probably never really was. I don’t have to read your answers to a Proust Questionnaire to know how good that must make you feel. xoxo Frannie * 16 Bank Street at Waverly Place, Greenwich Village; (212) 243-7900.

384,Bar Room at the Modern,3 star,"Jan. 10, 2007",Frank Bruni,Midtown East,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/10/dining/reviews/10rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/10/dining/reviews/10rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"HERE’S the epitome of a safe bet: Whenever the next Zagat Survey for New York City restaurants comes out, Gramercy Tavern and Union Square Cafe, the Danny Meyer mainstays, will be rated most popular. And in the survey after that, they’ll rule. They always do. They’re like a pair of preternaturally blessed prom queens in a high school where senior year never ends. But if you want as much radiance — as much pleasure — as you can find in a Meyer restaurant, your gaze should fall elsewhere. When did you last look at Eleven Madison Park? If the answer is more than a year ago, look again. In early 2006 a new chef, Daniel Humm, took over the kitchen, and the food at last lives up to the setting, the most regal in the Meyer coterie. For inspired, opulent cooking, like a crazily intense suckling pig entree for the ages, Eleven Madison is the Meyer destination of the here and now. Unless, that is, you’re in a less formal mood. Then you should set out for the Modern, but here’s the crucial, counterintuitive part: head for the cheap seats. The Modern is divided into a fussy dining room and a more freewheeling bar area, where the food is less expensive, though not really and truly cheap. The Bar Room doesn’t have the dining room’s view of the Museum of Modern Art’s sculpture garden, but it does have a more accessible, straightforward menu of dishes so satisfying that the trade-off is worth it. The tarte flambée, with its whisper of a crust and its confetti of bacon slivers, cinches the deal all on its own. Who needs Picasso when you’ve got a pizza like this? In the Meyer world right now, the most validated, consecrated theaters aren’t necessarily the most rewarding. Eleven Madison and the Modern’s Bar Room are the proof. Although I’ve spent more time recently in these two places than in the others, I’ve covered enough Meyer territory over the last two years to be convinced that they’re the standouts. I prefer them to Tabla, to Union Square Cafe and definitely to Gramercy Tavern, whose luster had dimmed some even before the chef Tom Colicchio officially severed his ties in August. It’s anyone’s guess how it will emerge from its current state of transition, which isn’t pretty. During a meal there last month a fillet of cod was a mealy catastrophe. Servers tried to deliver another table’s entrees to ours, then tried to deliver the same desserts twice. And I prefer the Modern’s Bar Room to its ostensibly better, glossier half. After giving the restaurant as a whole two stars following its opening in early 2005, I repeatedly found myself drawn back to the Bar Room, at first just worried, then persuaded, that I’d shortchanged it. The Modern’s distinct faces have very different appeals, a situation echoed at the city’s many other multiple-personality restaurants, and it’s time to acknowledge that for some of these restaurants, one summary judgment cannot do justice to two unequal parts. If the dining room is a stately epic, the Bar Room is an unpretentious character study. It has a shorter running time, fewer showy star turns, a less lavish budget for truffles. Its dishes state their cases with one or two central ingredients, one or two salient effects. A warm veal and goat cheese terrine was just that: alternating bands of luscious meat and creamy cheese, coming together in such a rich, deeply flavored way that you surrendered to it not by taking ever-bigger bites, but by taking ever-smaller ones. A little goes such a long way. That sentence could be the Bar Room’s motto. Its roughly 30 dishes,  presented in three tidy menu columns, are all portioned somewhere between a normal appetizer and an abnormally stinting entree, most around $15. The Bar Room adheres to an increasingly popular small-plates approach, intended to give diners more tastes of more things and more control over their meals. And it aces that approach perhaps better than any restaurant around town, its menu striking an ideal balance between relatively conventional French starters or snacks (an elegant liverwurst, a textbook foie gras torchon, steak tartare with the upgrade of a quail egg) and dishes that nudge you closer to a full-fledged dinner (grilled scallops amid beets and toasted almonds, pliant roasted garlic gnocchi interspersed with crispy nuggets of sweetbreads). Some small-plates menus make you feel that you’re being exiled to an island of sorry leftovers, asked to swoon over salumi, or subjected like gastronomic guinea pigs to experiments a chef would never try on an entree-size canvas. The Bar Room’s menu makes you feel that you’re eating in an easy — but no less privileged — fashion. While the Alsatian-born executive chef, Gabriel Kreuther, seems to lead with his head in the dining room, he definitely leads with his heart in the Bar Room, where several dishes — including a fat, juicy Alsatian sausage with pickled turnip — hit notes of hearty rusticity. There’s a tighter crush of people in the Bar Room, a louder conversational hum, and this conviviality acts as an essential antidote to any chilliness in the restaurant’s sleek contemporary style and subdued palette. So do a row of red chairs near the bar, red shirts on servers and a glowing photograph of a luminous forest that takes up an entire wall. The Bar Room has pivotal blasts of color that the dining room largely lacks. In terms of setting, Eleven Madison Park, which opened in 1998, has a grandeur — marble floors and walls, a ceiling at least two stories high — that’s the envy of almost any other restaurant. I gave Eleven Madison two stars in February 2005, and while I normally wouldn’t review a restaurant again so soon, Mr. Humm’s food  — not the new table settings, not the tweaked lighting — made me do it. I can’t have beef tenderloin in a bordelaise sauce this dense with marrow — this druggy — and stay mum. I can’t cut into such impeccably roasted duck — glazed smartly, but not too sweetly, with lavender and honey — and shut up about it. That would be a dereliction of duty. It would be just plain mean. Mr. Humm, 30, was born and reared in Switzerland and made his reputation at Campton Place in San Francisco. Under him the food at Eleven Madison has become more French and more precious. That change won’t be to every diner’s liking. But meals here now hit highs they never came close to in the past. Take that amazing — absolutely amazing  — suckling pig. It comes as a brick of deboned, tightly packed, meltingly tender meat that’s been poached in duck fat. The meat is bordered by a strip of crackling skin that seems to defy the laws of nature and science. Can anything really be so crunchy and light while also being so fatty and heavy? Mr. Humm performs tricks big and small, new and old. Swirls of Venezuelan cocoa provided a sharp, bitter, surprising and entirely apt foil for a torchon of foie gras. Another bold call, another complete success: the sweet, rich chestnuts in a late November entree of poached lobster with butternut squash. To an appetizer of uncooked hamachi with pickled butternut squash, Mr. Humm added toasted pumpkinseeds and pumpkinseed oil. He had clearly made a decision: if he was going to embrace late autumn, he might as well hug it for all it was worth. Sometimes he got carried away. Did a different lobster entree, on a different night, need not one  but two  tableside anointments? While the first of them, a tangerine-flavored chicken reduction, gave the dish a gorgeous perfume, the second, a camomile  foam, was pure affectation. Portions can be picayune, and desserts are something of a question mark, which is to say that the restaurant’s superb pastry chef, Nicole Kaplan, quit around Thanksgiving, handing the reins to her second in command, Alison Johnson. While Ms. Kaplan was still in charge during some of my recent meals, her work wasn’t as dazzling as in the past. Maybe she already had a foot out the door. But every time I left Eleven Madison Park, it was with at least one dish, and usually several, lingering in my thoughts and prompting me to rave to somebody the next day. That’s not the case with most restaurants, and that hasn’t been my experience in recent years at Gramercy Tavern or Union Square Cafe. They may have the more steadfast retinues of loyal suitors.  But the crowns rest uneasily — and perhaps unjustly — on their heads. Eleven Madison Park ★★★ 11 Madison Avenue (24th Street); (212) 889-0905.

385,Sasabune,1 star,"Dec. 27, 2006",Frank Bruni,Upper East Side,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THERE are restaurants that accentuate the positive and want you to know they’ll do anything, within the bounds of reason and the scope of what’s in the kitchen, to accommodate your desires. Then there’s Sasabune, which wants you to know that you’re entering a world  —   well, a white-walled nook with an almost severe lack of adornment  —   in which the rules of engagement are established and mostly unwavering. Sasabune wants you to know this right off, so there’s a sign outside the front door that unfurls a litany of negativity: children discouraged from sitting at sushi bar, no à-la-carte ordering for groups larger than four, and certainly none of those colorful sushi rolls that have migrated even into supermarket salad bars. A sign inside reiterates that last blast of nay-saying, admonishing diners: “No California rolls. No spicy tuna rolls.” It might as well say, “No sushi dilettantes,” because that’s part of the message here. But there’s another part as well, communicated by yet another sign inside, this one with a gentler tone. It says: “Today’s special: trust me.” And it gets at the fuller picture, which is that Sasabune isn’t simply trying to bend you to its will. It’s trying to treat you to its vision, let you benefit from its judgment. In the world of omakase, sternness and kindness overlap, and a slap is in many senses a caress. Since its opening on the Upper East Side in early November, Sasabune has served only an omakase menu. That means its chef and owner, Kenji Takahashi, also known as the “me” you’re supposed to “trust,” decides what you’ll eat and the order in which you’ll eat it, sending out slices of albacore sashimi in a tart version of a ponzu sauce, then pieces of toro sushi with no sauce or gloss at all. Intent on determining not only sequence but also seasoning, Mr. Takahashi lets you know precisely what he thinks you should and shouldn’t do to the fish in front of you, or one of his servers does. “No soy sauce!” those servers bellow when they set down sushi for which it isn’t advised. It’s unclear whether the volume and urgency of the command reflect a carefully enunciated compensation for rocky English or an edict whose violation could prompt expulsion. Sasabune exemplifies a certain kind of sushi restaurant and experience: the tiny, simple, serene refuge that inspires a cult of devotees, who equate instruction with enlightenment, surrender with liberation. That cult is already forming: on the nights I visited the restaurant, many of the diners had been there before  —  I could tell from overheard conversations  —  and had already established a rapport with Mr. Takahashi, who smiled broadly when he handed them what he knew was their favorite fish. Sasabune is noteworthy for another reason as well. While the $60 or so per person it charges for its omakase menu isn’t inexpensive, the amount and quality of the sushi that money buys represent a very fair deal in comparison with similar meals at like-minded restaurants. The kanpachi I had at Sasabune was as silky and buttery as the kanpachi I’ve had anywhere else; the toro was the fatty stuff of head rushes. Mr. Takahashi obviously takes pains to find top-tier ingredients, and he takes pains to mold nicely proportioned beds of rice, the warm temperature of which is what often distinguishes a serious sushi restaurant from an assembly line. There are tradeoffs. The pacing of a meal at Sasabune was often off-putting, perhaps because Mr. Takahashi was the only one molding the rice and cutting the fish. Usually in groups of two, pieces of sushi came flying at me so fast at times that the meal lasted just an hour. At other times, the rat-tat-tat rhythm gave way to awkwardly long lags. Despite their strictness, Mr. Takahashi and his assistants, who chip in by splashing sauces and scattering scallions on the fish, can actually be a bit sloppy. My piece of slightly cooked black cod, placed on a nori-wrapped puck of rice, was gently kissed by a sweetened sea eel reduction; a companion’s piece was swimming in the dark, intense, mesmerizing liquid. And Mr. Takahashi’s fondness for tartness, evident in the yuzu and lemon juices he brushes on hamachi, oysters and other fish, exceeded my own and many companions’. He honed his craft at  — and named his restaurant after —  a Sasabune in Los Angeles with the same “trust me” language and ethos. His Sasabune has just six seats at the sushi bar, another 14 or so at nearby tables and another dozen in a back room that wasn’t usually in use. The sushi bar is the place to sit, allowing you to bask in the palpable joy he takes in his work. His approach to seasoning is less elaborate than Sushi of Gari’s, more elaborate than Kuruma Zushi’s. He seldom put more than a rumor of wasabi, if that, between the rice and the fish, and he did nothing more to sweet blue crab than pack it with warm rice into a cylindrical roll of crisply, beautifully toasted nori. That hefty, filling roll was the climactic moment of each of my meals, and it was a knockout. But fluke sushi received a colorful plume of pickled red radish, Japanese chili pepper and scallions. Gorgeous Scottish salmon was roofed with a thin tile of kelp, over which toasted sesame seeds were scattered, providing a nutty lift. There were more of those seeds on top of the cod. An omakase meal at Sasabune usually encompassed more than a dozen pieces of sushi or sashimi, including Spanish mackerel and sea scallop. After the crab roll, Mr. Takahashi would permit requests, adjusting the bill upward accordingly. I stretched my meal out with uni one night, with a second crab roll and some sea eel on another night. Not counting wine or sake from a limited selection, my bill never climbed above $80. Mr. Takahashi told me that as the restaurant evolves, he may allow à la carte ordering from the start of a meal. I doubt he’s in any hurry to get to that point. He clearly prefers to call the shots. With fish this fine, he’s earned that right.",Scallop sushi; salmon sushi with kelp and toasted sesame seeds; blue crab roll; kanpachi sushi. 
386,The  Russian Tea Room,1 star,"Dec. 20, 2006",Frank Bruni,Midtown,Russian,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/20/dining/reviews/20rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/20/dining/reviews/20rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IT’S a safe bet that many visitors to the reborn Russian Tea Room won’t realize that it still serves chicken Kiev and beef stroganoff, or at least interpretations thereof. These dishes aren’t mentioned in the clear print on the dinner menu’s first three pages, which cover appetizers and entrees and seem  to exhaust the restaurant’s savory offerings. They aren’t mentioned on any kind of specials card. No, they’re relegated to a typographical Siberia: an italicized blur on the mostly blank fourth page of the menu, where diners are also told of holidays on which the restaurant will be open. “We are delighted to prepare historical Tea Room favorites, including chicken Kiev and beef stroganoff, on request,” reads the blur, which of course conveys the opposite message. If the Tea Room czars are so chirpily delighted, why not put the Kiev where people can find it? That’s easy: because a torpedo of breaded chicken with a butter-filled cavity isn’t really what Gary Robins, a seriously gifted chef, wants to cook. Mr. Robins, whose new American cuisine at  the Biltmore Room won him widespread praise, has a deservedly grander and less fry-happy sense of self. His surprising recruitment  to revive this wheezing institution has produced an engrossing tug-of-war: his culinary internationalism and contemporary sophistication versus the institution’s stodgy traditions and geographically constrained name; tataki of seared hamachi, which he sneaks onto the appetizer list, versus borscht, which he also dutifully includes there. Some dishes seem not to have any firmer tether to Russia than the restaurant’s ersatz Chagall and Kandinsky paintings and golden firebirds have to conventional elegance. Other dishes blur the boundaries between Russia, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and even the Far East. By Mr. Robins’s reckoning, poaching Maine lobster in sour cream tugs it as close to Red Square as it needs to be, permitting him to round out the plate with pickled papaya and cauliflower flan. Putting dumplings made with  tvorog, a Russian farmer’s cheese, next to slices of seared venison loin allows him to dust the meat with cocoa, a fate it doesn’t routinely meet in Moscow. Make a concession, take a liberty — that’s how he handles his ethnic compass.  It’s a smart approach,  accommodating  an impulse simply to do what feels right and yielding some very appealing dishes. As best I can tell, goose breast carpaccio isn’t all the rage in St. Petersburg, but maybe it should be.  Silky leaves of meat were sprinkled  with toasted pistachio and crowned with baby arugula, tiny cubes of sour-cherry jelly and like-sized cubes of creamy foie gras. If beef and noodles are all that’s necessary to claim a stroganoff, Mr. Robins satisfied the criteria while otherwise doing as he pleased. The beef was braised short rib, while the noodles were festooned with chanterelle and hen-of-the-woods mushrooms.  For the rich, zingy sauce that completed this terrific dish, he mixed whipped  cream, sour cream, horseradish and whole grain mustard. Adding sour cream or cabbage is one of his recurring strategies, as is pickling an ingredient. Slices of pork tenderloin were complemented by a version of stuffed cabbage — steamed and filled with ground pork shoulder and foie gras — that was out of this world. And the pickled cabbage beside a beautifully roasted fillet of turbot was a kraut to end all krauts, studded with pastrami and suffused with butter and olive oil. Sumptuous appetizer crepes already had a Russian name  — blinchiki — and thus a Russian pedigree, so Mr. Robins was free to stuff them with goat cheese, duck confit and yet more chanterelles. He didn’t toy around too much with the borscht, which  had a brilliant ruby color and brimmed with fresh dill. And the potato pancakes with a fluffy lunchtime omelet were faithfully rendered and wholly on target, hitting that crunchy-oily bull’s-eye. More than a few dishes weren’t so successful. Tea-smoked sturgeon had an acrid aftertaste. The chicken Kiev, unexpectedly straightforward, did a rubbery impersonation of airline food, and I mean coach. There are nearly a dozen kinds of caviar — foreign, domestic, wild, farmed — and several of the ones I tried had an excessively pasty texture, lacking any bouncy pop. The kitchen was also bedeviled by inconsistency. Buckwheat blini that were golden and fluffy one visit were charred and leaden the next. But this restaurant’s real shortcoming is its service, unforgivably poor in the context of dinner entrees that frequently exceed $40, appetizers that infrequently fall below $18 and 30-gram servings of caviar that cost as much as $300. Outdated menus with erroneous information were put on the table. Drinks and food were ludicrously slow to arrive. Servers responded dismissively to complaints, one of them telling us that we shouldn’t bother him with questions about a fugitive bottle of wine. It was, he shrugged, the sommelier’s problem. And what a problem. Although we had ordered a 1998 French Burgundy for $84, we got a 2001. We flagged the discrepancy, and for the next 15 minutes, as we ate our appetizers and thirsted for pinot noir, both the wine and sommelier were on the lam. When he showed up, he presented us with a similar 1998 — the listed one was unavailable — for $20 more. He paused, seemingly waiting for us to agree to spend that. Then, in the manner of a car salesman, he said: “I’ll make you a deal. We’ll call it an even $90.” Could he throw in cruise control? A leather interior? He later dropped the price to $84, the right end to a wrong situation that typified the restaurant’s clumsiness. Around since 1926, the Russian Tea Room has been teetering like an outmoded regime for more than a decade, its ownership repeatedly changing, its doors closing for years on end. Its last incarnation, which shut down in 2002, was rated satisfactory by William Grimes in The New York Times in 1999. This incarnation, owned by  Gerald Lieblich, opened nearly two months ago, and it looks like a vivid memory made real. Velvet ropes point you to a revolving glass door, which in turn leads you to the Santa-red booths and spruce-green walls of the ground-floor dining room, where every day is Christmas. (An upstairs dining room — the one with the translucent bear — remains under wraps.) And at times the experience indeed feels like a gift. The desserts  fulfill their sweet obligations, though apart from a pair of blintzes, they’re geographically unbound. That was truest of the best of them, a buttermilk panna cotta with lingonberries and hazelnuts. To another chef’s stroganoff, it might be an eccentric coda. To Mr. Robins’s, it’s as logical a next course as any other. In terms of food and all else, the Russian Tea Room doesn’t add up neatly or quite make sense. Maybe that’s its way of paying homage to the motherland. The Russian Tea Room * 150 West 57th Street; (212) 581-7100.

387,Cafe Cluny,1 star,"Dec. 13, 2006",Frank Bruni,West Village,"American, Bistros, French, New American",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/13/dining/reviews/13rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/13/dining/reviews/13rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE acoustics are cruel, the lighting kind, the profiteroles outstanding and the frisée aux lardons an embarrassment of unnecessary truffle oil. But who are we kidding? For now and for the immediate future, the balance of virtues and vices at Cafe Cluny, a West Village newcomer, won’t determine its success, already established. What diners are responding to is its genealogy. Owned in part by Lynn Wagenknecht, the ex-wife of Keith McNally, it shares roots with Odeon, Cafe Luxembourg, Balthazar and Pastis, and it  trades on those ties, its walls decorated with framed sketches of well-known worshipers at McNally-related temples over the years. Their faces contribute to its aura of chromosomal coolness, and that aura has kept Cafe Cluny packed, no matter how unimaginative the menu (roasted chicken with baby carrots, baby beets with goat cheese) or erratic the service, which hit bottom during a dinner when the sides arrived with the appetizers. In the restaurant business as in presidential politics, it can help to come from the right family. And Cafe Cluny has learned the lessons of its brood, the previously mentioned members of which are to some extent anagrams of one another, their details and levels of performance different, their overall strategy much the same. Give people food with the comfort of the familiar and dress it with buzz, so that it all seems more eventful than it is. Adapt a French idiom for a Manhattan audience. Make sure the fries are crunchy and salty. Cafe Cluny does all of that but also departs from the tradition. It’s more bistro than brasserie, tucked into two low-ceilinged rooms that trade swagger for a gentle prettiness that’s charming on first sight. There are carved stone birds in a glass diorama along one wall, flickering votive candles on each table and homey touches throughout, with one extremely odd exception. In the back dining room, hanging upside down from the ceiling, is a wood sculpture of what looks like a giant roach. Its intended symbolism is anyone’s guess. Like Cafe Cluny’s scale, its dinner menu is modest: half a dozen appetizers, eight entrees and a smattering of sides and desserts. Most of these dishes emphasize accessibility over enterprise, and if you happen across the right ones on the right night, you can have a meal that rises well above pleasant while falling only slightly shy of memorable. Maybe your good fortune will come courtesy of plump, supple sea scallops, placed on a cushion of cauliflower purée that’s brightened by swirls of beet jus. The best of the appetizers, it spoke to the kitchen’s generally expert cooking of seafood, which was also evident in a starter of unusually delicate bulbs of grilled squid against a backdrop of what was billed as risotto. I say billed because there was minimal truth in that advertising. Rice-a-Roni would have been as apt a description of the dry, dreary grains. One of the best entrees was roasted cod, buttery in texture,  with a hearty mash of polenta and piperade. Another, to my astonishment, was a monkfish special. I’ve grown weary of monkfish’s popularity and skeptical of its charms: it always seems to cool too quickly after it reaches the table and its flavor can be subtle to the point of being chimerical. In response to this challenge and in accordance with the current vogue, the chefs Vincent Nargi and Phil Conlon recruited the services of pork. A generous cloak of pancetta not only enlivened but also seemed to insulate the fish, keeping it warm. While the richness of braised short ribs was decadently amplified by seared foie gras on top, there was no distinction — but, then again, no fault — in a thick-sliced hanger steak, served with fingerling potatoes in place of fries. That was true as well of the chicken and of swordfish with green peppercorns scattered over it. For a menu this concise, weak spots were too common. An entree of duck confit was tough. The linguine below a colony of cockles was soupy. As for soups themselves, which appeared as changing nightly specials, they tended to be sludgy and timidly seasoned. One of them promised spicy red lentils, coconut milk and cumin oil, only to deliver a vague hodgepodge of indistinct effects. Delving into it was like boarding a flight for India and getting only as far as Heathrow. You couldn’t ask for a more solid roster of sides, highlighted by haricots verts with hazelnuts and brussels sprouts with plenty of bacon. But you could justly demand a much better lineup of desserts, among which the only unqualified winner was those profiteroles, with crisp pastry and with slivers of almond flecking deeply chocolaty sauce. You could also demand better service. Smooth on some occasions, it was ragged on several others. I asked for a glass of white wine; I got red. A friend asked for yogurt cheesecake; she got nothing. Servers kept re-checking orders, undoubtedly because they had trouble hearing them. If they wind up working at Cafe Cluny too long, they may have trouble hearing altogether. On busy nights, it’s painfully loud. The restaurant’s name alludes not only to a museum in Paris but also — fittingly — to a Parisian Metro station next to the Odéon stop. And Cafe Cluny’s emergence belongs to an incestuous boomlet of fashionable troughs in the West Village. Only a few blocks away, Graydon Carter, the Vanity Fair editor, whose face is among those in Cafe Cluny’s sketch gallery, has helped to remake and resurrect the Waverly Inn, which he owns with several partners. And Mr. McNally is about to try his hand at  Italian cuisine with Morandi, on Charles Street near Waverly Place. The attraction of the West Village is obvious: narrow and, in some spots, cobbled streets provide a romantic foreground for restaurants, whose dollhouse dimensions convey an intimacy lacking at so many brasher establishments. But except for a lunch visit, when Cafe Cluny  wasn’t full and stacks of the day’s newspapers were graciously laid out on a long table up front, it was less cozy and soothing than its appearance suggested it would be. I often  found myself squeezed into a tight seat and subjected to elbows and “excuse me’s” from all sides. That’s not the most unusual of fates. It’s not the worst of them. And it’s offset by just enough merit  to make Cafe Cluny a beguiling neighborhood place. But a noteworthy destination? Anyone seeing this restaurant in a light that kind is looking through a lens of culinary nepotism. Cafe Cluny * 284 West 12th Street (West Fourth Street), Greenwich Village; (212) 255-6900. ATMOSPHERE On a romantic West Village corner, two low-ceilinged rooms whose dollhouse charm is often shattered by how cramped they get. SOUND LEVEL Varies greatly, becoming extremely loud when crowded. RECOMMENDED DISHES Baby beets with goat cheese; scallops with cauliflower purée; roasted cod; monkfish; short ribs; brussels sprouts; haricots verts; confit fingerling potatoes; profiteroles.

388,Tocqueville,2 star,"Dec. 6, 2006",Frank Bruni,Union Square,"French, New American",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/06/dining/reviews/06rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/06/dining/reviews/06rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"MOST restaurants intent on improvement make do with makeovers, repainting walls, rethinking menus and, by the current fiats of fine dining, unveiling arrays of small plates. They seldom relocate, at least not unless there’s a feud with landlords or a plumbing crisis on a par with “The Poseidon Adventure.” A change of address is too potentially unsettling to regulars, too potentially ruinous to the delicate chemistry that makes a place work. Tocqueville and the Tasting Room, two downtown favorites with devoted followings and menus that emphasize the Greenmarket, took the risk anyway. Like lawyers who have just made partner or  winners on “America’s Next Top Pharmaceutical Researcher,” they converted good fortune into roomier real estate. And they wagered that whatever part of their charm they owed to their intimate settings paled beside virtues that would be served by — or at least survive — newer, bigger stages. They weren’t wrong. Then again, they weren’t entirely right. Tocqueville didn’t go far — from one end of the block of 15th Street east of Fifth Avenue to the other. The short distance, however, belies the extent of the effect. In its original location, Tocqueville’s artfully composed dishes came as impressive surprises given the cramped, trapezoid-shape room, whose big windows gave it the slightest inflection of a sidewalk cafe. Tocqueville now has a proper vestibule, beyond which lies a proper lounge area, beyond which lies a proper dining room with yards of wavy silk hanging dramatically, like stage curtains, over a passageway to the kitchen. In other words, Tocqueville screams “serious restaurant” where it once only whispered those words. The adjustment of volume leads to a readjustment of expectations, and the pricey food seems only as good as it should be, given the refinement of the air around it. The uneven caliber of servers stands out. Some of them struggle through recitations of a dish’s ingredients or, when pouring sauce at the table, dribble it over the edge of a plate. Why attempt such fussiness if you can’t ace it? Tocqueville, which received two stars from William Grimes in The New York Times shortly after it opened in 2000, remains a haven of considerable pleasures, thanks to the high standards and palpably committed efforts of its chef, Marco Moreira, who owns the restaurant with his wife, Jo-Ann Makovitzky. Whether the dish is wild salmon wrapped in Savoy cabbage, lobster with spaghetti squash and a saffron emulsion, or roasted chicken with morels and a parsnip purée, Mr. Moreira’s kitchen can be counted on to make the meat or seafood as tender as can be and to give it lively company. In a city too enamored of pork three ways or multiple meditations upon lamb, Tocqueville’s beef twofer nonetheless proved delightful. Poetic in name and approach, it comprised a small “60-second sirloin” — seared on one side, nearly bloody on the other — and a “24-hour rib pot roast” with a contrasting, decadently spongy texture. The sauce on the rib meat had a hint of bitter chocolate, while parsnips on the plate carried currents of vanilla. Tocqueville’s Eurocentric wine list has interesting selections. Its desserts, though, can be precious; a toasted sesame pudding with an elderflower and shiso consommé comes to mind. And it didn’t have its act together at lunch, when the front door went unattended, cod was mushy and an ostensibly truffle-bedecked risotto lacked flavor. In terms of service, the relocated version of the Tasting Room, which more than tripled in size by moving from its 25-seat East Village nook to a hodgepodge of casual rooms in NoLIta, almost never had its act together during recent visits. There was waiting and more waiting: for bottles of white wine to be chilled on the spot; for dishes to be cleared; for more food to arrive. Maybe the restaurant wasn’t ready to grow this much larger. The new space is a drag, but lost coziness isn’t the culprit. Found ugliness is. In the rear room, the whiteness of the walls and shape of the ceiling suggest a hastily erected tent, and the clunky artwork could easily be on loan from an elementary school. When crowded, the room is noisy to boot. And it’s frequently crowded, because many New Yorkers rightly appreciate that no restaurant burrows more joyously into the earth or delves more deeply into the forest than the Tasting Room, which received one star from Mr. Grimes in 2001. Its mushroom mania and exaltation of esoteric, exactly identified plants are arguably unrivaled. Ovoli mushrooms, mousseron mushrooms, tepary beans, tatsoi — they were all here and all handled with utmost care, emerging as the most generous and best parts of appetizers and entrees, which can be ordered in small tasting portions or larger sizes. But whatever they burnished — Montauk blackfish in one dish, Montauk tilefish in another — often had the feel and appeal of afterthoughts. The Tasting Room is like a vegetarian restaurant that won’t come out of the closet. Responding to what’s available from local producers and to his own formidable energy, the chef and co-owner Colin Alevras changes the menu constantly, hitting highs and lows. His crunchy, salty conch fritters were kookily good: the Tater Tots of the sea. His heirloom pear and whey soup was Gerber’s by a different name. The star dessert was a kabocha squash cheesecake. While the wine list, once exclusively American, now has some European selections, its laudable focus is still on unusual grapes and blends from enterprising producers. So drink up. It’s a way to fill the long pauses between courses.",
389,Spicy & Tasty,2 star,"Nov. 29, 2006",Frank Bruni,Flushing,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/29/dining/reviews/29rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/29/dining/reviews/29rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE smart way to begin a meal at Spicy & Tasty, perhaps the most aptly named restaurant in the city, is with a leap of faith. Or more precisely, a series of gesticulations of faith. You walk in, notice a display case, heed its pull and study its bounty of more than a dozen dishes, tended by a man visibly delighted by your fascination. Since his English isn’t much better than your Mandarin, the ensuing conversation involves considerable pointing, nodding and shrugging, glued together by stray syllables of spoken communication. “What’s that?” you say, pointing to pale, almost translucent ribbons of something unusual looking in red oil that glistens brightly enough to render the answer inconsequential. You’re going to get it, whatever it is. “Beef tender,” he says, and since it’s clearly not a conventional cut of beef, you guess that he means tendon. You will later determine, from its slick and rubbery (in a good way) texture, that you’re correct. But for now you wordlessly indicate your approval and move on to the next mystery. “That?” Your finger extends toward another heap of pale ribbons, much thinner than the tendon, also doused with red oil. While the man struggles for a response, one of your companions hazards a guess: “Tripe?” The man  gives a noncommittal nod. You give an emphatic one. You’ll have that, too. And strands of dried bean curd, woven with Chinese celery — you can tell what that is. And something that looks like hunks of pork belly with scallions and peanut shavings. You point in its direction. You choose about six dishes, all cold or at room temperature, then go to your table, where they soon appear. The adventure is under way. Spicy & Tasty takes you to places that less bold Sichuan restaurants don’t, and by that I’m not referring to its location in a cluster of Asian restaurants in Flushing, Queens, that too few diners from other neighborhoods visit. I’m referring to the numbing sensation of the Sichuan peppercorns more prevalent in its food than in the food at supposedly like-minded establishments that hold their fire, deferring to many Westerners’ palates. I’m referring to the lustrous sheen of the red chili oil or sesame oil that liberally coats the surfaces of many dishes or pools at the bottoms of them, setting off alarm bells in delicate diners. And, yes, to the tendon, tripe and kidney in some dishes on the epic menu. That menu goes far beyond the display case, encompassing more than 100 dishes. It easily accommodates people looking for something familiar, such as beef with broccoli and chicken with cashews. There’s also “sesame cold noodle,” listed like that, with the telling omission of the word paste. When you order it at Spicy & Tasty, it doesn’t come covered with peanut butter. It comes with sesame oil and the blooming heat of those peppercorns, used sparingly in this case. It’s a less cloying, more nuanced and infinitely better dish. That’s not news to many of this city’s more intrepid chowhounds, who have had Spicy & Tasty on their radar for a good long while. They visited it in its previous location on Roosevelt Avenue in Flushing, and when it disappeared three years ago they succumbed to understandable panic. It reappeared in short order on Prince Street, bigger and, relatively speaking, spiffier. In the main dining room the tan and black tables gleam and the cream-colored walls, with gold accents, are immaculate. None of this adds up to anything that could be mistaken for atmosphere, especially not with lighting so bright. And the service, while usually efficient, falls well shy of pampering. But Spicy & Tasty is more than comfortable enough to let you appreciate without distraction some of the most distinctive Sichuan cooking in any of the five boroughs. While it doesn’t bother with desserts or have much in the way of alcohol, its pleasure-per-dollar ratio — just try to spend more than $40 a person — compensates for that. And like the Thai standout Sripraphai in Woodside, Queens, it deserves citywide attention from food lovers whose primary interest isn’t simply a modestly priced meal off the beaten path, but a hugely enjoyable, eye-opening experience. A tongue-tingling one, too. Sichuan cuisine is known for “ma la,” which refers to the combined effects of those peppercorns — actually dried berries from prickly ash trees — and chili peppers. The peppercorns have a camphorlike quality, acting as a mild anesthetic, while the chilies deliver pointed heat. Spicy & Tasty plays lavishly with this fire, which blazed in a riveting dish called shredded lamb in fresh hot pepper. On top of thin slices of lamb and a tangle of herbs and vegetables were swaths of a four-alarm paste made from dried chili flakes. The peppercorns also entered the mix — you could feel them on your lips — and at the bottom of the wide, deep bowl, red chili oil glistened. Whenever you see that oil — and you see it as well under a terrific appetizer of meaty pork dumplings — you should proceed with caution, and maybe with a cold beer at hand, and definitely with a plate of sliced cucumber within reach. The cucumber was one of the options from the display case, and a mouthful of it after a mouthful of a spicy dish was like frigid water on a scalded finger: deliriously sweet relief. But Spicy & Tasty does justice to both sides of the ampersand, providing pleasures away from the heat. The bounciness of the dried bean curd was irresistible, and it exemplified an attentiveness to texture that also distinguished creamy tofu with minced pork and a dish of scallion and egg fried rice whose fluffiness, like its pale green color, was a revelation. The Chinese broccoli, scallions, eggplant and mushrooms scattered throughout dishes had clear, true flavors. Many dishes that depended less on seasoning than on careful cooking — for example, juicy little shrimp framed by a salty black bean paste — were terrific. Of course no menu as long as this one is without many pitfalls. Apart from those shrimp, seafood was disappointing.  And neither ma nor la could redeem the dryness of nuggets of chicken festooned with sesame seeds. That chicken wasn’t the only meat less tender than it could — and should — have been. You have to be willing to take chances, and you have to trust that most of them will pay off. At Spicy & Tasty, you can. Spicy & Tasty ** 39-07 Prince Street, Flushing, Queens; (718) 359-1601.

390,Porter House New York,1 star,"Nov. 22, 2006",Frank Bruni,Upper West Side,Steak Houses,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/22/dining/reviews/22rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/22/dining/reviews/22rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ON our way out of Porter House New York one night, as a friend and I retrieved our coats, a television set above the bar caught our attention. Although plenty expensive, Porter House is populist enough to give customers the chance to keep tabs on sporting events and news, but what we saw on the screen were pictures of meaty chops and starchy sides, arrayed in ways that looked familiar. We remarked on the oddity of the restaurant’s playing what seemed to be a commercial for itself. Then came the tag line: Outback Steakhouse. We’d been wrong, but not by much. Situated in the Time Warner Center, a few floors above the Hugo Boss and Pink stores, Porter House amounts to a generically sophisticated upgrade of the kind of chain establishment found in lesser malls. It’s like an M.B.A. program for beef eaters who did undergraduate work at Outback. STK is something else entirely. Like Porter House, it opened in September and it’s big, proving that a city already engorged with steakhouses can stuff in a few more. But while Porter House has a pleasant amber glow, STK is so dark in spots that the candles on tables have to double as flashlights, without which the menu is almost illegible. Servers are almost inaudible, at least on busy nights when the throbbing music is joined by the raised voices of a well-lubricated crowd. Is this a restaurant or a nightclub? In the meatpacking district, where STK fittingly makes its home, that’s often a distinction without much of a difference. STK attempts to do for filets and T-bones what some of the city’s Asian funhouses have done for sushi and spring rolls: turn them into edible accessories for a naughty expedition to the other side of midnight. It’s two kinds of meat market in one. Porter House takes a more earnest approach. It marks the reemergence of Michael Lomonaco, the executive chef at Windows on the World until 9/11, and it inherits the space once inhabited by Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s V Steakhouse. What’s been done to that space is less a makeover than an exorcism. The designer Jeffrey Beers has cast out Mr. Vongerichten’s bordello-chic décor in favor of warm woods, filament bulbs and cozy booths against the windows that face Central Park. While Mr. Vongerichten trotted out steak tartare brulée, Mr. Lomonaco keeps his raw hand-chopped beef torch-free. Of course most of the city’s new steakhouses come with at least some kind of conceit, and Porter House follows suit, making good on its name by presenting what it liberally calls porterhouse cuts of not only beef but also veal, pork, lamb and monkfish, which is served on the bone and wrapped in pancetta. In all of these instances, the kitchen turned out well-sourced, well-prepared flesh, as it also did with a strip and a chili-rubbed rib-eye. They didn’t argue for a special trip to Columbus Circle, but they made a strong bid for the attention of anybody working or playing in the area. With other dishes, Porter House ran into trouble. Rainbow trout, one of more than half a dozen seafood entrees, was overcooked and over-buttery. The wild berry glaze on slices of duck breast was much too sweet. And not many appetizers impressed me. A smoked beef-tongue salad was nervy and flavorful, but I’ve seldom had crab legs as mushy and flat-tasting as the ones here. The lobster in a bisque receded into the background, demonstrating the same timidity as the lobster in an over-dressed salad. Porter House goes proudly retro with desserts, including pineapple upside-down cake and, best of all, apple brown betty. Its wine list has a few nice surprises, like a lagrein from California that the restaurant’s charming sommelier, Beth von Benz, described as “purple-y” in taste. She had that just right. STK’s servers are actually a more impressive lot, in that they manage to remain upbeat and upright while transporting food through a maelstrom of bodies in the front dining area. They’re luckier if they’re working in the slightly calmer, less populous back, where circular white leather booths are set much too slickly into shiny black frames. I’ve never taken a spin inside a pimp’s stretch limo, and now I don’t need to. STK has more than a conceit. It has a signature image, emblazoned on glossy cards, and a motto. The image shows a vixen in a scarlet negligee. In one hand she clutches a hook with a raw chop; in the other, a gleaming cleaver. It’s unclear whether she’s emerged from the boudoir or the abattoir, but her idea of fun obviously involves meat. The motto, “not your daddy’s steakhouse,” underscores an agenda at odds with that image: to feminize a macho tradition. (STK’s idea of a feminist must be Pamela Anderson.) The restaurant lists steaks by size — small, medium and large — to accommodate restrained appetites. Restrained budgets don’t receive as much consideration. Only one of the small steaks, a six-ounce skirt, is under $20. Almost every steak was crowned with half a cherry tomato, which evoked the cherry on a sundae, and some steaks were pretty good. Others strayed far from requested cooking temperatures — just one sign of a kitchen prone to sloppiness. Had the peas in an appetizer of scallops been frozen, and had they not yet fully thawed? Had someone spilled lemon juice over the iceberg with blue cheese, which had an overbearing tartness? There was harmless foolishness (foie gras French toast, anyone?) and there were missed opportunities, like a cold seafood platter on which nothing — not clams, not shrimp — rose above the ordinary. But the restaurant redeemed itself somewhat with a thick-cut, juicy rack of lamb, and the shallots and ginger that snuggled up to duck breast were a shrewd departure from fruity sidekicks. The desserts, in particular an elegant riff on a classic s’more, lifted my spirits. By that point, though, my ears were ringing and my voice was hoarse. STK might want to think about buying some soundproofing, along with a vowel.

391,Picholine,3 star,"Nov. 8, 2006",Frank Bruni,Upper West Side,"French, Mediterranean",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/reviews/08rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/reviews/08rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"WHEN Picholine closed in August for a thorough makeover, it wasn’t a nanosecond too soon. I know. Just days beforehand I took my sister there for her birthday. I’ve been apologizing to her ever since. The food lacked luster. The service lacked smarts. When my sister foolishly asked our waiter how old he thought she was, he even more foolishly took the question seriously, hazarding a guess that was two years too many. What a dolt. And what a drag: the frayed olive and beige dining rooms, the glum diners, the funereal hush. It was Picholine, open since 1993, that wore its age badly. It now looks sleeker, shinier and better, but not much. Was a nearby interior décor store having an end-of-summer sale on the colors purple? Picholine has gone with a cloying monochromatic palette: lavender walls, lavender accents, plum carpeting. It’s the architectural equivalent of a bridesmaid’s dress. But it nonetheless manages to be a winner, arguably the nicest restaurant surprise of this disappointing season, because the biggest changes aren’t ones that meet the eye. The chef and owner, Terrance Brennan, has seized the occasion of a cosmetic overhaul to attend to more important matters. Along with his chef de cuisine, Craig Hopson, he has reinvigorated this restaurant’s soul. Many dishes are new. Most are fantastic. What Picholine lacks in energy and style  — it’s still too quiet and it’s sadistically bright  — it more than makes up for in first-rate ingredients and superior execution. Start with the Roquefort parfait. Decadently creamy and rich, it is skirted with sliced endive and pear and placed over a Sauternes jelly: a commingling of tangy, bitter and sweet notes; a communion of wine and cheese at the start of the meal. Or try Mr. Brennan’s gooey, salty riff on “bacon and eggs.” It’s printed on the menu that way, with quotation marks, the modern-day restaurant’s cheekiness alert. In this case those marks acknowledge  that the role of bacon is being played by smoked tuna belly. The role of a slow-cooked egg is, in fact, played by an egg, and there’s a crucial cameo by Parmesan-inflected polenta. More quotation marks, more whimsy: for chicken “Kiev,” breast meat is molded into a cylinder, cooked sous vide, encrusted with cornflakes, then quickly deep-fried. A server placed it on the table, then produced a silver lance. “For your safety,” he deadpanned, piercing the meat gently, so the liquid foie gras at its center oozed onto the plate instead of squirting into someone’s eye. Despite its seemingly chromosomal stuffiness, Picholine can actually be fun. Max McCalman directs the cheese course with Tony-worthy exuberance, introducing a sprawling international cast and tapping unlikely metaphors to help you decide what to have and have not. “This is the Lauren Bacall of cheeses,” he said of the Beenleigh Blue, an English delicacy made from sheep’s milk. “Circa ‘The Big Sleep’ or ‘The Mirror Has Two Faces’?” we asked, getting into the spirit. He smiled and forged ahead, explaining that the Beenleigh, like the actress, had elegant and edgy dimensions. We didn’t choose it, but we did try the Spanish Monte Enebro after he proclaimed it his favorite goat cheese in the world. No wonder. Its tart finish went on and on. The exceptional cheeses at Picholine are to be expected. Mr. Brennan, who also owns the restaurant Artisanal and a cheese wholesale and education center, is a veritable cheese evangelist. But at least in autumn and much of winter, Picholine has a comparable glory: its game birds. The recent selection included grouse and mallard duck, each with a livery intensity that made a mockery of the farmed squab with which most restaurants content themselves. There were also pheasant, wood pigeon and red-legged partridge, which tasted like impossibly pristine chicken, bathed in a dazzling foie gras and pistachio sauce. American restaurants aren’t permitted to sell wild game shot in this country, but they can import it from Scotland. That’s what Mr. Brennan does, and the menu carries an intriguing caveat: “Birdshot may be present.” “Did you get any?” he asked me on the telephone. I hadn’t. “Too bad,” he said. I’m not sure how to take that. But I’m certain of Picholine’s charms. The cheese and the birds have long been among them, and now they’re not dragged down by a mediocre roster of other dishes. Picholine gets superb lamb from Jamison Farm, and does justice to it by rolling loin meat in dried olives and gorgeously roasting it. For a lesson in balancing flavors and textures, look no further than the sautéed scallops, served with capers, butter, blood orange juice, cauliflower mousseline, slices of caramelized cauliflower and tiny, buttery croutons. The desserts, by the pastry chef, Zachary Miller, compete admirably with Mr. McCalman’s charges for your end-of-meal affections. A sheep’s milk cheese from Portugal or the caramel and apple brioche? All of life’s choices should be so tough. The wine list, like the food, travels around the Mediterranean without ever losing sight of France, and you can receive expert guidance on it. But while service across the board is greatly improved, it could still use more polish, especially at these prices. Four courses at Picholine cost $92, only $3 less than at Jean Georges. Under the restaurant’s newly relaxed rules, you can elect fewer courses or one of more than a dozen small à la carte dishes and cheese plates at the bar. Mr. Brennan is after more spontaneity and youth at Picholine,  which is near Lincoln Center and received three stars in The Times in 1996. The oversize chandeliers and lavender-striped sconces aren’t going to help. The consistently excellent  cooking might. When a late-October milestone of my own approached and I surveyed the restaurants in my sights, I decided to celebrate the occasion with the last in a series of visits to Picholine. What a happy birthday I had. What an impressive turnaround Mr. Brennan has accomplished. Picholine *** 35 West 64th Street, between Broadway and Central Park West; (212) 724-8585.

392,Boqueria,2 star,"Nov. 1, 2006",Frank Bruni,Flatiron,Spanish,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/dining/reviews/01rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/dining/reviews/01rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"BY all rights New York should have more places for tapas than it does. The tapas spirit, or at least versions of it, took root here long ago, spreading wide and far. In many of the city’s Japanese and Italian restaurants and even at a French enclave as punctilious as L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon, you can build meals incrementally, with modestly portioned dishes. You can flit noncommittally through appetizer and side-dish selections more numerous and ambitious than main-course options. The whole concept of grazing? It’s just the tapas spirit wrapped in a gerund with reassuring connotations of restraint. But blistered Padrón peppers haven’t achieved the profile that edamame has. Prosciutto crowds jamón serrano off the stage. And Spain, the realm of true tapas, doesn’t enjoy the top billing that other culinary wonderlands do. In New York it’s easier to make like you’re having tapas than to actually have them. The happy, peppy new Spanish restaurant Boqueria, named for the food market in Barcelona, is doing what it can to change that. It devotes about two-thirds of its menu to tapas, most of which cost $6, and to what it calls “media raciones,” or half portions that are slightly bigger and, at $11 each, relatively inexpensive. In other ways as well Boqueria sends the message that you needn’t commit to a conventional meal, that an early evening or late-night snack — which is what tapas are really about — provides ample reason to drop in. The restaurant’s no-reservations policy is in part a call to spontaneity, a rejection of ceremony. So is its clever seating arrangement. At Boqueria, every perch is a high chair, and no matter where you sit — at one of the small cafe tables in the front, at the large communal table in the back or on banquettes that trace the restaurant’s perimeter — your feet are many inches above the ground, as if you were on a stool at a bar. This has a practical benefit, along with a theoretical one. It puts you at eye level with servers, making your interactions with them feel smoother and friendlier. And it means that if Manhattan somehow flooded, you could dine at Boqueria and keep your shoes dry. You could also eat extremely well. Although an early visit left me with doubts, this restaurant has improved steadily and markedly since it opened in mid-August. And although its menu still harbors a few disappointments, they’re eclipsed by plenty of standouts and by a charismatically bustling, remarkably warm scene. Glossier than Tía Pol, cozier than Barça 18, Boqueria manages to have the virtues of stylishness without the vanity, luring relatively young, good-looking diners who turn out for the eating more than the posing. During a recent visit, one of the specials was a terrific dish of sardines two ways — either oil-cured, or stuffed with olives and pine nuts and then fried — on a bed of potatoes and heirloom tomatoes. I saw it being delivered to table after table, even though it wouldn’t seem a born crowd-pleaser. Sardines aren’t for sissies. Neither are anchovies, but they were among the specials as well, fried and smartly paired with fried slivers of candied lemon and, at the base of the dish, a salty tapenade. Usually for better but sometimes for worse, the chef, Seamus Mullen, relishes salty effects: the regularly offered tapas include salt cod fritters and a salt cod brandade, both satisfying, and a media ración presents frisée with salt cod and white anchovies, a dish that teetered into salty excess. He has teamed at Boqueria with Yann de Rochefort, a restaurateur who also owns Suba on the Lower East Side. Neither of them is Spanish, but Mr. Mullen has studied and cooked in Spain. That exposure is reflected in the full justice he does to classics like patatas bravas, fried potato wedges bathed in a spicy and smoky red pepper aioli; tortilla Española, a Spanish omelet with potato and onion; and ajo blanco, a chilled almond soup with red grapes and chorizo oil. He paired chorizo and fried quail eggs on little pieces of toast: my kind of finger food. He sprinkled an appropriately generous measure of coarse salt over those Padrón peppers. A dozen or so dishes are labeled tapas. Subsequent menu categories — media raciones, raciones and “para compartir” (“for sharing”) — chart escalating portion sizes while expanding your Spanish vocabulary. It’s in these categories that Mr. Mullen displayed more creativity and came up with some of his biggest successes. Foremost among them was a fantastic salad showcasing baby squid, which he seared quickly on a plancha, giving it external crunch and internal tenderness, then tossed with baby arugula, fried chickpeas (more crunch) and fried breakfast radish (even more). The salad underscored the care he lavishes not only on the cooking of a dish’s central element but also on finding surprising, flavorful ways to round out a composition. A beautifully braised lamb shank was placed over prunes and a celery root purée, with a rosemary-seasoned yogurt on one side, a glittering green basil and tarragon pistou on the other and a dusting of crushed hazelnuts on top. Suckling pig came as a tightly packed rectangle of irresistibly crisp, fatty skin over slick, succulent pork. Three almonds crowned the skin, while sautéed figs lapped at the edges of the meat. Mr. Mullen wisely leavens his salty impulses with sweet ones — remember those candied lemon slivers  — and often achieves a winning balance in the process. Dishes that seem designed for tamer tastes — prime rib for two, shrimp sautéed with garlic in olive oil — were well executed. So were desserts, including crema Catalana and a tower of hazelnut ice cream, chocolate mousse and candied hazelnuts. Paella didn’t work out as well, but then it’s long been the Bermuda Triangle of Spanish restaurants in New York, breached at considerable peril, with likely hazards of overcooked shellfish or clumpy rice. Boqueria’s paella avoided neither. So navigate your way around it. Do what a tapas bar intends you to. Sample some of the Spanish cured meats and cheeses on hand. Have a glass of sangria — there’s a bracingly tart variant made with beer — or one of the many affordable Spanish wines. Let your appetite wander while your feet dangle. That’s the tapas spirit, and at Boqueria it’s found a Spanish home.",Patatas bravas; quail egg and chorizo on toast; squid with fried chickpeas; almond soup; fried anchovies; boar terrine; lamb shank; suckling pig; hazelnut ice cream with chocolate mousse; crema Catalana.
393,Harry's Cafe and Steak,1 star,"Oct. 25, 2006",Frank Bruni,Financial District,Steak Houses,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/dining/reviews/25rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/25/dining/reviews/25rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THESE are good times for cardiologists, bad times for cattle. The steakhouse reigns anew, in fashionable neighborhoods and frumpier ones, as if Mayor Bloomberg had updated the call for a chicken in every pot by decreeing a porterhouse on every block. Everywhere’s the beef, meaning these are fraught times for devoted carnivores. They can easily miss a charmer like Harry’s Steak and the charms of its bone-on strip. I nearly did. I was distracted — by Quality Meats and a second branch of Wolfgang’s Steakhouse, by Staghorn Steakhouse and of course Craftsteak. All trotted out their rib-eyes around the time Harry’s opened in mid-May. Even though Harry’s was the progeny and echo of a once-proud institution near Wall Street, it got lost in the crowd. But a friend had a friend who had raved about Harry’s, and I read somewhere that part of the dining room was in a sunken nook carved from a wine cellar. So I went. And fate was with me, because my three companions and I ended up at the lone table in that nook. We weren’t seated there at first, but a little groveling goes a long way. We quickly noticed that Harry’s was trying and succeeding, with crucial bits of courtesy and innovation, to stand out from the pack. A cold shellfish platter arrived, and each of us got, in addition to sweet crab and supple shrimp, his or her own set of three dishes with the three condiments: a cocktail sauce, a mignonette and an Old Bay mayonnaise. There was no passing, reaching or awkward dribbling. What was presented as an appetizer of house-made Canadian bacon was actually a small chop that had been brined, smoked and sliced with the bone still attached: an inspired departure. A much larger pork chop entree, grilled over hickory chips, rose from a bed of unconventional sauerkraut laced with poppy seeds and pineapple. Beside the chop was a Mason jar with applesauce, but not just any old applesauce. Serrano pepper gave it glimmers of heat. Flourishes like these weren’t what distinguished the bone-on strip, which we also had that night. It spoke to the timeless glories of aged prime beef, a sensible marinade (oil, garlic, paprika) and a high-temperature broiler, agent of a crucial char. Thick and juicy, the strip was the best of the steaks at Harry’s, though the porterhouse for two had absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. But there’s trouble with Harry’s, and it’s the trouble with many newfangled steakhouses.  Their sponsors aren’t  content to do a limited lineup of expected dishes well, to apply clever tweaks to enduring traditions. Although they want the security and roomy profit margins of the steakhouse formula, they don’t want the constraints, so they simultaneously buy into and buck it, winding up with restaurants that overreach or seem muddled. Conjoined with Harry’s Steak is Harry’s Cafe, a different facet of the same restaurant, served by the same kitchen. And in Harry’s Cafe the menu metastasizes in ways that often turn out to be ill-advised. There was a shrimp bisque thin enough to be rechristened a consommé, an unwieldy Kobe-style beef hot dog with no more appeal than a ballpark frank, and a “crackling pork shank” that wore its cloak of fried skin and fat like a straitjacket. The spark of old-timers like Sparks, Peter Luger and the Palm is  the trust they place in established lures. Their kind of blunt call to beefy overindulgence is muffled at Harry’s, even in the steakhouse wing of the restaurant, where the digressions are fewer than in the cafe but  also indicative of a counterproductive ambition. Salmon was served with a precious, cloying blood orange glaze. A pasty sauce of cashews, butter and chicken stock smothered grilled swordfish, which would have been better left to sink or swim on its own. Harry’s Steak consists of about 65 seats spread throughout a narrow barroom with stone walls, a dining room with goofy murals of monks making wine, and that sunken, soothing nook. It feels aged, in a good way, and intimate. Harry’s Cafe has more than twice that number of seats in a larger, less distinctive dining room with its own bar area, filled on a recent night with equal numbers of men and women, nearly all of them drinking beer instead of martinis, even though Harry’s makes a mean one with Hendrick’s gin. Times have changed. Both the steakhouse and cafe inhabit what used to be Harry’s at Hanover Square, which for three decades was an archetypal retreat for traders and raiders, who went there to cut their adrenaline and steel their nerves with cigars and magnums of expensive wine. Its owner, Harry Poulakakos, closed it in 2003. His son, Peter, manages this reconfigured version and owns it with several partners. The Poulakakos family has a long history and deep investment in the neighborhood around Hanover Square. In 1998 Peter opened Bayard’s, just above Harry’s at Hanover Square. (It recently scaled back to private parties only.) And over the last few years he and his partners have added a pastry shop, a bar and a pizza place to the neighborhood. They haven’t tapped into a source of reliable help. Service at Harry’s was wildly erratic — better in the steakhouse but flawed even there. A server told us the tart of the day was peach. What came was lemon — and unremarkable,  like  the flourless chocolate cake (will it ever stop?) and cheesecake. The wine list commands serious attention, reflecting a cellar long in the making, and it’s aptly focused on substantial reds. They’re what you want to drink with hefty slabs of meat, which are what you want to eat at Harry’s. You want to start with the bacon, the shellfish platter, roasted clams with a benevolent sprinkling of pancetta, or a triptych of beefsteak tomato preparations involving blue cheese, Vidalia onions and mozzarella. The kitchen is run by Patrick Vaccariello, an alumnus of Maloney & Porcelli and student of David Burke. When he applies Mr. Burke’s ideas or his own creativity to stalwarts like tomatoes or pork chops, he and Harry’s make a strong case for themselves. For terrific double-cut lamb chops, he replaces mint jelly with a lighter, headier mix of orange marmalade, fresh mint, star anise and cilantro. If that  lamb is combined with the strip and savored  under one of those murals, the legions of other steakhouses fade away. There is only Harry’s, and it’s the best of times.

394,Morgan Dining Room,2 star,"Oct. 18, 2006",Julia Moskin,Midtown South,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/18/dining/reviews/18rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/18/dining/reviews/18rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE new dining room at the Morgan Library and Museum is a tutorial in the eternal pleasures of capitalism: marble fireplaces, heavy silver and really rich cream sauces. It’s also one of New York’s more eccentric fine-dining restaurants, and probably the best museum canteen in New York City. This is an increasingly competitive field, now that The Modern has opened in the new Museum of Modern Art  and it is possible to get a surprisingly good panino in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. But there’s no institution that joins a menu and a museum as seamlessly. The food served in the dining room that the Morgan family used in the early 20th century is brightly flavored enough to please modern palates but also, with touches like chicken fricassee, lobster salad and shrimp cocktail, telegraphs old-school opulence. This new-old luxury mirrors what has been done to transform the museum itself, which reopened in April after a renovation that joined the Gilded-Age sprawl of J. Pierpont Morgan’s original brownstone mansion to a glass center tower designed by the Italian modernist Renzo Piano. When going to the Dining Room, you bypass the museum’s entrance fee but still get to bask in the sunlight streaming in through its 50-foot walls of glass, and inhale the heady scent of expensive new architecture. (To see J.P. Morgan’s ornate library or one of the museum’s three Gutenberg Bibles, though, you will have to cough up $12.) The museum’s cafe, open only to museum visitors, squats on the floor of the central atrium and serves a more generic menu. The formal dining room is open only when the museum is open, so lunch is served every day, but dinner only on Friday nights — and then only until 9 p.m., when warning gongs ring and security guards begin sweeping through to nudge you out. “They do have to protect the Gutenbergs,” said our waiter last Friday night, as he reassured us that there was time for coffee. “They don’t really care about dessert.” For many New Yorkers, its abbreviated business hours will knock the Morgan Dining Room out of the running as a serious restaurant, but it offers compensatory pleasures. The room is not always one of them. It is undeniably cramped, with about 40 seats that occasionally have to squeeze in large parties of Morgan V.I.P.’s — and a bit too bright, with pristine white moldings, track lighting, and one glass wall. All that saves the room from looking like a very elegant operating theater are its modern orange-upholstered loveseats, tall sprays of flowers, and warm wood floors. But you will find many cosseting antique details on the table, from the menu’s typeface to the vial of simple syrup that comes with every glass of iced tea. Several wines are available by the glass or the quartino, a pleasantly indulgent eight-ounce carafe;  nonalcoholic options include a bittersweet mix of tangerine juice and tonic water and a very upscale raspberry lime rickey with only a hint of sweetness. The restaurant’s chewy olive-salt rolls are New York’s most-improved soft pretzel. Also beyond reproach, over the course of six meals, was the restaurant’s green salad. Restaurants  often present this  as a sop to timid diners, and it’s always depressing to see the same mesclun greens you have at home come out of a restaurant kitchen. But here, the chef Charlene Shade  uses organic lettuces — full-grown leaves with fresh flavor, not long-refrigerated micro specimens — and the result is soft and sprightly, the nicest restaurant salad I’ve had in years. A similar attention to detail is evident in most of the kitchen’s vegetables, both in their sourcing and in their cooking.  For example, the firm-tender green squash that sits under a fricassee of chicken; the pungent Swiss chard that tops a savory tart of ricotta cheese and slow-roasted cherry tomatoes; and a charred heart of romaine lettuce, split and seared brown on the cut face, that works well alongside a filet mignon and more of those sweet-sharp cherry tomatoes. Cooked lettuce is one of Ms. Shade’s borrowings from menus of the early 20th century, which come off here as surprising and often tasty innovations. Those of us who spend a lot of time trolling in new restaurants aren’t often served old-fashioned cream sauces like these, one infused with mushroom flavor and drizzled around moist roasted organic chicken, another brightened with lemon and poured over long, floppy twists of pasta. I had almost forgotten how delicious they can be. And more modern dishes, like mussels in a parsley broth, seared striped bass over butternut risotto, and salmon with poached baby vegetables, are just as successful. Dessert is less of a period piece. Ms. Shade, having worked in the kitchens of Jean-Georges Vongerichten, has mastered the technique for his molten chocolate cake, although she doesn’t improve it by adding trimmings like ice cream and blackberries. While I appreciate an organic chicken, I have never before been presented with an organic cookie plate: fortunately, it had other virtues as well, like warm gingersnaps and buttery nut shortbreads. The fruit cobbler, which changes seasonally but is always good, is more of a crisp, with a rumpled, crunchy top. I wanted to love that beef Wellington — with foie gras, mushrooms, puff pastry and beef tenderloin, how bad could it be? But some dishes, like some musicals, should never be revived. This one, in addition to being overcooked the night I tried it, was drowned in a classic brown sauce that suffered from all the classic flaws: too salty, too meaty, just too...brown. Better to go retro with lobster salad, made of unfailingly sweet and moist claw meat and slices of avocado and grapefruit — a dish that  has a whiff of country-club cuisine, but composed here with a play of flavors that keeps it from being just blandly elegant. And a bargain at $21; you no longer have to be a robber baron to eat like one.

395,Felidia,3 star,"Aug. 30, 2006",Frank Bruni,Midtown East,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/30/dining/reviews/30rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/30/dining/reviews/30rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE kitchen had been kind enough to divide the risotto into four portions, and each of us took a bite at pretty much the same time. Then it happened, that characteristic moment of wide-eyed silence, followed by  a telltale overlapping of voices determined to register something much stronger than approval, something closer to awe.  This was the scene and sound of a  clique of food lovers discovering something wonderful. The setting was Felidia, and the risotto had been colored and flavored with red beets. Along with a tableside drizzle of aged balsamic vinegar, they gave the dish a faint sweetness that was the first sensation out of the gate. That sweetness was quickly joined and tempered by Humboldt Fog goat cheese, at once sharp and round, with an effect that lingered. The acidity of the vinegar held any richness in check, everything in balance and my companions and me in thrall. A risotto like this could put pasta out of business. It could keep Felidia going strong for another quarter century. Felidia turned 25  this year, and its matriarch, Lidia Bastianich, has gone on since its opening to achieve  celebrity independent of it. With her television shows, books and supermarket sauces, she has earned admirers far and wide who know little about the restaurant that helped set her on her path. But the splendid dishes that Felidia continues to turn out   — dishes that hit a midpoint between regal and rustic that’s all their own —  suggest that Ms. Bastianich, edging up on her 60th birthday, hasn’t lost sight of her beginnings. So does her frequent presence in the narrow, charming East Side townhouse that the restaurant inhabits. On many nights you can still find her on a stool at the mahogany bar just inside the entrance or at a table in one of the  dining rooms, where deep yellow walls and glass sconces the color of midseason tomatoes emit a warmth in sync with the kitchen’s  full-bodied dishes. Felidia hasn’t changed all that much since it was last reviewed in The Times in 1995, when Ruth Reichl gave it three stars. That’s a good thing. Its food, rooted in Istria, a region once in  northeastern Italy and now mostly  in Croatia, remains big  — even heavy — and surprisingly distinctive in a city infatuated with, and just about saturated by, various kinds of Italian cuisine. In terms of main courses, Felidia excels at game, like a terrific quail saltimbocca  and a pan-roasted venison loin with a horseradish-mustard sauce that speaks to this restaurant’s particular geographic orientation. It also emphasizes organ meat, like braised tripe and a seared calf’s liver, served  with polenta, that no liver lover should miss. There’s plenty of seafood as well, but with the notable exception of a starter of sautéed rock shrimp in a creamy lemon and garlic sauce, it’s not Felidia’s strength. While grilled branzino, finished tableside with a gloss of olive oil, had a clean, clear taste, it mostly seemed like a sop to   health-conscious or timid eaters. A poached fillet of striped bass couldn’t quite stand up to the mushroom and tomato broth and celery root purée around it. When it comes to pasta, some of Felidia’s best selections rely on  slow-cooked sauces made with fatty meats. Fusilli lunghi  —  or long fusilli  —  was topped with not only succulent strands of pork rib but also meatballs of pork, beef and lamb. A dish of spaghettini thickened with egg yolks didn’t stop the decadence there. Onto this unusually rich pasta went braised, shredded duck. Then again, the lighter pasta dishes  —  light being a relative term in the context of Felidia  — made their own music. Felidia’s signature “wedding pillows,” delicate pockets of pasta filled with orange zest, lemon zest, clove, cinnamon, raisins and three kinds of cheese, didn’t overplay its sweet notes.  And the dish, on the menu for decades now, hasn’t overstayed its welcome. Ms. Bastianich leaves most of the cooking these days to her longtime executive chef, Fortunato Nicotra, but the food itself,  which commands attention without groveling for it, reflects her personality, sensibility and palate. And to return to Felidia is to be reminded of her role in the restaurant Del Posto, which opened late last year and has been framed more often in terms of Mario Batali’s involvement. Ms. Bastianich did more than stand there for hours on end, whisking zabaglione and courting carpal tunnel syndrome. She contributed recipes, ideas and a crucial refinement, evident in some of the roasts, risottos and flourishes. The jalapeño and toasted bread crumbs on a dish of spaghetti and crab? That’s Mario. The spaetzle with an elegantly arranged platter of carved veal shank? That’s Lidia. Del Posto’s bountiful bread service can be traced to Felidia, where every meal begins with a basket of grissini,  focaccia  and peasant bread, along with three chickpea spreads, one flavored with carrot and orange, one with garlic and lemon, and one with a basil pesto. It’s a carbo-phobe’s Waterloo. Del Posto’s final plethora of cookies has its   antecedent in a similar coda at Felidia, where the desserts are an otherwise uneven affair, the joy of a peach-flavored  tiramisù undercut by the joyless pairing of a watermelon sorbet with a chocolate-almond cake. Felidia is uneven in other ways, too.  Humdrum lamb chops didn’t live up to  heavenly beef cheeks. A dull dish of fettuccine with soft-shell crab couldn’t compete with a salty, zesty dish of chitarra with speck and razor clams. And just about nothing matched the risotto. But Felidia’s wine list, brimming with interesting northern Italian selections in the $60 to $90 range, doesn’t permit disappointment. An informed server found my companions and me a robust 1979 nebbiolo for under $100. Just before that, he had guided us to a less expensive white that blended sauvignon blanc, tocai, ribolla and riesling. “It’s a symphony,” he promised, and he was almost correct. “More of a chamber orchestra,” determined a companion, who got it just right. We couldn’t imagine anything more pleasing. On its best nights, Felidia is like that. Felidia *** 243 East 58th Street, Manhattan; (212) 758-1479.

396,Sip Sak,1 star,"Aug. 23, 2006",Frank Bruni,Midtown East,Turkish,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/23/dining/reviews/23rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/23/dining/reviews/23rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE best dish I had at Sip Sak, an artfully constructed lamb gyro platter, isn’t on the menu. Neither are the terrific stuffed meatballs, versions of kibbe with beef, pine nuts and mint. Or the outstanding lamb sausage. Or, for that matter, the Turkish pizza, which is really Syrian pizza, made with a thin, soft crust that’s folded over toppings of minced lamb and tomato, so the end product looks more like an omelet or even a burrito. Why so secretive? Sip Sak’s principal owner and chef, Orhan Yegen, said in a recent telephone conversation that these dishes hinge on fresh ingredients that the kitchen might run out of, or on labor-intensive preparations that can’t always be sustained during busy periods. Since he can’t promise them, he said, he doesn’t put them in writing. I wonder. His explanation doesn’t cover the sausage, made in advance. It doesn’t address why servers don’t bother to mention these dishes, even when they’re available, unless asked about them directly. No, I think Mr. Yegen likes to be difficult. He’s one of the New York restaurant scene’s greatest and most befuddling characters, and Sip Sak mirrors his personality. It’s a kooky artist’s warped — and sometimes wonderful — canvas. Never heard of him? I’ll bet you’ve heard of at least one of his restaurants, because he’s caromed through an insane number, seldom staying long. He helped start Turkish Kitchen back in the early 1990’s. He went on to cook at Efendi, Beyoglu, Deniz, Dervish and Divane, among other restaurants, some long gone. At some of these places, he would immodestly prime diners for rapture, telling them that they were receiving their first true glimpse of Turkish cooking. (He was born and reared in Turkey.) He’s nothing if not grandiloquent, though age has mellowed him. Now 50, he has moments when his voice is inflected with something that sounds suspiciously like self-effacement. “I used to say I’m the best food you can eat,” he told me. “These days I can’t say that. I’m not able to catch every mistake anymore.” Sip Sak opened in 2004 but didn’t take on the contours of a conventional full-service restaurant until this year, when Mr. Yegen erected a bar just inside the entrance, where several cases for prepared food had been. The restaurant’s name, which means fast or instant in Turkish, is pronounced “ship shock.” Past the bar is a deep, unadorned dining room with sunshine-colored walls. And in that dining room, during a typical lunch or dinner, is a crowd that speaks to why this city maintains such a splendid array of restaurants. These people, it seems, don’t come to Sip Sak out of ethnic allegiance: few of them look Turkish. They don’t come for an electric scene, which doesn’t exist, or the wine list, which is meager. But they know special food at special prices when they taste it, and they reward its providers. The most expensive dish on Sip Sak’s menu is $17.50. As you would expect, lamb, eggplant and yogurt reign supreme, but they don’t always assume predictable forms. The lamb gyro platter, called iskander, had at its base a  layer of sautéed cubes of pita bread, crunchy outside and spongy within. They swam in garlicky yogurt and tomato sauces. On top went the gyro meat: thin, fatty shavings with real lamb flavor and crisp edges. Mr. Yegen’s yogurt sauces were lighter, more garlicky and less tart than the ones you find elsewhere, and that’s one reason a dish of handmade manti, a sort of Turkish tortellini, was so sublime. But the dumplings themselves made an important contribution. They were delicate and so tiny that the ground beef in their centers came as a surprise. I’m convinced that Mr. Yegen performs some incantation as he whisks eggplant, olive oil, garlic and lemon into a silky spread that he calls eggplant salad, because while none of the ingredients are unusual, they attained an astonishing richness and smokiness. That spread was served with triangular wedges of a bread that was like crunchier, fluffier focaccia. It put the usual pita to shame, and it stood ready to convey the restaurant’s excellent tarama, made with cod roe, and its hummus as well. Between Sip Sak’s peaks lie many valleys. Lamb kebabs were gorgeous on one visit but grainy on another. Patties of ground chicken with red peppers were moist, but a dish of chicken kebabs was arid. Cubes of baked lamb over an eggplant purée were overcooked, as was a whole branzino. Stumble across enough of this low ground and you’re not so willing to overlook the unimpressive desserts, the unfilled water glasses and the fact that you’re so much better off if you happen to know about the unadvertised dishes before you show up. A friend had clued my companions and me in, and Mr. Yegen, his graying ponytail hanging low, stopped by to congratulate us on our savvy. He said he wasn’t really interested in less committed eaters. “It’s why I never advertise,” he said. “I don’t want all kinds of diners. I want one kind of diner.” That’s a strange business plan. But if you get to know Mr. Yegen just a little, it’s not a surprising one. SIP SAK * 928 Second Avenue (49th Street), East Side; (212) 583-1900.

397,The Mercer Kitchen,0.75 star,"Aug. 16, 2006",Frank Bruni,SoHo,"American, French, New American, Southeast Asian",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/16/dining/reviews/16rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/16/dining/reviews/16rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"AS gracefully as any of his peers, Jean-Georges Vongerichten shows that today’s globe-trotting, genre-straddling, hyperextended superchef can still create memorable  — even riveting — meals. You need only visit the restaurants Perry St. and Jean Georges to believe. But can a chef stamp his name as wide and far as  Mr. Vongerichten has and still make magic at the older as well as the newer establishments, at the fringe players as well as the flagship? You need only visit Mercer Kitchen and Vong to doubt. Start with Mercer Kitchen. Go on a Sunday night. The restaurant is almost empty, but that doesn’t mean any extra care from the staff. A svelte hostess bestows a perfunctory greeting, as if irked at being roused from her photogenic torpor by something as humdrum as the arrival of guests. A bartender watches you close out your tab in preparation for dinner, then lets you sit there for five minutes before telling you that he won’t be letting the hostess know you’re ready and that she probably won’t check back. It’s up to you to make it all happen. So you do. And you order. And the food appears quickly: a mixed blessing if ever there were one. Your pea soup doubles as a salt quarry. Your hamachi sashimi comes with two incongruously gargantuan bread sticks, which Babe Ruth could have used to hit homers. The mussels in your seafood platter don’t taste right. A pork chop with a hot-cool chili glaze requires the incisors of a jungle cat. You’re mystified, so you go back a few times. And sure enough, there are scattered pleasures, though the distracted service is never one of them. The toppings on the brick-oven pizzas — raw tuna and wasabi; pear and pistachio; black truffle and Fontina — are bold and flavorful. A salad showcasing steamed shrimp and avocado realizes its timid ambitions. The same goes for roasted chicken, the meat of which is tender, the skin crisp. But the skin on roasted duck is floppy, slippery and the saltiest thing you’ve tasted since a certain pea soup. A soft-shell crab has supposedly been dipped in tempura batter and deep-fried, but there’s no vestige of either activity in the cold, spongy wreck before you. Come dessert, you almost chip your tooth on one of the hard, frozen strawberries in a deconstructed ice cream sandwich. Mercer Kitchen opened in 1998, and one of its attractions then is an attraction now: an underground space that looks like an improbably sexy rathskeller. Its darkness blurs flaws, making the food, like the diners, seem more appetizing. But the reviews from eight years ago (Ruth Reichl awarded it two stars) suggest that the kitchen once operated more reliably. They also describe a menu seemingly more creative than the current one, which is an ethnically indistinct assortment of dishes with enough pro forma salads and sides to make you question the point of Mr. Vongerichten’s involvement, beyond the cachet it lends the restaurant and the money it presumably brings him. Mercer Kitchen doesn’t represent much of a showcase for him or his chef de cuisine, Christopher Beischer. Its true calling becomes clear on a crowded Friday night, when the tables turn quickly, tweaked martinis line the bar and clay pots of crunchy French fries (excellent, as it happens) sprout from every third table. This is the SoHo version of an Applebee’s. While Mercer Kitchen feels like a cynical enterprise, the Thai-French trailblazer Vong merely feels like a tired one. It’s been around since 1992, when oversized palm fronds still counted as theatrical Asian décor, the pairing of sautéed foie gras with mango was considered novel, and the galangal in a chicken and coconut milk soup seemed exotic. Bryan Miller gave it three stars back then. More than a decade  later, the virtue of Vong’s décor is its calmness in comparison to such like-spirited successors as Kittichai and Mr. Vongerichten’s own Spice Market. That foie gras and that soup lack a sense of surprise that, it turns out, were integral to the intensity of their appeal. Like the majority of the dishes at Vong, they’re entirely pleasant but not remotely compelling. At least Vong, unlike Mercer Kitchen, sharply reflects aspects of Mr. Vongerichten’s culinary personality — for example, the obsessive, measured integration of sweet and sour, fiery and lulling. You see it in a few welcome newcomers to the menu, like an appetizer with alternating slices of king oyster mushroom and avocado. They’re heated by Thai green chili and jalapeño oil, which gather force slowly in your mouth, and cooled by mint. There’s more chili — along with mango, Asian pear, tomato, cilantro and Thai basil — in a kaleidoscopic appetizer that spotlights pale red cubes of Tasmanian sea trout. The dish has an opulent texture, thanks to not only the fish but also lime-infused tapioca and a coconut gelée. Vong’s desserts remain impressive, and its servers exude an upbeat spirit you wouldn’t expect from people trussed in silly white jackets with shiny gold buttons. But you keep wondering if the food they deliver is really as it should be and all that it could be, if the restaurant is receiving Mr. Vongerichten’s most considered judgments and the most dedicated efforts of the chef de cuisine, Pierre Schutz, who’s been around since the beginning. Should the black pepper and soy paste on grilled sirloin be quite this thick and sweet? Should black sea bass with coconut juice and parsnip purée be quite this vapid? Shouldn’t the flavor of lobster be more present amid the curry paste, carrots and apple enveloping it? And shouldn’t Mr. Vongerichten be called on this? His reputation is attached as firmly to Vong and to Mercer Kitchen as to restaurants that undoubtedly absorb more of his worry. It’s the same lure, but it’s no guarantee. It’s no guarantee at all.

398,Chinatown Brasserie,1 star,"Aug. 9, 2006",Frank Bruni,NoHo,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/dining/reviews/09rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/dining/reviews/09rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"DIM sum speaks to the cad in each of us. It frees us from culinary monogamy, permitting us to wander from a crescent of pork to a bauble of shrimp, to have a spongy affair and then a crunchy dalliance. We get to slurp around. We can indulge two desires at once: to graze and to explore foreign territory, in this case Chinese. We can congratulate ourselves on the little portions, at least until we’re a half-hour into a gathering feast. Then we can congratulate ourselves instead on the amount of territory we’ve covered. And we can have dumplings. What’s better than dumplings? What’s better than biting into something doughy to discover something meaty, or crashing through a bouncy casing and reaching a soft — maybe even juicy — core? Not a whole lot, especially not if those casings are as thin and pliant as they are at Chinatown Brasserie and those cores taste as clean and carefully put together as they do here. Chinatown Brasserie, which opened about two months ago in the NoHo space that used to be Time Cafe, joins an increasingly populous contingent of restaurants that attempt to apply a sexy gloss to Chinese food (both the real thing and its American mutations) and try to restyle takeout favorites with better ingredients. Think of Mr. Chow Tribeca, if you can bear the thought, or Buddakan, if you can bear the meatpacking district. Then think again, because Chinatown Brasserie finds ways to distinguish itself, the most notable of which also happens to be this uneven restaurant’s principal strength: dim sum. There are about 20 dim sum selections at dinnertime and as many at lunchtime, when they’re slightly different. At lunchtime, for example, you can get fish skin dumplings, which you should absolutely get. And after you get them, you should get some more. They’re pan-fried and slightly crunchy, and there’s something light and crisp about whatever exactly that fish skin is — I don’t want to think too much about it. With dining as with so much else, knowledge is not always pleasure’s friend. Chinatown Brasserie takes dim sum seriously enough that it has a separate chef, Joe Ng, devoted to it. His thoughtful, prolific output includes not only soup dumplings but also steamed dumplings filled with shrimp and snow pea leaf. It includes not only pork pot stickers but also green chili peppers stuffed with shrimp and encased in tempura batter. Some of the dumplings come with external pinpricks of color or strands of herbs that make them look like adorable critters. A crunchy vessel of frog leg meat comes with a leg bone sticking out of it for use as a handle. Mr. Ng is having fun. You probably will, too. With this part of the menu, that is. With the rest of it, supervised by the executive chef, Tyson Wong Ophaso, Chinatown Brasserie was a mix of wins, losses and draws, and the outright wins, unfortunately, were rarest. Across many menu categories — wraps, rolls, salads, barbecue dishes, entrees, noodles, fried rice — the kitchen turned out food that was usually less gloppy than typical takeout fare, but not always more pleasurable. In dish after dish it demonstrated a sure hand with vegetables, be they broccoli, asparagus, snow peas or string beans. All were vibrant, none were overcooked, and the string beans, by the way, appear with minced pork in a side that’s worth ordering. But the kitchen had trouble with meat and seafood. Crispy orange beef was stringy. The roast pork that kept company with scallops in a listless oyster sauce was even tougher. The latter dish, like several others, cried out for salt, and the scallops had little flavor. The same went for sautéed shrimp, which at least had the textural thrill of gossamer ribbons of egg white all around them. The crackling skin on both Peking duck and crispy chicken was close to flawless, but what lay beneath it was far from moist. In an example of the kind of flourish this restaurant brings to an otherwise unglamorous mainstay, it served that chicken with four tiny bowls containing four condiments: a mix of salt, pepper and cinnamon; a scallion purée; chopped ginger; and a soybean paste with hoisin sauce. The restaurateurs behind Chinatown Brasserie are Josh Pickard and John McDonald, who created Lever House and Lure Fishbar, and while the name they chose for it involves some misdirection, geographic and otherwise, it neatly distills their apparent intentions. They want to fuse recognizable versions of Chinese favorites with a recognizably hip stage that is not — with the exception of a downstairs lounge with a koi pond — too tricked out. The egg roll meets the Odeon. While a profusion of low-hanging tasseled silk lanterns lends some Asian theater to the enterprise, the black and red leather used for the seats and the way the long bar opens to the rest of a single big room evoke a brasserie. This one has a respectable, user-friendly wine list that laudably notes which chardonnays are aged in stainless steel. It has specialty cocktails much better than the usual martini manqué, including a frozen spin on a mai tai, but it has run-of-the-mill, ecumenical desserts. A pleasant but slightly chewy platter of General Tso’s chicken held the place of honor usually accorded steak frites. Less predictable dishes — like steamed red snapper, simple and impeccable; and a gooey lunchtime omelet made in a wok — made much stronger impressions. And dim sum saved the day, or the night, depending. Not all the dim sum was created equal. I could have skipped the frog drumstick, but I wouldn’t have wanted to miss the steamed dumpling with four kinds of mushrooms and sweet corn. I savored it, then quickly moved on to a turnip cake. Neither was asking for a commitment. CHINATOWN BRASSERIE * 380 Lafayette Street (Great Jones Street), NoHo; (212) 533-7000.

399,The Little Owl,2 star,"July 26, 2006",Frank Bruni,West Village,"Mediterranean, New American, Seafood",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/dining/reviews/26rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/dining/reviews/26rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ONE of the reassuring wonders of the New York dining scene is the speed with which word about some unassuming new restaurants gets out. Take the Little Owl, which opened in late May with little fanfare, a little menu and little space: 30 seats, including the four barstools. By Week 3, it was full. By Week 6, people stood behind the barstools and just inside the door. And by Week 8, when I arrived after 9 p.m. to meet a friend for dinner, there were so many supplicants at the gates that the co-owner and manager, Gabriel Stulman, had created an impromptu sidewalk cafe for the overflow, serving people wine and complimentary canapés out there. “It’s the Little Owl way,” he said as he tended to all of us. “We’re just trying to put the love back in dining.” Hokey? No doubt. But when Mr. Stulman says things like that — and he says things like that with disarming frequency — he does so in a slightly mischievous voice, acknowledging the hyperbole and turning it into a kind of joke. More important, he backs up his bromides, his enthusiasm speaking as loudly as his words. Every time I left the Little Owl, having watched servers’ sunny demeanors become diners’ bright smiles, I thought, “What a nice place.” Every time friends who had been there talked to me about it, they said, “What a nice place.” It has an irresistible earnestness and exuberance that explain its instant, well-deserved popularity. The earnestness links the front of the house with the kitchen, which turns out food without much pretension. The star of the menu, a dish that seemingly every third diner orders, is the grilled pork chop, which is no more — or less — than a glorious hunk of flesh. Perhaps its most serious competition for affection are the “meatball sliders,” made with beef, veal and pork on tiny, bouncy garlic rolls. Forget the overcute overuse of the term sliders in New York restaurants these days and just concentrate on the pleasure of these miniature sandwiches, arrayed in a row of four that officially constitutes an appetizer but also works as a side. They were moist and meaty, with a pivotal kick from pecorino in the mix. Pork pops up repeatedly, not just in the centers of dishes but also on the peripheries. It pops up when it’s essential and even when it’s not, which makes its popping-up no less appreciated. There’s crunchy pancetta atop a very fine grilled strip steak. A side of butter beans is flavored with smoked ham hocks. First-rate housemade cavatelli wrap around a tomato sauce, fava beans, ricotta and, yes, bacon. The person calling these porky shots is Joey Campanaro, who worked as the executive chef at two Jimmy Bradley-Danny Abrams restaurants, the Harrison and then Pace. At the Little Owl, which he owns with Mr. Stulman, he embraces and repudiates his past. This restaurant is in some senses a shrunken version of the Harrison and the original Bradley-Abrams hit, the Red Cat. The cooking has a similarly straightforward, full-flavored style. But the Little Owl is the opposite of Pace, which closed last year. At Pace the menu reached in so many trendy directions that the kitchen couldn’t do justice to everything and the ratio of hits to misses wasn’t impressive. The Little Owl manages a much, much better one. Mr. Campanaro has pared down his menu to what he obviously feels complete confidence in preparing: about nine appetizers, including that cavatelli and a wedge of seared hamachi with an uncommonly nuanced coleslaw; seven entrees, including the steak and a “crispy chicken” that lived up to its billing; and a handful of sides. That conciseness didn’t ward off disappointments, like a starter of slightly gluey, mostly bland spinach and lobster risotto beneath grilled scallops. It didn’t prevent the appearance of a timid salad of bibb lettuce, hearts of palm and fennel. But the bolder, wiser successes came one after another, starting with that superthick pork chop, skirted by an ideally measured strip of fat; seasoned alliteratively with cayenne, curry, coriander and cumin, and cooked medium-rare. I had it twice, and twice marveled at its juiciness, so often absent from such an oversize pork chop. If I could have justified a third evaluation (consistency must be monitored!), I would have. But even a critic’s rationalizations have their bounds. So I stopped as well at two inspections of the Chatham cod, the next-best entree. Before broiling it, Mr. Campanaro coated it with a pesto aioli, which was transformed into a rich, salty second skin. He then lay the fish atop a big, colorful bed of roasted corn, English peas and red onion — typical of the bountiful way he constructs and rounds out plates. The cod’s flesh was beautifully cooked, as was a fillet of roasted halibut, which rested on a cushion of mashed potatoes. In dish after dish the kitchen demonstrated remarkable care. The Little Owl’s reach is modest and its limitations real. Its wine list isn’t hugely exciting, although there are interesting selections in a considerate assortment of half bottles. Only one dessert — an oversize brownie with a praline coffee sauce — rocked my world. And apart from blueberry pancakes made with cornmeal and served with mascarpone in place of butter, brunch was merely pleasant. Because of its size, the restaurant has little wiggle room if diners linger. My companions and I had to wait a half-hour past the time of our reservation one night. But there’s more space between tables than at Prune or the Spotted Pig, two downtown restaurants that the Little Owl brings to mind. While it shares their homey emphasis and hip clientele, its extra inches make it crucially more comfortable. It’s also prettier, with a gorgeous pressed-tin ceiling and two walls of enormous paned windows that take in an archetypal West Village street corner. I don’t know if it puts the love back in dining. But it puts the focus of dining where it belongs — on real hospitality and disciplined cooking — and it’s a welcome antidote to so much of the razzmatazz around town.

400,Mr. Chow Tribeca,0.75 star,"June 28, 2006",Frank Bruni,TriBeCa,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/28/dining/reviews/28rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/28/dining/reviews/28rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IT'S easy to see the bad in things and harder to see the good. Take Mr. Chow Tribeca. There are sane, prudent, well-intentioned people who will tell you why you should avoid this new outpost of a nutty empire, and they'll be indisputably correct. But with a slight adjustment of perspective, a certain generosity of spirit and a bit of willed enthusiasm, many reasons for embracing it can be found. Reason No. 1: You can participate in a strand of social history and mull over the eccentric genius of Michael Chow. Almost four decades ago Mr. Chow, who fled Mao Zedong's China for England, had an inspiration. Why not take Chinese food, at that point still somewhat exotic in the West, and swathe it in exaggerated elegance? Tether it to exorbitant prices? Make it fabulous, simply by declaring it to be? First came a Mr. Chow in London, then a Mr. Chow in Los Angeles, and then, in 1979, a Mr. Chow in New York, on East 57th Street. Like its forebears it proved that you didn't need great cooking to attract boldface names; you just needed other boldface names. And Mr. Chow, the Amy Sacco of an earlier era, got them in the door, mining contacts in the overlapping worlds of art, fashion and all-purpose elitism. Regulars included Andy Warhol, who, Mr. Chow has said, didn't so much eat his food as play with it. An understandable decision. Mr. Chow Tribeca stays true to the template. There are white tablecloths; waiters in white or black jackets and bow ties; a gleaming black bar in front; gleaming white lighting fixtures hanging from the ceiling. The restaurant looks and feels like a slick parody of a suave Italian restaurant, like an oxymoronic experiment in haute kitsch. Reason No. 2: Once you've visited Mr. Chow Tribeca, you will appreciate your favorite neighborhood Chinese takeout place like never before. The menu at Mr. Chow, which supposedly fuses various Chinese regional traditions, advertises many familiar dishes: scallion pancakes, shark's fin soup, pot stickers, crispy beef, beef with oyster sauce, sweet-and-sour pork. What's unfamiliar is how much they cost. For that pork, you pay $29. For crab meat soup, $13. Were there discernible crab in it, you'd understand. But there wasn't, so my companions and I didn't. There are also less ubiquitous dishes, along with dishes that — as servers announce with inexplicable fanfare — are making their Mr. Chow debuts. One is ""fiery buffalo,"" which wasn't fiery or, for that matter, particularly hot. Was it buffalo? The cubes of bland flesh could have come from any number of beasts or birds. And for $31.50, there weren't many cubes. If I'm going to get a main course this mediocre, I'd at least like more of it. Most of the food was precisely that — mediocre, not bad — and some of it was quite good. Peking duck had dazzlingly crisp skin and an appealing measure of fat. Sliced pork with chili peppers had an appealing measure of heat. Fried rice was never oily or clumpy. But almost none of the dishes improved significantly on cheaper analogues around town, and a few were unforgivable. Asked to steer us toward the best lamb dish, a server chose a minimally spiced shank. If I learned that it had been plucked from a freezer after the better part of a decade and then nuked in a microwave for the better part of a day, I'd be shocked. It didn't taste nearly that tender or flavorful. Reason No. 3: You will encounter a kind of service so aggressive at certain times and incoherent at others that it becomes a divine comedy. At the start of each meal, servers push expensive Champagne. (""For a toast! How about a toast? Don't you want to make a toast?"") They do it even if you have a full martini in front of you. Even if you have already said no. During two visits servers pitched desserts in the middle of a meal, not realizing that our table was empty because we were between appetizers and entrees. And they weren't daunted by not having much to pitch: some ice cream, some fruit, maybe two tarts, unless they run out of one. Of course they ran out of one — at about 9 p.m. on a night that wasn't busy. On a slightly busier night, it took repeated pleas and 25 minutes to get a check. Once we were done with spending, our servers were done with us. Reason No. 4: You can get excited about spotting a celebrity, though you may not actually lay eyes on one. You know that the possibility exists, because Mr. Chow is the kind of restaurant whose opening is noted in Us magazine, not Saveur. But celebrities are like the best animals at the zoo: theoretically present in the designated exhibit but always obscured by a bush or boulder just when you're looking. I arrived at Mr. Chow late one Friday night to be told by a waiting companion that I had just missed Tobey Maguire. Had my companion seen him? Well, he said, sort of, but. ... Reason No. 5: You may indeed lay eyes on Mr. Chow. On a Sunday night I watched him bop from table to table, peering through those owlish glasses. Like Sir Elton and Dame Edna, he gets a lot of iconic mileage out of eyewear. His is made for him by Cutler & Gross in London. His prescription adjusts problems with near and far sight. I learned this because I called his Los Angeles offices for information about the restaurant and he insisted on getting on the phone. We had to talk about something. Food seemed beside the point. But vision, well, that made sense. Mr. Chow, now 67, foresaw that salt-and-pepper prawns and squid in XO sauce could be vessels for an aura of clubby exclusivity. You just had to season them with enough amusing mannerisms. And regard them with the right kind of attitude. Mr. Chow Tribeca Satisfactory 121 Hudson Street (North Moore Street), TriBeCa; (212) 965-9500.

401,Degustation Wine & Tasting Bar,2 star,"June 21, 2006",Frank Bruni,East Village,"French, Spanish",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/dining/reviews/21rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/dining/reviews/21rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IN its short life under the fidgety rule of Jack Lamb, the space inhabited by the new restaurant Degustation has been repositioned as frequently as a flailing presidential candidate. Little more than a year ago it was Jewel Bako Robata, a Japanese grill named after its nearby sire, Jewel Bako, the sushi sanctuary that put Mr. Lamb and his wife, Grace, on Manhattan's culinary map. That segued quickly into Grace's Kalbi Bar, which pressed the same oversize sushi-bar configuration — 16 seats at a U-shaped counter around an open kitchen — into the service of Korean fare. The poll numbers didn't really improve, so a new message was in order. Goodbye, Asia. Hello, Europe. Degustation takes its cues from Spanish cooking as much as anything else, applying new-wave flourishes and a progressive sensibility to a menu of modestly portioned dishes that recall tapas. The quotation marks around the word tortilla in a description of one of those dishes signaled that something sly was afoot: specifically, poached quail eggs and shallot confit inside pockets of thinly sliced potato. Each of these savory bonbons was best consumed in one bite, which set off a gooey eruption. A roast beef sandwich defied its prosaic tag to assume poetic form: a round pedestal of toasted rye bread with a gossamer tangle of rare meat and a verdant headdress of parsley, cilantro, chervil and dill. To the side, in a graceful swish, lay a foie gras mayonnaise. Both dishes spoke to the creativity that coursed through the concise lineup of dishes at Degustation, which deserves a longer tenancy than its predecessors managed. That creativity was tempered: the 26-year-old chef, Wesley Genovart, a Spaniard who worked at Perry St., knows how to surprise without shocking and make bold impressions while still making sense. For a surf and turf of a different order, he stuffed a bulbous cylinder of grilled squid with braised short ribs, their lusciousness thrown into relief by their firm, bouncy vessel. A salty pile of lentils studded with chorizo and bits of blood sausage rounded out the plate. A seared pair of plump scallops rode a magical carpet with colorful threads of sweetness (wedges of orange), tartness (grapefruit and lemon) and heat (a jalapeño emulsion). Caramelized wedges of grapefruit were unexpected but prudent companions for seared foie gras, whose richness they eloquently offset. The overall experience is idiosyncratic, requiring several caveats. You should not visit Degustation in a group larger than two, because the side-by-side seating would make conversation awkward. You should not go if you're keen on desserts, because Degustation doesn't excel at them. You can easily spend $40 or more to assemble enough modestly priced dishes — maybe four, maybe even five — to fill you. And if your reserved seat isn't ready, there's nowhere comfortable to wait. But the peculiarities come with payoffs that suit the temperaments of today's food lovers, who are increasingly interested not only in the pleasure of a meal but also in the process behind it — who want to be closer to the culinary sorcery, not to mention the sorcerer. Like the great chef Joël Robuchon's multiplying Atelier restaurants, Degustation puts them there, permitting scrutiny of how and when Mr. Genovart and his assistants employ various parts of the compressed kitchen. A plancha is used for shrimp. A gas grill is used for crispy-skin mackerel, served with a fennel and chorizo purée. (Mr. Genovart is big on emulsions and purées, none of which feel tangential or superfluous.) A sous vide bath is used for halibut, placed over red peppers and chorizo and encircled by parsley and garlic oil. And all the while conventional dining yields to a ceremony more adventurous, in some ways more intimate, and laden with intensely pleasurable moments. It's not right for everyone or every occasion, but a restaurant doesn't have to be. Degustation is connected to Jewel Bako, which doubled in size about a year and a half ago, claiming the property that once separated the two spaces and fortifying the Lambs' East Village empire. (They also own Jack's Luxury Oyster Bar and Jewel Bako Makimono.) But while Degustation is carving a distinctive niche, Jewel Bako belongs to a genre more familiar and competitive now than it was in 2001, when the restaurant opened. The number of restaurants serving topnotch sushi and sashimi with the fruits of distant seas has grown large enough that it's easy to imagine Boeing 727's crammed with flying fish, the bluefin tuna up in first class, the mackerel in business, the sardines in coach. It's no longer easy for any one of these restaurants to stand out. In small ways Jewel Bako does. The breadth of its selection — about three dozen kinds of sushi and sashimi — remains remarkable. It has wisely resisted any temptation to serve overstuffed, kaleidoscopic sushi rolls. And a few pieces of its sushi — pike eel with a dab of pickled plum, chopped jack mackerel with baby ginger, scallions and shiso — are noteworthy. But on recent visits there were too few instances of extreme sushi bliss, even during a $95 omakase menu, even from such usual standouts as o-toro, which had unpleasantly ropy veins, and uni, which was unusually grainy. Among several disappointing appetizers, a wedge of salmon and a scallop were seriously overcooked. The arched, slatted canopies above the tables — they look like the rib cages of prehistoric beasts — are as visually amusing as ever. But those tables are tightly packed, the lighting isn't particularly soothing and service can be sluggish, making the prices, lower than at other serious sushi temples, seem less a bargain than a fair enough deal. Eating next door isn't cheaper. But it's actually more comfortable, and it's definitely more exciting. DEGUSTATION ** 239 East Fifth Street (Second Avenue), East Village; (212) 979-1012.

402,Cafe D'Alsace,2 star,"May 31, 2006",Frank Bruni,Upper East Side,"European, German",https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/31/dining/reviews/31rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/31/dining/reviews/31rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"CLOVE?"" I asked, not quite sure I had heard him correctly. ""Clove,"" he answered without hesitation. ""Huh,"" I said, for two reasons. The first was that I was already hoisting the beer to my lips for another sip, so I had to be quick and economical with my syllables. The second: I was flustered. Try as I might to latch onto them, the promised notes of clove in the brew eluded me. But I had hope. The beer sommelier had also foretold currents of orange, and their presence in this Leffe Blonde from Belgium was incontrovertible. He had talked about the  ""aromatics"" at work, and there was indeed a citrusy, flowery perfume. Could he be wrong about the clove? I concentrated. I searched my palate for what was behind the orange or maybe in front of the orange or possibly on the side of the orange. No clove, at least not for me. But I was having what I suppose I should describe as a heady time rooting around for it. Café d'Alsace, a new brasserie on the Upper East Side, brings the  fetishism and free-association  usually reserved for wine to the exaltation of beer. It has more than 110  kinds. It assigns them bin numbers and groups them under different headings: ""wheat,"" ""bock,"" ""lambic."" It pairs them with  foods. The Leffe Blonde, in fact, was the beer sommelier's tailored recommendation for an appetizer of warm potato salad with Alsatian Muenster cheese. And if that salad had been forgettable, all of the frothy rigmarole surrounding it and the rest of the menu at Café d'Alsace might have come across as an annoying gimmick meant to distract diners from unremarkable food. But it wasn't. The tender cubes of potato and melted cheese formed an ideal partnership, with or without the fervent orange and fugitive clove in the brew beside them. And this terrific dish kept company with many other winners: a goat cheese tart as sumptuous on the inside and flaky on the outside as you could wish it to be; a plump, moist wedge of fresh salmon smoked to order and surrounded by dark lentils. Subtract the obscure ales at Café d'Alsace and you still have a very appealing restaurant, its cooking accomplished (though inconsistent), its energy infectious. Put them back into the equation and you have something special, a solid neighborhood restaurant with a claim to distinction beyond its neighborhood. I don't think any other New York restaurant combines this many Pilseners with food this sturdy. Café d'Alsace won't just be beer today and gone tomorrow. It's the creation of Simon Oren, who knows a thing or two about successful brasseries. Refusing to cede the city to gnocchi and gnudi, Mr. Oren has made a career of colonizing needy neighborhoods with the likes of steak frites and crème brûlee. He brought Gallic pick-me-up's to the theater district (Marseille) and the Upper West Side (Nice Matin). That left the Upper East Side,  where Café d'Alsace opened about three months ago. To run the kitchen Mr. Oren hired Philippe Roussel, who had cooked at Montparnasse and Chelsea Bar and  Bistro. Mr. Roussel does justice to his new showcase's name by focusing his mostly French menu on Alsace and its hearty fare. You won't leave hungry, certainly not if you order the pleasant and filling choucroute garnie, which lavished a bevy of meats on sauerkraut that had been cooked with riesling. Along with several kinds of pork sausage there was a pillowy boudin blanc of veal and pork and — just in case you weren't getting enough protein and fat — hunks of flabby pork belly. All of the restaurant's sausages were excellent, including a livery duck sausage and an ethereal seafood sausage made with a shrimp, scallop and cod mousse. A follow-the-sausage ordering strategy would be prudent, as would a follow-the-bacon approach, pointing you toward the Alsatian soup, brimming with white beans as well as bacon, and the baeckeoffe, a traditional Alsatian casserole with bacon, lamb, oxtails and no small measure of potatoes. I suppose it's for diners who find the choucroute garnie too dainty. I encountered a few too many dishes, including a wanly flavored veal breast and a gummy beer-braised lamb shank, that weren't really for anyone. I encountered others, like an onion-laden tarte flambée and a heavily sauced hanger steak, that could have been better. But I loved an appetizer of marrow bones. I liked an appetizer of frog's legs. If tuna is the chicken of the sea, frog's legs are the chicken wings of the haute pond, which is to say they're ready, efficient conveyors of whatever they've been coated in or doused with. These conveyed garlic and butter and butter and garlic. Message received, and relished. On visit after visit, I packed away more dessert than I meant to, entering a sort of fugue state upon seeing and tasting the Frisbee-sized apple tart or  the bewitchingly salted chocolate tart. I got a buzz from the surroundings: a long  zinc  bar; a brilliant spectrum of seltzer bottles above it; a diverse mix of smiling, chattering diners at tables positioned close to one another, but not ridiculously so. Let's face it: I also got a buzz from the beers. One night I tried the effervescent Belgian Deus Brut de Flandres, which comes in what looks like a Champagne bottle and is served in Champagne flutes. Another night I ventured into the sour realm of the lambic — and beat a hasty retreat. And yet another night I heeded the advice of Aviram Turgeman, the beer sommelier (I had to use the phrase just one more time),  and started out with the Belgian golden ale  Duvel, which he said would ""cleanse the palate and awaken the stomach."" That seemed like a lot of responsibility for a beer. But time and again, we've asked as much of wine. Why not, on occasion, let a lager carry the load?

403,Crema,1 star,"May 17, 2006",Frank Bruni,Chelsea,Mexican,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/17/dining/reviews/17rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/17/dining/reviews/17rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"A CHICKEN entree that Julieta Ballesteros serves at her new restaurant, Crema, is one of the most enticing dishes I've encountered in a while. It's also the most heartbreaking. That's a lot of drama to attribute to poultry, but the poultry in this case is being put through unusually dramatic paces by an exceptionally talented chef. It more or less summarizes the story of Crema, which entrances and then disappoints you, its come-on stronger than its follow-through, and not just with that flirty bird. The chicken arrives decked out in many colors and layers. It's a sectioned, skinless breast, placed atop a faintly orange purée of squash blossoms and below dark, meaty slices of portobello mushroom. Over them, like a fleecy cloud at the very summit, hovers warm goat cheese. The elaborate art and architecture of the dish, which also includes an inky swish of chili paste along one edge of the plate and a verdant swish of cilantro and lime emulsion along another, boldly announce Ms. Ballesteros's desire to take Mexican cooking in the kind of nuanced directions that too few Mexican restaurants here do. That's great news, and it's delivered in this dish with a mingling of assertive flavors and rich textures that make you swoon. But there's a big problem that stops you short of total surrender. At least there was both times I sampled the dish, and I gave it a second try in the ardent hope that the letdown on the first go-round was a fluke. The centerpiece — the chicken itself — didn't warrant all the finery coddling and swaddling it. Although it had ostensibly been grilled, it carried none of the fiery, smoky charge that might have compensated somewhat for an even more troubling shortcoming. It had all the moisture of the Mojave. And it suggested that Ms. Ballesteros's carefully considered recipes aren't being matched by sufficiently careful execution. Broadly speaking, there are two principal steps to producing superior food in a restaurant, and Ms. Ballesteros has one of them — the conceptualization — down pat. Dish after dish at Crema comes with imaginative flourishes or impeccable judgment calls, leaving no doubt about the seriousness of her gifts. Ms. Ballesteros, 32, is a chef to watch. She constructs an eloquent melody of bitter, sweet and salty notes by coating broiled Chilean sea bass in achiote paste, skirting it with a tangy pineapple relish and scattering sesame seeds across the plate. A similar melody serenades broiled spareribs, which are heated by ancho and guajillo chili peppers and cooled by piloncillo, an unrefined sugar used in Mexican cuisine. Guajillo, piloncillo, hoja santa (a leaf with mintlike effects) — these uncommon terms stud Ms. Ballesteros's menu, and these specialty ingredients ennoble her dishes, giving them subtly distinctive shadings. But during my visits, Crema too often bungled the second step to complete success: the cooking. That chicken wasn't the only flesh betrayed. The ribs, too, wanted for the kind of succulence they could and should have had. A red mole sauce redolent of the clove, cumin and hoja santa that went into it couldn't disguise the toughness and blandness of the rib-eye it cloaked. And while I loved the chipotle aioli and mango salsa that formed a bright sea around sautéed scallops, the scallops themselves were dead weight. It's possible that the sporadically flawed cooking at Crema is exacerbated by meats and fish that aren't of the highest quality. Ms. Ballesteros cooked at Mexicana Mama, a tiny West Village haunt that became a cult favorite and spawned an offshoot near Union Square. She didn't have a direct financial stake in Mexicana Mama, but she shares ownership of Crema with Shaun Smith. It's a more ambitious, larger venture, with a speck of lounge seating up front, about 10 stools at a long bar and about 35 seats for indoor dining and about 10 outside. It occupies the space that once belonged to Snackbar and then became Sandía, a nuevo Latino place that didn't last much longer — or have much more meaning — than a David Blaine stunt. Ms. Ballesteros and Mr. Smith have replaced Sandía's deep reds with oranges and off-whites. They have also put a phalanx of cacti and yucca in front of a big mirror in the center of the long, narrow dining room. It sounds kitschy but it plays cheerful, and it seems to be going over well. The one time I ate at Sandía, only one other table was occupied. The many times I ate at Crema, the restaurant was populous and lively. As well it should be. Apart from its flaws, which include unimpressive desserts, it has ample charm and merit, and its most diligently executed dishes make it a leader of the pack of stylish Mexican restaurants, including La Esquina and Centrico, that have opened over the last 18 months. That sea bass was silken and delicate. Queso flameado, a crock of baked cheese rendered slick by the oil from chorizo in its midst, was an extraordinary version of an ordinary dish, and the corn tortillas that accompanied it were light and fresh. Get an order for the table as soon as you sit down, to go with your $12 margaritas, which were worth the price. Get a second order to supplement your other appetizers, which should include soft tacos filled with pan-seared hanger steak. They came with a tomato-chorizo paste, a green splash of sauce made from tomatillos, cilantro and jalapeño and a white dollop of the slightly sour Mexican cream from which the restaurant takes its name. This full-throttle array of finely measured effects typified Crema's virtues. Make sure one of the entrees is the flautas, which also came with vibrant flourishes and were delightfully crunchy to boot. Within that crunch was shredded chicken, but in this dish, the bird kept up its end of the deal. No heartbreak here. Just pleasure, along with a palpable, laudable regard for Mexican cuisine that makes you wish Crema were more constant and trustworthy. Crema * 111 West 17th Street (Avenue of the Americas), Chelsea; (212) 691-4477.

404,Buddakan New York,2 star,"May 3, 2006",Frank Bruni,Chelsea,Asian,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/dining/reviews/03rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/dining/reviews/03rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IF a restaurateur is going to enter the competitive downtown arena of pseudo-Asian pleasure domes, he might as well go for broke. He might as well blow out more than 15,000 square feet of space, fill it with bright colors and festoon it with jumbled visual allusions: an enormous fake European tapestry here, scores of artfully showcased Buddha pictures over there. He might as well set the ceiling of the central dining room as high as the Himalayas, hang a row of gargantuan chandeliers from it, and, ignoring the constraints of stiletto heels and the possible tipsiness of their wearers, make diners descend into this gaudy banquet hall — and the maze of moody chambers around it — via a vertiginous staircase. He might as well dim the lights, crank up the hypnotic music and flood the zone with dozens of servers. He might as well try to leave Megu and Matsuri in the dust and Spice Market gasping for air. That seems to be the philosophy that Stephen Starr brought to Buddakan, a restaurant as flashy as any this city has seen. Buddakan is the apotheosis, at least for the next 60 seconds, of a distinct genre: the post-millennial urban mess hall as supersize cocktail lounge with superstylized dishes, which chart a far-out trip to the Far East. The specific cuisine in its sights  is Chinese, and the real surprise is how good many of Buddakan's alternately faithful and fanciful interpretations of it are. A restaurant this sexy doesn't need to be smart. But its chef, Michael Schulson, breathes intelligence and creativity into it. His mao poe tofu may be the most crazily addictive thing I've tasted in months. Cubes of silky bean curd act as crucial moments of calm in a wet, fiery mix of garlic, Thai chili peppers and, well, minced pork. If you want tofu to bust loose like this, you have to give it meat as well as heat. There's an appealing spin on tuna tartare that actually manages to taste somewhat novel, with the diced big-eye tuna layered atop bits of poached egg in scallion oil. It comes on an undulating white plate that looks like a snowdrift. There's also a nifty take on beef tartare, which has tapioca, mint and fish sauce in the mix. Cantonese spring rolls were so plump with shrimp and chicken and so crunchy on the outside that a companion who shared them with me was still raving about them a month later. She wasn't saying much about the Peking duck, which lacked sufficiently crisp skin and notably tender flesh. But that's the thing about Buddakan — more than a few losers keep company with the many winners. Buddakan, which opened in early March, has an identically named forebear in Philadelphia, where Mr. Starr operates 12 restaurants. He's not so much testing the waters of New York as doing a headlong dive into them, and his chosen point of entry is the fringes of the meatpacking district, where the crush of fabulousness is getting a little confusing. Buddakan, with 275 seats for dining and about 50 more for drinking,  should not be confused with the unrelated Buddha-Bar, which just opened a few blocks to the south and can squeeze in at least as many people. Nor should it be confused with Morimoto, another Starr newcomer, which serves quasi-Japanese food on a similarly glitzy stage no more than a few hundred yards away. Entering Buddakan, you encounter a host station nearly as large — and often as thronged — as an airline check-in counter. The journey to your table takes you past what look like the lacquered windows of a Chinese temple to a red room or a teal room or maybe a shimmering gold ""library,"" its walls lined with fake books. Make a bid for the library, which is fittingly quieter than other areas. Order a cocktail called ""heat."" Made with tequila, Cointreau and cucumbers muddled with a chili paste, it's like a margarita with martial arts training — and it's the only specialty drink I didn't find too sweet. Among appetizers, avoid anything in the shape of a ball — meaning dumplings and fritters, which tended to be dull — with the exception of the sui mei. Each of them had a rich amalgam of crab meat and shrimp mousse on the inside and, on the outside, a tiara of additional crab meat. Consider the tartares, spring rolls or boneless pork spare ribs, sauced sweetly but not cloyingly. In a restaurant this mammoth, you don't expect fish to be as beautifully cooked as Buddakan's steamed red snapper, a dish cribbed  from the short-lived restaurant Yumcha in Greenwich Village. It was served with black fungus mushrooms and lily bulb, which had a pleasant bitterness. An equally moist steamed sole wore a glistening coat of oil infused with ginger and scallions. The kitchen dutifully rounded out more than a half-dozen seafood entrees with glazed black cod because, ever since Nobu, a splashy Asian restaurant has to. Mr. Schulson told me on the telephone that he serves about 80 orders of that cod, which happens to be excellent, a night. He serves about five of the mao poe tofu. The world is unjust. Tea-smoked chicken with a scallion and ginger chutney was about as tender as chicken gets. While various red meat entrees — pork belly, short ribs, lamb chops — were prepared with obvious care, they felt too rote. Among solid noodle and rice dishes, the standout was fried rice with a creamy congee of scallops on top. Like Mr. Schulson, the pastry chef, Daniel Skurnick, does work distinctive enough to compete with the décor. A ""crying chocolate"" cake wept delectable tears of white chocolate ganache, while intensely flavored sorbets of blood orange and ginger lemon grass were bedecked with fried ginger chips. Buddakan won't please diners of all ages equally. It's better suited to the young, and its own youth is crucial to its appeal. Restaurants like this tend to look junky upon fifth or sixth inspection, and it's hard to believe this kitchen, serving so many diners at such a fleet pace, won't show signs of strain over time. But for now it's keeping up with the crowds — and providing more reason than many patrons need to teeter down those scary steps into a labyrinth that Kubla Khan would undoubtedly have found appetizing.",
405,Morimoto,1 star,"March 22, 2006",Frank Bruni,Chelsea,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/22/dining/reviews/big-fish-in-a-big-pond.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/22/dining/reviews/big-fish-in-a-big-pond.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"AT the sushi bar, not far from our table, a handsome man takes a seat beside two attractive women, who expertly pivot in his direction, as if practiced at this kind of maneuver. He talks a lot. They laugh a lot. As the night moves along, both women hand him their cards. Their friendship had better be strong. It may soon face an awkward test. One of the cast members of ""Queer Eye for the Straight Guy"" arrives, a pretty and chattering posse around him, and claims a prime piece of real estate in the main dining room. The designer David Rockwell passes the group as he leaves. He didn't contrive the cool, clean, white-on-white look of Morimoto (an architect named Tadao Ando did), but he probably feels compelled to check it out. It's a stunning piece of work: a sparkly wonderland for glittery people, who always get the word and always hop onboard. They drink their bright cocktails, fiddle with their chopsticks, survey their compatriots and tap-tap into their cellphones and other devices, presumably checking on the whereabouts of less fortunate friends, perhaps informing them that the place to be is right here, right now. It's Morimoto's moment. Stephen Starr's, too. He's a Philadelphia restaurateur in the midst of an ambitious Manhattan transfer. In late January he opened this 12,000-square-foot restaurant, which is named for, and modeled after, a sibling in the City of Brotherly Love. It was followed this month by Buddakan, another Philadelphia import, another visually bedazzling behemoth, just a few hundred feet away. Both restaurants bet on a proven formula of Asian-inflected food, thoroughly tricked-out digs, theatrical presentations and pure buzz, although Morimoto has an additional ace up its sleeve. Masaharu Morimoto, a Nobu alumnus familiar to viewers of ""Iron Chef,"" put together the menu, supervises the cooking and, at least for now, can be seen caroming around the open kitchen and into the dining rooms to greet guests. He never stands still, and neither does his menu, which zooms across national and continental borders. It presents the culinary equivalent of a round-the-world ticket. It also sets up the possibility of gastronomic jet lag. A vast selection of very fine sushi and sashimi roots the restaurant in Japan, which also asserts itself in preparations of Kobe-style beef, in tofu and noodle dishes, and in the recurrence of shiso, miso, wasabi and sudachi. But other dishes and ingredients branch out to other parts of Asia, and even to Europe and Latin America. Among the best appetizers I tried was a ""tuna pizza"" with raw bluefin tuna, jalapeño, red onion, olives and an anchovy aioli atop a crisp, thin tortilla. I also liked silky slices of ""lamb carpaccio,"" dressed with Japanese green onions, grated ginger and garlic oil. But I was confounded by a vegetable tempura that was clobbered by a Gorgonzola dip. From Italy it was off to China and France, mingled in an entree called ""duck, duck, duck."" Why, why, why? Because it was a multifaceted fowl, roasted Peking style. The crisp-skinned, moist leg was served whole, while carved breast meat went into an unpleasantly soggy sandwich made with slices of cucumber and a foie gras-infused croissant. A gooey duck egg, placed between a patch of red miso sauce and a pool of port wine-flavored duck jus, completed the excessively busy composition. The appeal of the dishes at Morimoto, like their ethnic associations, was all over the place, due in part to their frantic nature and in part to the kitchen's uneven performance. Rock shrimp tempura, half of the shrimp bathed in a wasabi aioli, half in a Korean red pepper sauce, were light and sweet. Black cod with a ginger and soy reduction and a spicy half chicken with roasted red and green finger peppers had tender flesh, and a delicate touch had been applied to the poached lobster in a wonderful salad with yellow beets, cauliflower and a soy beurre blanc. But a roasted lobster was overcooked, as was just about all of the shellfish, including shrimp and crab, in a Japanese bouillabaisse with a red miso broth that turned out, by default, to be the highlight of the dish. And limp ribbons of beef in a soy and mirin broth tasted as if they had been adrift in hot water three times longer than they should have been. Even more troubling than the unevenness was the way high concept repeatedly supplanted sound judgment, resulting in dishes more amusing to behold than to ingest. The utensils provided for appetizers of toro and hamachi tartare were wood sticks not unlike tongue depressors in their feel and lingering taste. The tartare was accompanied by a beautiful but exasperating spectrum of colorful condiments and herbs (an avocado purée, crème fraîche, micro radish sprouts, wasabi and so on) arranged in contiguous bands so slender that it was nearly impossible to isolate any one from another. The ""Morimoto sashimi,"" terrine-like cubes made from layers of hamachi, smoked salmon, barbecued eel and seared toro, was luscious and hugely flavorful, but which of five colorful liquids in five gimmicky pipettes should be used to anoint it? There wasn't enough fish to make it possible to try all of the sauces and then circle back to a favorite one. Although plenty expensive, Morimoto is an often undisciplined restaurant, prone to silliness and crammed with servers whose extraordinary friendliness didn't mask their mistakes. One night I arrived just a few minutes after three companions. When I checked in with the host station, I wasn't told they had been seated, and I went to wait in the spare, sleek lounge downstairs. I kept asking servers if they had arrived, and my companions kept asking about me. For 35 minutes Morimoto never managed to connect us. But it has its luxe pleasures, including a serious array of not only sake but also shochu. It has its courtesies, like tables with ample space between them and a noise level kept somewhat in check by translucent partitions and by wavy white sheets of canvas and fiberglass on the ceiling and along the walls. And it has its amusements, some of them related to the paces apparently required of large-scale Japanese restaurants making a run at a fickle downtown crowd. There must be a signature design element. Morimoto's is a two-story internal wall, which is made from water bottles and resembles a gargantuan sheet of illuminated Bubble Wrap. There should be arresting restrooms, and Morimoto's take automation beyond the function of mere flushing. Step into a stall and the lid on the toilet rises to greet you. A sense of humor, a sense of style and definite sex appeal: Morimoto has all of these, along with the crowd they bring. If only more of the food lived up to the frisson.

406,P.J. Clarke's on the Hudson,0.75 star,"March 15, 2006",Frank Bruni,Battery Park City,American,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/15/dining/reviews/calling-all-carnivores-pjs-redux.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/15/dining/reviews/calling-all-carnivores-pjs-redux.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"YOU can look at the new P. J. Clarke's in downtown Manhattan as an unremarkable illustration of the laws of supply and demand, as an economics lesson writ boozy and caloric. It puts broad slabs of beef, tall mounds of carbohydrates, stiff drinks and an atavistically musky atmosphere in the paths of hungry financial types, who have been known to respond to such things. Or you can take a dimmer view and see a dark capitalist allegory, a validation of the idea that no rarity is safe from replication or protected from conversion into a kind of franchise divorced from any particular place and time. For many decades, there was only one P. J. Clarke's, and it was one of a kind. It occupied (and still occupies) a squat building in the East 50's, a loud and proud saloon, dating back more than a century, where Scotch would never cede territory to flavored vodka. At P. J.'s you often didn't glance at a menu. You glanced at the blackboard, and if you couldn't read what was scrawled there, it meant you'd had too many pints or tumblers and should probably quit -- after one or two more. P. J.'s trafficked in its own singular history. Nat King Cole had a charge account there. Johnny Mercer supposedly wrote the hit song ""One for My Baby"" on a napkin at the bar. Aristotle Onassis and Jackie Kennedy had a favorite table and, of course, dibs on it. The new P. J.'s, a roughly 220-seat leviathan called P. J. Clarke's on the Hudson, certainly has history around it. The space it inhabits in Battery Park City, in a building complex that's also home to Merrill Lynch and American Express workers and a Starbucks with the longest midafternoon coffee lines I've ever seen, became available after 9/11 displaced businesses in the area. But P. J. Clarke's on the Hudson owes just as much to an impulse to peddle the P .J.'s mystique beyond its cradle. There's money in these initials, and the East Side isn't the only place to make it. Philip Scotti, who put together the group of investors that took over the original P. J.'s in 2002, and who is also an owner of its spawn, said in a telephone conversation that he has plans to keep the brood growing. He's all but finalized a deal to put a P. J.'s near Lincoln Center. He's had thoughts about Washington, and he's had 10 copies of the original's famously oversize, winged porcelain urinals made, at a total cost of about $80,000. Ten was the minimum order that a special ceramics manufacturer in Ohio would accept, he said. Two of these urinals were installed in the new P. J.'s. Four pairs remain. P. J.'s could be the first restaurant chain with a destiny manifestly influenced by lavatory flourishes. In terms of food, the new P. J.'s, like the old P. J.'s, positions itself as an uncomplicated crowd pleaser. It's an American steakhouse (shrimp cocktail, iceberg wedge, T-bone for two, creamed spinach, cheesecake), a British pub (fish and chips, shepherd's pie), a brasserie (roasted chicken, steak tartare, oysters, other raw bar selections) and a diner (meatloaf, turkey club, corned beef Reuben) all wrapped into one. It's better than snobs would like to think and worse than contrarians would hasten to claim, which may be another way of saying that it's usually serviceable and sometimes respectable. It does nothing spectacularly well. It does some things badly. Its baked macaroni and cheese, almost stiff enough to be hoisted from its bowl in one clump, should be called macaroni and an unconfirmed rumor of cheese, and even that might be overstating dairy's role in the affair. For their part clams had seemingly minimized their involvement in a chowder named for them. Other dishes betrayed their pedigrees or purposes in other ways. A Caesar salad was insufficiently salty and excessively watery. French fries were stony, mashed potatoes pasty, lump crabmeat chalky. But apart from that crab, the raw bar selections, including chilled lobster, chilled shrimp, littleneck clams and cherrystone clams, suggested that P. J.'s was finding good ingredients and, in the cases of the lobster and shrimp, cooking them well. It's the kind of restaurant at which you can have a satisfying meal if you manage to hit the bright spots and avoid the dark ones. Heading toward the light means getting a 16-ounce rib-eye or that 36-ounce T-bone, both slightly charred, very juicy and just fatty enough when I tried them. It means crab cakes, moist, rich and more crabby than crumbly, which too often isn't the case. It means burgers, of course, which were plump and tender, though not exceptionally so. (Forget the béarnaise burger, which layered a gratuitous glob of undistinguished adornment on something that didn't need it.) And it means, for dessert, either rice pudding or a ""chocolate chip cookie soufflé,"" which wasn't much of a soufflé at all. It tasted like a chocolate chip cookie dough mousse, if such a thing can be said to exist. Come warmer weather, these modest treats can be savored al fresco, and the views of the harbor and the Statue of Liberty, discernible now through a long wall of windows, will be even more striking. P. J. Clarke's on the Hudson has a generous amount of outdoor space that will accommodate some 275 additional seats. For now lunch and dinner are served indoors at tables with red-and-white checkered cloths. There's a black-and-white tiled floor, blackboards aplenty and dark wood galore. These motifs evoke the original without capturing its spirit or tapping into its myth. Light-filled, gleaming and so vast that the walk between the front tables and the bathrooms is almost a day's worth of cardio, this P. J.'s feels too polished, too mass-market, like an upbeat Beyoncé cover of a downbeat Billie Holiday classic. Mr. Scotti said he could envision a P. J.'s in Las Vegas. It's no longer such a stretch.

407,Barbounia,1 star,"Feb. 1, 2006",Frank Bruni,Flatiron,Mediterranean,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/01/dining/reviews/a-sea-of-comfortable-choices.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/01/dining/reviews/a-sea-of-comfortable-choices.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE new restaurant Barbounia is very easy on the eyes, relatively easy on the ears and not so bad on the stomach, either. But it's kindest of all to another part of the body, which is less delicately evoked and most often consigned to euphemism. How to put this into appropriately fuzzy language? Let's just say that no matter where inside Barbounia you sit and no matter how long you sit there, you will feel cushioned, coddled and grateful. The barstools actually have some give, descending a few inches when you put your full weight on them. Chairs in the dining room are broad, soft and upholstered. Banquettes are pillow-paloozas, as suitable for napping as for noshing. In a city where diners' physical comfort often gets too little consideration, Barbounia is practically a massage of a restaurant, and its magic fingers reflect a broader eagerness to please. That attitude doesn't always work in the restaurant's favor. Barbounia's Mediterranean menu smacks of a bit too much market research and a bit too little inspiration. Although the restaurant's most obvious geographic allegiances are to Greece and Turkey, the cartography is permissive enough to encompass Italy, a more reliable culinary draw. There are categories on the dinner menu for cured meats and for Italian cheeses, and the carbophobe intent on simply prepared slabs of protein will find a category (""from the grill"") for those, too. There's a crudo dish -- in this case, yellowfin tuna -- among the appetizers, and there are sunchokes and polenta among the sides. These strategic inclusions may be the right recipe for popular success, but they render Barbounia less distinctive than it could have been. You relish and remember the sitting in part because it's easy to forget the eating, which is often appealing but seldom exciting, cause for little smiles rather than big sighs. That Barbounia works as well as it does is in many ways surprising, given the turmoil before its November opening. The original chef, Matthew Accarrino, departed, and at the last minute Michael Cressotti, who worked as a corporate chef at Sushi Samba, was put at the helm. At least Mr. Cressotti was literally familiar with the waters. Years ago he worked at Patria, the nuevo Latino exemplar that inhabited this space. Barbounia's food is less ambitious than its predecessor's, and the dishes vary widely in appeal. It's the kind of restaurant best navigated with detailed instructions. For a starter, try a grilled kebab of minced beef and minced lamb. Why did it summon memories of meatballs? Because there was parsley and Parmesan in the mix. Why did it taste so big and rich? Because there was lamb fat as well. Or go for saganaki, a pool of molten kasseri cheese. Does hot liquid cheese ever disappoint? If it isn't something like Velveeta, the answer is no, and Barbounia cinches that verdict by adding a bevy of dark bread and an array of bright fruit -- apples, grapes, pomegranates -- to the equation. This restaurant knows how to assemble a nice spread, be it cheese or salumi. It understands the value of a good visual. But it stumbles in other regards. Marrow bones were awash in a reduction of red wine and veal stock that competed with the marrow instead of complementing it. A mushroom moussaka needed more seasoning and less eggplant, and a Greek salad needed a twist or a tweak of some kind, especially when the price tag was $12. A risotto entree with braised duck, butternut squash, cinnamon and truffle oil was blander than those ingredients suggested it would be, though Barbounia deserves credit for not going bonkers with the truffle oil, as so many restaurants trying to take easy routes to emphatic flavor payoffs do. Pan-seared veal medallions were tough during several visits. Rabbit braciola is a better bet. As with so many rabbit dishes, the rabbit seemed incidental; joking aside, the meat could almost have been chicken, except it wouldn't have sounded as lofty on the menu. It looked fancy on the plate. To the right was a cylinder of loin wrapped in Serrano ham. To the left was slow-cooked, shredded leg meat in a shell of phyllo dough: Bugs in a blanket. Both components were terrific. As for chicken, Barbounia's was moist, bathed in a lemon and rosemary sauce and served with a saffron orzo. But the restaurant excelled in particular at seafood, and that was fitting: its name is a reference to red mullet, which it serves as a crispy-skinned appetizer. It serves crispy-skinned red snapper as an entree, and on most nights it also presents the possibility of grilled dourade, branzino or pompano. All of this fish was impeccably cooked. Desserts, which include a yogurt panna cotta with elderflower syrup and a caramelized banana tart with sour cream ice cream, were less impressive. But if you order Turkish coffee, you are treated to a delightful flourish. The coffee arrives in a tiny brass pot with a crazily long, curved handle. There's a lot about Barbounia that draws and pleases the eye: an open kitchen more tidily and theatrically framed than many an open kitchen is; shimmering blue tiles in the bathroom area; glass shelves along the big windows behind the bar; a whimsical, feathery chandelier that looks like a gargantuan version of Bjork's famous Oscar dress. Gauzy drapery here, there and everywhere conspires with archways and rounded pillars to effect an Ottoman-style opulence. All of this fabric serves an additional purpose, absorbing and muffling noise, and represents another example of this restaurant's rare thoughtfulness. Barbounia conjures enough atmospheric pizazz to wind you up while paying enough attention to basic creature comforts to let you wind down. It's no major culinary event, but it's an unusually pampering perch. Barbounia  * [Rating: One Star]  250 Park Avenue South (20th Street); (212) 995-0242.

408,Al di Là,2 star,"Jan. 11, 2006",Frank Bruni,Park Slope North,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/11/dining/reviews/11rest.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/11/dining/reviews/11rest.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"FOOD lovers who live in Brooklyn, especially food lovers who moved there from Manhattan, love to say that they have better restaurants, ones that wed equally fine food to a humility often absent in the taller, shinier, haughtier borough across the water. Sometimes these people are simply falling prey to local pride and grading on a generous curve. Other times they're talking about Al di Là. I resisted Al di Là for a good long while. One reason was practical: it doesn't take reservations, and I wasn't wild about traveling to Park Slope to wait an hour or more for a table, which can happen if you visit at a prime time on a weeknight or just about any time on a weekend. Another reason was journalistic: the charms of Al di Là weren't exactly secrets (hence those waits), so what purpose did a fresh look serve? But the main reason was pure stubbornness: so many Brooklyn friends were so smug in asserting that this little Italian gem was the ideal neighborhood restaurant. Even if they were right, I didn't want to grant them that. I hereby grant it, and I sing the praises of Al di Là, sung so many times before, because it deserves the music. Because there are food lovers from outside Brooklyn who have never been, and Al di Là is worth a trip. Because occasional chatter that it has grown tired and sloppy after more than seven years of extraordinary popularity needs to be corrected. It hasn't. True, Anna Klinger and Emiliano Coppa, the wife-and-husband, American-and-Italian couple who own and run Al di Là, haven't changed the menu all that much since they opened it in late 1998, but why should they? What was described as great then was great when I tried it over recent months, and the restaurant's fans would justifiably squawk if something like the casunziei, a dish of house-made ravioli, disappeared. It's not a complicated dish, and it's an important reminder, like so much at Al di Là, that Italian food doesn't need to be fancied up or elaborately fussed over to rise to a high level. The ravioli are stuffed with a blend of roasted beets and ricotta, then coated with melted butter and poppy seeds. Both times I had them, they were impeccably cooked, firm but not hard, pliant but not mushy, with pillowy insides and a rich, vaguely grainy gloss. Al di Là has also been doing its tripe appetizer since the beginning, and I hope it will do its tripe appetizer until the end. Blissfully slimy and appropriately chewy, the tripe is cooked and served in a bath of white wine, soffritto and tomatoes, with grilled peasant bread that you can, and should, use to mop up the liquid remnants. Al di Là prods and trusts you to eat adventurously by presenting that tripe; other appetizers of salt cod and bagna cauda; and entrees of calf's liver, basted with butter and sage as it finishes roasting, and rabbit, braised in white wine and chicken stock. But you can also play it safe. On a given night, the half-dozen appetizers are likely to include steamed mussels and carpaccio. The half-dozen pasta and risotto dishes will probably include tagliatelle with a chunky, immensely flavorful ragù of ground beef, pork and veal. And among the half-dozen entrees will be pan-roasted hanger steak served with a balsamic-sweetened sauce and grilled young chicken, tart with lemon juice. Over the past year, Al di Là has been preparing a terrific dish of pan-roasted cod, wild striped bass or hake, depending on the night, with hen-of-the-woods mushrooms and plenty of butter. Al di Là is unabashed about butter, embracing it in a way that many Italian restaurants in New York don't but that's consistent with the cooking in some areas of northern Italy, which is this restaurant's compass. There was a browned butter and sage sauce, for example, over house-made tortelli filled with squash. During my visits the kitchen usually exhibited remarkable precision. A risotto special, made with cuttlefish and cuttlefish ink, had a textbook texture - the elusive sweet spot between gloppy and soupy. But there were missteps. That rabbit, bedecked with olives, was tender the second time I had it, but stringy the first. The chicken, which I sampled once, was dry. Al di Là has additional shortcomings, including desserts of widely varying success. While the gianduiotto, an amalgam of chocolate ice cream, hazelnuts and whipped cream, was out of this world, a ricotta tart was earthbound. Servers can become harried and distracted, and then there's the anxiety-making threat or reality of a long wait. I usually avoided it by going on a weeknight before 7. If you can't do that, know that about two years ago Al di Là annexed a space with an entrance around the corner and turned it into a pleasant wine bar where you can bide your time. The restaurant presents its food on plates that are pretty but mismatched and sometimes chipped, and that seems just right. The dining room isn't dramatic, but it's comfy and warm, with big windows, a combination of lovely yellow wallpaper and exposed brick on the walls, one set of red striped drapes inside the entrance and another framing a passageway to the kitchen. It can feel romantic, which is why you see so many young couples, heads bowed toward each other. It can feel homey, which is why you see solo diners and families with young children. You see a diverse community of people united by a desire to eat extremely well without preciousness or daunting prices, but you don't really see a neighborhood restaurant, at least not anymore. Al di Là, whose name is a kind of Italian double entendre, referring literally to ""the other side"" and figuratively to the great beyond, beckons and rightfully attracts food lovers from far and wide, their local prejudices trumped by its universal appeal.

409,Pylos,1 star,"Dec. 28, 2005",Frank Bruni,East Village,Greek,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/28/dining/reviews/beyond-grape-leaves-on-east-seventh.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/28/dining/reviews/beyond-grape-leaves-on-east-seventh.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IF you've ever been to Pylos or heard its fans talk about it, you know that one detail literally above all others defines it. The clay's the thing. It's what more than 1,000 unglazed pots attached to the restaurant's ceiling are made of. They hang upside down, dramatic and seemingly perilous, drawing your eye and maybe even making you feel a little chicken. This sky really does look as if it could fall. This restaurant would never let that happen. Pylos has been put together with considerable care and operates with unusual grace, a conscientious ambassador of Greek cooking and a standout in the East Village, where the dining scene has improved over the last few years. Pylos (pronounced pee-LOHS), which roughly means ""things of clay,"" opened in 2003, replacing a more casual restaurant called It's Greek to Me. The seriousness of its intent is clear in its pedigree. The owner, Christos Valtzoglou, hired Diane Kochilas, a widely recognized authority on Greek cuisine, as the consulting chef. Her cookbooks are on display. Her full name is on the menu. Her first name is attached to one of nearly 20 mezethes, or appetizers. ""Diane's light-as-air meatballs"" were not quite as light as air when I tried them, but they were considerably better than average meatballs -- more pliant, juicier. A mix of beef and pork, they had been pan-seared in olive oil, and not a second too long. They represented one of several surprising mezethes. There was, for example, a vegetarian moussaka, made with artichoke hearts, caramelized onions and, in place of béchamel, a mix of melted cheeses. There was also a roasted red pepper filled with a frappé of feta cheese, olive oil and a mix of peppers, some sweet and some hot. Both dishes were terrific, and both signaled Pylos's determination to stand out from other Greek restaurants by moving beyond lamb, whole grilled fish and stuffed grape leaves, all of which it served, none of which were its strong points. Pylos also musters a hipper ambience than Greek restaurants usually attempt, the clay canopy playing a major role in that. I was drawn here after a friend who designs theatrical sets said he considers it the prettiest restaurant he knows. Oversize, handsomely framed mirrors make it seem bigger than it is. The contrast between exposed brick walls in the front and whitewashed walls in the back make what is essentially one long dining room feel like two entirely separate areas. There's a large marble table in the back, with seats on one side, a service corridor on the other and wine bottles in the middle. It functions as the bar, and lets solo diners feel fully integrated into the restaurant, not consigned to some antechamber to watch luckier peers penetrate a sanctum off-limits to them. The thoughtfulness goes beyond the design. Diners are greeted with a bounty of warm pita triangles, with a dip that changes nightly, so repeat customers don't get bored. It might be a purée of fava beans; it might be a paste of sun-dried tomatoes. It will probably be addictive. Pylos is a restaurant that comes fast and strong out of the gate. And because it falters later on, not only with desserts (often a rough patch for Greek restaurants) but also with entrees, you might consider ordering three mezethes per person and then calling it quits. It would be enough, and odds are, judging from my visits, that most of it would be terrific. Whatever your strategy, you should not miss a starter of sautéed slices of haloumi cheese with sautéed grapes. Or another of fried zucchini and fried eggplant. The vegetables had the lightness of expert tempura, and they were composed more delicately than you'd expect, in ultrathin circles, layered like a cake. A Greek restaurant must ace grilled octopus, and Pylos did, braising it before charring it, teasing from it a tenderness that octopus frequently resists. It came with balsamic vinegar and capers. Pylos is mad for capers. Applied liberally to an otherwise typical Greek salad, they seemed like eccentric, salty little cousins to the olives. They dusted grilled dourade and grilled branzino, perking up fish that badly and sadly needed it. Among the entrees, which also included braised short ribs and braised lamb shank, roasted Cornish hen and pan-seared duck, my favorites were two Greek stalwarts, moussaka and pastitsio. Both benefited from béchamel sauces less heavy than such sauces can be, and both were pleasantly dizzy with cumin, cinnamon, nutmeg and allspice. So the best strategy, upon further thought, might be two mezethes and one of these. And Greek yogurt with honey and walnuts, the best of the dessert selections. These include ouzo-spiked chocolate mousse and a walnut cake as soggy as, and little more appealing than, a wet sponge. Pylos rewards adventurous wine drinkers with a long, all-Greek wine list. (The restaurant does not serve liquor.) After a few glasses, the clay pots, more than three pounds each, become even more transfixing. Mr. Valtzoglou said he initially thought he would import pots from Greece, but learned that a nonprofit group on his block taught teenagers to make pottery. He contracted to get his reddish-brown pots from them. They produced batches of only about 50, no more often than once a week. So the canopy grew slowly. It grows still. Each pot is secured with heavy wire: no danger of a claystorm or clayslide here. Just a flourish at once rustic and contemporary, an apt metaphor for Pylos itself. Pylos  * [Rating: One Star]  128 East Seventh Street (Avenue A), East Village; (212) 473-0220. ATMOSPHERE -- Big mirrors, exposed brick, throw pillows and a stunning canopy of clay pots.

410,Keens Steakhouse,2 star,"Dec. 14, 2005",Frank Bruni,Koreatown,Steak Houses,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/14/dining/reviews/where-the-lore-is-part-of-the-lure.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/14/dining/reviews/where-the-lore-is-part-of-the-lure.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THERE'S a secret to the surprising mellowness of the ""legendary mutton chop"" at Keens Steakhouse, a restaurant long synonymous with that gargantuan slab of meat. (The menu announces it with a verbal trumpet blast.) There's a simple reason it has none of the gaminess that diners expect of mutton, which is sheep, and instead reminds them of lamb, the younger version they know and trust. Nix the trumpet and commence a drum roll: it is lamb. The mutton lore is a mutton lie. For at least two decades and perhaps many more, the legendary mutton chop has indeed been a matter of legend. The following sentence is inevitable, as is the one on its tail. Diners have had the wool pulled over their eyes. But they haven't been fleeced. The mutton chop at Keens, a 26-ounce saddle of lamb, skirted with fat and nearly two inches tall, can wear whatever label it pleases, because it provides about as much pleasure as a carnivore could want. So, for that matter, does Keens, a meaty Mecca since 1885, artery-clogging proof that not all good things must come to pass, though they may indeed have to adapt to new times by toying with certain traditions. In the case of Keens, those traditions include true-blue mutton chops, which it once served. It kept the name even after it lost the sheep. It's nostalgic like that. No restaurant in New York City pays the kind of lavish, often kooky, sometimes even touching tribute to the past that Keens does. Look to the ceilings of various dining rooms, which are spread over two floors of three connected townhouses, and behold row upon row of clay pipes. There are more than 50,000 of them, the property of Keens customers who, in tobacco-friendlier times, stowed and used them in the restaurant. Keens had what it called a pipe club, with members including Babe Ruth and Theodore Roosevelt. Even after smoking in restaurants went the way of absinthe, Keens inducted honorary members into the club, famous customers as diverse as Dr. Ruth Westheimer and Dr. Renee Richards, Liza Minnelli and Stephen King. There are pipes bearing their signatures in a glass case beside the main entrance. Keens is a trove not only of protein but also of memorabilia. Its dark-paneled walls display vintage photographs, vintage political cartoons and vintage playbills. On a poignant note, in a room often used for private dining, Keen has what it identifies as the theatrical program that Abraham Lincoln was holding when he was shot. On a humorous note, in the main vestibule, it has what it identifies as ""dinosaur sirloin,"" supposedly a fossil from the Red Rocks area of Utah. It looks like reddish-brown marble, and a sign with it says that in the opinion of Keens, it has not yet been aged long enough to be cooked. Keens expertly dry-ages its beef, which it serves in an array of cuts, all of them memorable and almost all of them mammoth: sirloin, filet mignon, prime rib, porterhouse for two, porterhouse for three. On my visits the restaurant put a nice char on any and every cut that was supposed to have it, and it cooked everything to its requested temperature. It proved itself to be not only one of the city's most charming and diverting theaters for testosterone cuisine but also one of its most reliable. And it presented a few surprisingly effective cameos, most notably a fried chicken salad available only at lunch. Morsels of tender breast kept company with hunks of Stilton cheese, several kinds of lettuces and a sparingly applied vinaigrette. Keens doesn't consign a diner to iceberg with blue cheese, though that's a very happy fate. It also serves a salad of arugula, bibb lettuce, basil and watercress, and both times I had it, the greens and herbs were springy and fresh. Other digressions from the beefy, lamby norm proved perilous. A half chicken had been left on the rotisserie at least 10 minutes too long. A gigantic wedge of salmon had an impressively silken texture but a muffled flavor. (Was it really wild, as the menu claimed?) Fried calamari were a rubbery wreck. It could be argued that a person who orders these dishes in a steakhouse gets what he or she deserves. But a steakhouse should come through with a stronger lineup of desserts than Keens did. Most of the ones I tried were instantly forgettable. The service was usually a graceful departure from the studied gruffness of some other traditional steakhouses. Keens paid attention to details. A glass of iced tea arrived with a fresh mint leaf floating on its surface. A refill wasn't a refill: it was a new glass with a new leaf. Water was poured from a pewter pitcher. In deference to the holiday season, a big stuffed moose head wore a little red Santa cap. Keens is mischievous like that. Cue the mutton. Because Keens changed ownership in the late 1970's, a definitive, comprehensive mutton history seems to be out of reach. But the restaurant's current manager, Bonnie Jenkins, investigated the matter at my request. Keens began with real mutton, which is often defined in this country as sheep of about a year or more in age. In 1935, the restaurant reached and publicly celebrated a milestone: one million mutton chops served. Apparently, Keens was an early, upscale McDonald's of mutton. World War II came. Deprived Americans ate more mutton than they wanted, and as it later fell farther and farther out of fashion, getting fresh mutton of reliable quality became iffy. At some point Keens had to turn to lamb, choosing a cut with a winged shape that mimicked the mutton chop of yore. Keens was using lamb in place of mutton when its current owner reopened it in 1981 following several years of extensive renovations. It was using lamb when subsequent newspaper and magazine articles about Keens appeared under headlines like ""Mutton Place"" and ""Of Mutton and Men."" And it is using lamb now, although it tries to get lamb around 10 months in age, which is older than most of the lamb we eat, including the thick-cut rack at Keens. That doesn't make it mutton, but it does seem to give it a more robust taste, like lamb with an exponent, lamb on steroids. Call it near-mutton. Call it extreme lamb. Go ahead and call it legendary. In more ways than one, it warrants that tag. Keens Steakhouse  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  72 West 36th Street, Midtown; (212) 947-3636.

411,Cookshop,2 star,"Nov. 30, 2005",Frank Bruni,Chelsea,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/30/dining/reviews/having-your-ethics-and-eating-them-too.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/30/dining/reviews/having-your-ethics-and-eating-them-too.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"TO appreciate how far eating has evolved from a matter of survival to a statement of values, take a trip to Cookshop and a look at its chalkboards. They don't list daily specials. They celebrate the restaurant's ""favorite farmers,"" an honor roll of principled stewards and good shepherds who aren't exhausting their land, immobilizing their livestock, tweaking genes or toying with hormones. Along with an elite fleet of chosen fishermen, these farmers stock Cookshop's larder, and they are more or less local, or at least regional; the governing religion demands it. On a given night the number of them on those boards may rise as high as 10, just like the Commandments. Cookshop, you see, is selling more than Montauk squid, Catskill duck and a cornucopia of lettuces, legumes, root vegetables and fruits that dutifully obey their seasons. Cookshop is selling virtue, and it's suffused with it, even in ways that aren't bluntly advertised. The tables, for example, are made of a type of American oak that Cookshop's proprietors chose over less expensive alternatives because those alternatives come from endangered forests. The menus, tawny and matte, use recycled paper. So you can sip, sup and simultaneously congratulate yourself, all of which might be a bit much but for this: You can also have a merry, heedless time. With the exception of those chalkboards, Cookshop renders its call to conscience as a murmur, audible to anyone soothed by the sound and ignorable by those who just want to chow down. More important, Cookshop's theology incorporates the pleasure principle. Never mind the wood. The tables are well spaced throughout an L-shaped room with a long wall of windows, a magnanimous level of lighting and a décor that perfectly splits the difference between spare and cozy. The seafood, meat and produce aren't just ethical; they're fresh and flavorful. And while the dishes, individually and all together, strive for a quality that might well be called wholesomeness, it's a hedonistic (as opposed to an extra-crunchy) wholesomeness, built around an all-American, old-fashioned emphasis on belly-filling comfort that brings to mind Prune and Little Giant. They and Cookshop are the deviled-egg restaurants. All three have served that dish, which is listed on their menus among snacks, a category separate from appetizers. And in all three cases the dish is part of a studied homeyness that also manifests itself in house-made sausages and liver-laden treats. But the deviled eggs at Cookshop are topped with caviar (from American paddlefish, mind you), signaling something else. Cookshop is a more ambitious production than its kinfolk. It's also more polished and, with about 115 seats, much larger. The producers are the husband-wife team of Marc Meyer and Vicki Freeman and their partner, Chris Paraskevaides, who also collaborate on Five Points in NoHo. Mr. Meyer is the executive chef. Five Points opened in 1999 and has done brisk business ever since. It's never exciting but frequently satisfying, while Cookshop is rarely exciting but almost always satisfying -- a child that improves upon the parent. It presents a balanced user-friendly menu that offers something for everyone (a meatless wood-oven pizza, a meatless pasta, halibut in a shower of olives and raisins, beef brisket in a swamp of grits and fried onions) without collapsing into incoherence. The food is amply portioned, fairly priced and completely sophisticated but not remotely fussy. The wine list is extensive and varied but not showy. Because Cookshop has made the rounds of small producers, acquiring wines that aren't easy to find in retail stores, you can spend $30 to $40 and get an interesting, hugely enjoyable bottle. Try the 2002 Mas des Chimères from Languedoc, made primarily of syrah. None of those strengths may sound like a big deal, but it's surprising how few restaurants combine them, how seldom I hear what I often did when I went to Cookshop: friends remarking that they would gladly return on their own time and dime. They most often said this as we sampled Cookshop's irresistible desserts, the work of the pastry chef, Heather Miller. There was a single-serving chocolate meringue pie, which had stiff competition from a maple flan with warm gingerbread and from a hot fudge sundae with pecans, bourbon-spiked butterscotch and more. There was also, for the faint of stomach, a fantastic mix of ginger-lemon ice and cranberries, which sat on the table among its less restrained peers like a Merchant-Ivory film in a festival of Tarantino. The savory highlights at Cookshop include an appetizer of house-smoked bluefish that's as fine a treatment of a blue as you're likely to encounter. You can't go wrong with any of the salads, one of which liberates beets from goat cheese and pairs them instead with tahini. You also can't go wrong with Cookshop's grits, and that's fortunate, because they appear not only with the brisket but also with roasted shrimp and fried duck livers, and on their own, as a side. Among the snacks, the deviled egg is not as good a bet as sautéed chanterelle, oyster and maitake mushrooms on grilled rye toast, or as slices of smoked pork tenderloin with persimmon. Mr. Meyer clearly knows his way around a pig, because the best of the entrees is probably the pork, which pairs grilled loin with a pudgy link of sausage. It reflects Mr. Meyer's attempt to use as many parts of the animals he buys as possible. He cooks whole young chickens and rabbits on an experimental, odd-looking vertical rotisserie that he helped design, but he seemingly hasn't mastered this equipment or dealt adequately with its collateral effects. Both times I had the chicken, its skin wasn't crisp, and the one time I sat near the open kitchen the heat from that rotisserie made me feel as if I should be wearing SPF 45. I'm betting Mr. Meyer and his partners will solve those problems, because their eagerness to please seems as keen as their exaltation of all things seasonal, free-range and line-caught. Of course these impulses are not contradictory, and Cookshop is proof: a place where eating well and doing good find common ground.

412,Cafe Luxembourg,1 star,"Nov. 23, 2005",Frank Bruni,Upper West Side,Bistros,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/23/dining/reviews/cinderella-and-her-popular-stepsister.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/23/dining/reviews/cinderella-and-her-popular-stepsister.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"YOU don't hear people talk much about Compass, which famously defied its name by so often losing its way. But you would if more of them tried its crispy skate appetizer, an expertly cooked indication that Compass is finally on course. When several friends and I recently had it, the moistness of the fish and the crunchiness of its panko crust played a textural tug of war. Neither side lost, so we won. Entrees arrived, and we were victors again. Our lobster, poached in olive oil before being pampered with butter and clementine juice, made a dreamy case for never treating lobster any other way. An hour or so later we were next door at Cafe Luxembourg, where we spotted skate as a main course and ordered it. It had been put through uneventful paces -- a sizzling encounter with olive oil, a subsequent shower of capers -- and had emerged somewhat gummy. It typified too much of the restaurant's food, at once serviceable and disappointing. And yet Cafe Luxembourg, unlike Compass, was characteristically packed. The way people push to get in and wait three deep at the bar, you'd think the restaurant's signature yellow tile walls were coated in some sort of culinary pheromone. Cafe Luxembourg is the soccer captain to Compass's science club president. It has more sex appeal and an easier time getting dates. The disparate degrees of ardor that diners feel for these restaurants also illustrates something else: the way success perpetuates itself, a self-sustaining reality sometimes divorced from the merits, while a history of failure obscures current accomplishments. In the restaurant business, as in so much else, reputations linger and a herd mentality rules. Diners crowd Cafe Luxembourg, which is now 22 years old, in part because they see that it's always crowded. Diners don't rush to Compass, which is not yet 4, because they don't notice any stampede in that direction. And why would they? Compass is already on its fifth head chef, the rapid turnover revealing frequent turmoil. But recent visits to both restaurants, which sit side by side on the Upper West Side, pointed out a need for reappraisals. It is the kitchen at Cafe Luxembourg, which received two stars from Bryan Miller in The New York Times in 1992, that has been struggling lately. After many months without an executive chef, the restaurant hired Victor Everitt about six weeks ago. The transition may partly explain the ordinariness of the food. But it doesn't explain the service, almost always sluggish and often distracted. During one visit, we waited 35 minutes past our reservation time without anyone's offering us an apology. On another visit, one friend, arriving mere minutes after the rest of us had been seated, was told there was no record of our party. We were 20 feet away. Perhaps because it has been desired for so long, Cafe Luxembourg doesn't fret enough over its desirability. At brunch an omelet was overdone. At dinner loin of lamb and a strip steak, both ordered medium rare, were overcooked. So were the noodles in a dish of pappardelle with braised rabbit and almost no flavor. We tried to resuscitate it with salt, the same emergency treatment we administered to an anorexic, wheezing potato and fennel soup. But both were dead on arrival. The menu combines populist French stalwarts (onion soup, steak tartare, coq au vin) with American favorites (burger, fried calamari). By Manhattan standards the food isn't extravagantly priced. And a diner can assemble an enjoyable meal, especially by starting with one of Mr. Everitt's new appetizers -- a salad of peekytoe crab, avocado and grapefruit -- and proceeding to one of his new entrees, maple-glazed pork tenderloin. There isn't a single letdown among a strong contingent of straightforward desserts (baked Alaska, rum-raisin bread pudding) by Alana Ford, the pastry chef. Apart from these bright spots, however, Cafe Luxembourg's strongest claim on diners' affection may be its hip, brasserie lite mien. Compass, in contrast, can't coast on comely pouts and poses. Its somewhat blankly contemporary dining room is the visual equivalent of the music that filled it one night: Dido, Sade, George Michael. Meet architectural easy listening. But if Cafe Luxembourg assumes your interest, Compass eagerly pins a corsage on you. A woman at the coat check called out to make sure a friend and I knew we could ditch whatever we wanted. (I think she would even have taken our dirty laundry.) The bread basket overflowed with slices of seven-grain, Manchego cheese rolls, corn bread -- all of it great. The current chef, John Fraser, on board now for six months, has put together an ambitious Continental-goes-global menu and buckled down to impressive cooking. It yielded succulent results in an appetizer of bay scallops, served with a potato purée and chanterelles, and an entree of wild salmon, served with Savoy cabbage, lentils and black trumpet mushrooms. Mr. Fraser combines formidable energy with fastidiousness, bringing fresh ideas to staples of high-end dining. Lamb? Tender medallions of loin were paired with a small, rich potpie of leg and belly. Duck? Out came more pastry: a tiny pastilla of braised leg to go along with seared breast meat. The skate, cooked on a plancha, was served with a swish of peanut purée and a Thai-theme salad of green papaya, pineapple and crab. A terrific appetizer of roasted beets included what a server called ""beet caviar,"" which was couscous stained with beet juice. That term, like the menu listing of entrees as ""compositions,"" reflects a tendency to embellish that can work against Compass, which received one star in The Times from Amanda Hesser last year. A veal chop was not so much coddled as clobbered by a cloak of peppers, chorizo and capers. And while the $32 price tag on Compass's vigorously promoted three-course prix fixe sounds like a deal, the limited choices, including salmon tartare and beef short ribs, did not rank anywhere near the restaurant's best dishes and reflected its unevenness. But those best dishes were truly distinctive, and so were the desserts, under the direction of Vera Tong. Ms. Tong's work is as spirited as Mr. Fraser's. Rolling with the seasons, she fashioned pumpkin panna cotta and gingerbread pudding. Recognizing the magic of salty with sweet, she affixed potato chips to the sides of a milk chocolate and hazlenut gâteau, where they fanned out like a hummingbird's wings. If she, Mr. Fraser and the rest of the staff at Compass keep it up, they might soon be able to count on legions of fans. Perhaps their biggest hurdle is simply the lack of them.

413,Aburiya Kinnosuke,1 star,"Nov. 16, 2005",Frank Bruni,Midtown East,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/16/dining/tokyo-in-midtown-english-optional.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/16/dining/tokyo-in-midtown-english-optional.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"AT Aburiya Kinnosuke, a new restaurant in Midtown, you probably won't spot any celebrities, the way you might at a more lavish, trendy Japanese pleasure palace like Megu or Nobu. You definitely won't find elaborately constructed, kaleidoscopic sushi rolls, the kind that look more like kites than supper, or whimsically shaped stemware filled with neon-colored potions, the kind that look more like chemistry experiments than drinks. Here's what you will see, or at least what I did, every time I went: tables filled with Japanese businessmen, neckties still on, briefcases nearby, speaking Japanese to servers who fared much better in that language than in English. In front of them they had banquets of food that was largely unfamiliar, and on their faces they had very broad smiles. This restaurant was clearly delighting them, sating them and offering them something much closer to, and more consistent with, what they would get in Tokyo than what they would get in TriBeCa. That caught my attention, and my own delight kept me coming back for more. Plunging into the restaurant's lengthy menu, which was supplemented each night by dozens of specials, I had a sense of seemingly boundless possibility, of new flavors that it would take quite some time to exhaust. I had a sense of discovery. And I had tuna collar, again and again, because like so much else at Aburiya Kinnosuke, it's not something that many other New York restaurants serve. It looked like a veal chop, big bones and all. The meat was tawny and rich, not in the manner of toro but in a muskier, messier vein. Some bits were darker than others, and some hid in crevices between skin and bone. Using chopsticks to grab hold of them was like excavating layers of earth, each slightly different. It's an activity I recommend, as I do Aburiya, with a few caveats. The menu is so expansive and arcane that a diner can encounter bad luck as easily as good and wind up with food that disappoints, if only because it's so peculiar. One night I blithely ventured in the direction of dried baby squid, only to make a hasty retreat after one repellently fishy, intensely funky bite. Due in part to the language barrier, service can be awkward. The people who waited on my friends and me had trouble explaining what various dishes were and, in some cases, why it was taking so long for these dishes to arrive. A few of these servers, seemingly reluctant to intrude on us, succeeded in ignoring us. But for a diner in the right frame of mind, the oddities of Aburiya just seem like part of the adventure. Aburiya was opened several months ago by the restaurateurs who operate Yakitori Totto, a more casual Japanese restaurant in Midtown. Aburiya is more expensive; although the price of each modestly proportioned dish is often low, it can take four or five of those dishes, at an aggregate cost of $35 to $45, to fill a diner up. In return, the restaurant adds a layer of gloss and a measure of serenity to the kind of no-nonsense, no-compromises ethnic fidelity more easily found in no-frills haunts. It's a pleasant escape that always made me feel as if I were traveling far away from the rest of the city. It provides several seating options. There are semiprivate nooks fronted by sliding latticed wood doors, a common area with tightly packed tables along a banquette and, in the back, a counter around a robata grill. The restaurant's menu is divided into many parts, including house-made tofu, salads, sashimi, and rice and noodle dishes. But grilling occupies center stage. It can even occupy the center of the table. Under the heading ""Shichirin Grill,"" which refers to a small portable vessel, the restaurant serves meat and fish that diners can grill over bincho-tan charcoal, which produces little smoke. During my visits hanger steak and red snapper were among the options. In both cases, servers placed a big leaf over the grill, and we were instructed to slather that leaf with sweet red miso paste, then put the flesh and a heap of scallions over that. When the paste bubbled, we were told, the food would be done. But the bubbling was a poor barometer for both the beef, which needed more cooking, and the fish, which needed less. In addition, the miso and scallions registered too strongly. The fruits of the robata grill, which also uses bincho-tan charcoal, were more reliable. The tuna collar, listed on the menu as neck, came from that, and so did salmon neck, another fatty, slightly gamy, challenging and rewarding cut. The robata produced crisp-skinned chicken wings, succulent strips of pork cheek and tender ribbons of sea eel. It was the cradle of what the menu called a chicken meatball, really a chicken meatloaf, eggy, gooey and comforting. I hadn't tried black sesame tofu before Aburiya, but I hope to have it again, especially now that I know what I didn't when I took my first few bites: that the tiny mound of salt beside it had a real purpose. Applied sparingly, it played a pivotal role in blunting the edges of the sesame. Gomoku kinpira, a sautéed mixture of thinly sliced mushroom, carrot, burdock root, lotus root and more, was like a slaw that had begun evolving into a lo mein, taking on greater weight, more flavor and oiliness. Cold, circular wedges of Japanese sticky yam, with the taste and texture of a slick potato, had been pickled and seasoned with wasabi. They were slimy on the outside, softer within, and had a fiery finish on the tongue. I couldn't stop eating them, and by that time -- my last visit to Aburiya -- I was no longer staring at the tables of Japanese diners or soliciting advice from Japan-savvy friends to determine what to eat. I was just guessing, improvising. In a way, that's the most authentic experience of all. Aburiya Kinnosuke  * [Rating: One Star]  213 East 45th Street; (212) 867-5454.

414,Ninja New York,0.25 star,"Oct. 26, 2005",Frank Bruni,TriBeCa,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/26/dining/yelping-warriors-and-rocks-in-the-broth.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/26/dining/yelping-warriors-and-rocks-in-the-broth.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"CONFUSING the point of a restaurant with the mission of a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit, Ninja New York deposits you in a kooky, dreary subterranean labyrinth that seems better suited to coal mining than to supping. You are greeted there by servers in black costumes who ceaselessly bow, regularly yelp and ever so occasionally tumble, and you are asked to choose between two routes to your table. The first is described by a ninja escort as simple and direct. The second is ""dark, dangerous and narrow,"" involving a long tunnel and a drawbridge that descends only when your escort intones a special command, which he later implores you to keep secret. I recommend a third path: right back out the door. Granted, you will be denied the sating of any curiosity about what a $3.5 million design budget permits in the way of faux stone walls, make-believe gorges and mock torches. You will forgo an iota of modest amusement. But you will be spared an infinitely larger measure of tedium, a visually histrionic smorgasbord of undistinguished food and a discordant bill that can easily exceed $100 a person with tax, tip and drinks. Ninja acts like a Disney ride -- Space Mountain under a hailstorm of run-of-the-mill or unappealing sushi -- but charges like Le Bernardin. It has a stringy crab dish served on a grapefruit that belches smoke, a ridiculous dessert in the shape of a frog and a whole lot of nerve. An American offshoot of a restaurant in Tokyo, Ninja intends to evoke a Japanese mountain village inhabited by ninjas, a special breed of stealthy warriors. In this case they come armed not only with swords and sorcery but also with recipes, which may be their most dangerous weapons of all. And they roam, romp and perform dopey magic tricks, including sleight of hand with rubber bands, over 6,000 square feet of darkened crannies and well-separated, quiet nooks. Each party of diners receives its own nook, which quickly takes on the aspect of a jail cell as the ninjas, delivering and removing dishes, laboriously slide the latticed doors open and closed, closed and open, ad infinitum. On my first visit, when I tried a $150 tasting menu with a dearth of culinary highlights but a surfeit of ninja pageantry, they reliably garnished this gesture with loud expectorations of a putative courtesy that sounded more like a rebuke, the phonetic rendering of which would be something along the lines of ""Go-mayn!"" ""Go-mayn!"" coughed a ninja, and onto the table dropped an appetizer of octopus drowned in vinegar. Not soon enough, it was spirited away (""Go-mayn!""), to be replaced and rivaled later on by a wedge of dry black cod in edible paper (""Go-mayn!""). I grew so weary of these syllables that I asked if they could be varied, if something along the lines of a ""Surrender, Dorothy!"" could be thrown into the mix. I was dead serious. The lineup of dishes isn't. Presented on a scroll, it mingles straightforward Japanese fare (tempura, sashimi, soba, yakitori) with flights of fancy that are grounded, but only somewhat, in Japanese and French traditions. In the name of ""new style sushi"" Ninja employs rice cakes as beds -- or sometimes graves -- for a rectangle of truffle-flecked omelet (it tasted like soggy French toast), a sliver of sautéed foie gras (pleasant, but how could it not be?) and a finger of seaweed-crowned mackerel (fishy in the extreme). It trots out a golden tower roll, which inexplicably embeds uni in spongecake, and a spring snow roll, which engulfs eel in an obliterating puck of sweetened cream cheese. In the service of table-side derring-do the restaurant spotlights what it calls a meteorite pot, a milky brew with Thai seasonings and slices of pork loin. A ninja cooks it in close, sizzling proximity to diners by heaving a large, hot rock into the broth. It's a soup and a sauna, not to mention a pointless effort for the thin, dull outcome. And in the interest of decadence Ninja concocts appetizers like a ""crème brûlée"" that combines egg custard with Parmesan, potato, foie gras and veal for a quichelike effect. It was actually good, a judgment that applied to only about a third of the food, much too small a fraction for a restaurant this expensive. The shoddy service also contradicted the cost. If a restaurant wants to promote six multicourse meals that range from $80 to $200, it should make sure that the menu on which these options appear doesn't have a big red food stain, as a companion's menu did. If a restaurant wants to charge between $12 and $18 a glass for white wine and $15 for weak specialty drinks, it should respond to an expressed interest in sake with a presentation of its sake list, not with the words ""I'll bring half a liter,"" which is what a ninja said. It should not run out of sparkling water, as it did one night. It should also advise its ninjas that it's not nice to brag about having entertained a Hollywood celebrity who, by the account of the ninja in question, was the apparent beneficiary of recent breast augmentation. I was happy for the disclosure and appalled at the indiscretion, as I was at so much else. A ""fatty tuna steak,"" available à la carte for $45, was no larger than a cutlet, and while I expected o-toro, I detected no toro. Once the bright red bits of shell that decorated a $40 lobster entrée were removed, all that remained was about eight bites of flesh, neither tender nor sweet. That frog dessert was just $10, but it was little more than a cloying blob of cunningly molded cream cheese. A ho-hum amalgam of chocolate cake, green tea cake and vanilla and green tea ice creams (also $10) was another triumph of shape over substance, resembling a bonsai. For a toddler with a trust fund and a yen for udon and maki, Ninja might be a valid alternative to the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant. For just about anybody else it's nonsensical, and its climactic illusion may well be a disappearing act. Ninja New York  POOR 25 Hudson Street (Duane Street), TriBeCa; (212)274-8500.

415,Abboccato,2 star,"Oct. 19, 2005",Marian Burros,Midtown,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/19/dining/reviews/recapturing-that-tour-of-italy.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/19/dining/reviews/recapturing-that-tour-of-italy.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ABBOCCATO is the 21st-century version of an Italian-American restaurant. There are no red tablecloths, no candles stuck in raffia-covered wine bottles, no lasagna or garlic bread. Instead there is an Italian restaurant with one foot firmly planted in Italy, the other in the New World: buffalo milk ricotta, meet sourdough bread; Umbrian truffles, meet fresh corn. And because no self-respecting upscale restaurant is entitled to high prices without it, foie gras. After an extensive tour of Italy, the Livanos family decided to add another restaurant to the two it owns in Midtown, Molyvos and Oceana. The Livanoses hired a chef who had worked at Felidia and Esca, and tried to make a grotto-like space in the Blakely Hotel into something bright and light. But there are too many things going on in the decorative effort. Jim Botsacos, the chef and a partner at Molyvos and Abboccato, and Jake Addeo, Abboccato's chef de cuisine, are cooking some interesting but seldom seen regional dishes and creating a few delightful combinations that would never see the light of day in Italy. It's a bit of a jumble, but often a pleasing one, like the heavenly buffalo milk ricotta soup with tomatoes, corn and crisp pancetta. I could eat it every week. Or the perfectly roasted black bass that is served with seared escarole stuffed with a zesty caponata, all of it moistened with a vinaigrette made with pork jowls. Foie gras has found its way into ravioli stuffed with wild radicchio and ricotta and served with a sage, walnut and balsamic butter sauce. The only complaint was that the ravioli were a little too al dente. Another felicitous marriage is foie gras -- the buttery interior bursting through the nicely crisp exterior -- served with a potato dumpling stuffed with tomato marmalade. Anyone who likes quail but despairs of the bones should go directly to Abboccato's boneless, beautifully roasted preparation, about the size of a Spaldeen. It is stuffed with mortadella and pistachios and served with lentils, the traditional balsamic onions and an unexpected slash of mostarda, the fruit and mustard preserves often found on a cheese plate. Carpaccio of tomatoes? Words take on meanings here they never had before. As you might suspect, the tomatoes are thinly sliced and make a base for sweet peekytoe crab meat, lightly flavored with scallions and punctuated with lovage. Of course, this dish depends entirely on the flavor of the raw ingredients, so it won't be around much longer this year. Tomatoes also depend on proper salting. And here is where the kitchen falls down on the not-so-simple task: the use of sea salt. It is a fault emblematic of the restaurant's drawbacks, and it prevents Abboccato, which means medium sweet, from being as good as it can be. There is not always a steady hand at the stove. On each visit some dishes tasted as if the chef had stock in a sea salt company. You can't sprinkle coarse salt the way you sprinkle Morton's. Not everyone wants a burst of salt in a bite. But in other dishes it was completely missing. The otherwise excellent spaghetti alla amatriciana, made with house-cured pig jowls -- which sound better in Italian, guanciale -- was oversalted. At the other extreme, the tagliatelle Bolognese was a tepid rendition of the old tradition, chiefly because it tasted salt-free. A side dish of peperonata lacked not only salt but also any evidence of the ingredients that give it its usual piquancy: onion, garlic and vinegar. The pan-seared potatoes with pancetta and onion tasted reheated and -- you guessed it -- devoid of salt. On the other hand, the rack of lamb for two, baked in a salt and mint crust, was not at all salty -- or minty for that matter. The meat, though perfectly cooked medium rare, was tough. For some reason most of the cheeses on the well-selected tray did not come with bread, though they were served with some delicious preparation of fruit, either macerated or marinated, fresh or dried. That's how Italians like to eat cheese. But Americans want bread, and when they ask for it in this country, in this city and in this restaurant, the waiter should not shoot them a look of disdain and say the restaurant does not have bread. It was this same waiter who on two occasions stood uncomfortably close to the table, staring at my guests and almost close enough to hear the conversation. Each time someone spilled a drop on the table cloth, he rushed over with a napkin and ceremoniously placed it over the offending spot -- four times at one meal. Did he know I was reviewing the restaurant? I doubt it -- it was service not with a smile but with a sneer. I think the maître d'hôtel needs to keep him busier. Otherwise, the service was pleasant and appropriate. The hardest course for an Italian restaurant in America to conjure up is dessert because Italians finish their meals with the cheese. But Abboccato's pastry chef, David Carmichael, has come up with some pleasing desserts connected to Italy. Tiny, warm cinnamon-dusted doughnuts with vanilla mascarpone were hard to resist. And the buffalo milk ricotta cheese tart with seasonal fruit poached in wine was a delightful mix of creamy, sweet and acidic. Thinly sliced, toasted panettone with an orange-marmalade-studded semifreddo, lovingly bathed in warm chocolate sauce, was a delicious deconstructed take on an ice cream sandwich. The gelati might have pink peppercorns, mostarda or just plain caramel. But Bonet was an overly dense, unpleasantly bitter chocolate mousse with a white chocolate topping. Though the menu says it is served with three citrus powders, the night we tried it the citrus had taken a powder. But when the espresso arrived with perfect little hazelnut meringues, we forgot about the Bonet. Simple is good. Reviews by Frank Bruni, who is on vacation, will resume next week.

416,Ben & Jack's Steak House,1 star,"Oct. 12, 2005",Marian Burros,Midtown East,Steak Houses,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/12/dining/reviews/take-my-steak-please.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/12/dining/reviews/take-my-steak-please.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"JACKIE MASON and Raoul Felder. Who cares about the food, or the service, at Ben & Jack's Steak House when a nightly cast of New York City characters straight out of ""Broadway Danny Rose"" occupies center stage? Woody Allen, of course, sits in the back room, where the spotlight shines not on the guests but on a life-size golden bull. Or is it a fatted calf? In fact, who needs Peter Luger when several of its former waiters and a grill cook, following in the footsteps of those who went to Wolfgang's, have decamped to this latest attempt to imitate that legendary steakhouse in Brooklyn? It's unfortunate that the food at Ben & Jack's strives to mimic Peter Luger's, rather than to aim higher. The prices for steak are within a nickel of each other: $36.95 at Ben & Jack's in Manhattan, $36.90 in Brooklyn. The question is whether either one is worth it. And at Ben & Jack's, when the service is off, the answer is definitely no. On my visits the service was generally very pleasant (if absent-minded) -- especially the night when two guests at my table fell into the category of boldface names -- although it could be rock-bottom insulting. For example, the night of the ""almost three hour dinner from hell,"" when it helped to pass the time speculating on what Mr. Felder, the celebrity divorce lawyer, who observes kosher dietary laws, was going to eat in a nonkosher steakhouse. (Salmon and spinach.) Still, it was annoying to wait 30 minutes for a waiter to take the drink order. We were further riveted by Mr. Felder's pal Mr. Mason, with his pale-orange coif touched by hints of pink, snacking on the bottled ""salad dressing"" (another Luger derivative) and proclaiming it ""delicious, delicious."" But celebrity-watching barely kept our minds off the 60 additional minutes it took for the first course to arrive. We were not alone: patrons at several tables around us (Felder-Mason excluded) kept looking from their watches to the empty spaces where their plates should have been. Finally someone at my table practically tripped our waiter to inquire about our long-lost meal. ""We have a lot of private parties, and they have to be served first,"" was his brutally honest reply. He was not just harried; he was insulting. And who can forget the sight of the maître d'hôtel -- or was he an owner? -- chewing gum while pacing the dining room. The food at Ben & Jack's is equally uneven, though the onion rolls, described by one guest as ""very Brooklyn,"" are just like the famous ones at the mother ship. One night some slices of a porterhouse were tough, but on two other visits, all were tender, juicy and full of flavor: what you always hope a steak will be, but seldom is. Then on a fourth visit the steak was slightly chewy and not very beefy in flavor. Filet mignon, though cooked to death at the diner's request, was still tender. Another evening, a medium-rare fillet was also tender, with flavor as good as that cut of meat can have. But it was dry. A rib-eye steak was tender but flavorless; lamb chops were not memorable. In both cases the meat was not much different from what I had recently sampled on a visit to Luger. In keeping with the expected over-the-top steakhouse experience, there was far too much of everything. But it's hard to come to grips with the practice of pouring sizzling butter over a grilled steak. Is it to add flavor to flavorless meat? To make dry meat juicy? Or simply wretched excess? Weighing in at four pounds, the lobster was rubbery and tasteless from stem to stern. Most of the meat ended up in a doggie bag, in hopes that it would make a decent lobster salad. The lobster cocktail fared no better. But the crab meat cocktail was deliciously sweet. That sort of inconsistency plagued the rest of the menu. There was perfectly cooked tuna one night: nicely grilled outside, rare inside. On another evening the Chilean sea bass was inedible, and the shrimp were overcooked. One night the oysters were tasteless; on two other visits they were briny and sweet. There was a nice Caesar salad, but at the height of tomato season where was the restaurant buying such hard, not-very-red tomatoes for its mozzarella salad? The best thing about the Ben & Jack's salad for two was the crispy bacon. The waiter forgot the blue cheese dressing. ""O.K., I'll owe you nice desserts,"" he said, but only two arrived for our party of four. Without additional plates. No loss there: the desserts don't rise about coffee-shop level. But like everything else they are big and sweet and are served with the same bizarre bowl of schlag (whipped cream) Luger serves. It is designed to improve any dessert, and it would, if only it tasted as if it came from a cow (the restaurant assured me it did) and had some flavor beyond sweet. But I still haven't figured out what kind of stabilizer they use to keep the cream so firm. The recommended salad dressing that Mr. Mason was eating with such gusto falls somewhere between cocktail sauce and the red sauce you get at a bad Chinese restaurant. The wines are certainly better than Luger's. There are plenty of decent choices between $40 and $60. The quality of the food and of the service in this 10-week-old restaurant matches its mishmash décor: an 1890's saloon here, a 1920's speakeasy there. Over all it's a 1940's steakhouse, with etched glass on the private dining room dividers, red and cream patterned carpeting and floral upholstered chairs. Maybe it's that décor, a far cry from Luger's down-market look, that is attracting such a wide range of diners, among them deeply tanned hipsters in pinkie rings and turtlenecks, and preppies in crew necks over T-shirts and jeans. For Manhattanites who love the idea of a Luger-style steakhouse but think they might as well go to Bhutan if they have to cross a body of water, Ben & Jack's has two advantages over the Brooklyn original: the seats are more comfortable, and you don't have to cross any bridges. Besides, where else can you see Bruce Cutler, the high-profile criminal lawyer who defended John J. Gotti, sitting alone? But if you want to go, choose a night when the restaurant isn't busy. Or take along your connected friends. Reviews by Frank Bruni, who is on vacation, will resume on Oct. 26. Ben & Jack's Steak House  * [Rating: One Star] 219 East 44th Street, Midtown; (212)682-5678.

417,Oriental Garden,2 star,"Sept. 21, 2005",Frank Bruni,Chinatown,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/21/dining/reviews/tradition-two-ways-plain-or-fancy.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/21/dining/reviews/tradition-two-ways-plain-or-fancy.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IF you want to make the acquaintance of your dinner just before you ingest it, Oriental Garden is your place. In stacks of tanks flanking the entrance of this Chinatown mainstay, crabs crawl, sea bass swim and clams loll about, for want of an even less kinetic verb. But the presentation winds up seeming less theatrical than practical, less like an aquarium of incipient deliciousness than an unadorned aquatic larder, even a floating gallows. The tanks are drearily overcrowded and the room beyond them distressingly over-bright. Uptown, at the new restaurant Mainland, what draws your eye almost immediately after you walk through the door are picturesque bundles of firewood and, above them, a glass-fronted oven in which whole ducks are cooked. This display is all about appetite-whetting beauty. The birds glisten like amber jewels, and the setting for their consumption includes soft lighting, spacious semicircular booths and the kind of lounge music that seems designed to induce a trance. You can wash your duck down with specially named cocktails like the Yangtze Sigh. You can follow it up with a white chocolate macadamia pot du crème. In New York over recent years, Chinese has been trading up, ditching its often matter-of-fact trappings and trying to grab some of the glamour hogged by other cuisines. Mainland follows in the stylish footsteps of 66, Xing and Yumcha, all of which seek to readjust expectations about restaurants that label themselves Chinese. But when the lights are dimmed, the prices are raised and the beef in a main course of beef and broccoli is aged sirloin, with the broccoli to the side, does the pleasure increase? Are a shinier gloss and sometimes better cuts of meat harbingers of a better experience? It depends in large part on your mood. But it depends just as much on how well the dishes are prepared, how wisely that gloss is applied and whether the whole experience comes together in a way that feels special and satisfying. It hinges on judgment, not authenticity. On execution, not airs. Mainland aims high, starting with its Peking duck, which uses the birds from that oven. The chef, Brian Young, whose ancestry is Chinese, follows a fastidious process for making sure the external layers of skin and fat are as respectively crisp and luscious as possible. It takes more than a day and includes ladling a boiling liquid onto the birds and having fans blow air over them before they enter the oven, where they hang on hooks over a combination of cherry, apple and peach wood. The ducks are then wheeled out on a cart, carved tableside and served with steamed pancakes and plum sauce. On one visit the pancakes were soggy, but the duck impressive. Another time every facet of the dish was spot-on. Mainland takes multiple tacks in gussying up Chinese. It serves classic dishes, like that Peking duck or Cantonese-style lobster over crispy noodles, which are simply being given a more elaborately decorated theater than they usually receive. It does upscale riffs on downscale delivery staples, like that beef and broccoli, which came with an incongruous but excellent stack of Vidalia onion rings. It takes staples of New York restaurants of various ethnicities -- raw fish appetizers, short ribs, rack of lamb -- and brings Chinese or at least Asian vegetables, sauces and spices into play. The restaurant's pot stickers, dumplings and spring rolls were almost always respectable and sometimes better, one of the standouts being the lamb spring rolls, which had an internal richness that the external crunchiness brought into relief. At Mainland, however, not all proteins are created equal. Duck got its due, both when roasted whole and when stir-fried with Chinese sausage, pine nuts, shiitake mushrooms and dried sour cherries. This amalgam was served with, and meant to be wrapped in, leaves of bibb lettuce. But prawns and shrimps of all sizes and in all kinds of dishes, including the fried rice, emerged undercooked, overcooked or just plain flavorless, as if there were a shrimp pox on the house. A corn soup with asparagus and crab was sludgy beyond belief one visit and cloying the next, the only link between the experiences being the faintness of the crab's presence. Beyond the inconsistencies there were, in Mainland's putative attempt to do something new, too many bows to the familiar: those raw fish appetizers, one with jalapeño and another with sesame; miso-glazed black cod; foie gras; even the music. Entering the series of hyperdecorated dining rooms means walking down several sets of stairs, passing that lovely oven and moving ever farther from any natural light. The effect can become crypt-like. And something about the service was always off-kilter. An intrusive waiter wouldn't stop jabbering. Another server knocked a bottle of water to the floor, where its contents lapped over one of my shoes. He neither offered a replacement nor took the charge off the bill. An almost inaudible apology was all he mustered. The service at Oriental Garden can certainly be brusque, and more than a few of the restaurant's selections flop -- or, in the case of drunken prawns, flail. You have to assure your server that you want this dish, which entailed the following: The server plucked prawns from a tank, put them in a glass bowl on the table and poured rice wine over them, at which point they convulsed so violently that the wine sprayed a friend and me in the face, even though the bowl had been covered. ""It's an appetizer and a shower,"" the friend said. When the prawns stopped moving, the alcohol was set ablaze. The end result: prawns that tasted, sure enough, like prawns drowned in alcohol. It didn't seem worth it, for us or them. But the blunt spectacle to some extent defined Oriental Garden, which isn't about pretty pageantry, enchanting music (I didn't detect any) or trends, as the matter-of-fact exhibition of those tanks also makes clear. Oriental Garden is about extremely fresh food -- fish in particular -- and a kind of no-nonsense preparation that defers to, and underscores, that freshness. Cantonese in inclination, Oriental Garden opened two decades ago and has repeatedly been renovated, but the golden dragons on its walls and mauve cloths on its tables don't make much of a statement. Many of its dishes, however, do, and they support the estimation of some Chinese-Americans and food lovers that this is the best of Chinatown's seafood restaurants. Don't look too long at the menu, which is too long to look at. Engage the servers and eyeball the tanks, and if there's geoduck clam, get that. The restaurant will slice its long neck in the manner of sashimi and then -- a phenomenal treat -- fry its belly. Order salt-and-pepper prawns, slightly sweet and not remotely greasy. If the restaurant's selection of whole fish includes sea bass, and the sea bass seems to be swimming with ample vigor, ask for that as well. The kitchen will do little more than steam it briefly with soy sauce, scallions and ginger, an approach that yielded wonderful, custard-like flesh. The kitchen will put black bean sauce on a bevy of fresh razor clams. That was all they wanted or needed. There were additional, unexpected treats at Oriental Garden, including the spicy ""Ma Pau"" tofu with minced pork. Pan-fried noodles with assorted seafood didn't just have the fabled breath of the wok. They had the deep-lunged, full-throated sigh of the wok. Although the restaurant is not as well known for dim sum as for dinner, I went one Sunday morning, randomly accepted items from the passing trays and ate marvelously. There were also disappointments, like crispy chicken with dry meat and rubbery, tasteless steamed scallops in XO sauce. OrientalGarden serves scads of diners at an often brisk clip, and the cooking sometimes reflects that. But it's divorced from trends, devoted to simplicity and in those ways actually more memorable -- and even more distinctive -- than the cooking at many glitzy Asian newcomers, be they Japanese, Thai or Chinese. In promising to coddle and sometimes even dazzle you, those newcomers set a bar for themselves that they sometimes can't reach. In promising to sate you, Oriental Garden hits its mark.

418,Perry St.,3 star,"Sept. 7, 2005",Frank Bruni,West Village,"Asian, French",https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/07/dining/reviews/showmanship-yields-to-elegance.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/07/dining/reviews/showmanship-yields-to-elegance.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"SOMETIMES the best way to move forward is to revisit the past. Sometimes the loudest statements are the quietest ones, made without undue fuss, in precise gestures. At his new restaurant, Perry St., Jean-Georges Vongerichten circles back, shuts up and cooks, electing earnestness over irony, controlled flourishes over cluttered frippery. In doing so he gives fresh currency to his stature as one of the most talented chefs at work in this country. He also gives his doubters, who had grown legion, reason to believe. For all his accolades and wealth, Mr. Vongerichten at this moment has something to prove, and Perry St. is more than just another potentially lucrative application of the Jean-Georges brand. It's a studied retreat from, and maybe even an act of amends for, the high-concept flamboyance of 66, Spice Market and V Steakhouse, the New York restaurants he opened between 2002 and 2004. All three have their significant merits and pleasures -- or at least the first two of them do -- but they rely as heavily on the novelty of their overarching conceits (Chinese goes sexy, the steakhouse does sarcasm) as they do on what happens in the kitchen. It was Jean-Georges the high-wire entrepreneur more than Jean-Georges the culinary genius who sired them. They have vacuous showmanship in their DNA. Perry St. doesn't. This one is from the heart, not the head. And while it is undeniably flawed and surprisingly inconsistent, it's cause for celebration, chiefly because it marks Mr. Vongerichten's return to the straightforwardness of Jo Jo, which he opened in 1991, and of his flagship, Jean Georges, which came along in 1997. Not since then has he produced a New York restaurant as tidily reflective of his culinary strengths and sensibility as Perry St. The expertly orchestrated interplay of flavors and yin-yang balance of effects in many of the dishes here are classic Jean-Georges, as are the clarity and lightness of his sauces and broths, which cast the stocks of previous eras as lumbering dinosaurs. For much of the summer the restaurant served as an amuse-bouche a version of gazpacho made with raspberry, cucumber, red and orange bell pepper, ginger, red wine vinegar and olive oil, discrete beads of which floated like a shiny archipelago on a ruby sea. The sweetness of the fruit set the stage for, then ceded it to, the sourness and gentle heat of other players, which arrived as a second wave, a delayed epiphany. The transition and contrast were transfixing. Mr. Vongerichten has mastered what might be called time-release gastronomy. An appetizer salad of frisée, goat cheese and pickled peach nailed a sweet heat that traveled a path similar to the gazpacho's: a cool front followed by a spike in the temperature, this time courtesy of crystallized wasabi. But sometimes a single sensation slowly intensified. An appetizer of bluefin tuna in a fried crust of Japanese rice crackers came with a salmon-colored, scallion-studded mayonnaise flavored with dashi, sriracha and various citrus juices. The controlled fire sparked by the scallions and sriracha blazed stronger in the middle of each bite than at the beginning and stronger still at the end. But it never singed. Roasted chicken rested in a broth made from chicken wings smoked with hickory, mesquite and cherry wood. The smokiness of that potion expanded with -- and even within -- each bite, and was cleverly offset by sweet kernels of fresh corn. The restaurant's ambience is as pruned of needless embellishment as the food. Perry St. has been decorated in a sleek contemporary vein and a subdued palette of white, beiges and grays, neither of which competes with the charmed setting. Located on the ground floor of one of the new West Village high-rises designed by Richard Meier, the restaurant has views of the Hudson River, the joggers and cyclists on its edge and, at dusk, the setting sun. Imagine some palm trees in the foreground and this could be coastal California. It feels that fixed on a watery horizon, that luminous and laid back. It also feels easy and easygoing, and in that sense represents another considered attempt, in these less formal times, to preserve the core pleasures of fine dining while jettisoning much of the ceremony and some of the expense. So there is ample elbow room and attentive service but only one type of bread and butter at the beginning, only a token cluster of petit fours at the end, and -- an informality too far -- brown paper place mats on the tables. It takes little time to peruse the concise wine list and almost none to absorb the menu: eight appetizers, eight entrees and five desserts. Given the winnowed options, there are too many disappointing dishes. An heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad was beautiful to behold but merely pleasant to eat. Steamed black bass was dressed in a basil vinaigrette so tart it suggested some kind of accident behind the scenes. So I tried this entree again on a subsequent night: still too tart, though appreciably less so. Other dishes also varied from visit to visit, the ginger vinaigrette on poached lobster proving sweeter one time than another, the dill broth around a gorgeous crop of summer vegetables proving sharper. Although Mr. Vongerichten's condominium apartment is just upstairs on the seventh floor and he has been spending much of his time in the kitchen here, it could use more discipline. But when Perry St. scores, it scores much, much bigger than most restaurants, and it scores on Mr. Vongerichten's instinct for flavor and texture combinations, his usually keen sense of equilibrium and of course his recruitment of traditions and ingredients from Asia, which seduced him before others. He tempts yawns by including grilled beef tenderloin among the entrees, but then sends it to the table with an onion jam and a sour cherry mustard that was like a less zingy horseradish sauce, a less cloying steak sauce. It was just right. In dish after dish, he let crunchiness frame succulence or thrust creaminess into relief. It happened with that tuna appetizer and with an appetizer of red snapper sashimi, the soft petals of fish hooded with strands of deep-fried snapper skin, fleur de sel, Thai chili pepper and lemon, which served as a counterpoint to a pool of olive oil below the fish. It happened as well with my favorite of the desserts, a bowl of chocolate pudding distinguished by a cover of crystallized violet and a pedestal of chocolate sponge cake. Johnny Iuzzini, the pastry chef at Jean Georges, shares credit with Mr. Vongerichten for the last act of a meal at Perry St., a finish that was usually happy and never histrionic, much like everything that preceded and surrounded it. Mr. Vongerichten has chosen a new tower of spare elegance in which to settle down -- in more ways than one. He's back from the carnival. It's a welcome homecoming.

419,La Esquina,1 star,"Aug. 31, 2005",Frank Bruni,SoHo,Mexican,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/31/dining/reviews/a-secret-too-dark-to-keep.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/31/dining/reviews/a-secret-too-dark-to-keep.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"MY friend reached our table in the dungeonlike hideaway of La Esquina's main dining room about 25 minutes late. Only 15 of those were her fault. A few of the additional 10 had to do with her understandable difficulty believing my instructions that the street-level portal was the one marked ""No Admittance."" The rest of the minutes had to do with the hostess she encountered when she hesitantly approached that door. The hostess claimed not to have any record of our reservation. ""She wouldn't let the guy ahead of me in either,"" my friend reported. ""We both stood there pleading."" Finally, my friend said, a manager intervened, recognizing her as the straggler in a group already seated and green-lighting her chutes-and-ladders passage down a harshly lighted staircase, along a corridor with kitchen supplies, through the kitchen itself, and into the contrived darkness of the vault where we waited. I asked her if she was miffed. She gave me the derisive, pitying look that a sane person gives a lunatic. ""The harder it is to get in, the more fun it is to be in,"" she said, articulating a maxim of Manhattan night life and a guiding principle of La Esquina, which is sort of like Studio 54 with chipotle instead of cocaine. ""I'm already in love with this place."" Over time La Esquina, which serves pared-down, priced-up Mexican food, will rise or fall on the merits of its chorizo quesadilla, chiles rellenos, pulled-pork taquito and grilled whole red snapper. But for now the buzz that whirls around it, the stampede of diners toward it and the significant pleasures it delivers boil down to its air of cunningly manufactured mystery, its speakeasy-channeling pantomime of illicit, exclusive pleasure. The unveiling of La Esquina belongs in a textbook for public relations and marketing executives. The subterranean chamber opened in mid-July without a listed phone number or a clearly marked entrance. The aforementioned portal is inside a taqueria that says ""Corner Deli"" -- La Esquina means ""the corner"" -- and bears, in addition to the words ""No Admittance,"" the words ""Employees Only."" Those are bogus caveats in a benign conspiracy that, early on, fueled insidery Internet chatter about this enigmatic taco belle with its unspoken identity and undisclosed location. On one Web site, clues to La Esquina's whereabouts included an anagram of its name. The look of the underground bar area and dining room dovetails with the furtive shtick. Within weathered brick walls are wrought-iron gates that recall the bars of an ancient prison cell, chandeliers that hold fat wax candles and murals made with tiles painted in Mexico. If the Phantom of the Opera hired Zorro as an interior designer and asked him for something in contemporary Torquemada, this might be the result. The adjacent kitchen produces food not only for this netherworld hacienda but also for an attractive street-level cafe with an entrance around the corner. It operates under the same ownership and is clearly marked La Esquina. I visited the cafe as well as the vault. What I ate in both places was always serviceable, sometimes distinguished and less frequently exemplary. As invested as it is in its pose, La Esquina also cares about its ceviches, soups, tostadas, salads and main courses, including chipotle-glazed shrimp, spit-roasted chicken and steamed mussels. It uses discernibly fresher herbs, vegetables and other ingredients than many other Mexican restaurants, and it doesn't resort to easy cheats: oceans of salsa, tides of sour cream, eddies of guacamole. Its kitchen exerts a lighter touch, exemplified by the very fine corn tortillas for its taquitos and the equally fine flour tortillas for its quesadillas. But its kitchen, supervised by Richard Ampudia, who also runs Café Habana, and Jim McDuffee, doesn't always cook with care or verve. Chicken and steak taquitos had stringy meat. Shrimp tostadas were excessively salty. A side of black beans was a watery wasteland. That spit-roasted chicken was overdone and the carne asada -- grilled sirloin with a chimichurri-style sauce of parsley, cilantro, jalapeño and more -- was dull. But there are enough highlights to create the possibility of a charmed meal from start to finish. Begin with the chorizo quesadilla, followed by a tostada with lump crab meat and avocado in a chipotle mayonnaise. Move on to a main course of baby back ribs rubbed with chili pepper, star anise and cinnamon, among other ingredients, then cooked in a vacuum pouch before receiving a chipotle and guava glaze during a climactic grilling. This process yielded luscious results. Make sure to try sides of grilled corn and of ""gratin de rajas,"" which combines roasted poblano peppers with Yukon gold potatoes and Manchego and Cotija cheeses. It was terrific, as was a sandwich of roasted chicken, avocado and chipotle mayonnaise that was available in the cafe but not below. The menus are slightly different. So are the moods. The underworld has more attitude and courts more chaos, to the point of being off-putting at times. On some visits, I felt rushed by servers whose outward affability concealed a furious determination to liberate tables for the welling crowd at the bar. But those servers demonstrated considerable knowledge about, and enthusiasm for, La Esquina's spectacular selection of about 100 tequilas. After a shot or two, the smartly chosen music -- Nina Simone, Soul II Soul, Nouvelle Vague -- seems to swell louder, but not so loud that eavesdropping becomes impossible. My tardy friend overheard several young women ask a waiter if the vault could be breached without a reservation. He told them that they were probably attractive enough to manage it, but that there were no guarantees. I bet that the hedged forecast thrilled them, and that they circled back nights later to join a crowd hungry for more than fried plantains and cactus salad.

420,Spigolo,2 star,"Aug. 24, 2005",Frank Bruni,Upper East Side,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/24/dining/reviews/italian-almost-home-cooked.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/24/dining/reviews/italian-almost-home-cooked.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THERE are many reasons to envy New York restaurant chefs these days, from the kitchen gadgetry at their disposal to their likelihood of receiving major publishing contracts. I for one covet their commutes. To arrive at his new restaurant, Perry St., in the West Village, Jean-Georges Vongerichten takes neither subway nor bus, taxi nor limousine. He travels via elevator, from the seventh floor of the condominium building in which he lives to the first. Daniel Boulud can use the stairs: his apartment is just one floor up from his flagship restaurant, Daniel, on the Upper East Side. And so can Scott and Heather Fratangelo, who live smack above their restaurant, Spigolo, also on the Upper East Side. For the Fratangelos, deciding how to get to work simply means choosing a pair of shoes. They can match their mode of transportation to the rest of their outfits. This arrangement doesn't allow them much of a sense of separation between home and work. But it lets the Fratangelos, both 30 years old, dote on and fret over Spigolo, which has only about 25 seats and a half dozen bar stools. Both the degree and nature of their attentiveness show. Spigolo, which serves unpretentious Italian food in an uncontrived setting, feels unusually honest and earnest. And it feels that way from the moment you walk through the door. ""Oh, yes, hello!"" said Heather Fratangelo, who plays the role of hostess as well as pastry chef, on a warm Sunday evening in early July, when the loss of neighborhood residents to distant beaches was still evident on the becalmed sidewalks and streets. Her exuberant manner of greeting me had nothing to do with desperation -- despite the weekend exodus, Spigolo was full -- and the tone of familiarity in her voice suggested we had met many times before. We had in fact met only once, and that was 10 minutes earlier, when I had glanced briefly into the restaurant to see if my guests were there. But in Spigolo's intensely hospitable world, that glance was enough to make me a veritable regular, and a summery lavender outfit worn by one of my guests, who trailed after me, was enough to prompt additional endearments. ""That's such a pretty dress,"" Ms. Fratangelo said. If she didn't really mean it, Cherry Jones better watch out. There's an even better actress in town. While Ms. Fratangelo supervises the dining room, Mr. Fratangelo minds the kitchen, and does so with a similar grace and confidence. Although he is young and Spigolo is his first chance to run his own show, he doesn't make the mistakes of flamboyant inventiveness and annoyingly cheeky conceits. The menu follows an instantly recognizable contemporary Italian layout: salumi and uncooked seafood in the prologue, followed by separate chapters of appetizers, pasta dishes and main courses, and then of course dessert, which is when his wife's hugely pleasing culinary efforts come into play. It's possible to take an unpersuasive journey through this narrative, because Spigolo's dishes aren't uniformly terrific. I recall an excessively sauced saltimbocca-like breast of veal, a somewhat dry red snapper, and a loin of lamb sliced into such thin ribbons that it surrendered much of its meaty appeal, becoming something daintier and droopier in the process. I remember an insufficiently thick risotto that came close to impersonating soup (and not even bisque at that). But more -- many more -- of my memories of Spigolo are extremely fond ones. Mr. Fratangelo excels at seafood and has put a grill in his kitchen that enables him to cook it over charcoal, which puts a distinctive stamp on it. During my visits, the terrific results included appetizers of plump jumbo shrimp and of tiny baby octopuses, the latter rendered especially pliant and zesty by a pregrill braising in white wine and chili peppers and a subsequent bath in preserved lemons, lemon juice and olive oil. Also grilled and also first-rate was a fairly straightforward salmon fillet, which was given robust accompaniment: charred corn, a mixture of oyster and shiitake mushrooms, and pea shoots. Mr. Fratangelo tends to cover his plates with many vegetables and herbs in different colors and shapes. These supporting players are at once pedestals, skirts and side dishes, and he doesn't mold them into geometric wonders, because his purpose isn't showmanship. What he's clearly after is a sense of bounty and a bevy of familiar, comforting flavors. And he achieved precisely that with a main course of pan-roasted wild striped bass. The fish was just about as succulent and satisfying as it could be, and had a contrasting layer of crisp skin atop it. Below and around it were tomatoes, eggplant, red onion, brined capers, olives, pine nuts and more: a caponata that brought the Mediterranean sharply to mind. Mr. Fratangelo also has a few terrific pasta dishes up his sleeve. He makes his own fettuccine, adding lemon zest to the dough, and serves it in a bracing pesto that blends arugula with basil but edits out nuts and cheese. He doesn't make his own garganelli, but no matter: the noodles he buys are combined with a sweet fennel sausage ragù and Parmesan cheese to delightful effect. Given all these options, it would be easy for a diner to fill up before dessert. It would also be foolish. While none of Ms. Fratangelo's creations were blazingly original, almost all were irresistible, including a caramel affogato with sugary doughnuts and a mixed berry cobbler with vanilla gelato. Spigolo means ""edge"" or ""corner,"" and the corner-lot theater for this feast seems, at first glance, just about perfect: exposed brick walls that create a rustic aura, handsome glass doors that let in streams of light. But the hard surfaces translate into the kind of earsplitting noise you usually associate with a bigger, slicker, less intimate restaurant. The Fratangelos have hired an acoustic consultant to help them find a solution to this problem, which could easily deter diners and possibly annoy the neighbors. Lucky for the Fratangelos, they needn't worry about complaints from the apartment closest to Spigolo. If the restaurant is at full tilt, that residence is empty. Spigolo  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  1561 Second Avenue (81st Street); (212)744-1100. ATMOSPHERE -- About 25 seats in an intimate room with glass doors, exposed brick, a copper-colored ceiling and a feeling of polished rusticity.  SOUND LEVEL -- Extremely noisy.

421,Taboon,2 star,"Aug. 10, 2005",Frank Bruni,Clinton,"Mediterranean, Middle Eastern",https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/10/dining/reviews/of-wood-floors-and-a-woodfired-oven.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/10/dining/reviews/of-wood-floors-and-a-woodfired-oven.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE restaurant Taboon was built from the ground up in a peculiar and particular sense. Its back story is a tale of love and parquet. Its owners, Danny Hodak and Gadi Ruham, run a successful New York City wood flooring business, and over the years their list of prominent clients grew to include many restaurants and restaurateurs. They installed or maintained the floors at Mesa Grill. At Gotham Bar and Grill. At the home of its chef, Alfred Portale. Perhaps inevitably, Mr. Hodak and Mr. Ruham found themselves intrigued by the people whose work they so literally supported. Romance turned that interest into action. In the late 1990's, Mr. Hodak traveled to Tel Aviv and met an Israeli woman, who later moved to New York and married him. Her brother-in-law, Haim Cohen, is a celebrity chef in Israel. Using Mr. Cohen's counsel on a menu and a cook from one of his restaurants, Mr. Hodak and Mr. Ruham opened Taboon a year and half ago. Of the infinite ways that restaurants spring into being, Taboon's is surely among the more unusual, and I probably wouldn't find it charming if the result had been a bust. But Taboon puts a deft, sophisticated spin on Middle Eastern food, and it's better on the far side of its first anniversary than it was at the start. I visited it back then, and I recall loving the restaurant's bread, a kind of halfway point between focaccia and pizza, rubbed with olive oil and sprinkled with rosemary and sage. I recall liking the restaurant's ambience. Its corner lot in a relatively tranquil patch of Clinton means two walls of windows and an airy, open, lulling feel, which is accentuated by cinched white curtains, white brick and white tables. But the quality of the food was erratic, and the sluggish service left more than a bit to be desired. I gave Taboon another try about a month and a half ago and had a very different experience. Just about every dish was superb, beginning with an appetizer of falafel: four sublimely seasoned balls, crunchy on the outside but not at all dry within. Each had a sort of orange squib atop it, a surprising and welcome engine for a hint of tartness and a rumor of sweetness. It was pickled mango, and it illustrated Taboon's habit of inventively and smartly tweaking Middle Eastern staples. On that visit we also had Taboon's terrific oversize lamb kebabs, which are really more like quenelle-shaped hamburgers. They are made from ground lamb, parsley and pistachio nuts and drizzled with an extraordinary tahini sauce that Mr. Hodak told me he imports from a vendor in Nablus in the West Bank. We had Taboon's remarkably moist halibut, plump wedges of which were submerged in a robust ragout of tomato, red pepper, paprika, harissa and cumin. And we had efficient, even ebullient, service from a waiter who was clearly as excited about promoting Taboon's food as we were about eating it. The quality of Taboon's service fluctuated over subsequent visits, including one night when servers circled back to our table so infrequently and did such a heroic job of avoiding eye contact with us that we had to plead loudly for their attention, which even then wasn't guaranteed. But except for a smattering of disappointments (a rubbery octopus appetizer, a boring branzino entree, run-of-the-mill short ribs) and a lackluster roster of desserts, Taboon's food remained impressive, and no meal was without its formidable pleasures. One of these was Taboon's hummus, which carries an extra, unexpected jolt: jalapeño. The seared zucchini cakes, made with feta and Parmesan cheeses and fresh mint, were another. The hummus and zucchini cakes may be the best meze, or appetizers, although a case can be made for the kube: fried pockets of bulgur wheat filled with ground skirt steak, onion and pine nuts, among other ingredients. Possibly the best main course is a half chicken, the leg of which is deboned and filled with cured lemon. The meat is then arranged around portobello mushrooms and a pool of kale-flavored polenta, and it was succulent enough the two times I tried it to suggest that poultry should never be cooked in any vessel that doesn't burn wood and isn't walled with brick. At Taboon, it's all about that oven. The restaurant's name is an Arabic word for oven. The restaurant is laid out so that the special oven, mammoth and domed, with a coat of white concrete over the bricks, snatches your gaze and demands your attention the moment you walk through the door. Like the chicken and halibut, almost every hot dish spends at least some time in this hive-like chamber, which imparts a faintly woodsy, smoky quality to its charges and perfumes the air. It's the Kathleen Turner of cooking implements: a fiery diva at center stage. And Efi Nahon, the chef whom Mr. Cohen trained back in Tel Aviv, knows how to coax an expert performance from it. His efforts are complemented by a relatively concise but interesting wine list, which adequately and affordably represents not only the most prolific countries (France, Italy) but also less heralded ones (Greece, Israel). The selections of wine by the glass change frequently, an example of a general courteousness at Taboon that transcends the unpredictable service. The milk for coffee arrived heated. Smokers are given an area out front with a bench, several chairs, potted plants and a proper ashtray. Mr. Hodak still holds on to his other venture, Norwegian Wood, which he said recently worked on Jean-Georges Vongerichten's new condominium on Perry Street. Mr. Hodak and Mr. Ruham are decidedly less practiced restaurateurs than he, and Mr. Hodak said in our telephone conversation that he made many mistakes over Taboon's first year. But, he said, he got one detail absolutely right. ""I put in a stone floor,"" he said, later adding: ""My business is maintaining wood floors. I know the hell involved.""

422,Barbès,1 star,"July 6, 2005",Frank Bruni,Midtown South,"French, Moroccan",https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/dining/reviews/at-the-intersection-of-france-and-morocco.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/06/dining/reviews/at-the-intersection-of-france-and-morocco.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"RICE runs rampant. Always has. It does a pantomime of subservience, deferring to the sliver of hamachi astride it or the lobster tail and chorizo in its saffron embrace. But playing humble is easy once you've already insinuated your way into so many dishes and cuisines. And pasta? An unsinkable showboat. Few carbohydrates could have triumphed so handily over Atkins and South Beach. But pasta thrives, insistent and ineluctable, like Paris Hilton. Couscous, on the other hand, needs lessons in self-assertion, a better publicist, maybe even its own reality show on Fox. There's no reason it should occupy such an underexposed niche among starchy, grain-based canvases for meat, fish and vegetables, no reason it should be so peripheral a side dish. It's fluffy and flexible. And it's all over the menu at Barbès, a Moroccan-French restaurant that attracts notice for that reason among others. Barbès is situated in -- well, it's not easy to say. Although it is in the middle of Manhattan, it doesn't really feel like a part of any distinct precinct, and a diner could spend part of his or her time here playing name that neighborhood. Empire State Building Mews? Herald Square Glens? Western Murray Hill is perhaps the technical answer, but Barbès really exists in a generic, low-energy limbo, which may partly explain why it takes its name from a section of another city. Barbès refers to a heavily Moroccan area of Paris. Morocco and France of course have a long, fraught history, and the arrangement between their cuisines at Barbès is less a matter of fusion than of time sharing. On the dinner menu, one tradition gets two or three lines of the appetizer or entree section, then the other gets a line or two. And so it goes, as a satisfying duck confit salad makes way for an excellent skewer of lamb with harissa and a respectable steak frites with green peppercorn sauce cedes the stage to the ""couscous royale,"" a hugely appealing and generously portioned platform for chunks of lamb, chicken and merguez sausage. The Moroccan dishes aren't necessarily the better ones -- the food at Barbès is maddeningly uneven -- but they're the most interesting, because they're the least commonplace. While the American and European romance with Morocco is a robust one, illustrated by the instantly resonant names of so many of the cities (Casablanca, Tangier, Marrakesh) under that sheltering sky, Moroccan cuisine doesn't claim much real estate in New York. Its meat of choice is lamb, sometimes served as a tagine, which refers both to the high-hooded earthenware vessel in which it's slowly cooked and to the resulting stew. Its go-to seasonings include cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, saffron, ginger and paprika, all of which recur in dishes at Barbès. The restaurant's chef and co-owner, Abdellah Ksiyer, is Moroccan. He opened Barbès early last year with Omar Balouma, who is Algerian and operates a Moroccan party-planning business called Omar the Tent Man. That name suggests a tendency toward shtick that, blessedly, doesn't get a thorough workout at Barbès. It keeps the midnight-at-the-oasis motifs to a minimum. The simple, square, 50-seat room has a medium-size palm tree in the middle, marbled orange walls and interesting, triple-tiered Moroccan fixtures that hang from a wood-beam ceiling. Barbès could otherwise be mistaken for any old bistro, and some of its food has the straightforward appeal of bistro fare. Both that skewer of grilled lamb and a skewer of grilled chicken boasted tender meat redolent of the vegetables, herbs and spices in which it had been marinated: red onions, shallots, cumin and saffron for the lamb; saffron, powdered ginger and coriander seed for the chicken. The skewers were accompanied by a profusion of springy, lightly dressed greens, which exemplified the restaurant's welcome habit of buttressing the main features of its dishes with fresh, unsullied produce. Arguably the best appetizer is a salad sampler that showcases the restaurant's hummus, which has the magically light texture of whipped cream, and its zaalouk, a divinely smoky mash of eggplant, tomato, cumin, paprika and lemon juice. Sadly, the triangles of pita for the hummus verged on stale. The most adventurous appetizer and entree are similar dishes in different sizes and shapes: small triangles, dubbed briouats, in the first case; a large brick, dubbed a pistilla, in the second. Both encase chicken, caramelized onions, egg and an array of Moroccan seasonings in shells of thin pastry, which are then dusted with powdered sugar and cinnamon. This confluence of savory and sweet puts a much greater, more arresting emphasis on sweet than a diner typically encounters before dessert. It warrants a try. The tagines -- lamb, chicken or fish, the type of which changes regularly -- arrive in majestic pots, and the theater trumped the eating. The lamb, served with prunes, was leathery. The chicken had a faint, under-seasoned flavor, like run-of-the-mill, therapeutic chicken soup. ""I suppose it would be good if you had a Moroccan cold,"" quipped a companion. A crab cake appetizer wouldn't be good under any circumstances, so paltry was the discernible presence of crab, as if it weren't an ingredient in the construction of the cake so much as a vaguely crustaceous thought in the mind of the person constructing it. Desserts skewed French -- chocolate mousse, crème brûlée -- and tasted pro forma. But the couscous was good in all circumstances. Couscous is steamed granular semolina, airy and sandy, with a mouth-feel all its own. Barbès alternately gussied it up with raisins and placed petals of chicken breast atop it in the ""couscous au poulet""; laced it with basil and skirted it with diced tomatoes as an accompaniment for grilled shrimp; and seasoned it with ginger, paprika and a touch of cumin in that busy ""royale."" Mr. Ksiyer apparently steams his couscous four times, an elaborate process with a pillowy payoff. In his worshipful hands, couscous could rattle rice's hegemony. It could even put linguine on the defensive. Barbès  * [Rating: One Star]  21 East 36th Street, Murray Hill; (212)684-0215.

423,The Red Cat,2 star,"June 29, 2005",Frank Bruni,Chelsea,"Mediterranean, New American",https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/29/dining/reviews/a-place-in-the-mood-for-anything.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/29/dining/reviews/a-place-in-the-mood-for-anything.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IF you're the kind of well-fed, restaurant-knowledgeable New Yorker who doles out recommendations about where to eat, there are three syllables that regularly escape your lips, a ready answer for what acquaintances want when they know vaguely, but not precisely, what they want. A place with sophisticated food but not a whiff of arrogance about it? The Red Cat. A place that looks good but not too good, that simmers attractively without sizzling flamboyantly? The Red Cat. Somewhere you can treat a business associate or a family member to a dinner that feels sufficiently special and not bust the bank? The Red Cat. Somewhere you can take someone who might be a date (but, then again, might not) and leave your designs ambiguous, your options open. Hint: a domesticated animal in a popular color for fast cars. By turns cozy and sexy, laid-back and fleet, the Red Cat is a restaurant Rorschach, different things at different times to different people, which is just what its owners, Jimmy Bradley and Danny Abrams, intended. The simultaneously prosaic and cryptic name they gave it alludes to nothing, connotes nothing. It's a phrase to be imbued with whatever meaning the imbuing party deems fit. Mr. Bradley and Mr. Abrams did not want to be pigeonholed into any one tidy theme or identity, so they jumbled the decorative motifs, hanging Moroccan lanterns from the ceilings, putting framed paintings and photographs on the walls and using reclaimed barn wood from Pennsylvania, some of it painted red and some white, as paneling. The Red Cat feels vaguely colonial and tavernlike, except when it feels downtown-gallery cool, and apart from those moments when it feels modestly and eclectically elegant. Choose your mood. The menu is more coherent, more of a piece. It doesn't take ethnic sides. But it fairly consistently mines a middle ground between Continental and new American, timeless Mediterranean and of-the-moment Manhattan, where unabashedly hearty preparations and ingredients meet seasonal produce and whimsical flourishes, where comfort and classicism welcome innovation without letting it run roughshod. It's an immensely appealing place, recently inhabited by a loin of rabbit wrapped in pancetta and surrounded by fava beans, cipollini onions and dates. On many menus this dish would be an entree, but Mr. Bradley, the restaurant's chef, does it as an appetizer. In a similar vein he includes among the starters a baby lamb chop Milanese, which is encrusted with mustard and panko and skirted with baked tomatoes, olives and capers. Mr. Bradley loves Italy, and so there is also a simple, excellent appetizer of sautéed zucchini slivers with pecorino cheese and toasted almonds. But his heart is roomy enough to open the door to potato pierogi sautéed in plenty of butter and paired with hon shimeji mushrooms and chunks of poached lobster. He bends to accommodate trends and has lately been serving a seared tuna appetizer, albeit one with real personality, thanks to currents of curry and a chili pepper vinaigrette. He accommodates lighter appetites with a delightful salad with chevrot cheese, pear and pumpkin seeds. The menu changes frequently, so some of those dishes will soon be retired or significantly tweaked. But you can count on encountering the zucchini sauté, a Red Cat staple, along with green beans tempura, an addictive side dish with a dipping sauce of extra-zingy honey mustard -- honey mustard on steroids. You can count on a terrific pork tenderloin among the entrees. It is bathed before cooking in a sugar marinade, and served with morels. You can count on an expertly grilled shell steak. You can count on the rest of the entrees running a predictable but sensible gamut: chicken and duck; salmon or Arctic char; cod or black bass or such. You can count on plates that are composed generously, with a bounty of vegetables and sometimes a whole extra dimension, like the richly satisfying vegetable risotto on which Mr. Bradley placed cod. And you can pretty much count on careful cooking. A skate wing was ideally crispy on the outside without being remotely dry on the inside. The Red Cat opened in 1999, when it received one star in The New York Times from William Grimes. Its location, on a fringe of Chelsea, among a growing gallery scene, seemed much more remote then than now, but the Red Cat has never relied solely on its neighborhood for business. Its fluid, flexible nature is such that it seems -- and is -- in equal measures a local joint and a destination. It's the exceedingly rare place that can often take a reservation only a few days in advance and yet is almost always packed. Some of the locals eat at the bar -- and began doing so here long before that practice became a citywide fashion. The Red Cat was also ahead of the curve in grouping the wines on its list not by country but by character: ""Floral Whites,"" ""Sangiovese, Nebbiolo and Earthy Reds."" It has been a prolific sire: first of the Harrison, which has a slightly stiffer posture; then of the Mermaid Inn, which frolics casually in the surf; and most recently of Pace, which went full-on Italian and stumbled a bit. None have quite the Red Cat's easy confidence or irresistible spirit. Mr. Bradley even roasts and serves suckling pig here every Sunday. That's a Red Cat kind of thing to do. Dishes at the Red Cat do not rise to sublime heights; that's not a Red Cat thing. Not all the desserts are as terrific as a rocky road sundae and an orange panna cotta, and a cookie sampler is entirely forgettable. The intensely friendly service can turn spacey, as when no one remembered to put a requested candle in the dessert of a friend who was celebrating a birthday. But I always leave the Red Cat happy. It doesn't have the best this or the best that. It isn't a star pitcher or a marquee shortstop. It's an expert utility player, and maybe that's what red cat means -- or should mean from now on.

424,Koi,0.75 star,"May 25, 2005",Frank Bruni,Midtown South,"Asian, Japanese",https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/25/dining/reviews/japanese-chic-with-volume-turned-up.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/25/dining/reviews/japanese-chic-with-volume-turned-up.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE gates of the ancient Greek underworld were patrolled by a pooch with multiple snouts and a mean streak. The gates of Koi are patrolled by a man with a single clipboard and an aloof mien. He makes sure that no one without a reservation slips past, but his snarling purpose is as much a messenger's as a guard's. He wants the diners who breach this sanctum to believe that they have made a heroically privileged passage. If they visit Koi during one of the kitchen's better moments, explore the menu's sunniest regions and don't mind a cacophonous din, they may well feel that way. But that's a pretty big if. While this restaurant has some fine ideas, first-rate ingredients and propitious convergences of the two, such high points are trampled and toppled by a more consistent mediocrity and a profusion of errors. Like an aged pop star on the latest of several proclaimed farewell tours, Koi ultimately relies on pose more than performance. Many utterly respectable restaurants bungle one dish of every five or one dinner of every three. Koi's success rate during my visits was worse than that. The kitchen's mistakes piled up: cold and soggy vegetable tempura; overcooked meat; a couple of instances of seafood that tasted like it had been carelessly stored. Koi sunk on occasion to depths lower than any restaurant this vain and expensive should allow itself. An entrée of ginger-glazed Alaskan king crab legs consisted of stringy flesh under a cloying varnish. It tasted like a canned seafood candy bar, so odd and unappealing that the friend who ordered it justifiably said she wouldn't have felt any more dispirited if a server had mugged her for the $27 that the dish cost. An entrée of what the menu advertised as Kobe-style beef had the dusky color, dreary texture and quotidian flavor of reheated pot roast. The pan-seared meat had been ordered medium-rare, but much of it was closer to medium-well, and if its provenance was indeed some preserve of specially pampered cattle, I predict a bovine class action suit in the offing. Those cows should be growing much fatter, happier and more flavorful than this. Koi recreates a popular, buzz-bedecked establishment with the same name and same principal owner in Los Angeles, and it belongs to a well-worn Japanese genre that includes, in Manhattan, Megu, Geisha, Ono, Matsuri and En Japanese Brasserie. These restaurants invest in flashy design, mix colorful cocktails and construct menus that hedge any daring bets with the safety of sushi rolls and versions of dishes popularized by Nobu, the less flamboyant, more dependable sire of this expanding brood. Koi's design is indeed flashy, pivoting on leafy bamboo stalks along some walls and an enormous, latticed white canopy that evokes both the honeycombs of a beehive and the intersecting strands of a spider's web. Koi made me feel like an insect, and I say that with gratitude for a new sensation in a city that frequently seems to have run through all the possible ones already. Sometimes Koi even made me happy. Its miso-bronzed black cod, one of the many homages to Nobu, was as pleasant as it promised to be. A hangar steak had a delightful dusting of sansho pepper on its nicely charred exterior. Poached halibut with maitake mushrooms and steamed Chilean sea bass with shiitake mushrooms were both carefully cooked and prudently garnished, the fish in each case allowed to speak ably for itself. And a few of Koi's signature experiments in Asian fusion or Asian reinterpretation -- petals of hamachi brushed not only with soy sauce, wasabi and yuzu but also with white truffle essence; petals of albacore bathed in ponzu and basil -- yielded intriguing, honorable results. Perhaps best of all, during one dinner visit, was the restaurant's crispy rice with spicy tuna. This dish tweaks the usual approach to sushi by frying the rice cake, ideally to a golden, crunchy state that provides a wonderful textural contrast to the fish atop it. But during another dinner visit a soggy cake minimized that contrast, foiling the dish. The excessively gooey dressing in a ""spicy shrimp tempura"" hand roll wasn't remotely spicy, nor was the tempura remotely crisp. Koi concocts an ambitious array of sauces, trying to balance fiery and sweet and sometimes succeeding. But it treats the flesh these sauces accompany in perfunctory ways. A pan-seared chicken breast with a tamarind dressing was dry. A roasted duck breast with a sriracha dressing had little character and could have easily been passed off as another meat. Slices of chu-toro sashimi were gray around the edges and shockingly fishy. A companion and I immediately stopped eating them, and our ebullient server never noticed or asked why. His tendency toward distraction was a rampant affliction, shared by the rest of the Koi-stone Kops, who alternately forgot to deliver side orders, tried to deliver another table's food to ours and poured boiling tea into a wineglass that was being used for iced tea. The hostesses at a front counter often failed to acknowledge us for many minutes on end. More than once, my companions and I were escorted to tables that turned out to be occupied, and we had to stand in the center of the dining room while a hostess circled back to the front to recheck the seating chart. There was a haphazard quality to almost every aspect of Koi beyond its eye-catching props and pulse-pounding music. What seems to matter most to its managers are a sexy setting, a chic vibe and an exclusive air, which brings us back to the human watchdog at the gates. Koi isn't the only restaurant to employ this Cerberus-like breed or to have some justification, in terms of traffic management and crowd control, for doing so. But it's a restaurant whose shortcomings are neatly signaled and summarized by that sentry. Attitude reigns here. The discipline and diligence required for dependably good meals have not yet made it through the door. Koi  Satisfactory  40 West 40th Street, in the Bryant Park Hotel; (212)921-3330.

425,Periyali,2 star,"May 18, 2005",Frank Bruni,Flatiron,Greek,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/18/dining/reviews/almost-as-durable-as-greece-itself.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/18/dining/reviews/almost-as-durable-as-greece-itself.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"""I HAVEN'T been here in three years,"" one gentlemen said to another as they passed my table at Periyali the other night. ""Do you remember what the food was like?"" his companion asked him. I didn't hear the answer. But the question made me think: at many pricey Manhattan restaurants, summoning the memory of an experience from three years ago would produce a misleading compass for the journey ahead. The passage of three years would guarantee a tweaking of the concept, a reshuffle in the kitchen or at least the arrival of a slate of new dishes and an expansion of the spice cabinet to include coriander and cardamom. Not at Periyali. This restaurant served octopus marinated in red wine back then, and it serves octopus marinated in red wine now. Time marches on; the moussaka at Periyali stands still. If you remember what Periyali was like 3 years or 10 years or even 15 years ago, you know what it's like today. And you know that it's a lulling antidote to the frequent overdoses of restless innovation and runaway imagination at other restaurants. That it's a pleasant sigh of a place, and a bit, but only a bit, of a yawn. That you eat simply here and you eat well: fish grilled over charcoal and sprinkled with lemon; lamb and beef seasoned with nothing more daring than rosemary and thyme. Periyali is the same as it ever was, right down to the décor: white stucco walls, enormous bouquets of fresh flowers and a ceiling of undulating white linen, which poetically evokes sails as it serves the more prosaic purpose of muffling noise. Periyali is as calm and calming as the Aegean on a windless day. While it's strange to think of a restaurant this retiring as a trailblazer, Periyali indeed was one. When it opened 18 years ago, upscale Greek was an oxymoron, a gyro-defying leap of imagination and faith. Its owners, Steve Tzolis and Nicola Kotsoni, had made a success out of Il Cantinori, an Italian restaurant featuring rustic food in a polished, handsome setting, and fellow Greeks who dined there would constantly ask where to find a Greek analogue to it. There was none, Ms. Kotsoni said in a recent telephone interview. She and Mr. Tzolis decided that there should be, that if a refined trattoria could work, so could a refined taverna. Besides, she said, they found a location on West 20th Street that limited their financial risk. ""We were paying $700 a month in rent,"" she said, laughing. ""We thought it was O.K. to take a chance."" So they did, creating a restaurant devoted to some of the fish and meat best loved in Greece, where they were born. (They met later, in New York.) Their influence on Manhattan was subtle, gradual and certain, visible today in the restaurants Estiatorio Milos, Molyvos and Thalassa. Greek didn't exactly become the new French, the new Italian, the new anything. It's a cuisine with less variety and ambition than those, rooted in a poorer and less populous country with less vanity about its culinary traditions. But Greek became something more than leaden spanakopita that sits and sags in a display case for half the day. Periyali's spanakopita, served as an appetizer, had a flaky, wonderful pastry shell when I sampled it. Fried rings of calamari, also served as an appetizer, had a similar lightness and delicacy. They made all those reckless pub versions seem like so many oily bread crumbs with specious claims to maritime paternity. Other appetizers ranged from modestly delightful (smoked trout with an emphatic presence of dill; puréed yellow split peas with red onion) to extremely satisfying (sautéed sweetbreads over gigante beans; sautéed chicken livers over lentils). The best of the appetizer bunch was the octopus. New Yorkers are currently enjoying an octopus renaissance, an octopus apotheosis, with restaurants as different as BLT Fish and Ama having cinched preparations that render this flesh unusually pliant. I like to think that Periyali, which marinates its octopus for two days, paved the way. It grills its octopus over charcoal, which is also how it cooks many of its seafood entrees. I tried branzino, dorade, red snapper and shrimp, all faintly crisp and moist. Periyali grills its lamb chops and its kebabs of filet mignon with similarly delightful results. The recurring virtues of its entrees are fine flesh treated with restraint, generous portions and fully composed plates -- some broccoli here, some couscous there -- incorporating side dishes, which many other restaurants list separately. The final bill at Periyali seldom shocks. The less austere preparations include veal medallions in a sauce of veal jus and wild mushrooms; a dish of cubed lamb, mushrooms, pine nuts and feta cheese, all swaddled in a fluffy phyllo comforter; and, of course, the moussaka, which managed the difficult trick of being rich but not smothering. Nothing at Periyali proves hugely intriguing. Nothing wows. But the little touches add up slowly and nicely. I think of the terrific mix of Greek olives at the start of the meal and the creamy quality of the Greek yogurt that mingles with honey and walnuts in the simplest and best of a limited selection of desserts. The ambience also has a way of sneaking up on you. Tables here are not squished together, and the series of rooms go deep enough, culminating in an enclosed garden, to give the restaurant a truly spacious feel. There have indeed been some changes over the years. The Greek wines on the primarily Greek wine list are more varied and better, a reflection of Greece's strides in that department. The first chef left, turning the kitchen over to Thomas Xanthopoulos. But that happened 17 years ago. Mr. Xanthopoulos has been cooking here ever since. He performs with relative anonymity in these cult-of-chef times and with admirable steadiness. One of my companions could not recall ever having a bad meal at Periyali, where he had dined repeatedly. How often? About every three years, he said. That seems to be a common span of time between visits to Periyali. Diners should shorten it.

426,Stone Park Cafe,2 star,"March 30, 2005",Frank Bruni,Park Slope,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/30/dining/reviews/where-to-take-thoreau-and-dr-atkins.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/30/dining/reviews/where-to-take-thoreau-and-dr-atkins.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"PARTING company with most literary scholars, utopianists and ovo-lacto vegetarians, I like to think that when Henry David Thoreau wrote in ""Walden"" that he wanted to ""live deep and suck out all the marrow of life,"" he wasn't dabbling in metaphor. He was fantasizing about dinner, his pent-up carnivorous impulses breaking through his reputed meatless resolve. To live deep is to eat deep, at least in my book, and nothing gets at the unfettered, unrefined core of things like marrow, so obscenely rich, so absurdly fatty, so enticingly suspended in a gelatinous limbo between liquid and solid. If that description disgusts you, I want you with me the next time I dine at the Stone Park Cafe, because you are unlikely to encroach on my appetizer of roasted marrow bones. If your hunger is primed, I respect you profoundly but want you far away from my table. Stone Park Cafe isn't the only New York restaurant that serves marrow bones. Prune, in the East Village, has been cooking them for years, and they are also available at Landmarc in TriBeCa. But marrow bones don't pop up often. When they do, you immediately know a few things. You know that a restaurant is willing to flout conformity and flirt with adventure and to do so in an earthy rather than a prissy way. You know it appreciates and indulges a basic kind of gluttony. Stone Park Cafe has those virtues and more. The marrow bones belong to a menu that is sagely balanced between curiosity-piquing surprises and consoling favorites, one that establishes a personality of sophisticated robustness while accommodating many predilections and moods. Among the appetizers are plenty of unexpected dishes or dishes with clever twists. Instead of crab cakes, Stone Park serves bluefish cakes, taming the assertiveness and oiliness of the fish by smoking it with alder chips and then flaking, breading and pan-searing it. The result was terrific, and the restaurant garnished the crisp cakes with a fantastic slaw that used celery root in place of cabbage and threw in capers. A palm-size short-rib sandwich arrived with a fried quail's egg perched atop the meat and poised to bathe it in an extra, unnecessary and wholly appreciated measure of moistness. Tempura-style oysters came with lightly fried caperberries. There are also more predictable starters: a frisée aux lardons, grilled artichoke, an asparagus risotto. Stone Park clearly intends to be the kind of restaurant where you can take your finicky brother-in-law, just back from the farmer's market, and your grumpy teenager, just back from the multiplex. It's smart and self-protective enough to proceed more conservatively with entrees, to know that diners become less daring when the stakes rise higher than the modest portions and prices of appetizers. And so there is a grilled pork chop and a grilled sirloin and seared salmon and seared scallops. But there's also braised rabbit, which was appreciably more tender than similar dishes at more expensive restaurants in Manhattan. Stone Park is yet another example of the expanded dining options in Brooklyn in general and on Fifth Avenue in Park Slope in particular. It keeps company with Blue Ribbon and Al di Là and can hold its head high among them. It opened last September, the lovingly realized dream of two childhood friends, Josh Foster and Josh Grinker. Mr. Grinker supervises the kitchen with Tracy Young. All three learned their restaurant ropes elsewhere and are striking out on their own for the first time. They took a rundown bodega, broke through its rear wall to connect to a garage and then decorated the expanded space in a pleasant, modest fashion, making generous use of exposed brick and Brazilian cherrywood floors. Stone Park has few airs: if the L-shape bar isn't crowded, the servers will tell you to throw your coats and stow your bags on and around the stools closest to the wall. Those servers sometimes seem overextended, their interactions with the table rushed or perfunctory. But the restaurant feels utterly comfortable in a way that more polished ones sometimes don't, and it's full of happy discoveries. When one of my dining companions ordered a cosmopolitan, I inwardly groaned, but the server steered her toward a marvelous one made with a passion fruit purée. I confess to stealing more sips than a mere appraisal needed. The cooking is careful, and the flourishes and grace notes are prudent. Only once in my repeated visits did the kitchen clearly misfire, sending out a seriously overdone roasted chicken. But a grilled rib-eye for two, seasoned with hints of rosemary, was as tender as could be, and so was the grilled pork chop, flanked by a heap of homemade applesauce. An excellent eight-ounce hamburger was crisply charred on the outside, juicy in the center and could be ordered with a choice of accessories that included blue cheese, which I always appreciate. For diners who want a less conventional sandwich, there is a grilled wedge of fish -- tilapia when I was there, mahi mahi or grouper at other times -- with avocado and chipotle mayonnaise on top and plantain chips on the side. I loved it. Desserts were the weakest part of my meals at Stone Park. While an apple and blueberry crisp was satisfying enough, a buttermilk panna cotta had little flavor, and the tangerine mint sauce around it tasted slightly medicinal. This restaurant nonetheless deserves to be a hit. Its charms will only multiply when the weather becomes warmer and it supplements the 55 seats inside with 25 outside, facing the leafy square from which it takes its name. Sadly, summer isn't marrow weather, so now is the time for this dish, which is made with beef bones, as it usually is. You spoon out dabs of the marrow, slather them on grilled peasant bread and sprinkle them generously with sea salt. Then you take a big lusty bite, at which point you find yourself in any truly committed carnivore's utopia. Stone Park Cafe  324 Fifth Avenue (Third Street), Park Slope, Brooklyn; (718)369-0082. ATMOSPHERE -- A split-level room with exposed brick, hardwood floors, handsome sconces and windows on two sides.  SOUND LEVEL -- Moderate.

427,Gari,2 star,"March 2, 2005",Frank Bruni,Upper West Side,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/02/dining/confessions-of-a-reformed-sushi-eater.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/02/dining/confessions-of-a-reformed-sushi-eater.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I AM ashamed of my past. Horrified by it, really. I need to glance back only a little more than a decade to catch a glimpse of my wantonness, to see myself treating something precious as if it were just so much flesh. When it came to sushi, I was a cad. I degraded it with excess wasabi paste, and my use of soy sauce was nothing short of promiscuous. Then again, there wasn't an abundance of exemplary sushi or expert sushi chefs back then. All too often the fish, overly chewy, and the rice, needlessly clumpy, didn't deserve gentler treatment. At Gari, a new Japanese restaurant on the Upper West Side, they do. I would never drag Gari's sushi carelessly through a salty, spicy murk. Gari's sushi would be especially ill served by that impulse, because much of it is prepared with more intricate and emphatic seasoning than sushi typically is. Any additional embellishments would distort the chefs' artful compositions and overload a diner's palate, which already has plenty to ponder. One night, for example, an omakase sushi tasting menu included a thin sliver of yellowtail, which had been caressed with sesame paste. A much fatter slab of salmon carried a warm red tomato sauce, which tasted as if it had just migrated from a mound of tagliatelle in a nearby trattoria. Red snapper was crowned with a tangle of baby mesclun and toasted pine nuts. Seared toro was sprinkled with soy-marinated garlic and scallions. A piece of bluefin tuna sported an ecru plumage of tofu mousse. Gari's calling card is sushi that has been tweaked slightly or gussied up significantly, but this restaurant usually doesn't let the process get out of hand. (One exception was an à la carte maki roll of fried oysters, which were held hostage by a ruthlessly unctuous mayonnaise.) Gari takes its cues from -- and arguably betters -- its sire, Sushi of Gari, an unadorned, uncomfortably jammed cranny on the Upper East Side with a cult following and, on the night I visited it, a hectic, brusque air. (A server and a sushi chef sped a friend and me through an omakase menu in one hour flat.) Gari is not exactly sluggish, serene, spacious or stylish. But it does have more surface polish than its forebear, its clean lines and warm woods forging a minimalist, quasi-Scandinavian appeal. It also has ostensibly Japanese-inspired dishes that go well beyond the sushi and sashimi to which Sushi of Gari largely limits itself. And some of this cooked food is as impressive as the uncooked fish. I think in particular of a dish called Mishima beef with a jolting price tag of $45. Both the term and expense are unexplained by the menu. Mishima refers to a place in Japan where special cattle are pampered and fattened to produce rich, Kobe-like flesh. Gari gets its beef from similar cattle in Texas. It pan-sears strips of rib-eye and then swaddles them in shimeji, shiitake mushrooms, an intricately seasoned chickpea purée and red miso sauce. The result was sublime. A shockingly succulent deboned young chicken luxuriated under a light soy glaze and a dusting of sansho pepper. Chilean sea bass and salmon had robust flavors and delicate textures and turned out to be wiser choices than roasted lobster, an insufficiently tender waste of an upstanding crustacean. The desserts, courtesy of Petrossian, are pro forma (molten chocolate cake, Black Forest cake), but a diner may have eaten so well by that point that he or she won't care. Besides, the check may have risen plenty high already. Cost is my biggest qualm with Gari, which struck me as too expensive for the neighborhood, the portions and the matter-of-factness of the ambience and service. Consider the sake selections: only two bottles are under $45, and they are only 10 ounces each. But the splendor of Gari's sushi and sashimi cannot be denied. The fish used is of discernibly high quality. I wouldn't put it on a par with the seafood at Masa, Sushi Yasuda or Kurumazushi, but I wouldn't put Gari all that far behind. Like those restaurants, Gari does right by sushi rice, serving it warm, so that the temperature of the fish atop it is raised. And my extended omakase menu at Gari, which cost about $100, was in fact less expensive than comparable experiences at those other restaurants. Gari claims its own niche in the increasingly crowded sushi marketplace with its colorful flourishes, like brilliant slices of avocado beneath a sweet mash of chopped sea eel. But Gari can also take a simpler approach, as it does in a $28 sashimi sampler, which arrives in a boat-shape bowl. I consumed the luscious toro as it was, even though the barest dab of wasabi or the subtlest splash of soy sauce would have been O.K. Now that I'm older and wiser, I know how to show a little restraint and respect. Gari  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  370 Columbus Avenue (78th Street), Upper West Side; (212)362-4816.

428,Duane Park,1 star,"Feb. 16, 2005",Frank Bruni,NoHo,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/16/dining/reviews/the-old-kid-on-the-block.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/16/dining/reviews/the-old-kid-on-the-block.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I PITY the Duane Park Café, but I respect it. I fear for it, but I root for it, this solid supporting player in the company of so many actual and aspirant stars, this earnest tradesman in the proximity of so many self-conscious, self-aggrandizing artists. Just across the street stand Bouley and Danube with their regal and whimsical interior décor, their annual Zagat Survey validations, their luxurious tasting menus. Not far away is Nobu, ever jammed, ever electric, still a celebrity magnet after all these years. To these neighbors add Megu, the expensively accessorized epitome of the wasabi-fringed fun houses in ascendance right now, and Odeon, which defined downtown cool decades ago and maintains an alluring temperature today. The list goes on because the milieu is TriBeCa, and few other patches of Manhattan are soil for such a high-flying, charismatic collection of destination restaurants. This is tough turf. And I was first drawn to the Duane Park Café by my curiosity about how a place that tried neither to be a glittery peer nor a frumpy counterpoint to so many luminaries had managed to fare for so many years in their midst. But I returned to Duane Park for an additional reason. At some point during my first visit -- perhaps when my fork slid through a beautifully grilled fillet of John Dory with fennel and blood orange, or when my spoon sank into an immensely appealing chocolate and banana brioche pudding with cranberries -- it occurred to me that there was a moral and a message in the relative anonymity of this restaurant. That the way it fades into the woodwork of New York was illustrative and instructive. More than culinary standouts like Per Se and Masa, Duane Park speaks to what a surfeit of options for sophisticated dining we New Yorkers enjoy. It tells us this precisely because it makes such a small impression. It serves pheasant breast and venison osso buco, and yet it would be aptly characterized as an unpretentious neighborhood bistro. It does a terrific job with sautéed Chilean sea bass, which comes with a celery and verjus reduction, and with roasted rack of lamb, which is embellished with blueberries and pickled walnuts, and yet it enjoys only run-of-the-mill regard. In many other American cities, Duane Park would probably create a fair degree of notice and lay claim to being one of the more interesting restaurants in its neighborhood. In New York City it's pretty much an afterthought. This status is understandable; I cannot and would not challenge or quibble with it. Duane Park is not exactly a bargain; its dinner entrees go as high as $30 and don't drop below $20. Although the restaurant's exterior is inviting and its foyer and bar area radiate a cozy air, its dining room feels boxy and banal, and the owner and managers obviously know that. They regularly vary the level of illumination in the room, and they keep several large vases filled with bright, fresh flowers. Late last year they had the rear wall of the dining room upholstered in golden silk panels. Even so, a slightly downbeat visual spirit persists. Some of what the kitchen does is badly conceived, poorly executed or both. That venison was infused with a blackberry tea that conspired with the overcooked meat to turn the dish into a murky, gummy gastronomic apocalypse. The sins of mustard-crusted tuna were twofold: vapidity and aridity. But tuna tartare, which could have been deadly dull, wasn't, partly because the tahini sauce around it was not the usual framing device, at least not these days, and was a commendable tahini sauce to boot. An even better appetizer, rife with prudently juxtaposed flavors and textures, was a mixture of shredded smoked trout, crème fraîche and horseradish that was perched atop a crunchy potato pancake and then surrounded with bits of Gorgonzola and roasted pear. The food at Duane Park often reflects pride, care and a commitment to fresh and very fine ingredients, qualities that were evident both in the rich, dark ribbons of air-cured duck breast in an arugula salad that I sampled and in the moistness and delicacy of a semolina-crusted halibut that I tried. Those dishes were mainstays of the menu, while a satisfying appetizer of grilled shrimp, calamari and cauliflower and a hearty braised short rib entree came and went, examples of the restaurant's efforts not to get stuck in a rut. It has struggled off and on since its chef and owner, Seiji Maeda, opened it in 1989. (The following year it received one star from Bryan Miller in The New York Times.) Marisa Ferrarin, who manages the restaurant, told me in a telephone conversation that Duane Park went so far as to bring in a feng shui expert five years ago. ""He hung special stones above the door to create new energy,"" she said, adding that those stones were still there. I never noticed them. But I noticed other details that reflected Duane Park's quest to survive in a difficult environment, to hatch strategies and hone attributes all its own. It has a way of greeting and saying goodbye to customers that feels gracious and grateful but not sycophantic. It has a simple two-page wine list that is considerate in its concision and prices, which are moderate. It has good desserts, which tend to be crowd-pleasing rather than trailblazing. During my visits they included a quince and apple cobbler and a chocolate, pecan and caramel tartlet. Those charms, modest and part of a more complicated and flawed picture, would be more than enough for a restaurant in less privileged precincts, a restaurant that didn't have to rub shoulders with Chanterelle and Montrachet on its own patch of Manhattan and compete with so many distinguished performers on the rest of the island. Those charms have been just enough to carry Duane Park through the years. They have done so in a decidedly fitful, humble fashion that ultimately says as much about how lucky we are as how limited this restaurant is.

429,Lure Fishbar,1 star,"Jan. 12, 2005",Frank Bruni,SoHo,Seafood,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/12/dining/fish-thats-raw-but-never-undressed.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/12/dining/fish-thats-raw-but-never-undressed.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IF you were a piece of raw fish, you would be feeling awfully confused about your worth these days. On the one hand, you're a crossover hit, a polyglot star. Restaurateurs give you top billing even in Italian and French productions, crowning you crudo and tweaking you into tartare. Long gone is that lean epoch on the Japanese margins. But with each new day and newfangled menu, the very people who cast you show less faith in your innate luster. They tease you out, tart you up and saddle you with eccentric accessories. It's one extreme makeover after another, and the next thing you know, you're wearing pickled Thai chilies and a beret of emulsified olive oil that looks like a toasted marshmallow. Such is the fate of uncooked cubes of yellowfin tuna at Lure Fishbar, where seafood endures more costume changes and a zanier array of accents than Jennifer Garner in ""Alias."" Lure wants not just to participate in the crudo craze -- the first quarter of this restaurant's menu presents nearly a dozen kinds of raw or barely cooked fish -- but also to add something to it. Unfortunately Lure adds too much too weirdly and too often. Fashioned to evoke the teak-paneled cabin of a luxury yacht, Lure makes a nifty visual promise of communion with the high seas. But with a few of its cooked dishes as well as its raw ones, it fails to trust the fruits of those waters. It lets the condiments steer the ship, abetting a mutiny by a bounty of relishes and vinaigrettes. When proper order reigns, this restaurant can provide a handsome, pleasant voyage. It looks great, its decorative conceit realized so shrewdly that you cannot help smiling as you take it all in: the bar stool cushions that bring to mind flotation devices, the windows that resemble portholes. More important, Lure makes you look great, its dimness as flattering as an interview by Larry King. If all the world were lighted as Lure is, a great many dermatologists would be out of work (and a great many ophthalmologists would be twice as busy). Lure's owners, John McDonald and Josh Pickard, who opened Lever House in late 2003, understand that scene is as potent a magnet as cuisine. With the help of the design firm CAN Resources, they have contrived an alluring one. It's the food, under the direction of the chef Josh Capon, that sometimes sends Lure into choppy waters. The menu is elaborately segmented in a manner that strands you with too many questions about how and how much you should order. Beyond the ""raw fishbar"" at the start, there's a section for shellfish, another for soups and still others for fried fish, kebabs, seafood entrees, meat entrees and sides. It took me many visits to identify and isolate the best from the rest. At least a half dozen kinds of oysters are available, and the ones I tried were terrific. Lure seemingly doesn't stint on the quality of its seafood, a virtue that was apparent in the best entrees I sampled. Grilled swordfish was meaty, moist and enlivened -- but not enslaved -- by an Asian-inflected marinade of soy sauce, butter, garlic and ginger. Grilled salmon provided the silky texture and rich flavor that we salmon lovers crave, and the amalgam of bell peppers atop it was both tolerable and easily swept aside. My favorite entree was one of the recurring specials: a vaguely corny, almost classic surf and turf of an enormous, succulent lobster tail (butter-poached and served with a truffled bordelaise sauce) and a pliant, juicy filet mignon. I followed this dish with my favorite of Lure's desserts, a hokey but irresistible collection of creative ice cream sandwiches like one with strawberry ice cream between vanilla shortbread cookies. And as a companion and I laid waste to them, it hit us: Lure's true calling. This restaurant works best as an upscale, downtown Red Lobster -- a Garnet or Ruby Lobster. Even by that conception, it has problems. The New England clam chowder was a watery shipwreck. The shrimp in shrimp soup were strangely mushy. But as a general rule, Lure hits the rocks when it harbors pretensions. Steamed black cod cowered beneath an oppressive mash of mushrooms, sake, lemon zest and Thai chilies. Sautéed halibut -- rather, oversautéed halibut -- had been doused with a pink peppercorn vinaigrette that rendered the fish almost irrelevant. Going back to the raw selections, the ginger vinaigrette on slivers of toro and the marinade of soy sauce, ginger and kaffir lime with Nantucket Bay scallops were too assertive. Japanese red snapper was meant to be dunked in a ""citrus-olive oil foam"" that looked and smelled more like a gooey, perfumed facial mask. You may wonder whether to eat it or moisturize with it. In these cases the very fine fish can be enjoyed more if liberated from its ablutions and adornments. And in cases like the Arctic char and the Tasmanian sea trout, both subjected to more prudent fiddling and both more easily divorced from their condiments, you will likely find ample pleasure. But you will still wonder: isn't a hint of wasabi or a sprinkling of rock salt and minced herbs about as much primping as a piece of raw fish needs? What must we be doing to its floundering self-esteem? Lure Fishbar  * [Rating: One Star]  142 Mercer Street (Prince Street), SoHo; (212) 431-7676.

430,La Masseria,1 star,"Jan. 5, 2005",Frank Bruni,Times Square Theatre District,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/05/dining/italian-rustic-just-off-broadway.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/05/dining/italian-rustic-just-off-broadway.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ONLY a small minority of restaurants exert a pull so strong that you go to them without much consideration for their location, their type of cuisine or the nuances of their ambience. The vast majority survive because they meet a specific craving or need: for something spicy or something romantic, something inexpensive or something nearby. They punch the ticket of a whim. They solve a riddle of requirements. Where, for example, do you go if you don't want to shuffle more than a few paces from the Broadway theater in which the show you're seeing is playing? If you want a place that feels a bit indulgent but not remotely reckless? That favors hearty fare over dainty fillips? That pays fitting tribute to the milky glory of mozzarella? You go to La Masseria. And you go knowing that, while you won't have the meal of your life -- or even the meal of your month -- most of your food will be good, you will certainly eat plenty, and you will sidestep the many disasters along the Great White Way, a culinary minefield of considerable peril. In fact my first meal at La Masseria was significantly better than good, and that judgment transcended the mozzarella, a subject to which I will later return. Along with a colleague, I dropped by La Masseria for lunch, not really knowing what -- beyond the probability of pasta -- to expect. The restaurant was almost empty, which may be why the food was more impressively prepared than it would turn out to be on subsequent visits. The kitchen wasn't stretched anywhere close to thin. And so the baby octopus appetizer was a many-tentacled, many-splendored thing: supple rather than rubbery, with a garland of slightly crunchy broccoli rabe and a cushion of puréed fava beans. A tangle of tagliatelle did the Bolognese sauce atop and around it proud, providing a vehicle that was sturdy but never clunky. Although many Italian restaurants sputter when it comes to main courses, La Masseria zipped right along, as if on cruise control. A decadently thick, expansively broad veal chop, seasoned in a restrained fashion with rosemary and sage, was a juicy invitation to gluttony, which we promptly and unconditionally accepted, leaving very little meat on the bone. An extremely moist fillet of pompano, sautéed in a bit of butter and white wine and sprinkled judiciously with lemon, provided precisely the right, light counterpoint, reprieve and amends that we felt we needed. We decided it was O.K. to eat the whole thing, and rapidly did so. Then we waddled back to the office with that special brand of contentment -- a satisfaction mingled with a sense of discovery -- that you get when you've had a terrific meal at a restaurant about which no one had made grand pronouncements or promises. And while La Masseria occasionally disappointed me over time, that lunch underscored how diligent and deft this restaurant can be with the highlights of its menu and under the most optimal of circumstances. Masseria means farm or farmhouse, and it's not only the restaurant's name but also its design cue, readying the stage for walls of stone or rough stucco, exposed wooden beams along the ceiling and, dangling on some of those walls, antique farm tools: a pitchfork, harnesses. Thankfully, the restaurant doesn't overplay this conceit. You notice it but then forget it, holding on to a vague awareness that the visual environment, like the food, veers deliberately and fetchingly in the direction of rustic. But the most appealing aspect of this restaurant's setting is the dimensions. The dining room is relatively broad and extraordinarily deep, with a few unexpected nooks toward the back. All this space translates into tables that are not wedged tightly together, and the absence of crowding is a balm for the ears as well as the elbows. It helps keep a lid on noise. The menu ranges far and wide over land and sea, carpaccio and capesante, in a naked bid to appeal to all audiences. There are unfamiliar scene-stealers, including a dish of fettucinelike noodles with wedges of eggplant and smoked mozzarella in a light tomato sauce. There are familiar star turns, including that tagliatelle. And there are unfamiliar performances from familiar players, most conspicuously a limoncello-flavored tiramisù that, like most other desserts, was worthy of nothing more than faint applause. You can pretty much count on generous portions but not, sadly, on careful preparations. With the exception of that pompano and the shrimp, scallops and squid in an absolutely wonderful fritto misto, the seafood I sampled at La Masseria was overcooked. So was grilled chicken, which bore the additional indignity of too much salt. Other meat, including rabbit and rack of lamb, fared better. An enormous rib-eye steak was tender and flavorful enough to warrant a presentation more imaginative than the one it received. It was buried beneath an unruly clump of fried shoestring potatoes, a gimmick that grew tired about a decade ago but somehow refuses to die. Then again, maybe La Masseria was making a decorative statement with it. Maybe Mount Spud was supposed to evoke a bale of hay. Now to that mozzarella. La Masseria makes it fresh daily, from cow's milk, and spreads it out in large sheets. Onto those sheets goes asparagus or eggplant or sun-dried tomato or speck, and then the sheets are rolled and sliced so that the mozzarella and its company make a colorful spiral, as delectable to the eye as to the palate. That mozzarella goes a long way -- although not quite the full distance -- toward redeeming La Masseria's frequently off-pitch service, which caroms from excessively chatty to inexplicably absent and only occasionally hits what seems to be its intended mark, affable availability. While the mozzarella doesn't represent a reason to go out of your way to get to La Masseria, it argues for a stop at this restaurant if you happen to be in its vicinity: if Italy is in your thoughts, a farmhouse is on your mind, and a show is part of the rest of the afternoon's or evening's itinerary.

431,Casa la Femme,1 star,"Dec. 8, 2004",Frank Bruni,West Village,Middle Eastern,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/08/dining/reviews/an-oasis-for-sheiks-on-the-east-side.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/08/dining/reviews/an-oasis-for-sheiks-on-the-east-side.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THERE came a moment during one of my meals at Casa la Femme North when my companion and I confronted a decision more critical than hummus versus baba ghanouj, a choice more pivotal than prawns or lamb, a consequential crossroads that captured the very soul of the place. Did we want a flap of our tent lifted so that we could assess the abdominal achievements of the belly dancer who had just begun to whirl through the dining room? Or did we prefer to stay hidden behind our gauzy white veil, shrouded sheiks in pseudo-Arabian isolation? We picked privacy over pulchritude. But I still couldn't shut out the screechy soundtrack for the performance, the clapping of other patrons or the dispiriting fact that an otherwise fine meal had been hijacked by high jinks that felt awfully kitschy in the context of the East Side of Manhattan. The nature of your response to Casa la Femme North, which serves Egyptian food in an ersatz Alexandria under the Queensboro Bridge, largely boils down to this: How much music and midriff do you like with your mezes? Does the sudden appearance of a sinuous siren count as dinner and a show or dinner and a distraction? If you arrive early and take your last bite of the restaurant's sublime baklava before 9 p.m., you can avoid the dancer. But there's really no escaping Casa la Femme North's facile exoticism, built around such obvious props as palm fronds and shisha (a k a hookah) pipes and such over-the-top indulgences as the private tents that ring the dining room. Don't get me wrong: I'm all for a sheltered, spacious niche of my very own, especially on date night, and Casa la Femme North deserves serious consideration from anyone who wants to pair grape leaves with groping or nibble on more than what's on the table. But there's something incrementally ridiculous about a server constantly having to pop through a gossamer cocoon to check on the level of your wineglass. It's a gas the first time and a goof the second. By the 9th or 10th, it's a gimmick that's wearing out its welcome. The tents are available by special request; the restaurant also has extremely comfortable untented tables in the center of the dining room, some with lavishly upholstered high-backed chairs and semicircular booths. At least until the dancer descended and I found myself smack in her gyrating path, I preferred this seating arrangement. But no matter my perch, I enjoyed Casa la Femme North's food, the ingredients of which tasted as fresh as I could desire, the spicing of which was as clear and well calibrated as I could hope for, the cooking of which was often spot-on. For all the restaurant's aesthetic eccentricities, it makes a serious, impressive effort in the kitchen, producing many minor and major delights. The pita bread, for example. It comes hot from the oven in generously proportioned wheels that have been encrusted with sesame seeds, dusted with oregano and rock salt and brushed lightly with olive oil. It provides the perfect canvas for the flavorful mezes, which the restaurant labels mazzas: hummus, baba ghanouj, tahini, zabadi, ful medames (puréed fava beans) and gibnah domiaty (a wonderful Egyptian cheese that is like a less chalky, less salty feta). Some of the dishes at Casa la Femme North will be familiar to anyone who has sampled Middle Eastern cuisine, but the versions presented here are extremely refined ones. Take those grape leaves, which are obviously assembled at regular intervals and do not sit around for long. When I had them, they arrived at the table warm, the rice inside not at all clumpy, the notes of dill and coriander sharp and crisp. Tamaya were like falafel: densely spongy dumplings, or really cakes, of chickpea and fava bean. They were also an excuse to use more of the restaurant's terrific bread and tahini, building blocks for a satisfying appetizer sandwich. Other standout starters included a baked bell pepper stuffed with rice and -- more surprising -- Egyptian crab cakes, packed with sweet meat. Casa la Femme North prides itself on relatively straightforward fish, and yet seafood was what I found most uneven here. A baked whole red snapper was somewhat dry and, because of a clumsy job of tableside filleting, slightly dangerous. Grilled prawns were too chewy. But grilled chicken, which can dry out so easily with such a slender margin of overcooking, was sensationally tender and juicy on both of the nights I sampled it. It was seasoned with sumac, oregano and crushed red pepper and had just enough fat and skin left on it. The restaurant's lamb chops and filet mignon were also first rate. As for the previously lauded baklava, it made me rethink and renounce the anti-baklava peeves and prejudices I had nursed for most of my adult life. The layers of phyllo dough were crunchy and airy and the cinnamon syrup that sweetened them had been applied sparingly, so that the pistachios, almonds and walnuts did not drown in a cloying tide. Open since February, Casa la Femme North is the relocation of -- and successor to -- Casa la Femme, a restaurant in SoHo that closed last December after 12 years. So it has its act down pat. But must that act be so flamboyant, so strenuous? The restaurant seems intent on turning everything into a production, even the pitchers of ice water, stuffed so densely with mint leaves that they look like cylindrical swamps. What ends up in your glass tastes like cold tea. On my first visit, there was a smothering quality to the hyperattentive service. Two garrulous servers at separate times dropped by the table to recommend favorite dishes and suggest strategies for ordering; one would have done the trick. On all of my visits, the servers and their supervisors paced the room endlessly, peering into the tents discreetly and assiduously weaving the vibe that Casa la Femme North is where the desert of daily drudgery ends and an oasis of nightly hedonism begins. But the more I felt like an overpampered sultan, the harder I found it to relax and simply eat. Casa la Femme North  * [Rating: one star]  1076 First Avenue (59th Street); (212) 505-0005. ATMOSPHERE -- A luxe, sybaritic Arabian fantasy, complete with gauzy white tents for private dining.

432,En Japanese Brasserie,1 star,"Nov. 24, 2004",Frank Bruni,West Village,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/24/dining/reviews/a-paean-to-tofu-in-a-japanese-pub.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/24/dining/reviews/a-paean-to-tofu-in-a-japanese-pub.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ARTISANAL and tofu are not two words I normally think of together, but artisanal tofu is what they showcase at En Japanese Brasserie, which essays the brave and, to my mind, quixotic challenge of casting tofu as the most refined of delicacies and rarest of dramatic events. Tofu does not merely appear on the En menu. It is given advertised, neatly spaced show times, much like a killer whale at Sea World. At roughly 90-minute intervals from 6 p.m. through 11:30 p.m., tofu comes fresh, glue-white and gooey from pots in En's kitchen; if you time your dinner reservation just right, you can get it while it's merely seconds (as opposed to, say, a whole hour) old and positively brimming with its pasty charms. You can order it warm or chilled, or you can really go for broke and get its dynamic cousin, yuba, which is the skimmed skin of heated soy milk, omelet-esque in texture. Yuba arguably has more character than plain tofu, which is like saying that Britney Spears lip-synchs less transparently than Ashlee Simpson. Some virtues are minor, and everything is relative. With its tofu and its house-made miso pastes, its julienne of burdock root and beef tongue hot pot, En promises an especially authentic, home-style Japanese dining experience. It also claims to channel the spirit of the izakaya, a Japanese pub devoted to what might well be called Japanese comfort food. The Japanese restaurateurs behind En run several dozen similar establishments in Japan. En marks their American debut. But what is so paradoxically striking about it is how familiar and redundant it feels, how faithfully this transglobal tweaking and translation of an izakaya obeys dining trends in New York and how perfectly it encapsulates a certain kind of Manhattan restaurant today. En, which means destiny, adheres to the same formula that Matsuri, Megu and Ono do: Find a location in a putatively hip or genuinely desirable downtown neighborhood. (En goes for the West Village instead of TriBeCa or the meatpacking district.) Arrange the tables and sushi counters in a vast, visually arresting space that looks as much like a stage set as a place to eat. (The main dining room at En has a celestially high ceiling, a central column covered in tin tiles, a two-story wall of enormous windows and an entirely open kitchen with cooks rushing to and fro.) Garnish with theatrical flourishes. (As at Megu, the staff at En screeches a greeting as newcomers enter the main dining room; upon hearing it, I never failed to flinch.) Construct an extremely long, confusing menu that suggests boundlessness, emphasizes small plates, encourages sharing and, most important of all, accommodates rampant carbohydrate phobias. (Japanese is the vehicle; Dr. Atkins would surely have invented sashimi if someone else had not beaten him to the punch.) Even En's identification as a Japanese brasserie suggests a have-it-all, connect-the-dots sensibility: it wants both the healthful allure of an ethnic cuisine in continued ascendance and the timeless appeal of an unfussy, teeming environment in which you can pass many a merry hour with copious drink as well as food. You can indeed do that at En, which I found more aesthetically attractive and relaxing than many of its counterparts, if only because it is slightly more low key. Although much of the seating is at two counters -- one skirts the kitchen, and the other envelops that central column -- there are also oak tables with significant space between them and a pronounced air of privacy and tranquillity. There are many specialty drinks, many kinds of sake and many flavors of shochu, a Japanese distilled liquor. En stands ready to lubricate you every bit as well as you want to be lubricated. In terms of feeding you, En delivers a more scattershot performance, and that assessment holds even if I put my tofu skepticism to the side. Among the cold small plates and the hot small plates, which constitute two separate and equally substantial categories, there are a few real winners, namely a salad of mushrooms and tender chicken, a plate of oysters sautéed in soy sauce and a crudité platter with leaves of cabbage to be dipped in different miso pastes, including sesame miso and peanut butter miso. But there are losers, too: fried chicken nuggets that were, on the night I had them, as succulent as gravel; an avocado and shrimp salad that tasted like a relic from a country-club banquet in the 1970's; a gruel of overgrilled eggplant, uni and mustard that amounted to a slimy mishap. Most of the food that I sampled -- including sushi rolls and chilled soba noodles, a bowl of thick rice with crab meat and a platter of tempura vegetables -- hovered between those poles, relatively satisfying at the moment of ingestion, pretty much forgotten 30 minutes later. I was surprised in a good way by how juicy and flavorful slices of sautéed duck breast were and in a bad way by how utterly ordinary slices of seared chu toro turned out to be. (The chu toro sashimi, by contrast, was terrific.) If you like your meat sizzling on a stone, both Wagyu beef and organic chicken come that way. Both are packed with flavor, although the $38 price tag on the beef is not warranted by the paltry portion. As for desserts, well, I have yet to encounter a Japanese restaurant that wowed me with this final act, and En hangs with the pack. There are tea ice creams and a tea pudding, and you can guess even before you order them if they are going to be your, um, cup of tea. Tofu reappears, taking a final bow in the form of a tofu mousse with brown sugar syrup and sweet soy powder. I suppose it is good enough for what it is, but I figure that its days are numbered the minute the chefs at En ace a yuba brûlée.

433,Dévi,2 star,"Nov. 17, 2004",Frank Bruni,Union Square,Indian,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/17/dining/reviews/left-or-right-a-place-to-be-centered.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/17/dining/reviews/left-or-right-a-place-to-be-centered.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"WE often wind up associating restaurants with the life dramas and junctures they guided us through. I will always associate Devi with the 2004 presidential election. And I will always credit Devi with making the campaign seem less ugly than it was, with making it recede, if only for the duration of a plate of pyramid-shaped rice puffs, too golden, crunchy and airy to permit unpleasant thoughts. It was in Devi that four companions and I gathered exactly a week before the election and inevitably made predictions. While the uncertainty of the race pressed down on us, we didn't feel it just then. We were too distracted and happy fishing creamy yam dumplings from a fragrant pool of salmon-colored tomato sauce that had been seasoned enticingly with cloves and cardamom seeds, cinnamon and red pepper. It was also in Devi, two nights after the election, that a man at the next table could not resist treating everyone around him -- strangers all -- to a passionate deconstruction of what the returns meant, where the country was heading, the challenges and threats it faced. But his soliloquy felt more like frivolous theater than an example of how heated and polarized so many voters had become, because nothing could seem too weighty in the golden glow of Devi's main dining room, where sheets of raw silk shimmer on the walls, servers glide past in what look like orange pajamas, and the scents of mint, cilantro and tamarind sweeten the air. There are restaurants that bring you back to yourself and those that spirit you away. Devi belongs to the latter group, delivering a heady retreat even when the odds against such an escape are longest. Devi works its exotic magic through its take on Indian food, more varied, multidimensional, nimble and surprising here than at the scores of samosa factories throughout these vindaloo-bewitched precincts, where a tandoor and delivery menu are sometimes all that a culinary entrepreneur needs to get by. It casts its spell visually, by making you feel as if you have been lifted -- lofted really -- to a realm more enchanted than any blue or red state could offer. Devi does not have the design budget or square footage of a Spice Market or a Megu, but it has a galaxy of brilliantly glowing glass fixtures -- white, red, blue, yellow and green -- that hang from the ceiling like gargantuan gemstones. It has a curved marble staircase that rises from the main dining room, each step flanked by votive candles, to a more intimate second floor that puts you at eye level with that sky of diamonds and rubies and sapphires. Best of all, Devi has chefs, Suvir Saran and Hemant Mathur, who do not feel bound by your expectations for Indian food. Yes, there is chicken tikka masala on the menu, but you have to hunt for it, and if you ask your server for suggestions, he will steer you in less tired directions. Toward the crispy fried okra, for example, which is dusted with ground mango peel, pomegranate seed and toasted cumin, for an effect so tangy and salty that this dish could easily oust potato skins or nachos as the new appetizer sensation at a T.G.I. Friday's. (I mean that as an unfettered compliment.) Or toward the cauliflower with ketchup. That is not, to be truthful, how Devi advertises the dish in question, but that is essentially what it is, and there is positively no shame in that. Manchurian cauliflower, to use the proper tag, pairs firm, crunchy florets with a tomato ketchup that has been spiked with garlic and chili peppers. It is entirely simple, crazily good and a fine example of Mr. Saran's laudable pragmatism: what matters is the bigness and seductiveness of the taste achieved, not the method for achieving it. Mr. Saran and Mr. Mathur previously teamed at the Indian restaurant Amma, which they left last April. Devi reprises many of Amma's hits and pursues the same goal of placing Indian cooking, or at least putatively Indian cooking, on a higher plane of New York City dining. That aspiration is perhaps most evident in an item available only on a seven-course tasting menu: a mash of calf's brain, green chili, quail eggs and pickled ginger that serves as the ethereal topping for a bruschetta. But that aspiration is also clear in the quality of seafood and meat that Devi puts into the tandoor. On both of the nights I tried them, the jumbo prawns, seasoned with toasted chickpea flour, cayenne, lemon, ginger and garlic, had a wonderful texture: slightly bouncy on the outside, soft within. Lamb chops, which had been marinated in yogurt, garlic and ginger, were faultless. Both the halibut and salmon at Devi are sealed and cooked in banana leaves and both emerged from their cocoons in splendidly moist form. But just when I was ready to pronounce Devi a master of all flesh, I waded into two different dishes -- one with a fiery curry sauce, the other with a marvelous gravy of pistachios, saffron and cream -- that included chunks of excessively chewy chicken. A beef entree -- sirloin pounded into thin strips -- was similarly tough and unappealing. In its bid for ""crispy,"" which was how the menu advertised it, it came up dry. Devi wobbles from time to time, and the prices for a few dishes are rather high in relation to the portions. A few of the restaurant's uniformly courteous servers are prone to distraction and more eager to please than efficient at it. Almost all of its desserts proved disappointing. I found only one, the ""falooda,"" a parfait that combined strawberry and mango sorbets with coconut-lemon-grass milk, that I truly liked. But there was much to compensate, including an unexpected standout: finely minced turkey with fenugreek leaves, spinach, cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and onions. It packs so many tastes of India into a hash so sublime that I feel happier and calmer just knowing it exists. I cannot guess whether, over the next four years, some of the acrimony of the past four months will lessen. But at least I know that if I need a vacation from the fighting and fretting, Devi is there for me. Devi  ** [Rating: Two stars]  8 East 18th Street; (212) 691-1300.

434,Sripraphai,2 star,"Nov. 3, 2004",Frank Bruni,Woodside,Thai,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/dining/a-thai-pilgrimage-leads-to-queens.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/03/dining/a-thai-pilgrimage-leads-to-queens.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IF you drew a straight line from midtown Manhattan to the restaurant Sripraphai in the Woodside section of Queens, it would not cross Kennedy Airport. It would not even come close. But my map reading skills are so poor, and my sense of direction so pitiful, that on a recent night a friend and I found ourselves barreling down the road toward long-term parking when we were supposed to be bound for short-term Thai. I had been entrusted with navigating while he drove, and this was a colossal mistake. The trip took us nearly two hours. The friendship almost flat-lined. Almost, but not quite, and that is a measure of the pleasure of Sripraphai (pronounced see-PRA-pie). He needed only a few spoonfuls of fragrant, revivifying tom yum soup to forget our odyssey. By the time he sampled the restaurant's roasted duck salad, its curry rice noodles and its sautéed ""drunken"" noodles, I had traveled in his estimation from cretin to genius, villain to hero, a culinary Columbus who had discovered an untrammeled new world. In truth I had followed the footprints of others. I just had not done so very concisely or coherently. Sripraphai has been around for more than a decade, and the most committed restaurant adventurers from outside Queens have long made pilgrimages to it. But plenty of less obsessive food lovers who would gladly venture to Woodside for something special do not know that this delicious destination awaits. They should. Sripraphai is to your corner Thai takeout what P. D. James is to Mary Higgins Clark: the real deal, well worth the extra time and effort. It is also about to expand and visually improve. Its Thai owner, Sripraphai Tipmanee, recognized that the original dining room, always spartan and charmless, had descended perhaps too far into outright frumpiness, and so she closed it last week for renovations and has moved for a month to an adjacent room next door, where the new blond wood furniture, black lacquered tables and clay-colored tile floor offer a preview of the restaurant's spiffier future. Come December, she said, the wall will come down, and Sripraphai will double to about 70 seats (not counting a back garden). I doubt it will bloom into a raving beauty, and I do not care. About the food at Sripraphai there can be no sarcasm and little complaint. I ordered that roasted duck salad on two occasions, rationalizing that I was performing a vital check of the restaurant's consistency and almost believing my argument. The truth: I was wild about this dish, and only partly because the ribbons of duck were more tender and flavorful than meat at many similarly inexpensive Asian restaurants, which tend to stint on the quality of flesh. What struck me even more forcefully were the variety and coordination of vegetables, herbs, spices and accents in the salad. Scallions, red onions, cucumbers, tomato, cilantro, lime juice, fish sauce, dried chili peppers and ground peanuts were all present in perfect proportion and perfect counterpoint, something tangy yielding to something soothing, a burst of cool mellowing a bit of fire. The balance of sweet, sour, salty and hot is what is often praised about Thai cooking, which focuses on bold flavors in blissful harmony. But at too many Thai restaurants in this country and this city the heat is tempered and the sweetness amplified as concessions to American palates. The spices are muted, the herbs less fresh than they could be and the lemon grass permitted to run roughshod over all else. Not at Sripraphai. Here the star anise, coriander and galangal sing clearly, identifiable voices that swell and recede as they hew to their carefully calibrated roles in a broader chorus. Sripraphai dutifully performs the requisite paces for a Thai restaurant in New York. You can have your pad thai and your chicken satay, and you can rest assured that this restaurant's executions of them will be very fine. You can have your curries, and I can promise that none of them will disappoint you, although all of them may surprise you, because they have nuances and a nimbleness often lacking in the curries at lesser Thai restaurants. You can have a classic dish of ground pork with ginger, chili and tart citrus, and you will indeed find peanuts in the mix, but you will not find an overload of them. Sripraphai veers away from such easy effects. But you can also make less conventional choices, and I would urge you to. Try, for example, the beef tendon soup, which comes in light or dark broths, the latter signaling the presence of blood. Several friends and I went the dark route and found ourselves engrossed by the hints of cinnamon and the salty bits of crackling that peeked through and crucially leavened the bluntness of everything around it. Try the pickled barbecued pork, which has a bracing tartness that does to your palate what astringent does to your skin. I was impressed by the deft seasoning and cooking of the pork, beef and chicken that appeared in a variety of ways and a variety of dishes, my favorite being those long, broad, flat drunken noodles, entwined with red peppers, green peppers, garlic, holy basil and fish and soy sauces. I was less impressed with the seafood. A disappointing papaya salad featured hard shrimp, tough calamari and relatively tasteless mussels. Sripraphai has additional limitations. It does not sell alcohol, although you can come with your own, and a nearby store sells beer. Its mostly gelatinous, often cloying Thai desserts, on display in prepackaged containers in the dining room, are not for everyone (and were not for me). But the bang for buck here is atomic. For those without wheels or navigational skills, the 61st Street stop on the No. 7 train is nearby. The smiling servers are both kind and wise: if you puff up your chest and request your dishes very spicy, they will rightly redirect you to moderately spicy, which is spicy enough. Like Pam Real Thai in Midtown and too few other Thai restaurants in New York, this one does not pander. But it sure does delight.

435,Indochine,1 star,"Oct. 13, 2004",Frank Bruni,East Village,"French, Vietnamese",https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/13/dining/it-was-hot-it-was-cool-that-was-then.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/13/dining/it-was-hot-it-was-cool-that-was-then.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"I CANNOT remember many details of my visits to Indochine in the 1980's, like where I sat or whom I ogled, but I vividly recall how special being at Indochine made me feel. Famous singers, actors and models went there. Political bigwigs and avant-garde artists went there. And the rest of us went there, if we could somehow luck into a table, even one at the farthest fringe of Indochine's starry galaxy, because we got to grab on to just a bit of all that glitter. Did we eat? Did they? Maybe a little. Maybe not. Food was beside the point of Indochine, which was the epitome of cool, the epicenter of hot, the apotheosis of an extremely profitable idea: the downtown restaurant as badge of knowingness and belonging. Indochine was the child of Odeon and the sire of Balthazar, but it burned brighter in its way and its time than any of the other Brian or Keith McNally restaurants, and so it seemed the most ephemeral. Could something as perishable as Indochine possibly last? Yes, it turns out, and no. Indochine is celebrating its 20th birthday this month, and it still flaunts a noisy and crowded dining room, a tropical-bordello décor and a gaunt, gorgeous crew of servers who look as if they have just tumbled out of beds in which sleeping was not a priority. But Indochine as it once existed inevitably died (and not just because Brian McNally sold it in 1992). In its place stands a museum, more or less, that draws young people who clearly consider it an anachronistic hoot, patrons of the Joseph Papp Public Theater or the Blue Man Group who need a nearby trough, Midwestern and European tourists who do not know any better, and Iman. ""That's her,"" a server confided to a friend and me when we dined at Indochine on a recent night. ""Over there, at that large table. She's in here all the time."" Really? I squinted. I could not quite make out the former supermodel, who is married to David Bowie. Our server offered to walk over and stand behind her. ""I'll need a signal of some kind,"" I said conspiratorially. She whispered, ""I'll scratch my hair,"" then stood over Iman and did precisely that. In the old days of course Iman was the umpteenth beautiful wraith at the umpteenth charmed table on which Vietnamese spring rolls, not yet ubiquitous, qualified as exotic props. The Indochine of yore would not have needed or deigned to point her out. The Indochine of now has a looser etiquette and less pride. I was drawn there this time around by astonishment that it was still open and intense curiosity about what it had become, about the temperature of a paradigmatic hot spot once the sun had stopped shining on it. On various nights I brought friends who are usually in the mood for a lark and occasionally good with a wisecrack. We turned our jaded eyes toward the familiar bamboo and wicker furniture in the front lounge area, the tropical trees that are still scattered throughout the place and the trademark wallpaper with gargantuan banana leaves. What had once looked exotic now looked campy, maybe because we had all been there and done that. ""Is this the 80's,"" said one friend, ""or Rue McClanahan's bedroom on 'The Golden Girls'?"" Our group of four was led that night to one of the roomy, high-backed, circular booths that were always Indochine's most coveted niches. It had the same tucked-away appeal that these booths had always had. But it looked out on a landscape with a changed population. A group of people in their 20's, badly dressed and badly groomed, occupied a table nearby, and at one point, if our ears did not fail us, they shouted at one another to do shots. ""It was different in the 80's,"" said my quipster friend, who visited Indochine often during that decade. ""Back then if you made noise, it was because you were attractive."" Back then the kind of Asian-inspired food that Indochine served was more novel and perhaps much better. The last time the restaurant was reviewed by The New York Times, in 1988, Bryan Miller gave it two stars. But many of the gooey or deep-fried objects that came our way on this night and others had either no character or too much of it, their flavors muddled, their seasoning scattershot. They tasted tossed-off, generic, like something you might get from a chain hotel that was doing Vietnamese room service. ""It's a pu pu platter that's lost its way,"" said my pithy friend. We passed around a plate of the evening's appetizer special, called ""won ton shrimp."" A crunchy batter not only encased the shellfish but also formed a series of strands that dangled from it like the legs of a centipede. If your goal were to make a harmlessly oily dish look as repulsive as one of the gastronomic challenges served to gagging contestants on ""Fear Factor,"" this would be a wise way to go. During my recent visits to Indochine, the sauces tended to be too sweet. The meat and fish tended to be mistreated. I had overcooked duck, overdressed beef, rock-hard shrimp. But here is the odd, crazy thing: I also had a decent time, and the main reason was not Indochine's delectable cocktails, especially the Indochine martini, made with pineapple, ginger, lime juice and Triple Sec. It was not the respectable desserts, especially the coconut crème brûlée. It was the way the servers strutted and sidled as if the 1980's had never ended, as if the sexy beat went on. The Indochine dining room is usually that degree of dark that graciously air-brushes everyone's wrinkles and pores, and when I was there, the soundtrack was heavy with hits from the 1980's. If I closed my eyes and flexed my imagination, I could almost smell the cigarette smoke and hear the sniffling of people who had gone to the bathroom to powder their noses. I could travel back to a more careless time. The way in which Indochine makes that possible may well be why Iman still comes around and why Paper magazine did a photo shoot for its 20th anniversary issue there. Some places are so evocative of an era and sensibility that they cannot die. They must survive as relics and reminders, to be savored by those who did not experience them in real time and to inspire nostalgia or laughter in those who did.

436,Convivium Osteria,1 star,"Oct. 6, 2004",Frank Bruni,Park Slope North,"Italian, Portuguese, Spanish",https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/06/dining/reviews/italy-and-iberia-consorting-amiably.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/06/dining/reviews/italy-and-iberia-consorting-amiably.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"CUISINES end up married for all sorts of reasons: a chef's inspiration, perhaps, or the movement of one ethnic group to another's turf. At Convivium Osteria in Brooklyn, the cause and agent are love. Italian and Portuguese are bed mates on the menu because the Italian chef and the Portuguese manager are bed mates off it. Carlo Pulixi, the chef, and Michelle Pulixi, the manager, have family trees planted in different patches of European soil: his in Italy, hers in Portugal. When the couple opened this charming restaurant on the fringe of Park Slope nearly four years ago, they decided not to favor either bloodline. They even went a step further, splitting the geographical distance between their heritages and adding Spanish dishes to the menu. That menu, written in Italian, Portuguese and Spanish, is like a dual-purpose primer on Romance languages and southern European cooking: Berlitz with bacalao. Seafood is translated ""al pescador"" for a Spanish assortment of tapas and ""de peixe"" for a Portuguese stew. I got nourishment, a new vocabulary and a fruity, feisty Ribera del Duero with which to wash it all down. Convivium Osteria is primarily a neighborhood restaurant, of the kind and level that every neighborhood wants. It does not force you to splurge, but it allows you to. You can eat conventionally or graze. Convivium accommodates different moods, and it changes with the seasons, opening up a lovely back garden with a wisteria-covered trellis during warm months. And it does a few things well enough to argue for attention from food lovers from more than a few blocks away. One of those things, as it happens, is steak. Inspired less by its muse countries than by an appreciation for sheer gluttony, Convivium offers a thick, broad rib-eye for two. The beef comes from Niman Ranch, and the steak comes to the table on a wood board, with an extremely sharp, long knife that looks like the gleaming love child of a scalpel and a machete. A server uses it to carve a few smoky, tender slices, then lets you use it to carve many more. The experience turns into a thrilling piece of participatory theater: ""The Carnivore Cometh."" The pleasures for a carnivore on the Convivium menu are many. Tender slices of pork loin are accompanied by small coins of chorizo, which are meant to join the loin in each forkful, bringing a crispiness and a saltiness to the fleshy fun. A roasted baby chicken -- succulent on the night that a friend and I tried it -- was splayed on the plate in a way that all but demanded that it be picked up. Or maybe we thought so and heeded that call simply because we wanted to get to the meat closest to the bone. A platter of cured meats and cheeses, listed as an appetizer for two, has serrano ham, chorizo and Italian speck, all first-rate. A friend and I ordered it at dusk one evening, as we waited for a tardy companion, and it perfectly accomplished such a platter's occasional mission of occupying people who are simultaneously trying to tame their hunger and pass an indeterminate period of time. We nibbled, we talked, we tried slivers of meat and wedges of Spanish cheeses (Cabrales, Roncal, Garrotxa). Our friend finally arrived, and there was still plenty for her. All dinners at Convivium begin with a bowl of olives and a basket of terrific bread, soft on the inside and crunchy on the outside. The quality of the appetizers varies widely, with a few too many failing to make a strong impression. These underperformers include the fried fillets of salted codfish we tasted on one night and the braised artichokes we tasted on another. Grilled baby octopus with black olives and celery was too tender on the outside, not tender enough on the inside and phlegmatic through and through. In contrast, roasted whole prawns had all the right textures, and the coarse sea salt that seasoned them was a simple, well-chosen stroke. But there were just three of them, for $17, and they should have been elephantine at that price. (They were not.) A much better value, for $9, was a salad of perfectly cooked string beans and bits of hard-boiled egg, a pairing of crunchy and slick textures that worked superbly. Among entrees, the most disappointing was a rack of lamb with a pine nut crust that was too thick and too intrusive. The most satisfying, in addition to the steak and chicken, was a dish of half-moon pockets of pasta that had been filled with duck, topped with shredded radicchio and speck and placed on a tawny, shallow pond of porcini cream sauce. A filling and pleasing salted codfish casserole with mashed potatoes and spinach tasted like a Portuguese spin on shepherd's pie. The standout desserts are a crisp apple tart and a silky chocolate cake, which is served with a heaping mound of freshly whipped cream. Michelle Pulixi makes these, in a fashion untethered by her ancestry, which is part Irish as well. She simply bakes what strikes her as delicious. The service could -- and should -- be better. Tell a server you need 10 more seconds to make up your mind, and he may disappear for the next 10 minutes. Do not go to Convivium if you are in a hurry, but know that even forced lingering feels good here. Much of the soft romantic light comes from tall, slender candles, some arranged like sconces on walls that have been made, with sponge painting, to look as if they are centuries old. Copper pots hang from racks mounted on those walls. You can almost believe that you are in a rustic haunt in Rome, or for that matter in Lisbon. The Pulixis deposit you at the Strait of Gibraltar and let you decide: east or west; his or hers. They chose both, which was no doubt maritally sensible. It turns out to be gastronomically rewarding as well. Convivium Osteria  * [Rating: One Star]  68 Fifth Avenue (St Mark's Place), Park Slope, Brooklyn; (718) 857-1833.

437,5 Ninth,1 star,"Sept. 22, 2004",Frank Bruni,West Village,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/22/dining/in-the-meatpacking-district-packed-in.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/22/dining/in-the-meatpacking-district-packed-in.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"SELDOM has a Manhattan neighborhood gone from intriguing to annoying -- from on-the-cusp to over-the-top -- with the distressing speed and depressing thoroughness of the meatpacking district. It is not really a neighborhood anymore. It is an urban theme park: a gaudy epicurean grab bag that weds cuisines from here and there to cocktails from the here and now. It is a ""Sex and the City"" fantasy in which would-be Carries and could-be Bigs look for love and settle for lamb under supremely flattering lighting. The lighting is terrific at 5 Ninth; the would-be's are at every third table, and they are pressed in tight. This sexy, exciting, exasperating restaurant is not for anyone who wants peace and calm. Like its neighborhood, it is for people who crave the jostle of too many bodies in too limited a space. It is also for people willing to choose unsteady exuberance over steady expertise. It has style and energy to burn, but 5 Ninth lacks discipline and judgment in terms of its service and, to a lesser extent, its food. It feels adolescent: ambitious but imprudent, creative but sloppy. Its chef, Zak Pelaccio, did a brief stint at the short-lived Chickenbone Cafe in Brooklyn, where his culinary eclecticism and adventurousness generated more than a bit of buzz. He has brought those traits and that buzz with him to 5 Ninth, which opened in late May. Named for its address and avenue, 5 Ninth actually refuses to be fixed in any one place: even more than most restaurants in these boundary-blurring times, it defies simple categorization. Asian-American? Malaysian-Mediterranean? Thai-Vietnamese-Italian? You could try a dozen geographical references, allow yourself three or four hyphens and still come up short. ""Serious global dazzle"" is how the publicity materials for the restaurant characterize Mr. Pelaccio's cuisine. That is a felicitous phrase with one serious flaw: at least at 5 Ninth, his food manages to dazzle only half of the time. When it is good, it is excellent, a symphony of grace notes in gorgeous balance. Several friends and I shared a steamed loup de mer, also known as branzino, that was beyond succulent. Its seasonings -- including lime juice, coriander root, bird's-eye chili and garlic -- provided hints of flavor that swirled into and out of the mix, hovering briefly, never lingering too long. Two other entrees were also quiet knockouts. One mingled slices of seared duck breast with slices of seared foie gras and roasted figs, arranged so that it was easy to get all three of those players -- meaty, gooey and sweet -- into each bite. The other entree was a baby chicken that had been gently cooked with white wine and a generous amount of deeply aromatic rosemary in a small cast iron pot. It came to the table in that pot and could not have tasted much moister, simpler or more satisfying. How, then, to explain the roasted squab of another night? It could not have been much tougher, and one friend had such trouble cutting into it that servers not only noticed his vain, heroic efforts but, to their credit, insisted on taking the entree off the bill. Or the grilled goat of a different night? It was presented as an unrefined excursion into unfettered protein. But a bit of extra butchering would have been appreciated. Excessively bony and fatty, the goat was difficult and unappealing to eat. The greatest puzzle of all, however, was a lobster appetizer that buried the sea's sweetest flesh in a coffin of fried batter that rendered it indistinguishable. Why put such a delicacy to such indelicate use? Above and beyond those scattered misfires, there is an impressive balance and diversity of meat and fish on the frequently changing menu at 5 Ninth, where I sampled, as appetizers or entrees, tuna belly and octopus, wild salmon and halibut, beef short ribs and lamb shoulder. Most were nicely cooked. The menu also has a separate category for noodles. A signature dish called noodles raja chulan features an engrossing broth of coconut milk, fish stock, Thai chili, garlic, ginger and shallots. A lusty dish of garganelli comes with braised lamb hearts and Parmesan. If the food at 5 Ninth is occasionally befuddling, the service is much more so. One night my friends and I waited more than 30 minutes for our table; another night we waited nearly 40 minutes for our appetizers. The bread that was supposed to come at the beginning of one meal never materialized, and the espresso that came at the end was lukewarm at best. We ordered blueberry crisp and got raspberry crisp, although the dessert menu and our server had not made note of the substitution. That menu promised peanut butter ice cream with the ""chocolate sandwich,"" but cherry ice cream arrived. 5 Ninth is also hindered by an awkward layout. Spread over a three-story town house with wood-beamed ceilings, many fireplaces and a leafy garden out back, the restaurant looks fabulous. But the kitchen is in the basement, while the main dining room is on the second floor. As a result servers are clumping up and down the stairs and often muscling their way through a tangle of bodies in the first-floor bar area. The lanes of foot traffic are easily jammed. And the town house is so narrow that 5 Ninth, in order to maximize the space, has a few tables that barely fit two people but are used for three or four. For some diners, no doubt, the crowded, frenetic air of the restaurant is an adrenaline-pumping (or maybe pheromone-priming) turn-on. It certainly connects 5 Ninth to its addling environs, toward which the restaurant exhibits an interesting ambivalence. Its only identifying mark is a tiny numeral on its inconspicuous front door. 5 Ninth seems to be coyly retreating from its neighbors, trying to stand a few refined paces apart. That goal is laudable, and not yet attained. 5 Ninth  * [Rating: One Star]  5 Ninth Avenue (Gansevoort Street), meatpacking district; (212) 929-9460.

438,Donguri,2 star,"Sept. 15, 2004",Frank Bruni,Upper East Side,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/dining/reviews/a-japanese-secret-fresh-and-simple.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/dining/reviews/a-japanese-secret-fresh-and-simple.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IN recent years restaurateurs in Manhattan have increasingly embraced Japanese as one of the cuisines best suited to stylish, visually arresting, loud and large restaurants, the kind with ruinously expensive cocktails in ridiculously bright hues. Japanese has become culinary fodder for all-purpose fabulousness, a low-carbohydrate prop in elaborate theatrical productions that are ultimately about much more than food. But not at Donguri, a Japanese restaurant that directs your attention squarely to what is on your plate. Where else would you look? What else could distract you? The dining room is tiny, unadorned and merely functional, with just 24 seats. There is no music, and there are no martinis, traditional or newfangled. The people sitting at the adjacent table are not talking about ""Entourage"" and trying to look as casually fashionable as the characters in that HBO show. They have their noses deep in bowls of buckwheat noodles, and they are much too content to be self-conscious about the slurping sounds they are making. Donguri is an antihip Japanese restaurant, matter-of-fact and brightly lighted, with servers who briskly and almost wordlessly ferry dishes to and from the kitchen, their banter minimal as they strive to make sure your tabletop is never, ever barren. It feels like a Japanese trattoria or bistro, to borrow terms from other dining traditions. It serves what some of its many longtime fans call Japanese home cooking or Japanese comfort food: lightly fried fish in addition to sashimi, simply grilled chicken with ponzu sauce as well as tempura. You do not come here to sit and pose. You come here to eat well. Donguri was opened in 1998 by Shuji Fujita, who runs the kitchen, and his wife, Michiko, who presides over the dining room. Since then it has evolved into a Manhattan-restaurant oxymoron: the successful secret. It is not even listed in the current Zagat Survey. The people who know about it tend not to talk it up, lest they find themselves unable to get a seat. But my mandate and my nature are to tattle -- make that share -- and so I am doing precisely that. Give Donguri a try, but call first and make a reservation. And know that even if you do that, you may nonetheless find yourself waiting for 10 to 20 minutes on the curb outside. Donguri has no bar, no lounge. It barely has a foyer. Your meal will begin with a small, complimentary dish that will be the first signal that you are in a charmed realm of supremely fresh, utterly straightforward food. One night a friend and I received about eight tiny shrimp, still in their shells, still with their heads. They had been thrown, while alive, into corn oil and deep-fried for just an instant. ""Eat whole,"" said our server, in tentative English and a soft voice. ""Be careful. Very sharp."" They were, with ridges and edges that vaguely scratched the inside of my mouth and made the experience all the more exciting. Another night our meal started with a Lilliputian bowl of pickled vegetables in a cold miso broth and along with it a broiled rectangle of tofu with a pinprick of wasabi on top. Again, so simple. Again, so good. If the lengthy list of daily specials includes oysters, order them. The Kumamoto oysters that several friends and I had one night were first-rate. So was the sashimi that followed. On the nights I visited Donguri the restaurant did not offer sushi, and the sashimi options had been edited down -- in a way that I greatly appreciated -- to a few fresh selections: kanpachi, which is a kind of yellowtail; sea urchin; bluefin; and bluefin otoro and chutoro. The toro, subtly stippled with fat and buttery in texture, was our favorite. Toro usually is. You build a meal at Donguri through a succession of small and medium-size plates, proceeding in general from cold to hot and from fish to meat, and you throw in some vegetable sides and perhaps a bowl of noodles along the way. All of this makes for a pleasantly paced experience in which the grazing almost never stops. But it also translates into a bill that can be higher than the generally restrained prices of individual items and the plainness of the atmosphere lead you to believe it will be. You can easily spend $60 a person on food, and much more if you order some wine, from an extremely short but judicious list, or sake, a much broader selection of which is available. Raw and cooked, sautéed and deep-fried, fish predominates on the Donguri menu. My favorites included grilled squid, which was a special one night. It was unusually supple and had been seasoned only with salt, although there were scallions and grated ginger on the side. Just as good was the broiled Chilean sea bass, a staple on the menu, which had been marinated in dashi, sake, soy sauce and pickled yuzu. The tempura at Donguri -- shrimp, sweet potato, lotus root, maitake mushroom, zucchini and other kinds -- is dependably airy, faintly crunchy and never oily. The boiled spinach with sesame sauce might not draw your eye, but make room for it on your table. That sauce bears only slight relation to the gloppy, gooey sesame paste that so many Chinese takeout places ladle indiscriminately onto cold noodles. It is much nimbler, much more finely balanced. Among limited dessert options, the sliced Asian pear that we tried was fresh and refreshing, and the interplay between sweet and savory in vanilla ice cream with red bean sauce made for a satisfying conclusion to a more than satisfying meal. Donguri is the kind of restaurant at which you could happily eat once every week or two, and I got the sense that a significant percentage of the diners around me do precisely that. Some of them were Japanese and were speaking that language. Many of them seemed to know the servers well and vice versa. That familiarity lent an easygoing air to the restaurant, which lacks the polish or sparkle to qualify as a big night out. It is more like a little night in, and a memorable one at that. Donguri  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  309 East 83rd Street (Second Avenue); (212) 737-5656. ATMOSPHERE -- A tiny, brightly lighted room with 24 seats and a long, unpainted brick wall with a few small oil paintings on it.  SOUND LEVEL -- Moderate.  RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Kumamoto oysters; chutoro and otoro sashimi; kanpachi sashimi; shrimp tempura; boiled spinach with sesame sauce; broiled Chilean sea bass; grilled chicken with ponzu sauce.  WINE LIST -- Just four whites, three reds and about a dozen kinds of sake, available by the glass, half-bottle or bottle and described succinctly and poetically on a menu bound with red, green or purple ribbon.  PRICE RANGE -- Appetizers, $3.50 to $28.00. Entrees, $13 to $26. Five-course tasting menu, $42. Eight-course tasting menu, $62.  HOURS -- Tuesday through Sunday, 5:30 to 9:45 p.m.  RESERVATIONS -- Absolutely essential, due to the size of the place. Call at least several days or a week ahead.  CREDIT CARDS -- All major cards.  WHEELCHAIR ACCESS -- Although the restaurant is at street level, it is too cramped for most wheelchairs, and the restroom is not accessible.

439,Ici,1 star,"July 21, 2004",Frank Bruni,Fort Greene,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/21/dining/restaurants-a-french-soul-wrapped-in-a-picket-fence.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/21/dining/restaurants-a-french-soul-wrapped-in-a-picket-fence.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"A TALL maple tree shades the Brooklyn backyard of Ici, a sweet new restaurant full of unpretentious pleasures. One of them is that broad canopy of leaves, under which I dined on a recent night. It filtered the last rays of sunlight and shimmied in a slight summer breeze, accentuating the feeling of calm that Ici weaves. I lifted my gaze to the darkening sky; I lifted a glass of a bracing southern Italian white wine to my lips. I was happy. When the food came, it prolonged and even deepened that spell. There was arugula at the start, and it is hard to imagine that it could have been fresher, or more sensibly dressed. A hint of bitter lemon clung to the greens. A diffuse sheen of olive oil tempered the lemon's bite. These ingredients and flavors were more like suggestions than outright presences, diffident stagehands rather than histrionic scene stealers. A salad can be produced with much more fanfare -- this one added fennel and grana Padano cheese to the mix -- but that does not make it any better. There was cod later on, with a refreshing Provençal-style sauce of tomato, garlic and onions, and my fork cut easily through the flesh rather than bouncing off it, as happens too often with a fish that can turn rubbery in the care of a careless kitchen. There was a plum tart after that, the ripe, sweet fruit buttressed by firm, flaky pastry. And along the way, bridging the beginning and the end, there was much -- perhaps too much -- wine. The Italian white was followed by several nimble French reds. When a server asked if I wanted yet another glass, I sheepishly muttered, ''I'm afraid I do.'' ''Don't be afraid,'' she said, her French accent and her sure delivery making the command sound oracular. ''There is the French paradox.'' She was referring to a belief that drinking wine saves many French people, with their fat-rich diets, from heart disease. She was giving me an excuse and an out, which I seized. There is a restaurant paradox, too. Sometimes restaurants succeed precisely because they do not try too hard. Because they are humble in reach. Because they are what they are, and they know what that is. Ici provides a good example. Its menu is extremely brief, with as few as a half-dozen appetizers and a half-dozen entrees. The handiwork behind some dishes is as simple as a sauté pan, butter and a few accents and herbs. There are only about 30 wines available -- all of them European, most of them French and many from small producers that eschew pesticides and embrace biodynamic techniques. Those criteria translate into curiosity-piquing selections, like that Italian white: a falanghina, which is an ancient varietal, made by Ocone. There is not a great deal by way of décor, but the walls in the 40-seat dining room, which is on the ground floor of a brownstone in Fort Greene, are freshly and immaculately painted, and they have handsome sconces that throw soft light. Ici has the intentions and soul of a neighborhood bistro, not a destination restaurant, although it turns out to be a very pleasant destination. It does not try to wow but to soothe, and every time I lingered there, I felt tranquil and content, in a modest way that befitted the place. For its married owners as well as its customers, Ici represents a retreat: it is what happens when two people who love restaurants but have soured on the scene decide to jettison all that jangle. Laurent and Catherine Saillard, both of whom are French, have the pooled experience of Bouley, Balthazar, Alain Ducasse and Pastis in their restaurant pasts. Mr. Saillard, who is in charge of the Ici menu, also put in time as the general manager of Rocco's, and appeared on the television reality show ''The Restaurant,'' coming across as a haughty villain. He told me during a recent telephone conversation that he hated that image. He said that he and his wife opened Ici so they could walk to work (they live a few blocks away), keep their 1- and 3-year-old sons underfoot and do things their own way. That way involves produce from nearby farms. It involves grass-fed beef from Arizona for the hanger steak, which is served in a terrific red wine and shallot sauce, and organic poultry for the roasted chicken, which comes with lemon-flavored couscous. It involves a comforting spaetzle appetizer with fresh corn, shards of dark chicken meat and tarragon. One of the other best appetizers is a frisée salad with smoked bluefish and a creamy horseradish dressing: it manages the trick of robustness without heaviness. The best entrees may well be the cod and the buttery skate, which features toasted hazelnuts and capers. Even within the limited scope of Ici's ambitions, not everything works. Mr. Saillard usually puts a pasta on the menu, and the one I sampled, with ricotta and asparagus, was dull. The roasted chicken on the night I tried it was seriously overcooked. Among the otherwise good desserts, the panna cotta had a lavender glaze that made me feel like I was licking a perfume bottle. But Ici does not promise perfection, and it delivers many small, happy surprises. It serves breakfast, including a fluffy vegetable frittata and a devilishly rich, homemade chocolate croissant. It has a vibrant mix of white, black, gay, straight, elderly and young customers, including plenty of neighborhood toddlers. That back garden has 36 seats and a white picket fence. And throughout the restaurant, there are little and big bunches of fresh fruit. My dinner check one night came with a trio of red cherries atop it, like paperweights. They were not so much exclamation points as little ellipses, and that was the right punctuation for Ici. Ici * [Rating: One Star] 246 Dekalb Avenue (Vanderbilt Avenue), Fort Greene, Brooklyn; (718) 789-2778. ATMOSPHERE -- A warm, simply decorated room in a brownstone opens to a large, tree-shaded garden. SERVICE -- Friendly, low-key, informed. SOUND LEVEL -- Modest, especially relative to many Manhattan restaurants. RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Vegetable frittata with Cheddar cheese (breakfast only); smoked fish and frisée salad; arugula salad; spaetzle with braised chicken and corn; hanger steak; sautéed cod; skate with hazelnuts; fresh fruit tart; chocolate pot de crème.

440,Wolfgang's Steakhouse,2 star,"June 30, 2004",Frank Bruni,Midtown South,Steak Houses,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/30/dining/restaurants-eat-up-but-don-t-tell-your-cardiologist.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/30/dining/restaurants-eat-up-but-don-t-tell-your-cardiologist.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ONE question more than any other hovers over Wolfgang's Steakhouse and its odds for success: are the juicy, buttery porterhouses here as delectably exceptional, in taste as well as heft, as the ones across the East River, at Peter Luger? In other words, does Wolfgang's manage to hold onto the beefy rapture as it edits out Brooklyn and the Williamsburg Bridge? An answer to that required a very special journey on a very caloric night, during which a friend and I willingly (and, truth be told, gleefully) sacrificed our cardiovascular futures on the altar of Thorough and Accurate Scientific Research. At 6:43, we had the Steak for Two at Wolfgang's. At 9:21, we had the Steak for Two at Luger. At 10:27, we should have had coronary bypass procedures. Instead, we called a taxi, then rode back to Manhattan in the deep silence of our shared protein comas, calculating how many years we had shaved off our lives and wondering whether we would ever again have reason, at company expense, to repeat the experiment. We certainly hoped so. The results follow in a bit, after an explanation of how Luger and Wolfgang's fit together and come apart. Wolfgang's does not refer to Wolfgang Puck but to Wolfgang Zwiener, who for many decades was the head waiter at Luger, the most celebrated steakhouse in New York City. His long service there gave him some access to the Luger secrets for making beef taste so great. He and his co-owners, including one of his sons and two former Luger waiters, endeavor to replicate this process at Wolfgang's, where steaks hang in a dry-aging box in the basement for weeks, then are cooked under a high-temperature broiler that produces a deeply charred exterior. As at Luger, the porterhouses at Wolfgang's are sized as Steak for Two, Three or Four and served on a tilted dish that lets blood and butter form a healthful dipping pool at one end. But Wolfgang's also tries to correct Luger's perceived inconveniences and limitations. It is simultaneously Luger-minus and Luger-plus, its sire's influence obvious in each deviation from, or genuflection before, the original. Wolfgang's stakes its claim smack in Midtown Manhattan. Unlike Luger, it takes major credit cards. There is a wider variety of salads, and Wolfgang's makes more than a perfunctory nod in the direction of the sea. Chilled crab meat and oysters have been added to the obligatory shrimp cocktail. For main courses, there is swordfish, yellowfin tuna, salmon and lobster. Wolfgang's also has the benefit of a beautiful main dining room in what used to be the Vanderbilt Hotel. The vaulted ceilings, tiled in blue and white, are designated as landmarks and a glory to behold. The atmosphere nonetheless feels gruff. The wait staff is all male and more efficient than warm. On my first visit, which preceded my porterhouse-a-palooza by several weeks, women were sparse in the early-evening dinner crowd, and the men had brought the bantam boisterousness of the trading floor into the restaurant, which was too loud for comfort. ''I feel like I'm in a gym,'' said one of my guests, who had never been in one. I set her straight: no Crunch would stay in business with clients who were carrying around, or rapidly accruing, this much paunch. Wolfgang's doles out mammoth portions, straight through dessert. I had a slice of cheesecake that was big enough for its own treadmill. It was also delicious. Other gargantuan desserts and large dishes ran the gamut from bad (a nut-deprived pecan pie, a tough slab of the swordfish) to satisfactory (a meaty but bland crab cake, overcooked lamb chops) to very good (the tuna, which was nicely grilled, and German potatoes, with sweeter onions than the Luger version). Best of all was the beef. A rib-eye steak (not on the Luger menu) yielded striations of color and texture: the black, crisp exterior gave way to soft red pinpricks in the center. A sirloin had similar virtues, and so did the porterhouse, arguably the raison d'être of Wolfgang's and Luger. My cholesterol-impervious friend and I tried just a few slices, knowing there would be more in another borough, at a later hour. Then we each had another slice. It was definitely time to stop. We had another. The meat was many wonderful things at once, or in rapid succession: crunchy, tender, smoky, earthy. It induced a kind of euphoria -- and a stab of guilt. We walked all the way to Williamsburg. Our gluttony demanded penance. The Luger porterhouse demanded awe. It was, amazingly, even better, chiefly because the steak had been cut about an eighth of an inch thicker (we measured), which allowed for more contrast between the exterior and interior. Luger also hewed to our medium-rare request. Wolfgang's had overbroiled. But not by much. I'll go back -- in two or three months, which is when I expect my arteries to reopen. Wolfgang's Steakhouse ** [Rating: two stars] 4 Park Avenue (33rd Street), Midtown; (212) 889-3369. ATMOSPHERE -- A beautiful room with vaulted tiled ceilings over thick clouds of testosterone.

441,Megu,2 star,"June 16, 2004",Frank Bruni,TriBeCa,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/16/dining/restaurants-a-menu-as-prodigious-as-the-prices.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/16/dining/restaurants-a-menu-as-prodigious-as-the-prices.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE menu at Megu begins with some counsel, or rather cheerleading, asking you to explore the 9 ensuing pages -- 12 if you count the glossary of ingredients and the map of Japan -- ''as you would a beautiful garden.'' What a lovely wish, and what a ludicrous one. Without a machete and a G.P.S. device, there is no easy way to navigate this thicket. ''It's all good,'' said a waiter, chuckling nervously, when I asked about the seemingly infinite iterations of toro and Kobe, sushi and sashimi, clumped into such semantically indistinct categories as ''Gems From Japan,'' ''Jewels From Japan,'' ''Crown Gems'' and ''Crown Jewels.'' Were these starters or main courses? Little tastes or big bites? Best eaten in a certain sequence? ''Order a lot,'' the waiter suggested, which did not really help. But it did hint at the overarching problem with Megu, a flamboyant addition to the expanding ranks of Japanese restaurants in New York. In too many ways, Megu is oblivious to the not-so-fine lines between welcome extravagance and unwelcome excess, bewitching theatricality and befuddling foolishness. If it reined itself in, it might be one of the most thrilling dining experiences in the city. It occupies a colossal space in TriBeCa that used to be the restaurant Obeca Li and received a magnificent, roughly $8 million, makeover. Its chef, Koji Imai, making his American debut, puts top-tier ingredients to often sumptuous use. Those ''Crown Gems,'' for example, are three tartarelike treatments of a subspecies of blackfin tuna with ruby-colored flesh so bright that it really does glitter, so meltingly tender that it seems to evaporate on your tongue. My favorite of the three dishes inserts cubes of the tuna between thick, silky slices of avocado that uncannily echo the fish's texture and richness. The Kobe beef, which comes from Texas, is so deeply flavorful that it almost makes you swoon, and if the $180 price tag on a seven-ounce fillet makes you stagger, you can order, instead, paper-thin ribbons of rib meat, which are $30. You cook the ribbons yourself, on a hot rock that a server brings to you. Then you dip them in a sesame sauce, a soy sauce or sea salt (the best choice), each of which fills a separate chamber of a series of gorgeous condiment plates. Megu contrives a nonstop carnival of sensations, but it also makes you pay dearly for the adventure, showing as little inhibition with prices as it does with everything -- except portions. You can easily spend $100 a person on food alone and find yourself hungry again three hours later. That $30 serving of Kobe is not much larger than an appetizer. A sushi combination platter runs $60 a person and is not enough for a full meal. ''Most of the fish is flown in daily from Japan,'' a waiter proudly explained. ''It couldn't travel coach?'' one of my guests quietly grumbled. Nine medium-size asparagus spears cost $21; they are planted vertically in an enormous bowl of glowing ice, which is illuminated from below by a blue light. Dinner at Megu, in other words, is likely to be more expensive than dinner at Nobu, which is about four blocks away and terrific. But Megu can claim some advantages. With nearly 300 seats over two floors, it offers much greater hope for a reservation. It has an ice Buddha, remade daily, that shimmers in the center of the main dining room beneath a gargantuan temple bell. It also has crickets, or at least the faint, teasing sound of them, piped into the restrooms to evoke a summer night in the country. There is no end to Megu's nifty inventions and cloying gimmicks, and significant overlap between the two. Instead of using the green-tinged horseradish that many restaurants use, Megu sends servers out with real wasabi roots, to be grated at diners' tables. What results is a milder, more pleasant paste -- and maybe a self-conscious performance. ''It actually takes five years for this root to grow,'' said a philosophically inclined server. ''Then I grate it in one night. This makes me think about time.'' That server was no wordier than the sake list, 10 pages of fairly ornate prose. I veered instead toward the special cocktails and especially liked the Blessing, whose name is the translation of megu. A vodka-based cousin to the cosmopolitan, it features pomegranate juice and comes with purple, blue or yellow flower petals on the surface. I also liked, or loved, more than three-quarters of the food I ate at Megu. Among the dozens of sushi and sashimi options, I came across creamy sea urchin that had the pitch-perfect degree of brininess. Among the meats that Megu grills over bincho tan, a Japanese charcoal, I relished four Kobe beef skewers, each with a different paste: wasabi, miso, sesame and garlic. Sautéed shrimp in a cream sauce of kanzuri, a combination of citrus and chili peppers, were a spicy, lightly crunchy knockout. So was an unconscionably (but rapturously) gooey amalgam of foie gras, sea eel, black truffles and egg custard that appears frequently on the menu, depending on the availability of fresh eel. There is ample good within Megu's plenty, even on the (separate) dessert menu, where a crème brûlée and the ice creams are standouts. But one of a restaurant's main purposes is to bring order to a vast culinary universe -- to weed and prune it, if you will. Megu does not bother. So you stumble through an enchanting and maddening forest, distracted by the toro untried, the roe not taken. Megu ** [Rating: Two Stars] 62 Thomas Street (West Broadway), TriBeCa; (212) 964-7777.

442,Balthazar,2 star,"May 26, 2004",Amanda Hesser,SoHo,"Bistros, French",https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/dining/restaurants-a-soho-brasserie-now-authentically-worn.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/26/dining/restaurants-a-soho-brasserie-now-authentically-worn.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"EVERY diner I know who has been to Balthazar has a story about being snubbed by the maître d'hôtel, hung up on by the reservationist, or ignored by a waiter tending to a more important guest. Yet everyone who has a grievance (myself included) returns again and again. Something draws us back. After seven years in business, Balthazar has reached that stage in the life of a restaurant when diners' eyes soften as they call to mind memories of meals past, memories of Lillet and oysters and crisp, peaked croissants and the evenings of carefree youth. A married friend recently gave me a sentimental tour of the many tables at which she had had dates. Balthazar is no longer hip, but it's still bustling. At 8:30 on a recent Wednesday night, groups of waiting diners chatted outside, customers streamed out of the bakery attached to the restaurant, and the predictable cluster of beggars were at the reservation desk, being snubbed by the maître d'hôtel. It is never easy getting in, but once you are at your table, your cocoon, the charms of Balthazar take over. The low-backed banquettes allow diners to see almost every other table through the room's hazy yellow glow. The space is loud, yet within your cocoon, you can hear your companions. And the wait staff has a machine-tooled finesse -- particularly the busboys, who zip by your table, pouring water and gliding on to the next table in continuous motion. After the main course, they change the paper on your table in a flutter of origami folds. The menu is much the same as always. Most of the best dishes are still there, and so are the less successful items. The beet salad still does not coalesce. Large beet cubes, walnut halves and a wedge of blue cheese rest under a tuft of mâche. It has the potential to be a great combination, just as a pile of lumber has the potential to be a great house. And steer clear of the garganelli pasta with tomatoes and the sautéed skate. But the Balthazar salad, romaine, frisée, asparagus, ricotta salata and truffle oil all mashed together, is as good as ever in its slick and wilted way. The escargots drew my companions' attention, large brown coils filled with juicy snails with plenty of the most important part -- the butter, garlic and parsley at the bottom of the baking dish. I adore the brandade, which is coarse and rustic, a mound of potatoes and salt cod marked with rivulets of olive oil, and topped with thin shards of toast. You spread a patch of brandade on the toast, and the delicate toast shatters in your mouth. And the crisp, salty French fries, which are served with the steak and a few other dishes, are still the best in the city. The menu maintains a backbone of classics throughout the year, as well as an ample infusion of seasonal dishes. Right now, for instance, there is navarin d'agneau with baby turnips and carrots, and asparagus spears, which are warm and come blanketed with a tangy hollandaise and small fragrant morels. One reason the food has held up so well is that Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson, the co-chefs who started when the restaurant opened, are still here. Lately, they have put more energy into the desserts. None of them will win awards for creativity, but almost all are excellent versions of the familiar. The apples on the tarte Tatin are cooked down so that they are chewy and candied on the edges. The tart of the day, when it is the cherry and almond, should not be missed. It is chewy, sharp and permeated with the essence of almonds. The profiteroles are as cold and sloppy as you could wish, and the Pavlova, a crisp meringue filled with ricotta whipped cream, is soaked with juicy blueberries and strawberries. In 1997, when Keith McNally opened Balthazar, it seemed to be merely a simulacrum of a turn-of-the-century French brasserie, notable for its museum-quality distressed tiles, faded mirrors and dented and worn zinc bar. But because Balthazar is animated from early in the morning to late at night by diners who treat it like a brasserie, rather than a sanctified restaurant (it is closed about six hours a day), the place now feels authentically worn, and it is difficult to distinguish between the real faded and the fake faded. The stairs leading down to the bathroom dip in the center and are worn down to raw wood. The restroom feels as if it has been there for 100 years, with clean but creaky stalls. A friendly woman is there to hand you a towel, and when you don't have money, she waves you off warmly. ''Next time,'' she says. ''Next time.'' Lunch is a good hour at Balthazar. You can tuck into a platter of oysters and a glass of wine; the lamb sandwich spread with harissa mayonnaise is also excellent. But my favorite hour at Balthazar is breakfast. Then the light is pure, the sound of forks and glass on tabletops is crisp. You can have Nutella spread on a baguette with a latte served in a large bowl, and a soft-boiled egg with toast ''soldiers.'' People are tapping away at their computers, sitting up straight for business meetings or nodding sleepily in their chairs. The atmosphere -- fake French, authentic New York -- buoys the room. Keith McNally, Balthazar's owner, was right all along -- a dining institution needs more than just great food. Balthazar ** [rating: two stars] 80 Spring Street (Crosby Street), SoHo; (212) 965-1414.

443,Wallse,2 star,"May 5, 2004",Amanda Hesser,West Village,German,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/05/dining/restaurants-spaetzle-and-schnitzel-unclouded-by-foam.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/05/dining/restaurants-spaetzle-and-schnitzel-unclouded-by-foam.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"WHEN Wallsé, an Austrian restaurant on West 11th Street, opened in 2000, it presented itself as a brave outpost on a residential frontier far from pedestrians' reach. It seemed an appropriate station for Kurt Gutenbrunner, Wallsé's chef and owner, who is outspoken and gruff, a rebel in a city full of media-groomed chefs. Rather than gliding through his dining room with a hand out to welcome customers, Mr. Gutenbrunner tends to march through, jerking his head as he inspects the scene, and abruptly approaching tables with a stern, ''Hello,'' followed by silence. If you have not eaten enough, he will tell you. If you argue with him, he is likely to puff up like an angry cat. With Mr. Gutenbrunner, what you see is what you get, and that carries over to his candid menu. And that, among other reasons, is why the restaurant continues to thrive, despite a wealth of competitors creeping into the neighborhood. Mr. Gutenbrunner opened Wallsé after working for four years as the executive chef at Bouley. David Bouley's influence, coupled with Mr. Gutenbrunner's Austrian background -- he is from Wallsee -- made for a stimulating blend of elegance and brawn. Delicately poached lobster and light asparagus soup coexisted happily with venison and lingonberries, goulash and potato pancakes. When the restaurant opened, it had a cool Scandinavian feel with polished floors, white walls and bleak black-and-white photographs of Austrian castles by Alexander Vethers. Vases overflowing with peonies or forsythia gave the room a soft touch, and enormous windows beginning on West 11th Street and wrapping around the Washington Street side flooded the place with light. Not much has changed. A black carpet now covers the floors, making the room quieter and warmer, and in place of the photographs an assortment of paintings, including a few by Julian Schnabel, a regular at the restaurant, have been hung. The cool and sleek has an overlay of idiosyncratic homeyness. Mr. Gutenbrunner has also remained loyal to his menu. It may be a bore for his cooks, but it was a delight to return and find kavalierspitz, a boiled beef shoulder, still among the entrees and spaetzle with braised rabbit as an appetizer. Mr. Gutenbrunner has a fondness for vegetables and herbs and uses them wisely to offset the heft of some of the Austrian dishes. If you are not tempted by goulash with spaetzle (a perfect dish), you can have wild striped bass, topped with a tuft of freshly grated horseradish. A buttery disk of foie gras terrine conceals a salad of green beans, wax beans, shallots, pistachios and thyme. A potato rösti, or pancake, is layered with lobster, horseradish crème fraîche, herbs and fennel, creating a wonderful spectrum of textures. His lengthy menu of daily specials often engages seasonal produce, and right now on the main menu is a frothy pea soup that is as green as moss and animated with an infusion of pineapple mint. Giant spears of white asparagus are prepared classically, with folds of baked ham and creamy slices of potato, all resting in a swirl of béarnaise. One dish that is partly out of season but still delicious is a terrine of tomato, artichokes and goat cheese. The tomato has been roasted and skinned so that it is sweet and pulpy. The artichokes are also sweet, and both coalesce with the help of the fluffy and tangy goat cheese. Mr. Gutenbrunner, once seen as a pioneer among chefs, has not been fazed by contemporaries like Ferran Adrià and Thomas Keller. He continues to be a great cook without foam, without powdered kumquat. It is a pleasure to order Wiener schnitzel and know you are going to get a breaded and fried piece of veal, and that the roasted venison does not involve roasted venison essence infused into potatoes formed in the shape of a venison chop. The venison chop here is big and hearty, and is surrounded by leaves of Brussels sprouts, slack and toothsome. In a dish of Maine lobster, warm pieces of claw and tail, poached in beurre blanc, are tangled with slices of fennel, peas and yellow raisins and glazed with a saffron sauce. It is as French and as classic as a Citroën. A rare hint of playfulness comes in a dish called ''skate salad,'' which is not a fish salad, but fish with salad. Menu semantics often raise the blood pressure of diners, but I must side with Mr. Gutenbrunner. Skate salad caught my eye, and the dish did not disappoint. Sautéed skate is served on top of a cluster of sautéed morels (they never raise my ire), and all around it is a tart cucumber vinaigrette and crisp cubes of cucumber. The salad, a sweet pile of bibb lettuce and dill, rises off to the side. Despite Wallsé's liberal use of lobster and foie gras, it has maintained a neighborhood demeanor. On most nights there is enough room at the bar for you to walk in and have dinner. It has a compact wine list that manages to excite you about selections with names like Bründlfangen and Smaragd, without assaulting your wallet. There is an excellent, but not overreaching cheese menu (try the Valençay). And Wallsé is not too pretentious to serve bottled water from green plastic bottles. (The brand is Römerquelle, Austrian, of course.) For diners who have grown accustomed to a culture full of restaurants that shock and awe and then fall apart, it is a treat to find a restaurant that continues to sail along, assured and unfettered. There are some things, like honey glazed duck and passion fruit crepes, that I would pass on next time. Not because they are bad, but because there are better things on the menu. If you don't end your meal with cheese, you might try the Salzburger nockerl, which is a kind of low-lying, sturdy soufflé on top of a bed of huckleberries. Or perhaps the Topfenknödel, a dessert which, after many tries, I am still not sure about, although I am intrigued. It is served in a deep bowl covered with sweetened rice paper. You peel back the paper to find a rhubarb compote and one (sometimes two) sweet bread-crumb-covered dumplings. On another plate you are given a glass of strawberry water and strawberry and rhubarb sorbet. A guest at my table described it as ''all sound and not enough fury.'' I would call it an amusing detour on an otherwise very steady voyage. Wallsé ** [Rating: two stars] 344 West 11th Street (Washington Street), Greenwich Village; (212) 352-2300.

444,BLT Steak,2 star,"April 14, 2004",Amanda Hesser,Midtown East,"French, Steak Houses",https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/14/dining/restaurants-a-steakhouse-with-a-soft-touch.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/14/dining/restaurants-a-steakhouse-with-a-soft-touch.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Correction Appended APERITIFS and amuse-bouches, pleasurable rituals though they may be, are also handy barometers of a restaurant's quality. They forecast its sensibilities, attitude and attention to detail. That's why, when the 1874 manhattan, made with Woodford Reserve bourbon, arrived at our table at BLT Steak, my mood lightened. The martini glass was accessorized with bourbon- and kirsch-soaked cherries impaled on a stick, and the cocktail itself, sweet and oaky and stiffened with a dash of bitters, eased across my palate. We were in capable hands, and if the size of the drink was any indication, we were not going to leave hungry. The manhattan also helped bring into focus the restaurant's rather blurry image. Though there is an obligatory photo of Arturo DeModica's sculpture ''Charging Bull'' in Bowling Green Park, BLT Steak feels like anything but a steakhouse. On the communal table at BLT Steak, which stands for ''Bistro Laurent Tourondel'' -- the name of the chef, not ''Bacon Lettuce and Tomato'' -- square vases are packed with trimmed leeks. Banquettes are covered in buttery suede and the tables, made of striated Makassar ebony, are glazed with a thick layer of baked resin. It's Peter Luger after a heavy session with the crew from ''Queer Eye for the Straight Guy.'' It takes chutzpah to launch a new entry in a category as storied as the New York steakhouse. And a strategy to redefine expectations; otherwise you end up like the colossally bland Michael Jordan's the Steak House NYC. Diners need a reason to shift alliances, and BLT Steak succeeds in this. In addition to well-seared meats and a serious wine list, there is a soft touch in the cooking, a sensitivity to acute flavors and seasonal ingredients. After the aperitif, the positive indicators continued to accumulate. Menus were delivered with a selection of antipasti -- marinated mushrooms, infused with coriander, a tiny bowl filled with duck liver mousse and a platter of cured meats. Serrano ham was carved into slices as delicate as tissue paper. The bresaola, delicious on its own, was tangibly improved with a sprinkle of lemon juice, olive oil and cracked black peppercorns. And just as these delicacies were cleared, a plate of popovers arrived. Each was the size of a ham hock and had a cap of melted Gruyère and a warm, eggy interior. In rethinking the steakhouse, Mr. Tourondel is renovating his own image. Previously, he was chef at Cello, a restaurant on the Upper East Side where his skill with fish earned him three stars from William Grimes of The New York Times in 1999. Indeed, two of the best dishes on BLT Steak's menu are the seafood platter and Dover sole sautéed on the bone. Here Mr. Tourondel's focus is on dry-aged meats in primal cuts. Of these, the hanger is by far the most flavorful. It is a homely cut, served with a dark crust, and a gamy interior that is dense with an iodine tang. But oddly, the beef was the most underwhelming part of the menu, not because of the way it was cooked but because the beef itself -- which comes from DeBragga & Spitler, where it is dry-aged for 28 days -- lacked the depth of flavor normally associated with aged beef. Luckily, the various accompanying sauces are excellent. The horseradish is amply hot and light; the three mustards include a beguiling red wine mustard that has a fruity and lasting heat; and the peppercorn is a beautifully executed classic sauce. The servers encourage you to try several at a time, which only serves to distract your palate. Avoid this. While veal chop and rack of lamb often seem like tame choices, here they are stunning. The veal is roasted with a moist crust made of bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and a wallop of rosemary. With each sweet bite of veal, there is a flash of the potent crust. The lamb is spread with a layer of ground parsley, garlic, chives and pine nuts. Where Mr. Tourondel really excels, and where he manages to take the steakhouse idea forward and distinguish himself from the merely excellent, is on the periphery -- in the soups, salads and side dishes. His white mushroom soup with truffle oil is poured into a bowl through a mound of foamy truffle sabayon. It is supple yet not subtle. (And if you can say that 10 times fast after having the 1874 manhattan, you should get your dinner free.) The crab cake is constructed of large lumps of crab, invisibly bound, and served on a crunchy, tangy celery mayonnaise. Like many touches here, the onion rings are cartoonishly proportioned, stacked like doughnuts in a round iron pan. Inside each crisp, salty shell is a thick softened ring of sweet onion. Fat asparagus spears are grilled and left firm. In the potato gratin, 10 thick slices of potato are laid like fish scales in a square modern dish and doused in a delicious cream. It is difficult to save room for dessert, but you should. It would be a shame to miss the best chocolate tart in New York City. It is sliced into a thick wedge of darkness, and looms over a small quenelle of almond milk ice cream. The crepe soufflé is a welcome remnant of Mr. Tourondel's past days of elegance. The fluffy, moon-shaped crepe is encased by a thin shell of caramel; below it is a puddle of tangy citrus sauce, flecked with passion fruit seeds. Most unusual is a steamed banana pudding, which is served warm in a terrine. A scoop of rum raisin ice cream loosens and spreads over its surface. As you settle in to dessert, the last extra arrives, a tiny chocolate chip cookie from Johnny Léon, BLT's pastry chef. It is cut into a small circle -- crunchy on the top and soft with lumps of melted chocolate in the center -- a period in form and function to punctuate a fine meal.

445,La Bottega,0.75 star,"March 31, 2004",Amanda Hesser,Chelsea,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/31/dining/restaurants-aromas-of-wood-smoke-raising-hopes.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/31/dining/restaurants-aromas-of-wood-smoke-raising-hopes.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"RESTAURANTS are like small cruise ships, with a crew sweating in the galley and the paying customers taking their ease on deck. The best restaurant ships have a captain on duty at all times. At Le Cirque 2000, you can count on being greeted at the door by Sirio Maccioni or one of his sons. While you rarely catch sight of Danny Meyer at Union Square Cafe or 11 Madison Park, you always sense his hand at the helm, guiding your passage. Occasionally, though, a restaurant seems to have no one at the helm -- and La Bottega, in the Maritime Hotel, is such a place. When you dine there, the busboys pour tap water into glasses half full of the $7 sparkling water you just bought. A margherita pizza you ordered as a middle course is served and, just as you are about to bite into a slice, your main courses are plunked down next to it. When you ask where the bathrooms are, the waiter doesn't know, and the hostess merely swings her arm in the general direction. And so down to the basement you go, cursing as you seek out the bathroom yourself. But when you do find it, you pause for a moment, because it's a pretty nice bathroom, after all. Tiny azure blue tiles cover its walls, and the heavy swinging door is constructed of lacquered walnut with a frosted porthole. Down the hall is an old phone booth, perfectly restored. In design, La Bottega is an unusual collision of Italian trattoria and 1950's American high school, with an overlay of Keith McNally -- a stage set of crackle tile, distressed fabrics and soft yellow light. Booths made of the same lacquered wood as the bathroom door are cushioned in burnt-orange leather. The terrazzo flooring is inlaid with circular threads of steel. Waitresses wear dark blue outfits that resemble early women's basketball uniforms, and the waiters are in bright orange bowling shirts. In the corner, near the bar, is a wood oven. And while not all of the food coming out of it is good, the scent of wood smoke, herbs and blistering pizza dough it gives off is addictive. From the moment you walk into La Bottega you are hungry. The trattoria-style menu is long (20 appetizers and 20 main courses) and is populated with dishes that focus, in Italian style, on one or two ingredients. Fried artichokes with truffle oil. Fennel with blood orange. Prawns with sea salt. The choices are appealing, yet numbing. It is a menu everyone has read before. Ravioli filled with butternut squash? It's on there. Braised lamb with polenta? Check. Panna cotta? Of course. There is something to be said for food that is simple and familiar. But not when an appetizer costs $15. Surely John DeLucie, the chef, has better ideas than tricolor salad with young Gorgonzola cheese. And he does -- sometimes. A salad of escarole with fava beans, mint and pecorino is delicious. The escarole is chopped so that when mixed with the favas and cheese, it clings together in a dense tuft that is bitter, salty and herbal. Salmon is grilled over wood and gas, skin side down, so the skin gets dark and crisp and serves as a smoky condiment for the rich fish. In a warm calamari salad, the calamari is chopped into small bits and blended with soft wedges of avocado and tomato. As you eat it, a dash of chili oil warms your palate. Mr. DeLucie's real specialty is pizza. His crust is flavorful and thin, and the toppings are added with restraint, so that each bite is an intense taste, not just filler. Some desserts are well conceived, too. The ricotta cheesecake is cut into a wedge, low and wide, and unlike New York cheesecake, it is dense, scented with vanilla and not too sweet. It's amusing to find gelato affogato on the menu -- so simple a child could prepare it. At the table, a shot of hot espresso is poured over a scoop of vanilla gelato, making a sauce of fluffy, creamy espresso. (It's $8, like the other desserts.) If I had to choose a single dessert, however, I would order the tiramisù, a dish long in disrepute. Here, it is flopped onto a plate so it resembles a deflated balloon. The mascarpone cream is light, almost foamy; the ladyfingers are soaked on the edges but still chewy; on top is a fresh dusting of cocoa powder. But these few delights cannot make up for the slough of irksome duds. Why, when Mr. DeLucie has 19 other appetizers, must he include tomato, basil and buffalo mozzarella as the 20th? In March. Countless restaurants make the same mistake, serving this seasonal dish year round. The dish was designed to flatter good mozzarella with an herb and a little sweet acid, but tomatoes are never good this time of year. Why not pair the mozzarella with a pickled vegetable, or none at all? Great mozzarella can stand alone. Octopus carpaccio was like a mouthful of bland rubber bands. And the butternut squash ravioli was like pumpkin candy stuck between flavorless leaves of pasta. At night La Bottega fills up, mysteriously, and the din can make it seem like a party in an empty swimming pool. But at lunch, it is serene. Then, you can appreciate the lush details and flag down a waiter when you need one. Be sure to have the tuna tramezzini. A mash of tuna, capers and olives is spread in a thin layer between two slices of white bread -- bread that is soft but a little dry on the edges, as if it has been sitting in a case like the ones at bars in Italy. Still, a restaurant cannot survive on a good little sandwich. Even 'ino would not be 'ino if were not for Joe Denton, who is there night after night, tending to his handful of regulars.

446,Asiate,1 star,"Feb. 25, 2004",Amanda Hesser,Upper West Side,"Asian, French",https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/25/dining/restaurants-a-lavish-ice-palace-high-above-the-din.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/25/dining/restaurants-a-lavish-ice-palace-high-above-the-din.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"DINING at Asiate begins with a whoosh! as the elevator shoots up 35 floors to the restaurant's glassed-in perch. On the way up, it's hard not to feel camaraderie in the air. There is the thrill of having secured one of the most elusive reservations in town, the excitement of dining in the new Time Warner Center as it transforms itself into a luxury food court and the simple anticipation of a fine meal. But most of all, perhaps, is the joy at the prospect of dining among the clouds. Two of New York's best skytop restaurants, Windows on the World and Wild Blue, which were on the 106th and 107th floors of the north tower of the World Trade Center, vanished on 9/11. This left the Rainbow Room, which has long thrived on its exhilarating views: getting to watch the sun set over Hoboken has a kind of romance unique to New York City. And for a few minutes at Asiate, you get just that. A cityscape that makes your heart race and a restaurant that is designed to amplify the thrill. Tables are arranged so that most diners can overlook Central Park, and the lighting is arranged to offer a nighttime trompe l'oeil. When you look out at the skyscrapers, you also see a reflection of the lights outlining the restaurant's glass wine-storage towers -- they, too, look like skyscrapers, doubling the brilliance of the city before you. No extravagance was spared in the design, which might be described as tundra luxe -- as if Philippe Starck and Mr. Cold Miser had collaborated. A sculpture affixed to the ceiling looks like a tangle of icicles, and the bread plates resemble chips of pale blue ice. Booths in the upper dining room are swaddled in toffee-colored leather and topped with feather-plumed pillows. Menus are delivered on hefty steel plates. Do pause for an aperitif. The list, which includes sakes (the Hanahato Densho Junmai Ginjo is delicious), good sherries and an unusual selection of Scotches (some of which have been aged in Sauternes barrels), is rich in surprises. And it may be the last moment of clarity, because then, alas, the food begins to arrive, and your senses, so far stimulated, slowly become conflicted. Nori Sugie, Asiate's chef, who worked with Tetsuya Wakuda in Sydney, Australia, joins a wave of New York chefs fixated on Asian and French influences. The best present a synthesis of cuisines. His cooking, however, seems to have gotten muddled in the rarefied air. First a dish of gougères, or Gruyère-filled choux pastry, is slipped onto the table. They are tiny as buttons -- crisp little poufs, spiced with a whiff of cayenne. The flaky pastry collapses on your tongue. From here, the ride gets a little bumpy. Prawns and linguine arrive in a parchment paper pouch that is twisted closed like an enormous candy wrapper and snipped open at the table by a waiter wielding garden shears. It's a good use of culinary drama. But you know what? Steaming pasta in a paper pouch makes for gummy pasta and soggy seafood. The prawns are not nearly so worrisome as the benign-sounding vegetable appetizer, which looks like a circus parading across the plate. Flaglike sticks made of kuzukiri (a fried rice noodle), fried parsley leaves, wedges of roasted beet and miniature pattypan squash soar above dabs of potato purée. In the center a mountain potato slouches forlornly in a thick truffle sauce. There are reasons nouvelle cuisine went away, and this dish is one. It also epitomizes the flaws in the cooking at Asiate. Mr. Sugie should not be serving pattypan squash in February. And he should not feel the need to load every dish with his entire culinary arsenal. When Mr. Sugie does pull off the acrobatics, it can be marvelous. Pan-roasted branzino rests on a spoonful of brandade sweetened with caramelized fennel. Nearby, a pristine sautéed scallop sits, unfettered. Verjus and a seaweed sauce stream around the plate. Suckling pig is pressed, its cheek confited and its trotters fried into a croquette. It's salty, chewy, earthy and rich. But with many dishes, editing would help. The foie gras pâté is buttery, nutty, lovely to spread on the thick wedge of sweet toast -- yet the venison and foie gras terrine on the other side of the plate does nothing but disrupt the pleasure. The desserts are particularly prone to overcrowding. An Earl Grey crème brûlée is served with a side of litchi sorbet in a cool broth of tapioca, shaved fresh coconut, sliced litchi and coconut milk. I would happily skip the crème brûlée and have seconds of the sorbet. The same goes for raspberry granita with herbal sumac, which outshines a chocolate soufflé served alongside it. And Chocolate, Chocolate, Chocolate (a classic euphemism for dumbed down) has three components, which would be better off as three desserts -- or, really, off the menu entirely. But a quince tart possesses all the right magic. Delicate leaves of quince and a knob of almond purée are nestled in a crisp pastry shell. Chestnut ice cream is spooned into a tiny dish on the side. When the waiters remembered to serve the petit four, it was also lovely: a pink and white die poised on a Japanese soupspoon. It was cool, a touch of fruit and coconut. Ah, yes, you think: ambrosia from the 1970's, brought up to 2004. There are other things to admire about Asiate. The waiters are deft and have a sense of humor. When one of my dining companions demanded that the waiter stand closer so he could hear his suggestions, the waiter, Brian, promptly obliged. Later when my guest bellowed something to Brian from outside the established range, Brian smiled and held his hand to his ear. ''What's that?'' he said. ''I can't hear you.'' There is also the view. You sit atop an urban canyon, as the sheer cliffs of Midtown drop off into the park. From this height, the traffic below seems to glide and swirl without an ounce of contention. The pressures of city life ease a little. And for that alone, I might order a glass of sake, stay for the gougères, then feign illness and steal across Columbus Circle to Jean Georges for a meal that never disappoints.

''Bronx style'' filet mignon of veal. A cheesecake lollipop tree with bubble-gum whipped cream. New York culinistas will know immediately that those off-the-wall menu items can be the work of only one man, David Burke, the chef who first gave us swordfish chops and pastrami salmon. Mr. Burke, recently unleashed from the constraints of corporate chefdom, is now performing his high-wire act twice daily not far from his old stomping grounds at the Park Avenue Cafe. In December he opened David Burke & Donatella with Donatella Arpaia, a lawyer turned restaurateur who owns Bellini. While she keeps things calm and happy in the dining room, he whizzes around the kitchen preparing complex dishes of immense fussiness that really shouldn't work, but do. There are some definite misses -- and let me quickly say that bubble-gum whipped cream is one of them. But overall, diners here are in for terrific savories, a reasonable and unusual wine list and excellent people-watching. The restaurant itself, in an Upper East Side town house, is done to a turn. In fact, the all-white front room, its tables filled on the nights of my visits with high-testosterone patrons, would be quite at home in Palm Beach. The main dining room, a few steps down, is fancy and formal, yet stylish. Admiring the crimson hue of the place, one of my guests declared red the new black. All sorts of red, at that: paprika banquettes, Chinese red Roman shades, a spectacular Dale Chihuly-like sculpture over the fireplace made of red glass rods that look like licorice. It is all quite grand. This is a restaurant where you would expect to see perfectly coiffed, bejeweled women of a certain age with men in double-breasted sports jackets and striped shirts with white collars. Not to mention an astonishing number of paunchy men of a certain age who appeared to be dining with their nieces. And you do. But the Upper East Side is not what it used to be and so the dining room also supports a good number of men in cashmere Kiton sweaters and groups of young women with Prada bags at their feet. They are the new moneyed class. Still, the attentive staff is better dressed than many of the guests. And each dish, like the décor and the staff, makes a statement. David Burke can't help himself. The restaurant does not simply serve bread; it presents bread, a cross between a parkerhouse roll and a brioche, baked in a copper casserole, its sourdough top studded with thyme and sprinkled with coarse salt and zatar, a Middle Eastern spice blend. It's delicious. The butter, of course, must be decorated, so it comes sprinkled with coarse red salt. The amuse-bouche, an icy cold Kumamoto oyster with Mr. Burke's tarted-up mignonette sauce of soy, orange and lemon grass, is a perfect prelude. It takes an entire paragraph to describe one of his dishes, but unlike other chefs who play with their food, Mr. Burke seems to know what he's doing and when his complex combinations work, the depth of flavor in the dish is a joy. A lobster flan, made with Sauternes, is topped with miniature home fries and lobster meat ragù. This accompanies a shiitake dumpling and a boned leg of quail with a shiitake filling, the quail wrapped in pasta, the drumstick bone serving as a handle. Next to it sits a quail breast, coated in Asian spices with a dusting of dried orange peel. And that's just one dish. The day-boat sea scallops ''Benedict'' bring out Mr. Burke's whimsical side. The scallops sit on potato pancakes -- stand-ins for English muffins -- topped with sunny-side-up quail eggs, slices of chorizo replacing the ham, with olive tapenade sauce and a little chorizo oil. There's foam, too, a weird last-year touch, this one made with lobster broth. Foie gras is superbly combined with candied kumquats and grapes that have been poached in Armagnac and port wine and then rolled in cornflakes and fried, the poaching liquid becoming the sauce. Point counterpoint. A dish of salmon tartare and tuna tartare, which Mr. Burke first made at the River Cafe in Brooklyn, came with caviar and crème fraîche and was unctuously good. As was the salmon mousse, and the pastrami salmon with rye blini, and the tuna sashimi with a panna cotta of sea urchin. Even a simple market salad had a dash of extra flavor -- crisp potato and bacon. It is all very appealing. Blue crab ravioli with basil aioli in crab consommé may be one of the chef's simplest dishes but it is suffused with flavor. And all of the pasta dishes show a sure hand, including the cavatelli with wild mushrooms and the ravioli with spinach, though the generous gratings of black truffles really add little to the dishes. The roast chicken, which has been brined in seaweed water, is moist and tender. The Dover sole is gently cooked, preserving its delicate flavor. And the highly seasoned barbecued squab comes with a corn torte with foie gras. Just right. When Mr. Burke cooks like this he can play with his food all he wants. But some of his whimsy needs rethinking. Angry lobster has reason to be angry: it's dry and overcooked. The Bronx-style filet mignon of veal looks like a bootjack and is boring. Suckling pig stuffed with pork sausage and cornbread has far too much going on. And shrimp cooked at the table with a pouring of hot oil have no flavor for all that effort. The desserts are acceptable if you don't include the cheesecake lollipops with bubble-gum whipped cream or the fruit carpaccio, designed for carb-counters who really don't want dessert. These dishes aside, Mr. Burke and Ms. Arpaia make you want to come back for more. And they think of everything. On frigid nights smokers are invited to the ''smoking room,'' a stretched stretch limo -- white, of course -- with the motor running and the heater on, parked right outside the front door.

448,Bread Tribeca,2 star,"Jan. 14, 2004",Marian Burros,TriBeCa,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/14/dining/restaurants-straightforward-fare-and-license-to-linger.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/14/dining/restaurants-straightforward-fare-and-license-to-linger.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Correction Appended I AM more than willing to forgive Bread Tribeca for its bland soups, its charming but not always focused serving staff and the lack of spoons for its saltcellars -- I hate to think how many fingers have taken a pinch or two -- because most of the food is a pleasure. Every neighborhood would be lucky to have a place like it, where the dress code is immaterial for patrons and waiters alike, and people who linger over a cup of coffee and the paper in the middle of the afternoon are not shooed out. With its soaring windows, white brick walls, open fireplace and stripped-down look it is quintessential TriBeCa. Good breads may be the foundation of the restaurant -- Luigi Comandatore, the co-owner of the restaurant with Bob Giraldi, also owns Bread, a paninoteca on Spring Street. This more ambitious spot has moved way beyond panini, though. Still, if you fancy something between two slices you will be amazed at how good sardines taste with pepperoncini and tomatoes on a baguette. Taking its cue from Liguria, the restaurant offers food that is simply prepared and delicious. In fact, its fritto misto may be one of the best in the city. Tender, crisp, and lightly breaded, the assorted seafood and vegetables are fried to perfection and served on white paper. There are no architectural renderings on the plates here; no froufrou decorations, just straightforward cooking. If you, like me, think the only kind of pizza crust worthy of the name is rolled as thin as possible and baked in a brick oven, then you would do well to make this restaurant a pizza hangout even though there are only two choices -- pizza margherita and pizza with prosciutto and arugula. If you live in the neighborhood, so much the better: they'll deliver. Baking it in an impressive iron and brick wood-burning oven (handmade, custom built) does make a difference. Not just to the pizzas and breads, but also to the grilled vegetables and roasted meats. (It's not often that people marvel over the flavor of a plate of grilled vegetables. They usually leave them to the veggie eaters at the table.) The chef showed a very sure hand with fish: it was never overcooked. A savory tomato-shrimp flavored broth perfumed the zuppa de pesce filled with tender seafood that was sautéed before being added to the broth. Fried sardines were perfectly cooked, light and greaseless and balanced by the slight bitterness of arugula and lemon zest. Grilled shrimp, which are almost always cooked too long, were sweet and tender. Branzino, sea bass on a bed of braised radicchio, was moist and simply flavored with rosemary, lemon and salt and showed off to its best advantage on a slab of black slate. Pesto, perhaps the most famous export of Liguria, generally overpowers whatever it is meant to complement. Here just the right amount is used with taglierini, haricots verts and potatoes. The tagliatelle with braised lamb and tomatoes was also a treat but the star of the pasta department is the pansotti with walnut sauce, plump supersized tortellini filled with minced herbs and topped with a irresistible cream sauce of ground walnuts, cheese, milk and garlic. Fat green-lipped mussels from New Zealand in a peppery tomato broth fortunately come with thick slices of crusty bread, the best method for conveying the last drop of liquid from the bottom of the bowl to your mouth. But maybe the biggest surprise of the day was the moist whole roasted Cornish hen, a bird neither known for its flavor nor its tenderness but rather for its frequent appearance at large catered events. The chef, Iacopo Falai, formerly the pastry chef at Osterio del Circo, has brought his considerable dessert skills with him. The freshly fried orange pastry cream-stuffed fritelle, about the size of doughnut holes, come with a chocolate sauce, reputedly infused with basil. I didn't get a whiff of the basil but the fritelle didn't need chocolate sauce. Strawberries, sautéed and glazed, are served with vanilla gelato, wonderfully scented and flavored with the sweet Italian wine, moscato. The simple plate of cookies, including tiny muffins flavored with coffee and lemon, lemon cookies and excellent biscotti, was remarkable. The pumpkin crème brûlée is a mistake. Bread Tribeca has other faults that are curious because they are so inconsistent with most of the food. The mashed potatoes had no flavor, not even any salt. The huge plate of prosciutto was nice but it needed something more than a couple of Parmesan breadsticks, which didn't have much cheese flavor, to set it off. The gnocchi were singularly disappointing, not especially flavorful and a trifle doughy. There is a short, reasonable wine list, emphasizing Italian bottles and the usual cocktails that have nothing to do with the food. Although I am not necessarily a fan of communal tables -- there are also tables for four or more -- one night my party was seated at one and perhaps because it was not full, the other guests did not seem intrusive. We admired their shrimp before we got ours; they admired our desserts. I'm glad I was not facing the 50-inch television screen that runs constantly though without sound. I don't know what to say about the black sink in the bathroom, so trendy, so deep, so square, so filled with pebbles -- and large enough to bathe a toddler in. Bread Tribeca * [Rating: one star] 301 Church Street (Walker Street), (212) 334-0200. ATMOSPHERE -- Spare, informal with open kitchen and wood-burning oven.

449,'Cesca,2 star,"Dec. 31, 2003",William Grimes,Upper West Side,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/31/dining/restaurants-west-side-trattoria-with-velvet-booth-style.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/31/dining/restaurants-west-side-trattoria-with-velvet-booth-style.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"SOME restaurants take a while to find their footing. Others hit the ground running. 'Cesca belongs to the second group. Like Ouest, the other joint venture of Godfrey Polistina and Tom Valenti, his chef and partner, 'Cesca knew what it was and where it was the moment it opened its doors. Diners did, too. Never before have I been forced to accept so many 5:30 reservations. Ouest is French; 'Cesca is Italian. But the similarities are striking, right down to the circular booths upholstered in velvet. Both strike the same pitch-perfect tone, a little more stylish than a common neighborhood restaurant, but not formal enough that a jacket might be required. The cuisine fits the tone, and the décor, precisely. Mr. Valenti, a very assured chef, sets his sights on the high-middle range in this urban trattoria, emphasizing honest, uncomplicated food with strong, clearly defined flavors. Any number of dishes illustrate the approach, but small veal meatballs in broth, an appetizer, makes a good test case. It is a simple dish, but the moist, chewy meatballs are delicately seasoned, the meat broth is limpid, and the chard leaves floating in the broth with little specks of pastina retain their color and just a hint of crunch. The result is an enormously satisfying dish with nothing remarkable about it. The menu abounds in small victories like this. A scattering of celery leaves, for freshness and aroma, and first-rate capers from the island of Salina, near Sicily, make Mr. Valenti's vitello tonnato a revelation. Breaded sardines, roasted and served with a poached egg, are rich, meaty and almost defiantly simple. By comparison, roasted oysters, topped with a piquant tomato zabaglione and crispy pancetta, seem almost rococo, but wonderful. Potato gnocchi with a sauce of braised duck and garlic slices cooked crisp, like little potato chips, does not quite hit the mark. The gnocchi tend to be a little gummy, and the sauce includes a lot of dried bits of duck. It is a disappointment on an otherwise solid list of pastas and risottos with a decidedly rustic bent, like vialone nano rice with skate, tomato and cabbage, and outstanding raviolini stuffed with shrimp and served in a sneakily spicy tomato sauce with herbed bread crumbs. The big-hearted entrees can bring down a weak-kneed diner at 50 yards. Tripe with red wine and pancetta, a steaming heap of innards in a heady sauce, had me mopping my brow after the third bite. Tripe in the wrong hands can be a slippery, unchewable mess. Mr. Valenti, like a great coach, brings out every bit of its admittedly modest potential. Swordfish, although slightly overcooked, is a gratifyingly thick slab with a piercing, vinegary sweet-and-sour caponata that can also be ordered as a side dish. Grilled lamb chops, dark and gamy, are served as a kind of mixed grill, with dense, nearly black lamb sausages on the side, an intensely flavored cauliflower stew and mint. Pork shanks are no joke either, slow-cooked until they fall off the bone, and arranged with roasted calf's liver cut into plugs and wrapped with pancetta. A tart agrodolce sauce mercifully cuts into the richness of the dish. There is relief, too, in a terrific list of amari, or flavored bitters. For diners who have encountered only the fiercely astringent Fernet Branca, 'Cesca's amari offer a pleasant voyage of discovery, including fresh, myrtle-based Tremontis Mirto and the vaguely root-beer-tasting Cio Ciaro. 'Cesca's sommelier, Patrick Bickford, has an obsession with these underappreciated liqueurs. Indulge him. A three-bitters tasting, at $14, helps smooth the road toward dessert, a goal that might seem unrealistic midway through the tripe. Taken after the meal, they can do some valuable damage control. The attention-getting dessert is two layers of wafflelike chocolate pizzelle sandwiching a hefty frozen slice of pistachio gelato. It is ungainly and crude. It should take as its role model the chaste, impeccable ricotta and mascarpone cheesecake, white as marble and situated, ideally, midway between creamy and fluffy. Bits of bitter orange and fennel-orange brittle, like little exclamation points, emphasize the sourly sweet quality of the cheese. Buttermilk panna cotta with blood orange sauce is simple and straightforward, just the kind of dessert you want in a trattoria, but there's a more intriguing choice in the same vein, a smooth scoop of honey and goat cheese gelato, with anise cookies. It is easy to see why 'Cesca has found a following. Mr. Polistina, who named the restaurant after his daughter, Francesca, seems to have a knack for organizing a dining room so that patrons feel a pleasant sense of bustle and activity around them, while the tables themselves are islands of repose. Energy radiates from the antipasto station by the front-room bar and an open kitchen overlooking the main dining room, but diners at the well-spaced tables and wraparound booths eat in tranquillity. A semidetached wine room, with one long table, feels a little like a wayside shrine. Like everything else about 'Cesca, it is shrewdly conceived and perfectly placed, just one more ingenious touch in a restaurant that rarely puts a foot wrong.

450,Azalea,1 star,"Dec. 24, 2003",William Grimes,Midtown,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/24/dining/restaurants-italy-north-to-south-before-the-curtain.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/24/dining/restaurants-italy-north-to-south-before-the-curtain.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"FATE has dealt Azalea a couple of tough cards. The restaurant sits right next to a parking garage, so patrons on the west side of the dining room, if they peek out the window, can watch an endless parade of S.U.V.'s roll by as curtain time approaches on Broadway. The dining room itself is an awkward L shape, so narrow along the tall part of the letter that dinner is a nonstop game of bump-the-waiter if you sit with your back exposed to the traffic lane. Close quarters feel even closer because the room is overdecorated, with complicated blond-wood paneling and many, many Georgia O'Keeffe flower prints. That's a lot to overcome, but the kitchen does its best. The Italian cuisine is a not-especially-coherent mixture of dishes from the Amalfi Coast in the south and Brescia in the north, with diversions. This north-south alliance comes about because Giovanni Apicella, one of Azalea's two owners, is from Tramonti, on the Amalfi coast, and his chef, Umberto Bonometti, is from Brescia, in Lombardy. (The restaurant's name is pronounced ah-zuh-LAY-uh.) Sometimes local pride works out in the diner's favor, sometimes not. Guinea hen, plumped out with an aromatic herb stuffing, then baked with sage, butter and rosemary, comes straight from Mr. Bonometti's childhood kitchen, obviously a good place to start. From Amalfi comes the kind of dessert best described as interesting, thin layers of eggplant drenched in brandy and coated in dark, bitter chocolate. It could work. Eggplant, more a texture than a taste, does a brilliant job standing in for cake layers, but half the Cognac in the recipe would still be too much. Mr. Bonometti, to his credit, resists cliché. He feels free to invent and modernize along the way, and he has flair. A simple appetizer of sweet baby shrimp, arranged on a tangled heap of shaved fennel, sits in an oversize Parmesan shell with jagged edges that looks like an avant-garde settee. The shrimp are sweet and succulent, the fennel cool and crisp. A light dressing of lemon and excellent olive oil does the rest. His Gorgonzola and pear sformato, a dense, almost gooey soufflé, is an ingenious showcase for one of Italy's greatest flavor combinations. With the right dessert wine, it could be dessert and a cheese course rolled into one. Garlic-accented beef carpaccio with chestnuts sounds better than it is. The chestnuts have no flavor, which leaves the roasted garlic stranded. A better bet is dense, dark duck sausage, served in slices with a rustic accompaniment of barlotti beans in a tomato and onion sauce. The kitchen really hits its stride with pastas, which are convincing across the board. Wild boar braised in Barolo wine may be the richest, most deeply flavored meat sauce I've come across at an Italian restaurant. It's served with broad, flat pappardelle, and cherry tomatoes have been deployed strategically to give off intense bursts of fruity acidity. Stubby rigatoni stuffed with seasoned ground veal, topped with crushed roasted walnuts and covered with an oozy white-truffle cream are downright dangerous. Each sublime bite gives rise to uneasy thoughts about the entree to follow. Most appetites will stop dead in their tracks with this one. A somewhat lighter alternative, equally appealing, is ravioli stuffed with veal and red cabbage in a concentrated veal sauce, but even the fish pastas tend to be rich, especially the ravioli stuffed with lobster and buffalo ricotta in a Prosecco and lobster broth. The pastas can make the main courses seem anticlimactic, satisfying for the most part but not nearly as impassioned, or as complex. Jumbo shrimp sautéed with fresh herbs is what it says it is, and no more. A sizable tuna fillet, rolled in sesame seeds, is plain, served in a light tomato sauce with cannellini beans and fried onions. It was ordered medium-rare and came out on the far side of medium, but under no circumstances was it ever going to be an exciting dish. Pork fillet sautéed with apple purée sounds dull but isn't, thanks in part to tender, flavorful pork, and a nice-sized potato cake on the side. Baby lamb chops get the royal treatment. They're cooked in a potent reduction sauce of Amarone wine, then served with a heap of spinach sprinkled with pine nuts and raisins. The forbidding chocolate eggplant casts a giant shadow over the dessert list. It does have its own mystique, though, which puts it ahead of the baci di Modena, a chewy, astoundingly sweet cake made from crushed amaretto cookies with mascarpone cream. This is candy, not dessert. It takes a triple espresso to right the balance. The best desserts on the menu are a warm chocolate and banana cake, covered in caramel sauce, sweet without being cloying, and a chaste, beautifully realized fruit tart, nothing more than a few fresh berries in pastry cream on a crisp, buttery crust. The waiters are a colorful bunch. They seem to be working from a playbook not yet available in English-speaking countries, in which diners are regarded as hopeful applicants rather than customers with the power of the dollar behind them. One evening, luck of the draw delivered a waiter who all but snapped his fingers impatiently when the table did not order fast enough, and took it as a personal affront when I looked at the label on the wine bottle, as though I were accusing him of a double-cross. Needless to say, his favorite dessert was the eggplant. Azalea * [rating: one star] 224 West 51st Street; (212) 262-0105.

451,Amma,2 star,"Dec. 3, 2003",William Grimes,Midtown East,Indian,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/03/dining/restaurants-the-food-of-india-from-top-to-bottom.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/03/dining/restaurants-the-food-of-india-from-top-to-bottom.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"INDIA is a big country, but Amma manages to cover most of it. Its menu is a whirlwind tour that extends geographically from the northwestern frontier to Goa, and stylistically from refined Mogul cooking to lunchbox fare and street snacks. Suvir Saran, one of Amma's owners as well as one of its two chefs, is the travel agent for this culinary adventure, and he has a not-so-secret educational agenda. For years he has taught a popular course on Indian cooking at New York University. Amma is his opportunity to reach a different kind of audience, in a different way, and he has jumped for it. His able assistant is Hemant Mathur, who caught the attention of New York diners when he worked the tandoori at Tamarind before moving along to Diwan. At Amma, Mr. Mathur continues to tend the tandoor, which is the source of some of Amma's most seductive entrees, like juicy, basil-scented chicken with tomato chutney and lemon rice, and grilled lamb chops served with a sweet and sour pear chutney and potatoes spiced with curry leaf. But Amma gives him much more freedom to roam. Amma does away with the redundant curries, vindaloos and pilafs that crowd the menus of so many Indian restaurants, replacing them with a wide variety of homey dishes, like idli upma, or steamed cakes made from rice flour and urad dhal, a relative of the mung bean. Idli, a Southern Indian specialty, have a slightly chewy texture and a bland flavor that makes them ideal for spicing. At Amma, they are sprinkled with mustard seeds, topped with a few sautéed curry leaves and served with a dollop of creamy coconut chutney on one side and hot tomato chutney on the other. Bombay bhel puri, another humble appetizer, also shows off the kitchen's clean, precise way with spices and aggressive flavors. The dish is a gaudily colored, interwoven stack of crispy rice puffs and chickpea flour noodles, arranged for maximum crunch, with a tart, aromatic onslaught from tamarind and cilantro chutneys. Potatoes, tomatoes and red onion bring it back down to earth. Amma makes a point of doing honor to India's rich vegetarian cuisine. Tasting menus come in both vegetarian and nonvegetarian formats, and the meatless dishes on the à la carte menu are among the best. Americans with a taste for fried okra can rediscover it in a very different guise, dusted with chickpea flour and fried to a crisp, then served in a complex dressing of lemon juice and sour spices, like ground mango peel and dried, powdered pomegranate seeds. Amma must surely be the only restaurant in New York serving Gobi lahsuni, a potent, richly flavored Manchurian-style dish. Cauliflower florets are marinated in garlic and lemon juice, then tossed in a garlicky tomato sauce seasoned with scallions and chilies. Kararee bhindi are feather-light vegetarian meatballs made from Indian summer squash. Served in a creamless tomato sauce, they have a delicate flavor that makes them an ideal complement to the spicier, more robust meat dishes, like lamb fillets stuffed with apricots and served with a sweet and sour pear chutney. The fillets are a little tough, but with a strong lamb flavor that marries perfectly with the pungent chutney and potatoes flavored with curry leaf. Southern India, with its vast repertory of spices, also adds punch to the menu. Goan shrimp, sautéed in butter, are folded into the vibrant, smoky tomato sauce called balchao, spiced with fried red chilies. It is a faithfully rendered classic. More intriguing is Malabar salmon, a hefty slab of fish marinated in balchao and steamed in a banana leaf before being finished in the tandoor. Once unwrapped, the fish gives off a tantalizing aroma of vinegar and chilies, which permeate the salmon, right down to the juices. Curry-leaf potatoes and crispy okra fill out the plate. Side dishes, when not treated as an afterthought, always fill more than a minor role in Indian cooking. Mr. Mathur devotes a great deal of attention to his condiments and breads, which include the standard parathas and nans, but also a sweetly chewy kulcha stuffed with crab meat and a paratha stuffed with spinach, peas and fenugreek. His raita, a garlic-infused yogurt condiment, comes with a sprinkling of crunchy fried okra on top. As an alternative to the usual Basmati rice, Amma has three Southern Indian rices, flavored with tomato, mint and lemon, that come to the table arranged like red, green and yellow Hostess cupcakes. A word of caution about the lassis. These mildly sour, extraordinarily refreshing yogurt drinks can become a meal in themselves. Once you start, it's hard to stop. And a couple of mango lassis can do real damage. The worst effect is to dull the appetite for Amma's satiny mango cheesecake, a light, almost mousselike creation that leads a short list of desserts that seem suspiciously modern, especially the tasting of three creams, a three-act production consisting of banana flan, chai pot de crème and rose panna cotta. It's a bit sneaky. The flavors are traditional, as familiar to Indians as peanut butter and chocolate are to Americans. It's the setting that makes them seem new. The same goes for Amma. By taking the back roads, and steering clear of the tired tourist sites, it shows diners a different India, so old that it seems fresh.

452,Pampano,2 star,"July 16, 2003",William Grimes,Midtown East,"Mexican, Seafood",https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/16/dining/restaurants-on-49th-street-a-cool-breeze-from-mexico.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/07/16/dining/restaurants-on-49th-street-a-cool-breeze-from-mexico.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"PLÁCIDO DOMINGO likes to eat. He just can't decide what he wants to order. Domingo, his pet project in Manhattan, opened in 1996 as a Spanish restaurant of no particular distinction. When that failed, he abandoned Spain and hired the cookbook author Patricia Quintana to devise a Mexican menu. When that did not please, he turned to Richard Sandoval, the chef and owner of Maya, to work some magic on a restaurant that seemed to have only one thing going for it, Mr. Domingo's name. Mr. Sandoval rose to the challenge. Wiping the slate clean, he created a Mexican seafood menu, fresh and contemporary, that brings spice, color and excitement to a formerly listless dining room that has been redecorated in a startling white-on-white beach style. White plaster shells hug the walls, and a cool canvas shade covers the ceiling, with paddle fans sending a permanent breeze across the tables. A school of abstract metal fish, rendered in bright Miró colors, hover over the outdoor terrace, like an aquarium suspended in space. You can almost hear the waves breaking over 49th Street. Against this clean backdrop, Mr. Sandoval and his chef de cuisine, Josefina Santacruz, deliver inventive, sharply executed seafood dishes that keep the taste buds busy. Bright squiggles, specks and blobs put a lot of drama on the plate, and the cast of characters tends to be extensive. Every dish seems to have at least eight or nine ingredients. Somehow all the actors find their places, and the chilies, in particular, perform brilliantly. Mr. Sandoval uses all of them, from anchos, anaheims and chipotles to the fiery habaneros and jalapeños. They italicize flavors, infiltrate them, sway them this way and that, without ever making the primary impression. A smoky chipotle and lobster sauce, for example, brings out the sweetness of sautéed shrimp in a rich, mouth-filling tamale stuffed with steamed cornmeal, mushrooms and zucchini blossoms. Chiles de árbol apply mild heat to an understated salsa that blends effortlessly with black-bean purée and buttery slices of avocado in what may be Pampano's signature dish, an appetizer of three miniature lobster tacos on soft tortillas. Big anaheim chilies, mild and slightly sweet, make the ideal wrapper for sharp goat cheese and a welcome accompaniment to huge grilled shrimp in a spicy bell pepper and tomato sauce. Fruity ancho chilies, with their overtones of licorice, make a complex, beguiling glaze for baby octopus, served with roasted corn and crunchy chayote dice. The menu could probably be pared down. It can be exhausting to navigate, and one place to start might be the very average guacamole, one of two dips pressed on customers the moment they sit down. The other one is the winner, a swordfish hash flavored with bits of tomato, onion and cilantro. The fish is beautifully smoked. It's a toss-up whether to spread it on thick tortilla chips or to leave it in the center of the table and simply inhale the aroma. It makes the guacamole seem a little pointless, really. Raw bar appetizers like cherrystone clams with a spicy vinaigrette deflect attention, unwisely, from ceviches like shrimp in a spicy chipotle sauce with avocado and jicama, or a well-balanced ceviche of tuna with tart tomatillos, poblano chilies and mango. Mr. Sandoval brings the same virtues to his ceviches that he does to the rest of the menu, a clear sense of how competing flavors and textures can be orchestrated to create exciting results. A tomato and cactus salad, stuffed right in the center of a pan-fried snapper like the filling in a sandwich, deploys sherry vinegar and roasted garlic expertly to enhance the qualities of the fish. Strips of toasted tortilla add welcome crunch to a smooth black-bean soup with slices of spicy seafood sausage. Crema fresca and small bits of buttery avocado bring down the heat. The menu does include a few meat dishes, notably a flavorful if messy rib-eye steak heaped with yellow-tomato salsa, guacamole and a long list of adornments that somehow manages to include cracklings. It contrasts sharply with the simple but arresting lamb marinated in a guajillo pepper purée and braised in a banana-leaf wrapper. Plain roasted vegetables complete the package. The dessert list is short. Natilla de cajeta, a sort of Mexican crème brûlée topped with a lid of tough caramelized bananas, is dense, grainy and, to my taste, painfully sweet. The antidote can be found in pastel de elote, slices of warm, pudding-like corn cake served with rich coconut ice cream and hibiscus sauce. Next to the formidable natilla, even the chocolate tacos seem austere. They're Mexican cannoli, delicate vanilla tuiles filled with light hazelnut-chocolate mousse, with a tart fruit salsa as a shrewd complement. Pampano cannot resist the urge to push a lot of very expensive tequilas on the after-dinner menu, including a presumptuous Herradura Selección Suprema priced at $64 a glass, and there are some baroque coffees, the strangest one, by a long chalk, being the Cappuccino Maya, a lethal sugar assault that combines Kahlúa, Bailey's Irish Cream and whipped cream to devastating effect. On the plus side, Pampano offers a nice selection of Spanish brandies like Cardenal Mendoza and Gran Duque de Alba, a treat for those who venture beyond Cognac and Armagnac. Mr. Sandoval and his singing partner, Mr. Domingo, have pulled off a rare feat. When restaurants begin revising their formulas and rewriting their menus, the end is usually near. Pampano, against the odds, has finally found a way to get started. Pampano ** [rating: two stars] 209 East 49th Street; (212) 751-4545.

453,Nice Matin,2 star,"June 25, 2003",William Grimes,Upper West Side,"Bistros, French",https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/25/dining/restaurants-the-light-of-nice-shines-on-the-west-side.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/25/dining/restaurants-the-light-of-nice-shines-on-the-west-side.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"FIRST Marseille, now Nice. Can Antibes, Montpellier and Perpignan be far behind? Two years ago, Simon Oren tapped into a rich vein of fantasy when he opened Marseille in the theater district. Pink wine, black olives and an exotic touch of North Africa made for a very appealing package tour. Not surprisingly, Mr. Oren, who also owns L'Express and Sushi Samba, began extending the itinerary. Nice Matin, named after the largest daily newspaper in the South of France, gives the Upper West Side a splash of Provençal sunshine and a heady introduction to the cuisine of Nice, home of the pissaladière, pan bagnat and, if we are to believe the menu, a whopping big burger topped with comté cheese, smeared with aioli and served with a heap of rosemary-flecked fries. It's the best thing to happen to a hamburger since Daniel Boulud worked foie gras and short ribs into an all-beef patty. Andy D'Amico, formerly at Sign of the Dove and Little Dove, interprets Nice with respect. He showcases simple classics like grilled leg of lamb rubbed with rosemary, refusing to fuss. He anchors his menu in the potent flavors, bright colors and fragrant herbs that define Niçoise cooking, adjusting here and innovating there, always in a way that feels true to the local idiom. That hamburger is his invention, but aioli and rosemary keep it in the same family as his shrewdly simplified one-fish bouillabaisse, with fennel purée and a creamy, hard-hitting rouille. As at Marseille, the menu starts with a long list of small, bite-size appetizers priced at $4 and $5, or less than half the price of the average full-fledged appetizer. These are no-nonsense starters, ideal with a glass of rosé, like tender poached mussels dipped in rouille, or grilled sardines split in half and topped with bread crumbs, garlic and parsley. Less thyme would help the pissaladière, Nice's famous thin-crust pizza, topped with slow-cooked onions, anchovies and olives, but his trouchia, a Swiss chard and onion frittata flavored with Parmesan cheese, is a glorious thing. The chard, fresh and crunchy, dominates rather than being lost in the eggs and Parmesan. Fennel-cured mackerel, one of the full-priced appetizers, is pleasingly oily and chewy, a robust alternative to the often anemic tuna tartares all over the city. Fennel adds a fresh note, and the combination of bitter grapefruit segments and cracked white pepper cut the oil. Soupe à pistou, the Provençal minestrone, validates Mr. D'Amico's passport. It can be a horrible slush of overcooked vegetables with a vague hint of basil and garlic. At Nice Matin, the zucchini dice and fat fava beans retain their integrity, and the pistou enunciates clearly. This is the soupe à pistou for diners who had given up. Pan bagnat, I have to say, seems odd. The dish, Provençal for ''bathed bread,'' is a salade Niçoise stuffed between two halves of a roll and drenched in olive oil. The secret lies in weighing the sandwich down with a heavy plate for an hour or so until the oil soaks the bread. Nice Matin skips that part of the equation. The result is a tasty but not very distinctive salad sandwich. Bitter orange, one of the great Niçoise flavors, shows up in an impressive daube of beef short ribs, a glistening, black monolith of meat whose richness is nicely offset by orange and sage. A sharp note of orange also corrects the fattiness in ravioli stuffed with braised lamb. Mr. D'Amico also sneaks in a few Moroccan influences, notably in a spice-rubbed salmon with bulgur salad and harissa, but also in a crisp pastry tube stuffed with potatoes, onion and lamb. Do not attempt conversation. The brutal acoustics at Nice Matin preclude it. Diners can either scream at one another or study the décor, which flummoxed everyone I took to the restaurant. Victorian flocked wallpaper runs right up against a retro 70's pattern that looks like an unfurled spotted ribbon. Oversize black-leather booths clash with handsome dividers in polished blond wood. The huge light fixtures that dominate the room resemble white plastic carousels with bare, dangling bulbs. Was there a distress sale at a catering hall? The pleasure is all on the plate, and it carries right through to the desserts. I'm not sure about the so-called madeleine, surrounded by chopped strawberries in syrup. It looks an awful lot like a doughnut, and a lot like a country bumpkin side by side with the elegant chocolate ganache, a lighter-than-air mousse wrapped in a thin cylinder of dark chocolate and layered with passion fruit sauce. It's a Sacher torte with a French makeover. The little lemon tart is like a burst of sunshine, with a good, buttery crust and an intense lemon filling. The real lemon tour de force, though, is a milk chocolate pot de crème, topped with a lid of toasted meringue and enlivened with a subtle citric charge. One of the simplest desserts of all, a scoop of lavender-honey ice cream, is a lovely tribute to Provence. I can't think of a better way to end the meal, unless it's to order a muscat, the opulent fortified wine from Beaumes-de-Venise that seems to squeeze a bushel of apricots and melons into each glass. The French drink it before the meal. They're wrong. At Nice Matin, it's a way of snatching a last, honeyed drop of pleasure from a cuisine that exists only to please.

454,Agave,1 star,"March 12, 2003",William Grimes,West Village,Southwestern,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/12/dining/restaurants-heading-out-on-a-southwestern-limb.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/12/dining/restaurants-heading-out-on-a-southwestern-limb.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"SWINGING BEEF sounded like just the thing, ''a brace of pan-tanned bullberrie crisps with a chipotle salsa,'' as the menu has it. The waitress gave me a stricken look. ''Um, do you know what that is?'' she asked. No, I said, but ''pan tanned'' sounded enticing. ''They're bull testicles,'' she said. ''And actually, they're going off the menu this week.'' Not a huge demand, apparently. But give Agave an A for effort. The cuisine at Agave is billed as New Southwestern, and it comes in handsome surroundings. The walls are smooth, cool adobe, lighted dimly by flickering white candles massed in fireplace-like niches. The ceiling is lined with rough-hewn spruce-fir branches arranged in a hatch-mark pattern, and tribal artifacts, distributed sparingly on the walls, add a tasteful commentary on the food. The prevailing mood of calm and restraint ends with the menu, a dizzy document with more thrills and spills than a condemned roller coaster. In the hands of Bill Lawlor, who designed the restaurant and devised the menu, and his chef de cuisine, Richard Pang, who is from Malaysia, New Southwestern becomes an impetuous, slightly mad adventure, a blur of spices, colors and textures that reminded me of those spinning plate paintings that used to be popular at fairs. You squeezed a few blobs of bright colors on a disk, flipped the switch and let 'er spin. Mr. Pang seems to be willing to try just about anything, up to and including pan-tanned bullberries, and more often than not, things work out in his favor. In other words, there is a lot more method than madness at Agave. The basket of blue corn tortilla chips that arrives as soon as you sit down provides badly needed reassurance. They are warm, feather-light, superlatively crunchy and sweet with blue-corn flavor. They come with a pleasant, mildly spiced bean dip and an unconvincing salsa, but they go best on their own. A second positive sign is Mr. Pang's ''roadhouse chili,'' a stewlike interpretation of the Tex-Mex classic, packed with butter-soft chunks of beer-braised beef and pork in a spicy sauce with intense tomato flavor. Mr. Pang understands spices. He doesn't use them to traumatize the tonsils or boost the beer sales. He treats them as valued supporting players, never allowing them to upstage the stars. Chilies, paprika and cumin, for example, bring out the sweetness of blue corn in a thick posole stew, while smoky, low-heat chipotles -- the animating principle in a creamy dipping sauce -- allow the mild flavor of squid to come through a layer of crisp breading. At the same time, who are we kidding? The cuisine at Agave, by design, has a large trash element to it. One of the best things on the menu is a sloppy bowl of three melted cheeses -- Monterey Jack, queso blanco and white cheddar -- poured over pieces of spicy chorizo. You can call it fondue, but to me it is tailgate cuisine. Of the highest order. Throwing strips of sugary jerked beef into the posole stew, a bad idea, fits right in with diner concepts like Southwestern shepherd's pie, a heaping helping of chili topped with macaroni and Jack cheese, or the go-for-broke short ribs, a mountain of rich, tender beef braised in mole colorado and fighting for space on the plate with barbecued onions and jalapeño gnocchi. There comes a time when the wisest course of action is to pile on, and Mr. Pang understands this. He knows how to deploy gobs of molten cheese. The flops at Agave are unmistakable. Jalapeño gnocchi, tremendously appealing on paper, have a gummy texture and scant evidence of jalapeño, a pepper that needs to be unleashed. Using jalapeño subtly is like casting Steven Seagal in ''Pride and Prejudice.'' Agave's guacamole is similarly noncommittal and oddly spiced, with an intrusive note of cumin. Most of the salsas seem tired, as does the ceviche of red snapper. Rather than the bull testicles, I would vote for dropping the daurade fillet cooked in a banana leaf with corn masa and mole sauce. It has the solidity of a brick. A close cousin on the menu, red snapper fillet cooked in rice paper, fares much better. The fish comes out moist and flaky, after an aromatic steam bath in cilantro and herba buena. Bits of chili-heated mango set the fish off nicely. Desserts fall short, although the mango napoleon does make a strong visual impression. It's a big, round ball of vanilla gelato poised between two oversize nests of phyllo pastry that look like Elizabethan collars. Search hard and you may find some tiny strips of caramelized mango in there somewhere. Pot au crème of Mexican chocolate is bland, and for some reason, the delicious-sounding fried plantain split, stuffed with dulce de leche, was always off the menu. A modest Key lime meringue tart turns out to be the winner of the bunch, with a buttery, flaky crust and pure lime flavor. The service at Agave is just a notch above the ''hi, guys'' level. The servers are young and sweet-natured and happy to oblige, but dishes do not always arrive. It can take forever for someone to pick up the check and another eternity for it to be processed. Perhaps it seems longer because the restaurant's Mission chairs, although beautiful to look at, are cruel, although not as diabolical as the backless banquettes, which will either straighten your spine or kill you in the course of an evening. Only a couple of ruby-red cactus-pear margaritas can dull the pain.

455,Otto Enoteca Pizzeria,2 star,"Feb. 26, 2003",William Grimes,Greenwich Village,"Italian, Pizza",https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/26/dining/restaurants-a-pizzeria-where-you-can-skip-the-pizza.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2003/02/26/dining/restaurants-a-pizzeria-where-you-can-skip-the-pizza.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IT takes salesmanship and flair to sell the idea of lard on a pizza. But these are precisely the qualities that define Otto, an inspired collaboration of four partners, Mario Batali, Joseph Bastianich, Mark Ladner and Jason Denton. The first two are well known to New York diners as the creators of Esca, Babbo and Lupa. At Otto, their largest restaurant to date, they took on two extra hands, Mr. Ladner, Lupa's chef, and Mr. Denton, a partner in Lupa. The new venture has its front door on Eighth Street, hence Otto, Italian for ''eight.'' That's OH-toe, please, not Ah-toe. The restaurant is advertised as an enoteca and pizzeria, which is more and less than the truth. There is a serious all-Italian list, which includes a mouth-filling, very fruity white wine from Mr. Bastianich's vineyard in Friuli. There are also a lot of pizzas, some traditional, others unique to Otto, and all cooked on top of the griddle rather than in an oven. But Otto may be the only pizzeria in New York where it's possible to skip the pizza entirely. The menu is devised, ingeniously, to stave off boredom, with separate categories devoted to antipasti, bruschettas, pizzas, fried appetizers, cheeses and desserts. To add interest, one item in most categories changes daily, so there's a new bruschetta, fried appetizer, traditional pizza and new-wave pizza each day. Initially, it's a little bewildering, but the well-trained waiters start each meal by explaining the Otto system. My advice is not to overcommit to the pizza. Some are terrific, notably the pizza topped with lardo, or cured salt pork. Like the pizza bianca, which is flat bread brushed with oil and sprinkled with sea salt, the lardo harks back to what might be called the pre-Columbian or Roman pizza, which did not have any tomato. The lardo version is simply covered with paper-thin strips of glistening, translucent, heavenly pork fat (which has less cholesterol than butter and fewer calories than olive oil) and scattered with bits of pungent rosemary. The crust, which was chewy bordering on tough in the early days, improved greatly with time, becoming lighter and flakier. Otto has average pizzas, good pizzas, excellent pizzas and odd pizzas, like the one topped with ricotta, sliced potato and marinated anchovies. Not everyone will appreciate getting clams in the shell on the vongole pizza, but the combination of clams, chili and garlic makes for a zesty pie. The classic margherita, the famous tricolor combination of tomato sauce, buffalo mozzarella and basil leaves, makes a feeble impression. It's dull. It cannot compare to the Thursday special pizza, topped with tomato sauce, roasted golden tomatoes, two cheeses and nuggets of cured pork jowl, or the frizzy-looking pizza topped with tomato, raw fennel and shaved bottarga, or pressed mullet roe. After many meals at Otto, however, I found true happiness by grazing the margins of the menu. The appetizers, many served in mustard-colored ceramic ramekins, can make a full meal. Cauliflower florets tossed in garlic, lemon and bits of olive have the winning simplicity that defines Italian food at its best, as does a generous serving of eggplant caponata, its almost dangerous sweetness cut by slivers of sharp, pungent calamata olives. Mushrooms, on the other hand, are so fiercely marinated that they become slippery bits adrift in an acidic sea. The fritto category is rewarding. Small triangles of fried chickpea, served with a squeeze of lemon, are delicately breaded and sweetly creamy inside. Whitebait, fried to the crackling point, are tossed with fried sage and marjoram. They are perfection. The fish list offers a half dozen choices, but I kept returning to the marinated anchovies, served with sliced scallions and rough croutons soaked in good olive oil. The lardo can be ordered on its own. Like the rest of the meats, except for the prosciutto di Parma, it's made on the premises. Otto's menu categories take on a life and a personality of their own. Rather than abstractions, they become friendly territory to explore. There's something about the presentation, and the pleasing logic of the thing, that makes you want to work methodically through each and every dish in each category. Admirably, this clean, elegant concept carries right through to the dessert stage, when diners face two choices, cheese or gelato. Otto puts a spin on its small cheese list by pairing each cheese with fruit, in an unusual form, like the little sour cherries in syrup that accompany a slab of soft gorgonzola dolce, or the sweetly vinegary saba, or grape must, that makes a dipping pool for large chunks of Parmesan cheese. The dessert plan is simple. It's gelato, served in a steel coupe and eaten with a spade-shaped spoon. The quality is very high, so unadorned flavors like hazelnut, chocolate or caramel can shimmer in their own light. Like the pizzas, though, the gelati come plain and fancy, and a couple of the fancier ones are stunners, like an appealingly sour ricotta gelato with crunchy glazed walnuts and dried figs reconstituted in red wine and sugar syrup, and the brilliantly improbable olive-oil gelato sprinkled with grains of sea salt. Otto is a pleasure in almost every way. Mr. Batali and his partners somehow know exactly when an idea becomes a gimmick, and they stop just short of the line. Vintage Italian deli slicers and scales, in Ferrari red, add a bright touch to the front room, with its wine bar and stand-up tables with marble countertops. Even the check-in procedure has a bit of drama to it. Diners announce themselves, and if there's no table, they are issued a train ticket with a destination on it. The idea is to have a glass of wine at one of the marble tables and check a large blackboard. When Firenze or Lucca or Napoli shows up on the board, the table's ready. It's a little silly, but ingenious and irresistible. Just like Otto.

456,Il Gattopardo,2 star,"Aug. 28, 2002",Eric Asimov,Midtown,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/28/dining/restaurants-the-cooking-of-naples-pure-and-simple.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/28/dining/restaurants-the-cooking-of-naples-pure-and-simple.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE perennial appeal of the little Italian restaurant may not reside among life's deepest mysteries, but many adventurous eaters regard the thought of a meal at yet another trattoria with the yawns ordinarily reserved for a night of Chinese takeout and reruns of ''Cheers.'' For such naysayers, I recommend a helping of meatballs from Il Gattopardo, a tiny, understated Neapolitan restaurant that opened last year on West 54th Street across from the permanent home of the Museum of Modern Art. Il Gattopardo's meatballs are not precisely balls. They are, more accurately, patties of beef and veal flavored with white wine and thyme and served tightly wrapped in silky cabbage leaves, which not only keep the meat wonderfully juicy but add their own sweet fragrance. It is a simple dish, rustic even. Yet its uncomplicated elegance stirs the soul in a way that any number of drizzled, bedded, foie-gras-bedecked creations cannot. Similarly, though meatloaf may not merit much respect among card-carrying epicures, Il Gattopardo's loosely knit, terrifically savory meatloaf (really a larger-scale meatball) achieves a height of peasant refinement, blending not only ground veal, beef and pork, but salami, prosciutto, eggs, pine nuts and pecorino cheese. Suffice it to say there is nothing the least bit fussy about Il Gattopardo (The Leopard), where an emphasis on simplicity often translates into high satisfaction. Almost nothing detracts from the food in the slender, almost spartan dining room. Creamy white walls are adorned with only a narrow, smoky mirror, and white-jacketed waiters set the tone immediately, bringing bountiful baskets of bread and crisp, peppery breadsticks along with the small, straightforward menu. It's a sceneless departure for the owner, Gianfranco Sorrentino, who was a partner in Sette Moma and a longtime manager at Bice. But he and the chef, Vito Gnazzo, who both hail from Campania, seem freed to delight in their home cooking. One of the restaurant's plainest dishes, a special of cold zucchini soup, is also one of the most luxurious. It's no more than puréed zucchini flavored with mint, perhaps a bit of cream. But it is sumptuous and opulent, perfectly seasonal and so good you want to dredge up every last drop with a piece of bread. Among the appetizers, braised escarole, stuffed with olives, anchovies and pine nuts, has a sweet and salty appeal that is quintessentially Neapolitan. And I loved a mélange of tender baby artichokes with Parmesan and smoked mozzarella. Fried cakes of buffalo milk ricotta and eggplant are crisp and satisfying, served with a spicy tomato sauce. Strips of smoked veal enliven a salad of baby greens and asparagus tips. While the appetizer selection includes many of the menu's highlights, the pastas succeed as well. Genovese sauce, paradoxically another Neapolitan specialty, is unknown in Genoa or anywhere else in Italy, unless a Neapolitan chef has introduced it, as Arthur Schwartz points out in his book ''Naples at Table'' (HarperCollins, 1998). Il Gattopardo's is superb, a rich ragù of pork and onions cooked for hours down to their sweet essences without even a hint of tomato, served with fat tubes of paccheri pasta, which have just the right amount of give to them. For tomato, the spaghetti alla chitarra is supremely lively and delicious, with only a few herbs tossed in. Circular ravioli, stuffed with veal, ricotta and thyme, goes well with a mildly spicy tomato sauce, but tagliatelle with roasted peppers and sun-dried tomatoes is a perfect illustration of why the craze for sun-dried tomatoes died years ago: when used injudiciously, an uncharacteristic flaw at Il Gattopardo, they overpower all flavors in their path. With the exception of the meatloaf and the roasted lamb chops flavored with herbs, the main courses are several notches less enticing. Sautéed veal loin is rare and tender, yet without flavor; simplicity here is a drawback. Same with lightly breaded swordfish, which does not have much to recommend it outside of its side dish of garlicky broccoli rabe. Fat sea scallops are tasty enough, served in a sauce of garlic cooked slowly until it turns sweet. But fish and shellfish stew cannot overcome a lackluster broth, which does not inspire the sopping up with bread, by which such dishes are judged. Service is sweet and almost shy, with the exception of a host, Valentino Culla, who delights in reminding you of the dishes and wines you had on your last visit. Incidentally, Mr. Culla is passionate about the wine list, which is well chosen and offers some gems, like Il Bacialé, an unusual blend of barbera and pinot noir from Giacomo Bologna. If the mood strikes, at dessert he may favor a table with a glass of floral moscato d'Asti, which is like a fragrant meadow in a glass. Moscato d'Asti is the perfect dessert, although the granular ricotta cheese cake known as pastiera comes close, as does an excellent lemon tart topped with meringue. As with the best home cooking, Il Gattopardo does not challenge so much as embrace. In a city where likability is often taken for weakness, Il Gattopardo wears its with honor.

457,MarkJoseph Steakhouse,1 star,"July 31, 2002",Eric Asimov,Financial District,Steak Houses,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/31/dining/restaurants-ever-see-a-porterhouse-bow-to-brooklyn.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/31/dining/restaurants-ever-see-a-porterhouse-bow-to-brooklyn.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"SUCCESS, it is sometimes said, is knowing what to imitate. If so, the MarkJoseph Steakhouse has had things right from the beginning. As its model, it took Peter Luger, the Brooklyn institution, which, though I haven't fully completed my research, may well serve the best steaks in the world. MarkJoseph opened only a year and a half ago, which puts it about a century behind. Still, with an owner, Charlie Blair, who used to be a general manager at Luger, it is betting on the burly appeal of the 19th-century steakhouse rather than offering a more refined 21st-century vision. The backward orientation is fitting. Situated in the South Street Seaport Historic District, MarkJoseph, named for a son of one of the owners, takes its place among cobblestone streets and 18th- and 19th-century structures. It's almost a surprise to happen upon the restaurant in those otherwise quiet walkways, practically under the Brooklyn Bridge, where the smell of the Fulton Fish Market lingers in the air. With a low ceiling and stout supporting pillars, the dining room feels small, and when the room fills up, it can barely contain the hearty roar of the off-duty traders, bankers and businesspeople who make up the bulk of the weeknight crowd. Without Luger's airy beer hall spaciousness to dissipate the noise, MarkJoseph must fall back on civilizing touches, like tablecloths, to absorb the sound. The dining room, I'm happy to say, has not adopted sepia photos, brass rails and other Olde New York imagery, but a sky-blue ceiling with painted clouds? It's like a vase of flowers in the middle of a rodeo. Like Peter Luger, MarkJoseph is a porterhouse specialist, offering huge steaks that serve two, three or four people each. You can hear the steaks sizzling and popping from across the room as a troop of white-aproned waiters ferries over an order, ceremoniously propping up one end of the oblong dish on your table -- just as at Luger -- so the juices run to the other, where they pool at the rim. The steak is presliced, and the waiters quickly distribute the meat, spooning the juices over the slices. Here is where the resemblance to Luger ends, for while the porterhouse is remarkably tender, with a well-charred, salty crust, it cannot match the firm, chewy texture of the Luger porterhouse or its funky mineral-laden flavor. It has a soft blandness that may thrill those who like their beef buttery but will leave lovers of dry-aged steaks unsatisfied. Fortunately, unlike Luger, MarkJoseph goes beyond the porterhouse. Its rib steak, served unsliced on the bone, has an excellent, subtle dry-aged flavor that makes it almost impossible not to pick up the bone to gnaw off the last few bits. Sirloin steak, already sliced, is likewise densely flavored and pleasingly chewy, while the filet mignon, like all good filets, will almost melt in the mouth, though its flavor comes more from the crisp crust than aging. One worthy alternative to steak is an order of the meaty double lamb chops, massive yet almost delicately tender and mild, served with a disarmingly small vessel of mint sauce. Yes, the menu offers seafood, but these selections are simply meant to pacify the nonsteak-eaters among us who must have their place at the table. The tuna, salmon and catfish are a nondescript bunch, and while the lobster tails are tasty enough, why lobster tails? If you're going to have lobster, you may as well have the whole bib-wearing, shell-cracking, butter-dripping-down-the-side-of-the-mouth experience. Well-textured mashed potatoes and crisp hash browns ace out the rather ordinary fries, while creamed spinach has its moments -- rich and flavorful one meal, overly slippery the next. Taking another page from the master, MarkJoseph offers as an appetizer a thick, sizzling slice of smoked bacon, which actually outdoes Luger's for its full-throttle hammy flavor. An order of bacon and a plate of the impeccable clams or oysters makes a perfect warm-up for the carnivorous pleasures to come. But don't bother with the mealy, granular shrimp cocktail or the less-than-crisp calamari. And if you simply must stay in the Luger mode, a pitcher of cloyingly sweet steakhouse sauce is on every table to adorn your tomato-and-onion salad. The waiters -- even the waitresses -- adhere to the tradition of gruff, affable service, complete with an inexhaustible supply of rimshot lines: ''Let me tell you about our specialty, chicken.'' Sometimes the past and present collide unexpectedly. MarkJoseph's waiters are a diverse lot -- nothing unusual there -- yet it's hard not to smile when a Mexican waiter, reciting the list of desserts in full accent, remarks that they all come ''mit schlag.'' Excellent schlag it is. Thick, rich and creamy, it's a fine accompaniment to a tart, supple Key lime pie, though it's hard to conceive of plowing through the entire mound after a full meal. Other desserts are predictably hefty, like a MarkJoseph special tart, which seems formed of equal parts cheesecake, chocolate mousse and truffles, and an enormous wedge of three-berry pie. MarkJoseph knows what it emulates. It is a likable addition to the steakhouse lineup, doing justice to its historic neighborhood with its respect for New York traditions. But its own personality is not yet fully formed. One goes to Luger for porterhouse, to Sparks for strip steaks and a great wine list in a quieter environment, to Smith & Wollensky for masculine rowdiness. MarkJoseph knows its role model, but it doesn't yet know its role. MarkJoseph Steakhouse * [rating: one star] 261 Water Street (Peck Slip), Manhattan; (212) 277-0020.

458,Teodora,1 star,"July 24, 2002",Eric Asimov,Midtown East,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/24/dining/restaurants-a-homey-greeting-with-a-pedigreed-menu.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/24/dining/restaurants-a-homey-greeting-with-a-pedigreed-menu.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ON an unlovely commercial strip of East 57th Street between Lexington and Third Avenues, Teodora stands out like a non sequitur. A restaurant this sweet and hospitable ought to throw open its door on a neighborly street with families on stoops, or at least on a piazza in Ravenna, since its specialties hail from Emilia-Romagna. The region is home to some well-known foods. It can claim perhaps the greatest cheese in the world, Parmigiano-Reggiano, from Reggio, and a remarkable collection of cured meats and sausages like prosciutto from Parma and mortadella from Bologna. It produces wondrously pure butter and exceptional durum wheat for pastas. Aged balsamic vinegar, potent enough to perfume a house and fine enough to sip, comes from the city of Modena. Yet when you put the ingredients together and try to conjure up the cuisine of the region, little comes to mind except maybe the famous Bolognese sauce, which, strange as it may seem, many people associate with Tuscany. Perhaps this is because dishes that for years have been passed off as ''Northern Italian,'' like tortellini and other stuffed pastas, are in fact from Emilia-Romagna. Teodora has been open for more than five years, quietly charming its diners without calling much attention to itself. With its beige walls, slightly dulled by the residue of nights of dining, and its worn terrazzo and wood floors that slope this way and that, Teodora feels as if it's been around forever. Roberta Ruggini, who owns the restaurant with Giancarlo Quadalti, its chef, has adorned almost every available surface with her collection of homey knickknacks. Carved wooden trays and scads of dishes lean against walls, rolling pins balance on Victorian sconces and big pots of flowers are wrapped in beribboned receiving blankets. Ms. Ruggini embraces customers as if they were guests in her home, making them feel like indispensable members of the restaurant's family. Mr. Quadalti's food, though occasionally rustic, is by no means simple. Lasagna, cooked ever so slowly until the béchamel and Bolognese sauces meld into a creamy whole, is a model of painstaking preparation, hearty and rich, yet far more elegant and concise than most lasagnas. His piadina, the traditional unleavened griddle bread that has nourished Romagnans for centuries, has a texture that is both firm and chewy, and a nutlike flavor that is superb, whether heaped with paper-thin slices of prosciutto, salami and sausage, or buttery stracchino cheese, a specialty of Lombardy to the north. Chicken livers, glazed in balsamic vinegar, are sweet and earthy with soft roasted onions, while Parmesan sformato, a kind of airy pudding, is surrounded by a field of chopped porcini mushrooms imbued with garlic, which perfectly complement the sformato's cheesy tang. Mr. Quadalti maintains a sense of delicacy even when straying beyond the regional borders. Delicate fried artichoke leaves, strewn with piquant fried parsley, are so tender they almost dissolve in the mouth. Slender fried zucchini blossoms, a special one night, were equally sheer and light, served with a handful of little shrimp cooked with garlic tossed over the top. A big bowl of clams and mussels, so tender they barely require chewing, are excellent sautéed in olive oil and garlic. Pastas break little new ground and are served American-style, heaped with sauce, but some are very good nonetheless. Strozzapreti, torn pasta strips with a name that translates provocatively as ''priest stranglers,'' are interlaced with shreds of sausage, herbs and roasted peppers, while tagliatelle comes in a Bolognese ragù layered with intense meat, chicken and vegetable flavors, both savory and sweet. I was less enamored with tagliatelle with lobster and artichoke, and tagliolini with shrimp, crab meat and lobster; the seafood was consistently overdone. But gnocchi, nuggets of potato and spinach flour the size of fingertips, came in a sumptuous cheese sauce. Risotto seemed perfect to me, flavored only with herbs and chicken stock, until I noticed an extraneous lump of goat cheese in the center. Vitello tonnato is a supreme summer dish, and Teodora's is uncommonly lively: the cool rare veal is sliced thin, smeared with tuna-flavored mayonnaise and topped with chopped asparagus. Filet mignon, also sliced thin, is fanned around a heap of bitter broccoli rape, the cooking juices of both mingling together to form a perfect Italian pot liquor. On the heavier end of the scale, meltingly tender osso buco, full of herbs, arrives with a tiny fork sticking up from the center of a shin bone, for digging out the deliciously gelatinous marrow. As with the pastas, though, seafood dishes were lackluster. Orata in a sauce of white wine, lemon and capers was clearly weary, while fritto misto, an impressive-looking serving of fried seafood in a crisp potato basket, was almost entirely composed of fried calamari, with a few shrimp, mullet fillets and zucchini thrown in. In the end, it's essentially a bowl o' squid. Desserts are a familiar lot, with some fine choices like a caramel-flavored panna cotta, substantial yet not heavy, and a warm apple tart encased in almond pastry. My absolute favorite, though, was an unexpected gift. ''Here, it's just out of the oven,'' Ms. Ruggini said, setting down a plate of ciambelle, a traditional cake of Emilia-Romagna. The crumbly slices were subtly flavored with lemon and barely sweet, just the thing with some fresh fruit and a glass of passito, a modest Italian dessert wine. It was typical of Teodora, the thoughtful gesture to welcome guests. Teodora * [rating: one star] 141 East 57th Street, Manhattan; (212) 826-7101.

459,Molyvos,2 star,"July 17, 2002",Eric Asimov,Midtown,Greek,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/17/dining/restaurants-greek-fare-in-the-classic-home-tradition.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/17/dining/restaurants-greek-fare-in-the-classic-home-tradition.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"FIVE years can be an eternity in the restaurant business. Some restaurants, built on the shaky bases of fashionable dishes and celebrity appeal, will have already been blown away. Others may have been too hyperactive to evolve gracefully or too sluggish to evolve at all. Landlords, the economy, partnership disputes and a fickle public are but a few of the problems any restaurant will face. Just as thousands of small fry are born so that a few might survive, only a small percentage of restaurants make it to robust adulthood. When Molyvos opened a little more than five years ago near Carnegie Hall, its food, solidly grounded in the traditions of Greek home cooking, earned hearty applause. Like most restaurants, though, Molyvos has not been immune to change. Rick Moonen, one of the founding partners and a consultant to the executive chef, Jim Botsacos, left recently to open his own restaurant, and the tourist economy, on which its business partly depends, has been slow. Yet Molyvos shows few signs of faltering in the kitchen. Mr. Botsacos, who has been at Molyvos from the beginning, has almost imperceptibly tweaked the menu. Relying on the eternal appeal of traditional cooking and excellent ingredients, his newer dishes feel like graceful additions to the canon, but never like departures. From the long bar in the front, with booths and a large wooden communal table, to the airy room in the rear, its walls cluttered with urns and vases, black-and-white photos and maps, Molyvos is pleasingly informal. In a city where restaurants typically treat dining rooms as rush-hour subway cars, cramming too many tables into too little space, Molyvos is spacious enough to cross your legs or freely throw your arm over the back of a booth without fear of catastrophe. While familiar Greek dishes dominate the menu, it's worth trying some of Mr. Botsacos's more recent additions, like one called Greek fava. In fact, this appetizer is not made with fava beans but with yellow split peas, mashed and whipped to a froth and served as an almost lighter-than-air flan. Mr. Botsacos has also added a fabulous roasted tomato soup with a tangy flavor that seems a mile deep, and a lovely salad of black-eyed peas woven through with tender pea shoots and slivers of oven-dried tomatoes. Of course, it's hard to resist the old standbys, like the outstanding melitzanes salata, a light eggplant dip that resounds with the flavor of lively olive oil, which, along with tzatziki, a thick, refreshing yogurt made from sheep's milk, and oceanic taramasalata, the whipped cod roe dip, form an almost platonic ideal of Greek mezedes. Meaty pastitsio, served in a small ramekin and deftly touched with cinnamon and nutmeg, may be the best I've ever had, while baby octopus, grilled to a withered dryness on one occasion, was at its moist, smoky best on another. I was not won over by astringent stuffed grape leaves, but I was by an unusual version of dolmades, cabbage leaves stuffed with savory ground meat, in which simple flavors of olive oil and lemon gave an unmistakably Greek treatment of these more typically Eastern European ingredients. The best main courses tend to be the most straightforward. The kitchen gives special care to the fresh fish grilled simply over wood, like a light, lemony branzino and the slightly richer, more strongly flavored dorade royale. Grilled grouper made an appealing combination with new potatoes, green beans and chickpeas, and baby lamb chops are perfect with no more than a sprinkling of salt and pepper. While lamb shanks, braised and baked in a clay pot, may seem like a hefty dish for summer, the meat is exceedingly juicy and tender, served with orzo and roasted tomatoes. But the rabbit in stifado, a slightly sweet stew made with red wine and pearl onions, was dried out, and a roasted leg of lamb, though flavorful enough, was also too dry. Service is efficient and friendly, yet there seemed to be puzzling gaps in knowledge. Simple questions about Greek dishes and traditions required trips back to the kitchen for answers, all done willingly enough, but not what I expected. Similarly, the extensive wine list includes many Greek bottles, and waiters, though eager to advise on choices, were hard-pressed to say more than, ''That one's dry, that's dry, too, and that one's really dry.'' Desserts include many of the standards, like tart yogurt flavored with honey and walnuts, or a cylinder of baklava dripping with syrup, yet they are executed exceptionally well and served in enormous portions. I counted nine fritters on one plate -- each the size of a small doughnut, freshly made and drizzled with honey -- where maybe two or three would have done. Best of all was a sensational new dessert, a rough-textured walnut cake, flavored with olive oil, yet pleasingly sweet. Molyvos retains its thoroughgoing Greek appeal, and despite the rough waters facing many restaurants these days as they chart their courses toward middle age, Mr. Botsacos has kept a steady hand on the tiller. His assurance about where Molyvos comes from imparts a sure confidence about where it is going. Molyvos ** [Rating: Two Stars] 871 Seventh Avenue, near 55th Street, Manhattan; (212) 582-7500.

460,Patroon,1 star,"July 10, 2002",Eric Asimov,Midtown East,"New American, Steak Houses",https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/10/dining/restaurants-after-the-cigars-a-simple-steakhouse.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/10/dining/restaurants-after-the-cigars-a-simple-steakhouse.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"WHEN Patroon opened in Midtown in 1996, it revived a style of luxurious clubbiness that had come to seem threadbare and outmoded. With uniformed doormen, a richly appointed dining room and a menu that was among the most expensive in town, not to forget a sedate cigar bar upstairs and a list of bejeweled old Cognacs, Patroon charmed expense-account diners, who indulged themselves in the straightforward yet exquisite American cuisine. Not settling for popularity, the owner, Ken Aretsky, brought in a well-known chef, Geoffrey Zakarian, who, while staying true to the essentially conservative spirit of Patroon, was able to innovate on the sly, offering modern renditions of old school favorites like duck à l'orange. The smart likability of his cooking and the energetic professionalism in the dining room won Patroon three stars when it was last reviewed in The Times, by Ruth Reichl in October 1998. Much in life has changed since then, of course, including Patroon. Mr. Zakarian left in 2000 to open his own restaurant, Town, and last summer, after the economic slowdown took some of the starch out of high-end dining, Mr. Aretsky closed Patroon for renovations, saying he was aiming for a more stripped-down steakhouse approach. His plan seemed all the more sound after Sept. 11, when the conventional wisdom suggested that costly luxuries were no longer in good taste. The doorman is gone, the cigar bar is history (though the smell of stale cigar smoke lingers), and the new Patroon, done up in contrasting shades of brown and beige, looks more like the dining room of an airport hotel than an up-to-date ''21'' Club. This is not to suggest that Patroon has become inexpensive. It's a steakhouse with steakhouse prices, but the menu has been pruned of almost all excess and, for that matter, individuality. As you might expect, simplicity now rules. Oysters on the half shell are superb, although the selection is slim. I prefer the more delicate, saline Malpeques over the meatier Blue Islands, the two available one evening, but both were served perfectly, needing nothing to enhance their purity. The same can't be said of utterly tasteless shrimp, which are barely more pleasing when doused with barbecue sauce and grilled than they are served cold with cocktail sauce. But a jumbo crab cake is practically all meat, a thoroughly satisfying mouthful of pure flavor, while a fried soft-shell crab, a special appetizer one day, was delicately crisp and delicious. Caesar salad is well rendered, though I like a more pronounced anchovy presence. And truffle oil mars potato-and-leek soup, giving it a sharp, almost artificial flavor. Patroon faces stiff competition in a city full of steakhouses. As far as beef goes, though, little things tend to go wrong. Steaks, for example, were consistently overcooked -- medium instead of medium rare, well instead of medium. This is a pity, because the meat itself is quite good. I love the mineral tang of aged beef, and it's right there in the thick, firm sirloin and in the porterhouse for two. Even filet mignon (when not overcooked) was full of flavor beneath its well-charred exterior. But the Delmonico steak was barely aged -- soft and almost mushy. Maybe some people prefer their steaks that way. Among the accouterments, a platter arrives practically overflowing with onion rings, the slender, precisely battered O's almost uncannily identical. Creamed spinach, though, needs to be wrung of cream before a forkful can safely be lifted to the mouth. Strangely enough, where the steaks are wanting, fish dishes are excellent. Branzino, roasted whole and presented to our table on a wooden platter before filleting, was moist and faintly oceanic, enhanced with no more than garlic, lemon and herbs, while grilled Dover sole was supremely elegant. I might not return to Patroon for the steaks, but I would go for the simple, elemental fish preparations. I would come back too for the smart, well-chosen wine list. While the selection of first-growth Bordeaux, running $1,000 and more a bottle, remains from the old days, there are many excellent selections in the mere two-figure range. Desserts are straightforward in the typical steakhouse way -- hefty wedges of creamy cheesecake, chocolate cake with an interior that has the consistency of chocolate pudding and hearty hot fudge sundaes. While waiters are friendly enough, there is a lackadaisical, laissez-faire quality to the service that may have you wondering whether you'll ever receive menus or water refills. It's as if the crack professionals moved on when Patroon closed for renovations. It may be tempting nowadays to think of Patroon as an anachronism, a dinosaur struggling to keep up with swiftly changing times, yet it won't be the fault of evolution if Patroon falls by the wayside. Luxury dining may be somewhat toned down, but it hasn't died. People are still crowding into steakhouses, buying fine wines, foie gras and other emblems of pleasure. They're just a little more picky about where they are doing it. Patroon * [rating: one star] 160 East 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 883-7373. ATMOSPHERE Institutional and somewhat weary, lacking the energy that makes steakhouses crackle. SOUND LEVEL Reasonable, unless you are sitting next to a business group on its third bottle of wine.

461,Butter,1 star,"June 26, 2002",Eric Asimov,East Village,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/26/dining/restaurants-a-birch-forest-and-a-foot-in-two-camps.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/06/26/dining/restaurants-a-birch-forest-and-a-foot-in-two-camps.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"FROM the outside, it's difficult to fathom why Butter, which opened not long ago a few doors down from the Public Theater, requires a pair of grim hosts posted like sentries in a glass-walled vestibule, their arms mentally crossed. As with London beefeaters, I felt compelled on a recent visit to try to make them laugh, but I decided that they must have serious work to do, like fending off people who want to be seated before their full party has arrived. Everything changes once you get past the welcoming committee, though. A long hallway that resembles nothing so much as a sauna gives way to a slender bar and then to a vaulted dining room designed by Andrew Phillips that is done up in a cedar veneer with an illuminated photo mural of a birch forest filling the back wall. The waiters, in their checked shirts with ties tucked between the buttons military style, are eager to please, filling tiny goblets with free welcoming aperitifs and offering little treats to start. In many ways, Butter epitomizes the conflicted priorities of certain downtown restaurants that teeter between being dining rooms and clubs. From the velvet-rope vibe of the hosts to the fawning friendliness of the waiters, Butter tries to have it both ways. The chef, Keith Harry, once cooked at Chanterelle and has put together a serious contemporary American menu with all the requisite high-end ingredients and global touches. Yet Butter only half-promises the opportunity for an enjoyable meal. The dining room is serene enough, but a downstairs lounge with a ceiling made of saplings, two walls constructed of birch trunks and a third of wine bottles lighted in red and black, is loud and smoky, with the unappealing prospect of a D.J. booth that gets going later in the evening. Upstairs, appetizers in particular struggle to hold up the food end. For every success -- crisp sweetbreads surrounded by mustard greens, their nutlike flavor enhanced by a tangy mustard-caper sauce, or a mâche salad, the leaves as tender as baby cress, with sweet striped beets and little chunks of smoky sturgeon -- there is a miscue. Spanish mackerel was grilled to the point of mushiness, and a thin slice of raw hamachi in tamari and ginger juice was unfortunately withered around the ends. The fish was pristine in the tuna tartare, a well-conceived blend of clean ahi and smoky tuna ''bacon,'' but the sesame oil dressing overwhelmed the tuna flavors. Mr. Harry is more sure-footed with his main courses, especially fish dishes, in which he combines reticent and robust flavors without sacrificing balance. Roasted peppers, braised escarole and bits of Smithfield ham tease an almost Chinese cast from a fine piece of black sea bass. The delicate grilled turbot with snow peas and braised savoy cabbage also has an Asian character, perhaps because of the sake in the beurre blanc. A tapenade coating enlivened a rosy piece of tuna, though grilled swordfish was too dry. Roast chicken breast is not my idea of excitement, but Mr. Harry conceals morels and slivers of truffles underneath the meat, touches that seem wasted on the otherwise routine bird. A lamb chop and loin are juicy enough, and a beef fillet will do the job of placating beef lovers, but I don't see any reason other than novelty for ordering ostrich, a lean meat that, but for the faintest gamy aftertaste, falls into the lamb-beef spectrum with little to distinguish it. It would be easy to imagine Butter playing to the showoff crowd with a list of expensive wines. But the restaurant instead emphasizes good, moderately priced bottles, like a mineral-laden Austrian grüner veltliner from Bründlmayer and a full-bodied Crozes-Hermitage from Alain Graillot. The amiable list of desserts does not break new ground, though some offer appealing architecture. Dense and creamy chocolate-mocha cake comes with coffee gelato, the two linked by a spiral bridge of crisp cocoa pastry, while passion-fruit curd joins a pineapple tart and its accompanying coconut gelato. Soothing tapioca pudding needs no structural enhancement, nor does a bombe of fromage blanc sweetened with berry consommé. For those heading to the restaurant rather than to the lounge, Butter offers sound pleasures without much promise of excitement. Later in the evening, after 10:30 or so, a crowd indeed gathers out front, waiting to enter, many presumably en route to the lounge. The grim-faced sentries are still there, and regardless of what I've eaten for dinner, I know that I've had a better evening than they will.

462,Carlyle Restaurant,1 star,"May 29, 2002",William Grimes,Upper East Side,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/29/dining/restaurants-a-frump-does-something-about-it.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/29/dining/restaurants-a-frump-does-something-about-it.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"FOR what seems like decades, the Carlyle Restaurant has occupied the back of the Carlyle Hotel like a rich widow who managed to wrest control of the premises and won't leave. On my rare visits to the place, I was always shocked to find that the food was not at all bad, which is to say, it was a lot better than the threadbare surroundings. Rosewood Hotel and Resorts, which took over the management of the hotel last year, invested heavily to renovate the hotel, as well as the restaurant and the famed Bemelmans Bar. The results are impressive. The restaurant now looks the way a first-class dining room in a fancy hotel should -- formal, sumptuous and soothing to the senses. Dark taupe walls and matching velvet banquettes strike a luxurious note. An intimate room within a room, hung with large botanical prints by P. J. Redouté, beckons from the back, and a small lounge, whose oddly appealing decorating scheme includes wholesome country American wallpaper, is a tempting pit stop along the way. The Carlyle Restaurant used to feel like one big frayed cuff. Now it takes its rightful place alongside the dining rooms in Manhattan's finest hotels. Rosewood did not stop with the décor. It also hired a new chef, Jean-Louis Dumonet, to remake the kitchen and put the restaurant back in circulation. Mr. Dumonet was one of the three Jeans who in 1992 created Trois Jean, a strikingly handsome bistro with very good food, at least in its early years. As the restaurant lost its luster, Mr. Dumonet departed, cooking briefly at Palladin and then Rhône. His intentions at the Carlyle are hard to fathom. The busy menu, with many subdivisions and special categories, wanders hither and yon. Old warhorses like grilled Dover sole, chateaubriand and steak with béarnaise sauce mingle with more modern French dishes, often with a Mediterranean accent, like cod with black-truffle brandade and roasted poussin with preserved lemon, calamata olives and a cumin-spiced vegetable tagine. There are a half-dozen side dishes that can be ordered separately, daily specials and a ''familial'' menu of homey dishes like country pâté and hanger steak with shallots. It's an erratic, unfocused menu that seems to have been designed by committee, and perhaps cooked by committee, too, because the quality fluctuates wildly from dish to dish. I would like to think that it's Mr. Dumonet who makes the stunning roasted langoustines with gently browned gnocchi made from fingerling potatoes in a rich Parmesan emulsion. For purity and depth of flavor, it would be very hard to find a dish to equal this seemingly simple appetizer. Mr. Dumonet's langoustines seemed to contain all the taste that's missing from the crustacean that goes under that name in other restaurants. Biting into one, I felt like a gambler who's come up three cherries on a slot machine, unleashing a cascade of coins. And surely it's Mr. Dumonet's hand behind the cod steak, seared to a crisp, and lowered onto a firm pillow of brandade speckled with black truffles and sharpened up with a condimentlike serving of tapenade. The dish is really bistro fare that's been given an upgrade, but it slips into its high-class surroundings without a false note. Someone other than Mr. Dumonet must be making the pleasant but fairly ordinary velouté of green peas with duck prosciutto, the thin and watery broccoli velouté and the utterly pedestrian New York strip steak with béarnaise sauce and French fries. There are many dishes of this ilk on the menu, like the fricassee of asparagus and morels, dominated by enormous but flavorless asparagus, or the bland lemon risotto with spring vegetables. The picture brightens with a very light, delicately handled salad of crab and hearts of palm in a mixed citrus reduction. Soft-shell crabs amandine pair nicely with soft polenta, but a harsh anchovy coulis creates an annoying dissonance. Veal cheeks braised with white and pink baby carrots, another bistro-based dish, has a foursquare, muscular quality that seems a little down market for the restaurant. It's like a bouncer in dark glasses outside Alice Tully Hall. But one evening I was in the mood for veal cheeks, and Mr. Dumonet's version satisfied the urge. The one great flaw in the campaign to transform the Carlyle into a truly fine restaurant is service. The rigid, old-fashioned and pretentious style of service at the Carlyle, a relic of olden days, is rendered laughable by the charmlessness and indifference of the tuxedoed time-servers who grudgingly take your order and clearly hope you will depart sooner rather than later. ''Tonight's special is rack of veal,'' one captain intoned. ''It's very nice, and it comes with'' -- a long pause here -- ''a very nice sauce that the chef has made.'' The little ritual of presenting soup with the garnishes and solid ingredients arranged in the center of the bowl, and then pouring the soup itself, loses a little class when the soup is thrown into the bowl in one fast splash, like hogwash. I worried, one evening, that the captain had a pressing engagement elsewhere, because he took a position by the table, pencil and pad in hand, approximately three minutes after delivering the menus. There he hovered, immovable, until the table ordered. When he deboned a Dover sole, he looked like a surgeon performing an experimental procedure for the first time. It wasn't at all clear that the fish was going to make it to the table. The Carlyle has the looks. It has a chef who, if he can find his way and settle on an approach, could do the place proud. Fixing the service problems may be mission impossible. But those captains really do know how to wear a tuxedo.

463,Jo Jo,3 star,"April 17, 2002",William Grimes,Upper East Side,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/17/dining/restaurants-a-bold-bistro-stays-the-course-gracefully.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/17/dining/restaurants-a-bold-bistro-stays-the-course-gracefully.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"JO JO turns 11 this month. It seems only yesterday that a supercharged young chef named Jean-Georges Vongerichten left Restaurant Lafayette, having imprinted it with four stars, to open his own little bistro with a difference. It was casual, modestly priced and enormously influential, as Mr. Vongerichten continued to reinvigorate classic French dishes with vegetable-based sauces and Asian flavors. Mr. Vongerichten went on to create a restaurant empire that now stretches from New York to Tokyo. By rights, little Jo Jo should have settled into a comfortable rut, as most restaurants do after five or six years. Instead, after an extensive renovation, Jo Jo has shown, with extraordinary grace, how a restaurant can age without looking old. The face-lift helps. The cheeky bistro of yesteryear now has the taste, and the money, for velvet and expensive jewelry. The place looks sumptuous now, with plum banquettes in the tiny downstairs room and walls done in broad asparagus and celery stripes. Old-fashioned brass sconces make it feel like a Romanov railroad car. The upstairs dining room, overlooking 64th Street, is a genteel living room straight out of Vuillard. Jo Jo is the kind of restaurant that makes diners feel like members of an exclusive club. At the same time, it still has the heart of a bistro. The style of service is not overformal. The menu is a fairly short read, and the wine list, with perhaps 65 selections, makes a serious effort to please the $50 customer. There are a few heavy hitters for the kind of diner who simply must drink a $300 Bordeaux, but they are far outnumbered by wines like a $44 St.-Chinian Cuvée des Sigillaires from Moulinier, or even a $25 Chinon from Gasnier. Mr. Vongerichten has wisely retained a few signature dishes. The spring menu continues to offer an appetizer of shrimp dusted in orange powder, and the renowned roast chicken with chickpea fries is still an entree. Both dishes hold up very well, and they both exhibit, neatly, the ingenious weaving together of sweet, sour and bitter flavors that characterize Mr. Vongerichten's French-Asian style. The orange-shrimp combination, which teeters on the edge of sweetness, gets a quick correction from artichokes and arugula, just as green olives impose discipline on the flavors of ginger and coriander in the chicken dish. Jo Jo's chickpea fries, flattered by a thousand imitators, are still the ones to beat. Credit goes to Alex Powell, Jo Jo's chef de cuisine for the last six years. The food at Jo Jo never clamors for attention. Most dishes have a surprise or two in store, but they conquer by stealth, aided by a sure hand in the kitchen and a sane, clear-eyed view of how flavors work in combination, and which ones need to be framed and pushed to the fore. There's nothing fancy about grilled sardines topped with crushed pine nuts, lemon and parsley, but the sardines, plump and firm, come perfectly cooked, without a hint of dryness, like little Mediterranean seafood steaks. Soft-shell crab, done tempura style, holds its own against a wasabi-fired slaw of Napa cabbage and a sweet-hot honey-mustard sauce. A pristine pea soup sets itself a single goal, to express pea flavor with maximum clarity and presence, which it does. A couple of sticklike croutons for crunch, and a little constellation of chopped carrot, leek, celeriac and garlic supports the project, but the soup is an exercise in minimalism. The more adventurous goat cheese panna cotta, smooth as custard, takes a chance with candied ginger, but thin slices of cooked and pickled beets -- red, yellow and candy-cane -- head off the sweet tendencies of this dish before it turns into a dessert. A fenugreek and vegetable herb broth, like a nearly transparent veil of flavor, intensifies the natural richness of lobster served with Basmati rice. In a bold but entirely successful move, Mr. Vongerichten conjures up a light, bright and fruity sauce for black sea bass, with sweet shreds of carrot ''confit'' suspended in orange juice and olive oil accented with cumin. Slow-cooked salmon on a pillow of chive mashed potatoes seems, at first glance, like yet another dutiful salmon dish, but pickled ramps add a racy touch, set off brilliantly by an earthy chanterelle vinaigrette. On occasion, Jo Jo can send a merely good dish from the kitchen. The foie gras terrine, with a bitter lemon zest salad and a few haricots verts loitering on the plate, does not really make much of an impact, and lamb topped with finely chopped fava beans, artichokes, garlic and niçoise olives seems a little tame when set beside Jo Jo's duck, a rich red slab of meat with sweet and sour shallots and a Tunisian-style brek pastry stuffed with leg meat, foie gras and duck prosciutto. Desserts include one dull character, an unexceptional warm chocolate cake, with a molten center and a little scoop of vanilla ice cream on the side. It is perfectly respectable, but I have the feeling I've eaten the same dessert at a couple of dozen other restaurants. Once past the cake, the picture brightens. Strawberries and rhubarb find shared bliss on clouds of mascarpone sandwiched between thin sheets of pastry, and the fattest, firmest blueberries on record lend tactical support to a cheesecake perfectly balanced between sweet and sour, with a pastry base that could almost be its own dessert. Kumquat sorbet seems unnecessary, but there it is. A dainty lemon meringue tart, with a filling that begs to be eaten in slow, drawn-out bites, pays a lemon dividend after the tart itself has disappeared. It comes with a scoop of tingling lemon-verbena ice cream, its flavor as clear as crystal. This little shock of pure citrus took me by surprise. In my mind, it's shorthand for the new Jo Jo, a restaurant I thought I knew. It's older now, but still new in all the ways that count.

464,Café Sabarsky,2 star,"April 10, 2002",William Grimes,Upper East Side,Austrian,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/10/dining/restaurants-where-the-end-of-the-meal-is-the-beginning.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/10/dining/restaurants-where-the-end-of-the-meal-is-the-beginning.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"AT first glance, the lines outside the Neue Galerie might suggest enthusiasm for the art of Oskar Kokoschka. His Expressionist portraits are on display at the museum, the city's newest, and critics have been enthusiastic. But the visitors clogging the lobby have something other than Viennese modernism on their minds. They're thinking of Viennese pastry. When Ronald S. Lauder decided to create a museum to house the collection of Austrian and German art assembled by Serge Sabarsky, he wanted a cafe to go with it. It would be a real Viennese cafe, with marble tabletops, chairs designed by Adolf Loos and an authentic Viennese menu created by an authentic Austrian chef, Kurt Gutenbrunner, the owner of Wallsé. It was a good idea. Maybe too good. I'm willing to bet that at least half the museum's visitors whiz through the special exhibitions and the permanent collection in half an hour or so and then race downstairs for the aesthetic experience that really counts, coffee and linzer torte. It's a New Yorker cover begging to be drawn: Manhattan culture vulture staring intently at a nude by Klimt, with overhead thought bubble showing coffee and whipped cream next to a fat slice of apple strudel. Cup of coffee, or Kokoschka? It's a close call. If you've had the coffee at Cafe Sabarsky, you'll understand. It comes from Meinl's in Vienna, and I'm prepared to state that it's the best coffee in the city: rich, robust and deep. Add a huge dollop of whipped cream, a slice of strudel or torte, and you're in Lehar's Land of Smiles, a megacalorie Viennese never-never land built almost entirely of chocolate and sugar. There are about a dozen ways to reach this small paradise at Cafe Sabarsky, one for each of the desserts lined up on the cafe's marble mantelpiece. The end of the meal is the beginning, really. The rest of the menu presents some tried and true Austro-Hungarian staples, like goulash and tafelspitz, and some newfangled dishes, like cod strudel, all prepared in a kitchen the size of a broom closet. There's a nice list of about two dozen Austrian wines, selected by Alexander Adlgasser, formerly the sommelier at Danube and now, bow tie intact, serving as maître d'hôtel at Cafe Sabarsky. But the goulash, herring sandwiches and boiled beef, a little like the Kokoschka portraits upstairs, are merely a warm-up to the desserts. Shockingly, they are made by a Frenchman, Serge Decrauzat, formerly the pastry chef at Le Cirque 2000. Perhaps that accounts for the light hand in desserts like a yogurt cheesecake with a chiffonlike filling. Each slice revealed a translucent section of pear within and a bright red layer of raspberry jam underneath, tart enough to make the dessert sweet but not cloying. A crunchy layer of crushed pistachios on the outside was an unexpected bonus. A sponge roll stuffed with strawberry mousse and served with sliced strawberries has a bright, upbeat quality to match the season. The house specialty is a Klimt torte, neatly stacked layers of hazelnut cake alternating with firm, bittersweet chocolate. It deserves classic status, along with the linzer torte and the Sacher torte, both flawless. Two other desserts deserve special mention. The first is a visually striking multilayer dobosch torte, thin layers of yellow cake alternating with mocha butter cream. On top, balanced at a rakish angle, the torte wears a triangle of thin crunchy caramel. The final pastry in the drop-dead category is the cafe's apple strudel, which, when it is good, somehow manages to rise above the rest, not easy for an apple strudel to do. My three samplings have convinced me that when Mr. Decrauzat uses very tart apples, the dessert reaches sublime heights. He achieves an ideal balance of tartness and sweetness, with just the right proportion of raisins and walnuts. Blander, sweeter apples bring the strudel down a notch. On all three tries, the pastry was perfect, flaky and crackling outside, just slightly gooey inside. The savory dishes can be ordinary. Open-face sandwiches on chewy, caky dark rye bread do not make a strong showing. The liverwurst needs more than a tiny, dime-size dot of onion confit, the best part of the sandwich. The egg sandwich, described on the menu as spicy, was not spicy in the least. Freshly grated horseradish adds a sweet kick to a simple cooked ham sandwich and to the somewhat dry tafelspitz. Viennese sausages, served with potato salad, do not compare well with their German brothers. They have a smooth, bland quality that reminded me too much of Yankee Stadium franks. The cheese plate, mostly French, is nothing to write home about, and goulash soup, like hamburger soup, seems to exist as a reminder that goulash does not really need to be a soup. The actual goulash is good. And the quark spätzle that comes with it, cheesy, buttery and chewy, is one of those side dishes that nearly runs away with the whole show. The wild card on the menu, cod strudel, may be the best thing going among the nondessert offerings. Cod and sauerkraut are gently braised in riesling, flavored with a little tarragon and purple basil, then wrapped in a flaky phyllo dough. There's a deft touch here that deserves applause. The cod, somehow, never disappears, although you might expect sauerkraut to bury it without a trace. The setting for this Viennese operetta is ornate, a 1914 Beaux-Arts mansion designed by Carrère & Hastings. It is old-fashioned, opulent and no doubt aswarm with genteel ghosts from Edith Wharton novels. Restless or not, they now have the kind of desserts they deserve, even if the art is shocking.

465,Blue Fin,2 star,"March 6, 2002",William Grimes,Times Square Theatre District,Seafood,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/06/dining/restaurants-appearances-can-be-pleasantly-deceiving.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/06/dining/restaurants-appearances-can-be-pleasantly-deceiving.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"BLUE FIN is the sort of restaurant that encourages diners like me to set their sights low. It's in Times Square, for one thing. It greets the street with a glass-enclosed bar that looks like an advertisement for the latest youth-oriented liqueur. The restaurant itself can feed multitudes -- 400 diners on two floors -- and the waiters and waitresses look like cast members for next year's slate of young-adult sitcoms. A quick tabulation generated the following memo addressed to the culinary department of my frontal lobe: too big, too good-looking (both the interior and the personnel). Inform pleasure centers of brain that they can take the night off. Well, life is full of surprises. Blue Fin, a full-blast production from Stephen Hanson's B. R. Guest restaurant group, the very successful operation that runs Blue Water Grill, Isabella's and Ruby Foo's, delivers much more than it promises. In fact, it may be the most virtuous restaurant in Manhattan. I strongly suspect that it could get away with some fairly mediocre food and hitch a free ride on the look of the place and its presold cachet as part of the W hotel chain. But somewhere along the line, someone decided that they preferred to create a very good restaurant. The theme is fish, and anyone confused on this point gets a quick reminder on the floating terrazzo staircase. It looks out over a school of black fish suspended from the ceiling by fishing line, and a bright white plaster wall whose raised swirls seem as though they were shaped by moving water on the ocean floor. It makes a dreamy, very seductive transition to the water world of Blue Fin. The menu divides this world into two parts. Half of it is joined to a sushi counter, where Masaki Sasaki, formerly the head sushi chef at Kantaro Sushi in San Francisco, turns out sushi, sashimi and special sushi rolls. The raw-fish part of the menu  includes towering shellfish platters, labeled, by size, as a maison, castle or palace. The menu proper is in the hands of Paul Sale, a quietly talented British chef who did quality work as the executive chef at Icon, also in a W hotel, and who filleted a fish or two at Le Bernardin before that. Both Mr. Sasaki and Mr. Sale have very raw material to work with. The B. R. Guest empire is big. It buys a lot of fish. And because it buys a lot of fish it gets first dibs. The quality is unmistakable. Some of the freshest, most pristine fish I've eaten in many months has been at Blue Fin, where the oysters almost seem to twinkle and the tuna is pure velvet. One way to test the waters is simply to order sushi or sashimi by the piece, from a list of 20 varieties. I'm not usually enticed by fanciful sushi rolls, but Blue Fin's -- clever but restrained -- changed my mind. One of the simplest rolls, combining scallion and silky toro, or fatty tuna, is the best introduction to a list that includes shrimp coated in a crackling skin of tiny puffed rice and daubed with green curry ginger mayonnaise, and a tempura oyster, so lightly fried it still quivers inside, with a bright soy-ginger mignonette. The shellfish platters are undeniably impressive, but they have their ups and downs. The ups start on the ground floor, where the oysters await. They are superb specimens, three varieties that change with the market, and there are, in addition to a classic vinegar-pepper mignonette, three flavor enhancers, including a zippy tomato-horseradish granitè. Ascending the palace, a five-level Trump Tower priced at $100, I encountered lots of rubbery mussels, Jonah crab claws that seemed more trouble than they were worth, sweet and tasty crawfish, mammoth but very flavorful shrimp, a good but not exceptional two-pound lobster and a terrific scallop ceviche. The main menu, where the fin fish swim, is where Blue Fin impresses the most. Mr. Sale creates distinctive dishes that do honor to his ingredients. He does not overload the plate or step on the fish. Bigeye tuna, as succulent a piece of fish as you could hope to eat, is lightly dusted with cumin and charred on the outside. That's it. The fish is served with puréed butternut squash, broccolini and baby shiitake mushrooms in a  ginger-shallot vinaigrette. Wild salmon, with its meaty texture and strong flavor, is seared with aromatic sprigs of thyme and scattered with black trumpet mushrooms. A bed of French lentils makes this a red-wine fish dish par excellence. The most impressive entree, for my money, is a crisply sautéed fillet of Atlantic black bass served on a creamy shrimp and asparagus risotto. The genius touch is a shallow pool of chive nage. Nage, which so often translates as ''murky puddle of indeterminate color and no particular flavor,'' here reclaims its birthright. The color is the green of a crisp large-denomination bill. The flavor is etched sharply, a fresh, oniony note that brings the risotto, and the fish, to vibrant life. I have been revisiting this dish mentally since I encountered it on my first visit. Joseph Murphy, a former pastry chef at Gotham Bar and Grill, makes first-class desserts. His coconut-milk panna cotta is feather light but just rich enough to take on a bright, snappy soup of pineapple and passion fruit freshed up with a whiff of mint. Sour-cherry toasted almond cake, a bouncy Americanized financier, is perfectly crunchy on the edges and chewy inside, with a tart pool of red wine and sour cherry juice that slowly soaks into the cake. On top there's a scoop of morello cherry sorbet, as red and round as a clown's nose. Mr. Murphy even makes crème brûlée seem worthwhile. He served three in a neat row: Tahitian vanilla, milk chocolate and Sicilian pistachio. Eat them in that order. The pistachio, for one shining moment, makes all other nut flavors seem trivial. By the way, there is meat at Blue Fin. It's good. But why on earth would anyone bother?",
466,Osteria del Circo,1 star,"Jan. 23, 2002",William Grimes,Midtown,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/23/dining/restaurants-doorway-to-tuscany-by-way-of-the-circus.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/23/dining/restaurants-doorway-to-tuscany-by-way-of-the-circus.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IT'S hard to think of a restaurant that works harder at fun than Osteria del Circo. It opened, nearly six years ago, with a trumpet blast and a big shower of confetti, and if the owners, Mario, Marco and Mauro Maccioni, did not actually send out clowns on tiny tricycles, it's only because they could not quite figure out how. The restaurant, like the owners, is a younger, more casual offshoot of the very grand Le Cirque 2000, a kind of one-ring circus to Sirio Maccioni's three-ring, Monte Carlo version. The two restaurants share the same designer, Adam Tihany, who somehow managed to make Osteria del Circo even more carnival-like after it closed last year for renovation. The freshened Osteria del Circo has new harlequin-pattern fabric on the chairs, circus-theme midnight-blue banquettes, lots of trapezes hung from the ceiling, and a big metal lion draped over the coat-check concession. Tail wagging, it joins the rest of the junk-sculpture crew -- the chorus line of rotating circus performers balanced over the window to the open kitchen, and, high on a wall, the sinister-looking metal monkey holding a martini glass. The restaurant has lots of visual pizazz, and enough Italian warmth to fire the ovens. It's easy enough to settle in, enjoy the show and not worry too much about the undeniable fact that the food is nothing special. Those who do worry about such things, like me, can wind up feeling, by the end of the evening, that the monkey is having the last laugh. Simple is best. Appetizers and pastas, on balance, outperform the entrees. And there is light at the end of the tunnel, because Stephane Weber, the pastry chef, comes through with very pleasing desserts. The revised menu is much more Tuscan than it used to be, and waiters seem to enjoy underlining the fact, offering mini-travelogues about less familiar dishes, with footnotes about their origins and the way they are enjoyed in Italy. Occasionally they get carried away. My pasta turned cold one night by the time my waiter got through explaining it. As a greeter at the doorway to Tuscany, the fritto misto makes a poor impression. Slimy and tasteless, it satisfies only one requirement of the dish: it comes in an abundant heap. Scallops wrapped in crispy pancetta have the usual scallop problem, lack of flavor. The picture brightens with an excellent tartare of branzino, or Mediterranean sea bass, cut into small translucent dice, firm and meaty, and freshened with fennel, lemon and capers. Chilled lobster, removed from the shell and arranged stylishly over a bed of lentils, artichokes and arugula, makes an unusual match of rich seafood with dark, earthy flavors and the bright acidity of baby tomatoes. A special cold appetizer of braised beef tongue with puntarelle, a bitter green, and sliced porcini mushrooms in a light lemon-caper vinaigrette was fresh and simple, the hallmarks of Italian cuisine at its best. Spaghetti alla chitarra comes in a murky tomato sauce with rather mealy langoustines. It is easily outclassed by a superior risotto packed with button-size bay scallops, the rice firm to the bite but dissolving into creaminess at the edges. The slender sticks of battered and fried zucchini that came with it were a model of delicacy. Tortelli stuffed with pumpkin came with a small ball of braised goose meat, a tangle of small shreds steeped in a rich, citrus-accented liquid. It made an ideal middle course on a chilly night. And it raised an interesting question: whatever happened to goose? Main courses fall apart. Osso buco, a Wednesday special, is a slick, glutinous mass, with surprisingly untender meat concealed within. Grilled St. Pietro, or John Dory, was the centerpiece of a dish that would have been first rate, minus the fish, which was so tough it might have been an espadrille. It rested malevolently on a dark green bed of wilted kale, lightly sautéed with garlic. On the side was a tort of roasted vegetables in a flaky, buttery casing, a bit player worthy of a starring role. Roasted rabbit loin stuffed with fennel sausage acquits itself with honor, but rack of lamb and osso buco of lamb had all the appeal of a gnarled tree stump. The lamb was flavorless, gristly and tough. Cacciucco del Circo, a rustic fish stew, helps redeem the fish category. It's a bowl heaped with clams, mussels, octopus, cuttlefish, monkfish and prawns, in a burly tomato sauce so thick it can barely be called a liquid. The dessert menu delivers color, excitement and a badly needed touch of elegance. A simple, pristine cake made with goat cheese, mildly tangy and fluffy, meets its perfect match in a deeply concentrated cassis sorbet, echoed in a small puddle of cassis compote on top of the cheesecake, contained in a little pastry nest. Bomboloncini, little Tuscan doughnuts filled with vanilla cream, chocolate cream and raspberry marmalade, are fragrant and chewy. Mr. Weber manages to dazzle without being flashy. Even his chocolate desserts, which could easily go for the cheap thrill, remain models of decorum. The chocolate tart runs the risk of being upstaged by its scoop of caffè latte gelato, something that should be sold by the pint to take home. The zuccotto al cioccolato looks fearsome -- a dark, glistening dome that seems like a piece of expensive candy inflated to giant size. It is a suave, velvety dessert, intensely chocolaty without being cloying. Eat one of these after quaffing a major Barolo or Brunello, and you may wind up seeing eye to eye with that monkey.

467,Arabelle,1 star,"Sept. 5, 2001",William Grimes,Upper East Side,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/05/dining/restaurants-parisian-elegance-on-the-upper-east-side.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/05/dining/restaurants-parisian-elegance-on-the-upper-east-side.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IN Paris, the Hôtel Plaza Athénée has Alain Ducasse and three Michelin stars. In New York, the hotel has struggled to make a serious impact on the dining scene in recent years. In the 1980's, its restaurant, then called Le Régence, briefly had Daniel Boulud in the kitchen. When he departed for Le Cirque, the hotel imported the Rostang clan from France to keep the restaurant in the top rank. But with their departure, Le Régence slipped into overstuffed, overdecorated mediocrity. Now the Plaza Athénée is giving it another try. Le Régence is no more. In its place, after a $2 million renovation, is Arabelle, with a new chef, Raymond Saja, and a more contemporary, global French menu. On looks, Arabelle is a vast improvement over Le Régence. It has a subtly luxurious feel, with pale pink wall panels, wispy gold curtains and a gold-domed ceiling. Even the horrendous abstract paintings, chosen purely for their color schemes, do not break the spell, although once your eye settles on one, it's hard to tune it out. The moodily lighted lounge and bar just outside the restaurant's entrance, with tiger-print chairs and Orientalist knickknacks, should be on everyone's list of romantic meeting spots. The food is another matter. Mr. Saja, who worked at Le Régence before taking over the kitchen at Arabelle, proves that the restaurant world, too, has its fashion victims. In a clear case of overcompensation, he has avoided the fusty dishes and gold-plated war horses normally associated with fancy French restaurants in even fancier hotels. Instead, he has made a point of showing that he knows what foam is, that he can turn traditional terms like ''gratin'' or ''sorbet'' inside out and upside down, and that East and West can be made to embrace whether they like it or not. It's hard to tell what Mr. Saja's natural inclinations might be, but a dish like veal chop crusted in vegetable ''flour'' (Mr. Saja's quotation marks), accompanied by a crepe stuffed with wild mushroom ''daube'' (my quotation marks), tells me that he buried them fairly deep in devising his attention-getting menu. There's a little too much of everything here. As a result, ingredients often wage war on one another, or sit superfluously on a far corner of the plate, awaiting instructions. The most extreme example is the ultratrendy ''heirloom tomatoes, levels 1-8.'' The intent is to express tomato flavor eight ways, from tomato water to tomato oil to sun-dried tomato. It is all much ado about very little. There are wonderful appetizers, however, that should make all eight tomatoes blush with shame. Bits of citrus-cured salmon, clean-tasting and plushly textured, nestle in a shapely nest of microgreens and tiny, crunchy dice of jicama and malanga. Mr. Saja does justice to his seared foie gras, with an appropriately sumptuous accompaniment of figs, almonds and sharp, rich oloroso vinegar. The Spanish touch here is dignified, elegant and original, but the red snapper escabeche is bad. The fish, cut in thick slabs, is tough, and the vinegar marinade is overpowering. Ahi tuna served sashimi-style is simply buried under the multicultural flavors of Chinese broccoli, rock shrimp and wood-ear mushrooms in a sharp blood-orange sauce. The dish has a severe overpopulation problem. Overcrowding also afflicts the very flavorful loin of lamb with arugula, artichokes, Ligurian olives, tomato confit and roasted eggplant in a cumin broth. Mr. Saja makes a much better, more organized impression with his pan-roasted halibut with a golden crust, bathed in a well-judged truffled chicken jus, just the right level of richness to complement the fish, which is placed on a simple potato purée surrounded by chanterelles and topped with a paper-thin slice of salty roasted pancetta. Foam or no foam, I found the roasted poussin equally impressive. An emulsion of Vidalia onion and Madeira brought a sweetly earthy quality that suited the chicken meat perfectly. Lobster, sliced into neat scallop-like circles, looks lovely on the plate, arranged in overlapping rounds over a neat mound of sweet corn, truffles, julienne green apple and baby fennel. But the dish is too sweet. The wine list, it must be said, is skimpy, unimaginative and in every way unworthy of a restaurant bidding for respect. Kristen D. Murray's desserts at least have the virtue of being consistent with the rest of the menu. They use lots of herbs and even sneak in a little tomato. The rhubarb in white chocolate pain perdu is expressed three ways. Champagne gelée with vanilla fromage blanc and blood-orange sorbet is dense and heavy. Coconut tapioca, very weak on coconut flavor, features a salad of yellow tomato and mango with mango sorbet. The dessert reminded me of the old ''What's wrong with this picture?'' newspaper cartoons. Anyone guessing yellow tomato would be correct. The cheesecake is closer to a sideways napoleon, with paper-thin rounds of roasted pineapple sandwiching dollops of cheese filling that brilliantly evokes Philadelphia cream cheese. I mean this as a compliment. A scattering of cracked black pepper adds spice and cuts the sweetness just a degree or two. Arabelle has all the charm in the world. I can't think of a dining room more pleasing to look at, or to spend an evening in. But for a truly great meal at the Plaza Athénée, I'm afraid you'll have to fly to Paris.

Like a Detroit prototype car, the $27 DB burger has been through many redesigns and modifications, picking up and dropping ingredients along the way, and only gradually working its way onto the main menu after serving an apprenticeship as a weekly special. It is now the chief ornament of Daniel Boulud's newest venture, a lively, even raucous restaurant that tries to pass for a bistro but can't quite disguise its high-class leanings. Which brings us back to the burger. It stands high on the plate, a thick circle of ground sirloin stuffed with short rib meat braised in red wine and stuffed, in turn, with foie gras and truffles. Slices of tomato confit, like red splats from a paint gun, adhere to the meat, and spidery tendrils of frisée lettuce make a crunchy nest under a lid of soft Parmesan and onion bun. Mustard, onion and mayonnaise are presented in very French-looking crocks, along with soufflé potatoes in a silver julep cup. It is quite a production. Impressive, absolutely delicious and, for me, a little pointless. Mr. Boulud has proved that an American hamburger can be made to speak French. Bravo, and so what? DB Bistro Moderne, to give the full name, has a couple of inside jokes on the menu. The other is vitello tonnato dismantled and reassembled, so the dish comes out as tuna tartare with a crisp breaded sweetbread. The two actors in this little drama barely look at each other, and in fact, the second time I ordered vitello tonnato, Mr. Vitello did not show up for the performance at all, and was not missed, until an apologetic waiter came rushing over with a late plate. The tuna tartare is sublime, by the way, anointed with an unctuous, rich hazelnut-oil dressing whose identity is cleverly tipped off with a few hazelnuts strategically dotting the plate. Mr. Boulud is entitled to have a little fun. But it's when he rolls up his sleeves and gets serious that DB, the most casual of his three restaurants, really takes off. The cooking, although simplified to suit the bistro concept and even countrified on occasion, plays to Mr. Boulud's strength, his refined rusticity. Nothing seems to invigorate him more than a traditional, low-rent dish that he can work a little magic on, and at DB the entire menu presents him and his chef de cuisine, Jean-François Bruel, with just that opportunity. They grab for it with both hands. At times, it seems as if Mr. Boulud wants to show just how much he can do with a mere half-turn. Lovage oil, for example, sends a fresh, transforming whiff of celery wafting over marinated salmon, accompanied by a dollop of smoky eggplant caviar. At other times, he simply shows that rock-solid technique, good ingredients and a sound idea translate into gustatory bliss. There's nothing fancy about Mr. Boulud's tarte Tatin heaped with roasted tomatoes, goat cheese, basil and black olives, but a perfect buttery crust and tomatoes brought to peak concentration of flavor make a little miracle out of this humble tart. Gazpacho, tingling and vibrant, sticks to basics. It is clean, crisp and clear, with tender shrimp and small chunks of buttery avocado. Roasted duck breast, although a little chewy, has great depth of flavor, and Bing cherry sauce brings an innocent sweetness to the dish, offset by bitter Swiss chard. Confit de canard, the Tuesday plat du jour, looks like meat in a bowl. It is potently flavored, with garlicky roast potatoes and mushrooms reeking of the earth. The bowl is a good idea. You can lean over it and simply inhale the fragrance, like a burnt offering. One of Mr. Boulud's more convoluted efforts, boeuf en gelée with horseradish cream, served in a martini glass, seems a little forced at first glance, and a little formidable for an appetizer, but it turns out to be a winner -- cool, light and refreshing. The prices, by the way, put Mr. Boulud's new plaything into deluxe territory. Entrees dance around the $30 frontier and occasionally step over it. Cristina Aliberti's desserts are excellent. Years of catering to an Upper East Side clientele have given Mr. Boulud a supernatural hand with salads and spa fare. Ms. Aliberti, too, manages the trick of making very light desserts, like melon carpaccio with ginger sorbet as appealing as, say, her clafoutis tout chocolat, a small round chocolate cake, runny in the center, that looks like no clafoutis on earth. No one will object. Rich without being gooey, the clafoutis impersonator strikes me as the kind of chocolate dessert that can win over the most hardened chocolate skeptic. They do exist. I'm one of them. The service at DB is puzzling. It is disorganized. And the layout of the restaurant seems to accentuate the sense that things are only tenuously under control. The restaurant is divided in half, with a street level dining room that seems like a brasserie attached to the more formal room a few steps up and past a strikingly illuminated wine wall. Bottlenecks can develop at the hostess station atop the stairs. When both rooms fill, the kitchen can take quite a while to get the food out. And the waiters, although obliging and friendly, need to polish the rough edges. They sometimes disappear. One diner at my table was studying his wine list intently, only to have it whisked away from him. When the wine arrived, the waiter simply filled everyone's glasses without pouring out a trial taste to see whether the bottle was good. Well, this is DB, not Daniel. It's a rollicking, jolly place, and there's a very good reason why the mood is upbeat. Mr. Boulud, in a casual vein, is turning out some of the most appealing, accessible food in town. Even the Versailles-burger can't spoil the fun. DB Bistro Moderne ** [Rating: two stars] 55 West 44th Street; (212) 391-2400. ATMOSPHERE: Refined bistro cooking served in a lively, casual setting.

469,Peasant,1 star,"July 11, 2001",William Grimes,Nolita,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/11/dining/restaurants-rustic-italian-breathlessly-translated.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2001/07/11/dining/restaurants-rustic-italian-breathlessly-translated.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE concrete floor and the brushed-aluminum chairs send off warning signals. Is Peasant, despite the name, going to be an exercise in deprivation chic? The whitewashed brick walls and bare wood tables don't offer much hope. But closer inspection suggests that all is not as it seems. At the far end of the room, a brick pizza oven radiates heat. On a counter in front of the open kitchen, apricots, tomatoes and grapes have been massed in abundant display. Even the forbidding industrial chairs spring a surprise. They are form-fitting and inexplicably comfortable. The black-clad waiters turn out to be Jimmy Olsens in disguise, full of gee-whiz enthusiasm and can-do optimism. Peasant may be cool, but it's not cold. In the 15 months since it opened, Peasant has built a following by sticking to some very simple premises. Keep the food simple, rustic and Italian. Cook it over a wood fire. Serve abundant portions. Be nice. That's about it. When the formula works, Peasant sends out highly satisfying food, fresh and flavorful, with the rich tanginess that wood smoke imparts. Four big Mediterranean sardines, done to a crisp and drizzled with a little lemon and oil, manage to stay perfectly moist inside their crackling skins. They are flawless. This may not sound like much of an achievement, but after chewing my way through several schools of desiccated, flavorless grilled sardines all over the city, I knew that these prize specimens were heaven-sent. Panzanella is a warm-weather addition to the menu, a traditional bread salad that's a plumped-out, heartier cousin of Spain's gazpacho. Too much vinegar, and the wrong kind, can turn it into a palate scorcher. Peasant's is just right, a generous plate of chewy bread cubes, red onion and cerignola olives, with a subtle application of balsamic vinegar for roundness and sweetness. The buffalo mozzarella at Peasant could be better. It lacks the properly frappéed texture and fresh sourness that can make buffalo mozzarella seem, for a brief moment at least, the best cheese on earth. The good news is that it comes with strips of wood-roasted red pepper oozing thick, smoky juices. The small mozzarella balls known as bocconcini become Italian canapés after being wrapped in prosciutto, dusted in bread crumbs and baked. Somehow, cooking bleeds every bit of salt and savor from the prosciutto. You're left with a bland white cheese ball in a tasteless brown wrapper. Burning wood can be a force for good or evil. It adds a sublime crunch to the excellent crust of Peasant's little pizzas. (The most appealing of the three versions, topped with pepe roncini and soppressata, is fiery enough to require a stern warning from the waiter.) Bushy sprigs of rosemary release a thick, heady perfume that mingles with wood smoke and permeates the firm flesh of orata, or sea bream, so that each bite seems to release a small cloud of fragrant steam. Skate does not fare as well. Its delicate scalloplike flavor dissipates, and a too-robust caper sauce buries the fish entirely. Cuttlefish, cooked in small terra-cotta vessels, might as well be pressed tofu. Meat is another story. Leg of lamb, slow-cooked on the rotisserie, is sliced off in neat rounds, served on top of creamy polenta and garnished, if that's the word, with an enormous head of bitter radicchio di Treviso grilled to a state of juicy limpness. If this be peasant fare, don't tell the royals. The flavors here are potent and lingering. The pasta at Peasant, like the mozzarella, is good, not great. Properly firm risotto, dotted with peas, shrimp bits and cherry tomatoes, pleases well enough, but the impression is marred by the mealy Sicilian shrimp, split in half and grilled, that surrounds it like a dragon guarding a treasure hoard. Gnocchi with morels is more like it: earthy, rich and -- there's no other way to put it -- peasantlike. The untranslated menu encourages much back-and-forth with the waiters, who, like ''A'' students, seem happiest explaining what you get when you order, say, insalata acciuga e fagiolini. The all-Italian wine list, although not terribly long, seems to pose more of a puzzle. I had questions about this Sardinian and that Sicilian. They remained unanswered. If you take the trouble to put together a list of regional wines, several of them off the beaten track, it helps if the waiters can say something a little more enlightening than, ''That's my favorite.'' The desserts include a few surprises, some of them unpleasant. An enormous bowl of fresh fruit and sorbets, enough for an entire table, turns out to be a cruel joke. The fruit looks spectacular, but someone made off with the flavor. The low point one evening was a mushy apricot that could be identified only by color. The ricotta cheesecake is respectable, although not as good as the pistachio gelato by its side. Vanilla-soaked bread pudding, an imposing cube of unctuousity accompanied by a caramel-swathed scoop of white chocolate gelato, relegates the cheesecake to also-ran status. Best of all is a heroically proportioned peach pie with a rough lattice crust, its opulent fruit flavor coaxed out by the magic heat of burning wood. The espresso at Peasant cannot pass without comment. Both weak and bitter at the same time, it may be the worst I've ever tasted. In a city awash in bad espresso, this is no mean feat. Try making it over a wood fire. It couldn't hurt. Peasant * [Rating: one star] 194 Elizabeth Street (between Prince and Spring Streets); (212) 965-9511.

470,Triomphe,2 star,"Nov. 22, 2000",William Grimes,Midtown,"French, New American",https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/22/dining/restaurants-favoring-a-small-and-understated-setting.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/22/dining/restaurants-favoring-a-small-and-understated-setting.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"SIGN of the Dove no longer exists, but it continues to exert a quiet influence on the dining scene. The chefs who spent their formative years there have fanned out across the city to restaurants like Little Dove, Five Points and Cibo, bringing a restrained stylishness along with them. The latest in this crop is Steven Zobel, who spent four years at Sign of the Dove before taking over the stove at one of its sister restaurants, Contrapunto. Now he has his own showcase, Triomphe, in the remodeled Iroquois Hotel in Midtown. It's a tiny stage. The front room is dominated by a curved bar that can accommodate perhaps a half-dozen customers. A wall-size mirror on one side of the main dining room tries to trick the eye into doubling the size of the space. It works. For an instant, you think the room is merely small. In fact, it is minute, barely large enough to accommodate the chocolate and pale-lemon banquette and 11 tables, each adorned with a spare, elegant calla lily or miniature amaryllis. The setting is subdued and adult, with pristine white walls, dark walnut floors and a dome ceiling with precise, crenelated moldings. It is an awkward room, windowless and narrow, but clever decorating has smoothed out the worst of the problems. Mr. Zobel's food, simple and understated, matches the room. He has devised a small menu that abounds in small pleasures supported by big flavors, like the chewy brioche croutons that shore up his rich, vermouth-scented stew of Malpeque oysters, packed with potatoes and leeks, or the brisk, lightly applied lemon emulsion that makes his cured salmon snap to attention. A straightforward rabbit stew, in a viscous Burgundy sauce with pearl onions and cremini mushrooms, turns up an unexpected ingredient: soft buttered crepes that do the work of pasta but in a lighter vein. Mr. Zobel has the talent, even the wit, to put chicken livers in the appetizer slot normally reserved for seared foie gras. Like professional party crashers, the upstart livers pull it off with a certain panache, accessorized with fried leeks and onions, and perfumed with the heady aroma of sherry braising liquid. Again and again, Mr. Zobel quietly strikes the right note. A subtle herb broth nicely underlines the natural sweetness of acorn-squash wontons covered in shavings of Parmesan cheese. Long, wide strips of pancetta, wiggly at the edges, make a natural foil for white beans and Swiss chard, but their salty astringent quality also plays well against the richness of New Zealand lamb chops. Atlantic halibut, although dry on one occasion, comes with some ingenious packaging. Resisting the temptation to overload this meaty fish with a big-gauge sauce, Mr. Zobel pulls back, applying a delicate ginger-chili marinade, then posing the snow-white meat on jasmine rice and surrounding it with grilled leeks. Green curry and lemon grass give a deft Asian spin to tuna, surrounded by potatoes, tofu and haricots verts. When the main ingredient calls for more, Mr. Zobel opens up the flavors. A hefty rib-eye steak comes with fat grilled cepes and a muscular brandy demi-glace, and a thick slab of salmon gets the works: a caviar-dotted beurre blanc, a scattering of grilled shrimp and parsnip whipped potatoes. The very short dessert list stumbles once. The tarte Tatin is achingly sweet, its thin apple slices just a minute away from becoming candied fruit. A much better bet is the poached Bosc pear, primarily because of what comes with it, a deceptively labeled chestnut poundcake that turns out to be a tiny bun split in half, filled with chestnut jam and espresso anglaise and topped with whipped cream. Diners should get the option of skipping the pear and super-sizing the poundcake. It's fortunate that Mr. Zobel consistently hits the mark, because the surroundings impose a certain austerity on the dining experience. The room feels pinched, and the acoustics are surprisingly poor. As Triomphe fills up -- and it takes only a handful of diners to do the job -- the volume rises, and suddenly the place sounds like Les Halles, despite the raised-pinky decor. The wine list does not do justice to the food. It abounds in choices under $40, but at 50 bottles, it makes for quick and not terribly exciting reading. For a bistro, the list is fine. But the food at Triomphe is pitched a little higher than that. It's smart, stylish and a little shy. In a city with flash to spare, Triomphe has a rare commodity: charm.

471,Rosa Mexicano,0.75 star,"Sept. 20, 2000",William Grimes,Flatiron,Mexican,https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/20/dining/restaurants-the-empire-that-guacamole-built.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/20/dining/restaurants-the-empire-that-guacamole-built.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"EVERY Mexican restaurant above the taco-stand level must answer a fundamental question at the outset. Will it take the pledge and swear to serve fine food, with a respect for regional differences and prime ingredients, or will it saunter down the cash-strewn path to Margaritaville? Rosa Mexicano, the Lincoln Center offshoot of Rosa Mexicano on First Avenue, tries to be virtuous. ''As Rosa Mexicano presents classic Mexican cuisine,'' the menu warns, ''some of the popularized Americanized dishes often associated with Mexican food are not included on our menu.'' No burritos here, in other words. No combination platters. Dishes are listed in Spanish first, English second. It all sounds admirably high-minded, but then you hear the slurping sound of a thousand slushy cocktails going down the hatch, the din of euphoric young voices lubricated with premium tequila, and there you are: cruising in an aqua convertible with Jimmy Buffett. But there are worse ways to pass the time. Overall, the cooking at Rosa Mexicano is pallid and dull. It lacks the snap and the vibrancy that make Mexican cuisine approachable and popular. The kitchen seems incapable of getting food to the table hot. The use of spices is timid, and it's hard not to feel that the menu has been smoothed out to avoid giving offense. It's Latin without passion or flair, but with enough bright spots along the way to offer hope. The best comes first. When a guacamole cart comes rolling by, hail it. Specify the degree of hotness you want. Then watch as the cart superintendent constructs a superlative avocado experience, layer by layer, mashing ingredients in the traditional lava-stone molcajete, and achieving the perfect creamy-lumpy balance. It would be tempting, but a mistake, to order ceviche next. There are two varieties, red snapper in a citrus, tomato and jalapeno marinade, and a sweeter mixed seafood ceviche of scallops, baby shrimp and squid marinated in lemon juice, mango, honeydew and red peppers. There is very little margin for error in ceviche. Seafood can wind up either too tough or mushy, and at Rosa Mexicano it usually does. Among other appetizers, flabby ravioli filled with chicken, tomato and onion float serenely in a peculiar sauce made with poblano chilies and Champagne, dotted here and there with islands of melted manchego cheese. For whatever reason, the kitchen seems most successful with deep, earthy flavors. A small appetizer casserole of sauteed mushrooms, tomatoes and onions is flavored with garlic, serrano chilies and the pungent herb epazote. The entire savory mess lies on a moist bed of cornmeal, a neutral layer with just the right counterbalancing sweetness. Huitlacoche (here spelled cuitlacoche), Mexico's renowned corn fungus, shows its dark, smoky splendor after being sauteed with onions, garlic,  chilies and epazote and simply placed on a crisp tortilla chip. The one fish success story among the appetizers is the tacos de pescado, small tortillas filled with crisp pieces of pan-fried lenguado, or rex sole, topped with a tangy lemon-jalapeno dressing. The menu makes a fuss over its main courses from the grill. They are unexceptional. Hefty skewered shrimp, marinated in garlic vinaigrette and served over rice with onions, tomatoes and serrano chilies, are slightly dry but otherwise inoffensive. Tuna makes a better showing. It comes in thick steaklike chunks marinated in achiote and bitter orange and then topped with pickled onions. The nongrilled entrees make, at most, a mildly pleasing impression, except for an appalling lamb shank coated in pasilla, ancho and guajillo chilies and then steamed in a parchment bag. It looks like an oversize, stew-filled beggar's purse. Steaming, strangely enough, does not take the toughness out of the lamb. Red snapper Veracruz style, baked in a tomato sauce flavored with capers, poblanos and green olives, has almost enough personality to linger in the memory, and huitlacoche comes to the rescue once again, this time in the stuffing of a chicken roulade covered in poblano chili sauce. The budin azteca, a layered tortilla pie filled with shredded chicken and cacciota cheese, has a sort of fascinating blandness, like Charles Grodin, that makes it stand out from the featureless landscape of chicken with mole sauce, enchiladas with mole sauce, and shrimp crepes topped with mild chili sauce and melted cheese. Desserts are very sweet and very forgettable, except for the delicia de chocolate, a tall column of velvety mousse resting on a crunchy chocolate and peanut butter disk. The coffee flan, on my first visit, was also an exception: it was the worst I have ever eaten in my life. I ordered it a second time, and it had made a giant leap to mediocrity. David Rockwell's design for the restaurant has a splashy exuberance that's missing from the food. The colors tingle and vibrate, and he outdoes himself in the restaurant's most memorable feature, a glittering blue tile wall with a thin sheet of water running over its two-story surface. Up and down the wall, hundreds of little white plaster divers are deployed in precise ranks, ready to spring outward. Maybe they're trying to jump ship. Rosa Mexicano Satisfactory 61 Columbus Avenue (62nd Street); (212) 977-7700 ATMOSPHERE: Crowd-pleasing Mexican food in a bright, informal atmosphere.

472,Brasserie 8 1/2,1 star,"Sept. 13, 2000",William Grimes,Midtown,French,https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/13/dining/restaurants-journey-to-the-planet-brasserie.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/13/dining/restaurants-journey-to-the-planet-brasserie.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"MY vote for the hardest-working banana split in town goes to Brasserie 8 1/2. It's a strenuously conceptual dessert, a plateful of allusions, feints and inside jokes, the main one being the almost total absence of banana. From right to left, one encounters a small dome of caramelized banana on a quarter-size sable pastry disk, a medium-size puck of strawberry ice cream topped with strawberry slices and a large stack that begins with caramelized pineapple and ascends, in many chapters, through vanilla ice cream, almond sable, chocolate ice cream and chocolate syrup, with fascinating asides. If a split could sweat, this would be a three-towel production. Signs of overachievement are everywhere on the menu, and it is easy to understand why. The food has to go a long, long way to take anyone's mind off the design. Visually, Brasserie 8 1/2 is a knockout, a double surprise after the design assault unleashed this year at the Brasserie, the other below-ground restaurant operated by Restaurant Associates. If New York thought the last word in descending-staircase glamour had been uttered, it thought wrong. The downward swoosh at Brasserie 8 1/2 is a circular staircase in thick salmon carpeting. Taking a half turn, it winds down through an enormous hole in the floor to a low-slung illuminated onyx bar and an open-plan lounge, where deeply cushioned black leather chairs cluster. The anteroom feels like the departure lounge for the space shuttle. The dining room could be a galactic mess hall, with a white terrazzo tile floor, black leather booths and walls covered in a gray-green silk that looks like brushed steel. At the far end of the room, a stained-glass mural by Leger makes almost no impression. There's too much competition. Julian Alonzo, formerly the executive chef at Cafe Centro, obviously took one look at the playing field and decided that it would take audacity to win the day. The name of the restaurant -- which sounds Felliniesque but actually refers to the building that surrounds it, 9 West 57th Street -- demanded a brasserie menu, but Mr. Alonzo has taken liberties, some inspired, others puzzling and still others downright annoying. A frequently served amuse-bouche manages to be all three at once. Packaged in a V-shaped aperitif glass, it is a hearty, heady oxtail jus thick enough to hold tiny cheese ravioli in suspension. A thick layer of garlicky potato foam sits on top like the head on a pint of Guinness. It is a ravishing dish, in its way, but far too substantial in flavor, texture and portion to qualify as a palate-tickler. Finish it, and you're ready for a scoop of sorbet and the check. The traditional brasserie menu can be seen in a mostly standard raw bar selection (oysters, shrimp, clams), an iced seafood platter and a weekly rotation of specials like bouillabaisse on Fridays and confit of suckling pig on Thursdays. Wednesday deserves a check on the calendar. The plat du jour is a thick slab of Muscovy duck breast, coyly listed as a ''steak,'' with a crisp, golden skin outside, pink, oozing meat inside and a sweet, sticky fig compote on the side. A perfectly fine steak au poivre, mussels mariniere and a wonderfully gamy hanger steak round out the week. Familiar dishes incorporate inventive touches, like poached quail eggs,  which come with a frisee-lardons salad. A side dish of haricots verts, bright green and crunchy, comes with a luxurious coating of macadamia butter, simple but brilliant. A bristling sea urchin shell, balanced on a bed of salt and filled with a hefty chowder of urchin, clams, potatoes, peas and bacon bits, catches the eye and rewards the palate with its interplay of brine and earth. The flourishes can be beside the point, like dried shards of prosciutto, which come with duck steak, or an oxtail marmalade that partners the hanger steak, like a mini-portion of sweet barbecue that wandered over from another recipe. Tempura-fried squash blossoms do not need goat-cheese stuffing. The tempura batter is a mere wisp, the squash blossoms are fresh and flavorful -- what more could anyone ask for? A little less would add up to a little more. As part of the all-out effort, Brasserie 8 1/2 prepares the way for dessert with pre-dessert and punctuates the experience with a post-dessert. Pre-dessert, even at a high-tone French restaurant, often strikes me as overkill. At a brasserie, it seems utterly out of character, but I have to say, the little slice of apple strudel that came my way one evening made me abandon my principles. Topped with shavings of a smoky, nutty, slightly butterscotch aged Gouda, it made a nice little interlude before the tangled mysteries of the banana split. Or the superior sorbets, luscious fig tart, ''reverse'' chocolate souffle (a kind of molten chocolate cake) or the arresting milk-chocolate creme brulee, iced with a rose marmalade and surrounded by candied rose petals like Mena Suvari in ''American Beauty.'' There is a design flaw. The booths in the center of the room are so deep that most waitresses cannot reach the diners on the inside. This fact has produced interesting socioeconomic results. It has placed a premium on male waiters with long arms, who are constantly called on to help. It makes ''pardon my reach'' the mantra for the evening. And it encourages diners to help clear the table rather than watch their waitress suffer. This in turn promotes a feeling of camaraderie and in the end, I suspect, bigger tips. The communal table has probably peaked. The double-wide booth looks like the coming thing. Brasserie 8 1/2 * [Rating: one star] 9 West 57th Street; (212) 829-0812.

473,Roc Restaurant,1 star,"Aug. 30, 2000",William Grimes,TriBeCa,"Italian, Seafood",https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/30/dining/restaurants-gazetteer-of-italian-fare-with-eccentricity.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/30/dining/restaurants-gazetteer-of-italian-fare-with-eccentricity.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IN the race to unearth the world's least reclaimable dish, Roc may have scored an upset victory. Meatloaf has gained classic status. Macaroni and cheese can be found in fine Parisian restaurants. Mashed potatoes have been through so many conceptual contortions that they qualify as haute cuisine. It's getting harder to shock. But Roc has succeeded. ''Every Thursday we have spaghetti and meatballs,'' a waiter told me with a sly smile one evening. ''It's a Roc tradition.'' You had to admire the cheek. For many Americans, this is a dish that comes in a can. And how, exactly, does a brand-new restaurant have a tradition? Still, if any restaurant could put the meatballs over, Roc is probably the place. It's a traditional Italian restaurant with a modern sense of style and some lunatic impulses that keep it interesting. It is also maddeningly inconsistent. At its best it delivers very fine food, with that Italian respect for ingredients and strong, clearly expressed flavors that can make simplicity seem like the only virtue worth having in the kitchen. There's an imagination at work, too. The desserts, in particular, roam adventurously beyond tiramisu and cheesecake territory (although both show up on the menu). But then you run into clunkers like the desiccated veal Milanese, a grim piece of meat pounded out to the size of a Ping-Pong paddle, or the appetizer of thin-sliced salmon, swordfish and white anchovies, so harshly marinated that the swordfish takes on the texture of shirt cardboard. Perseverance pays off, however. An appetizer special one night, eggplant Parmesan with breaded buffalo ricotta, sounded foolish and looked it, too: a sloppy slab of eggplant in thick sauce attended by two fat cheese balls. But the eggplant was firm to the bite, the tomato sauce was concentrated and intense, and those cheese balls, with a fine golden crust, were as light as whipped cream. Fried calamari showed the same light touch, coated in the thinnest possible fried batter, entirely oil-free, and surrounded by long tendrils of batter-fried zucchini that melted in the mouth. A pile of frisee lettuce topped with perfectly cooked shrimp and thin-sliced asparagus sounded plain but stood out as one of the most satisfying appetizers on the menu. Main courses waver. There are more than a few old-fashioned dishes done with no particular distinction, like veal scaloppine with mozzarella and prosciutto, or chicken with roasted pepper, herbs and sausage. The grilled rib-eye steak is large, and that's about all you can say about it. But the hefty lamb chop, encased in a crunchy potato crust fragrant with rosemary, stands out from the pack. Braised veal shank in a syrupy veal demi-glace, so tender it slid right off the bone, needed no more than a few slivers of olive to make a memorable main course. I never did penetrate the mysteries of one fish special, fillet of John Dory in a strange, Asian-influenced environment that included snow peas, green beans and squares of steamed pumpkin. The pasta is reliable, whether it's the rich, creamy oxtail ravioli with  butter and sage, the minimal taglierini with chunks of lobster, or a very robust special offered one night, linguine with nuggets of pancetta, sliced fava beans and scallions. It's worth listening to the specials, even though they tend to be numerous and contain twice as many ingredients as any of the other dishes, or so it seems when the waiters reel them off at top speed. In this time of labor shortages, Roc has managed to find that special breed of waiter who can take the order for a table of eight without putting pencil to pad or making eye contact with the diners. The performance becomes truly impressive on a busy night, as diners from the neighborhood drift in and pack the restaurant. The tables are placed close together. The tall ceilings turn clamor into din, and as parties come and go, you can see waiters rolling round table tops back and forth the length of the dining room, barely squeezing by the crowd at the bar. It looks like a sporting event with medieval roots, like the Palio. The waiter who takes your order may or may not reappear in a significant role. It doesn't matter. The food gets there, the wine makes its way to the table, and somehow order emerges out of chaos. The noise level and surging crowds make it tempting to cut and run before dessert. That would be a mistake. The list includes two winning chocolate desserts, a chocolate terrine, just slightly gooey, with espresso sauce and toasted almonds, and a chocolate almond cake, not too sweet, with a texture poised between fluffy and firm. A timely shipment of figs yielded a light cake split in half, filled with fig-mascarpone cream, and surrounded by a sticky pool of fig sauce and ripe plums. (The dessert has been reorganized around red currants, black currants and strawberries.) Roc is as breezy and offhand as its name, an allusion to Rocco Cadolini, who opened the restaurant with Elio Guaitolini of Elio's and other uptown neighborhood spots. Roc wanders heedlessly from one region of Italy to the other, and occasionally walks right off the map. The decor is idiosyncratic, with clean, elegant white walls and gauzy white curtains making a minimalist statement, only to be overruled by the peculiar ceramic knickknacks arranged on shelves around the dining room. It's a funny sort of place, but funny in the right way, with an eccentric side that's hard to resist. Roc * [Rating: One Star] 190A Duane Street (at Greenwich Street); (212) 625-3333. ATMOSPHERE: Pan-Italian with antic touches in a stylish high-ceilinged room that attracts a lively neighborhood crowd. SOUND LEVEL: Very loud. RECOMMENDED DISHES: Shrimp and asparagus salad, fried calamari with crispy zucchini, beef carpaccio with arugula, oxtail ravioli with butter and sage, lamb chop in potato rosemary crust, chocolate almond cake with pear gratin, chocolate terrine with espresso sauce. SERVICE: Surprisingly efficient and responsive, given the rather chaotic atmosphere. WINE LIST: A fairly ordinary list of about 100 mostly Italian and  American wines, with a dozen half bottles. PRICE RANGE: Dinner, appetizers, $7 to $13; entrees, $15 to $30; desserts, $6 to $9. HOURS: Lunch, Monday through Friday, noon to 4 p.m. Dinner, Sunday through Thursday, 4 p.m. to midnight; Friday and Saturday, 4 p.m. to 1 a.m. CREDIT CARDS: All major cards.

474,Avra,1 star,"April 19, 2000",William Grimes,Midtown East,Greek,https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/19/dining/restaurants-greet-your-fish-and-eat-it-too.html,https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/19/dining/restaurants-greet-your-fish-and-eat-it-too.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"AT Avra, the fish tour starts just after the aperitifs. It makes for a highly entertaining and educational five minutes, and throughout the evening, you can see Avra's enthusiastic waiters bringing one group after another up to the seafood counter for a brief, meaningful encounter with handsome daurades, soot-colored red porgies, sullen-looking Dover sole and a school of chipper little rougets. The tour combines the best of the Discovery Channel with the pleasure of picking out a pet at Bide-a-Wee. There's no question about it: meeting your fish and picking it out somehow doubles the fun in dinner. They don't worry the fish too much at Avra. Back in the open kitchen, a ball of fire blasts each side of a sea bass or red snapper imprisoned in a grilling basket, and that's about it. The fish gets a squirt of lemon, a drizzling of olive oil and a sprinkling of herbs, then heads to the table. Fresh fish, barely touched, is the selling point here. It's an appealing formula, to which Avra brings its own brand of charm. The restaurant, divided into two large dining rooms on either side of the seafood counter and kitchen, has a spacious, easy feeling to it, and just enough decorative pieces -- Oriental  rugs on the wall, oversize rustic urns on the floor -- to suggest a country taverna without belaboring the point. The waiters, upbeat and friendly, pull off the very neat trick of making each table feel as though inside Avra's protective walls, all worldly cares have ended, all problems can be solved. It is a soothing place. Greek cuisine is a modest thing, a fairly limited catalog of simple pleasures, and Avra gives it honest, honorable representation. It is not a cuisine that rises to great heights, and Avra, wisely, does not try to push it farther than it's meant to go. After suffering through dozens of soggy, tasteless spinach pies all over my beloved neighborhood, Astoria, Queens, I thrilled to the taste of Avra's spanakopita, a flawless layering of good feta cheese, firm spinach and leeks, with crackling-fresh leaves of phyllo dough. The grilled octopus, served simply with onions and red wine vinegar, was thick, firm and meaty. Kolokithi, a big pile of thin, batter-fried zucchini and eggplant slices, came out of the fryer without a drop of oil, ready for dipping in a gutsy, garlicky tzatziki sauce. One surprise on the appetizer list is omos dolmas, pieces of raw tuna, salmon and cucumber enrobed in rice and wrapped in a grape leaf. Sliced on the diagonal, they look like oversize sushi, making them perhaps the world's first triumph of Greek-Japanese fusion. The pieces are dipped in a mayonnaise made from yogurt, garlic and dill. I regarded this experiment with deep skepticism, but it worked. The seafood counter, an eye-pleasing panorama, offers about a dozen fish listed on the menu and perhaps an extra two picked up at the market unexpectedly. The standard species include Dover sole, red snapper, pompano and John Dory, but Avra makes an effort to sell more unusual Mediterranean species, like white bream, blue-spotted bream and pandora. All fish at the counter are priced by the pound. Generally speaking, the smaller fish weigh about a pound and make a good entree-size portion. Larger fish need to be shared by two or three people. The seafood is not limited to the fresh-fish display. Kakavia, the Greek version of bouillabaisse, comes in a large earthenware pot filled to the brim with scorpionfish, clams, mussels and vegetables, in a saffron-scented fish stock. The menu also includes youvetsi, a shellfish stew of clams, mussels and shrimp in a tomato-shellfish broth that's baked with orzo and feta. The broth has a good, acidic bite to it, but the orzo is squishy. There is meat. Not a lot, but it's there. Lamb loin chops, served with lemon potatoes and okra, are tender and flavorful. Chicken is simply grilled and served with fasolakia, or string beans, in a zesty stewed tomato sauce. No one orders dessert in a Greek restaurant expecting anything less than a serious wrestling match with the sugar molecule, which the coffee, thick and sweet, only intensifies. Karidopita, an enormous hunk of spongy walnut cake, seems like the last word in sweetness until you tangle with the baklava. Baklava tends to come in two styles. One is rather dry and light, emphasizing cinnamon and nuts. Avra serves the other -- a heavy phyllo sponge soaked with syrup and served with a side of chocolate ice cream. It makes the yogurt with honey and nuts seem austere. A better bet is galaktoboureko, a thick slab of yellow semolina custard between layers of phyllo dough. ''I'm not a big fan of Greek food,'' an Italian dining partner told me one night at Avra, ''but I'd come back here in a minute.'' Heads around the table nodded assent, for very Italian reasons. They were not eating the most imaginative cuisine in New York, but they were eating well enough, and luxuriating in the happy sensation of total well-being. The fish tour had been a treat, the waiter was by now the table's best friend and if you overlooked that chocolate ice cream with the baklava, all was right with the world. You don't get that every night of the week. Avra * [Rating: one star] 141 East 48th Street; (212) 759-8550. ATMOSPHERE: Simple Greek food, with the focus on fish, in lively, friendly surroundings. SOUND LEVEL: Never too loud to carry on a conversation. RECOMMENDED DISHES: Grilled fish from the seafood counter, spinach pie, grilled octopus, stuffed grape leaves, zucchini and eggplant chips, Greek bouillabaisse, walnut cake, semolina custard.

It snares you as you enter, and throws your image up on the first in a long string of television sets over the bar. As each new diner enters, you get moved on down the line. The video display is just one tip-off that the new Brasserie in the Seagram Building is very different from the original, which opened in 1959 and closed in 1995 after a fire. There's also the bar. The old place did not have one, and if it did, the bar stools would not have looked like space-age saddles. The entry into the sunken dining area is now an event, a Norma Desmond descent on an illuminated glass staircase, and the interior, by Diller & Scofidio, is a two-lapel grabber. Some elements suggest a stripped-down airplane fuselage, others a futuristic diner. The hours have changed too. Nightowls loved the old place because it was open at all hours. The new Brasserie opens at 6:30 A.M. and closes at 1 A.M. The menu does not shock. Luc Dimnet, formerly of Les Celebrites, has kept some of the old standbys, like onion soup, steamed mussels, crepes and omelets. He sticks to the simplicity of the brasserie format with dishes like frisee salad with lardons, Provencal fish soup, and ideally crispy goujonettes of sole, France's contribution to the fish-stick concept. The main courses have a little offbeat touch here and there, like the dried figs and fennel ragout that comes with the roasted monkfish, or the horseradish beurre blanc and salsify meuniere that liven up the salmon, but for the most part Mr. Dimnet plays it straight, with four-square bistro dishes like cassoulet, bouillabaisse, steak frites, rabbit stew and roast chicken with truffled mashed potatoes. The desserts follow the same script, with a mango and banana tarte Tatin sharing the page with chocolate beignets, lemon profiteroles and nougat glace. There's a secret payoff to those overhead video monitors. If you get a parking space out front, you can watch your car while eating. The Brasserie, 100 East 53rd Street, Manhattan; (212) 751-4840.

476,Scalini Fedeli,1 star,"Oct. 13, 1999",William Grimes,TriBeCa,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/13/dining/restaurants-in-tribeca-simplicity-and-soft-edges.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/13/dining/restaurants-in-tribeca-simplicity-and-soft-edges.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"A  GENERATION ago, America was infatuated with the idea of gracious living. It was the Eisenhower-era  consumer-culture equivalent of shibui, a Japanese concept that suggests refinement, visual harmony and an all-over feeling of well-being. It has been superseded, in New York at least, by ''edge.'' Scalini Fedeli has no edge. What it has, instead, is old-fashioned grace. Open the door, and fresh fruit aromas pour out in a fragrant wave. It's a startling welcome, and the source is not hard to find. In the little entryway, strawberries, peaches and pears have been piled high in wooden baskets and copper pans, surrounded by lavish floral displays straight out of House Beautiful. Philippe Collon, the maitre d'hotel, has the looks, the accent and the courtly manner that all maitres d'hotel aspire to, but few achieve. The dining room, with its well-spaced tables and conservative country-Italian decor, is as soothing as massage. Against the front window, tastefully draped with diaphanous white curtains, the ventilating system sends gentle breezes over a small forest of green plants, which sway endlessly throughout the meal. Waiters speak in soft tones. Ordering a zesty aperitif becomes a survival strategy. Without stimulation, you could sink into a doze before the menus arrive. There's plenty of tension behind the scenes, however. Scalini Fedeli means steps of faith, and in this case, it's a leap. The original Scalini Fedeli is one of New Jersey's most highly regarded and popular dining spots, a perennial winner in reader surveys. Michael Cetrulo, its chef and owner, has decided to test that reputation on a more ambitious circuit. It's a doubly audacious move, because, of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, he had to walk into the former Bouley, a four-star dazzler. In this new theater, Mr. Cetrulo puts on a competent but hardly inspired performance. The food is pleasing, for the most part, but it rarely takes flight, and when it does, the dish is likely to be disarmingly simple. A pumpkin risotto, flavored with sage and pancetta and sprinkled with toasted pumpkin seeds and crispy shallots, did not pass what I think of as the firm-handshake test. It was thin and soupy, and the rice, instead of offering resistance to the bite, surrendered unconditionally. Broad lasagnette noodles, colored with squid ink, made a strong visual impression, but they were limp, and the sauce of champagne and porcini mushrooms was overly polite. Mr. Cetrulo does a lovely job, however, with a warm carpaccio of red snapper coated in a lemon-chive oil and scattered with fresh slivers of celery, and it's no wonder why, one evening, he sent out little samples of his pappardelle with a sauce of Scottish hare and venison. It's a cold-weather marvel, a small feast of gloriously rich, dark meats finished off with cream and truffles. The main courses are satisfying, decorous and rather unassuming. A good-size fillet of roasted Patagonian toothfish (Chilean sea bass), for example, found an ideal matchup in a sauce of sun-dried tomatoes and Sicilian and Greek olives, just the right combination of fruit, acidic twang and earthiness for this sweet, fat fish. Saddle of rabbit, swaddled in pancetta and served with a black olive sauce, made a simple, pleasing entree, and the thick, brick-red venison chop, coated with a jet-black pepper crust and served with a potent red-wine reduction, was just the ticket for some of the more serious Barolos, brunellos and amarones on the wine list. The dabs of Gorgonzola that come with it, however, are so pungent that they overpower everything else on the plate. Is it possible for a dessert to flunk the firm-handshake test? Yes. The panna cotta, which comes with a roasted pear and a drizzling of honey, looks solid enough but betrays a deplorable weakness of character at first bite. It takes a back seat to the dense chocolate tart, accented with shavings of sweet-bitter caramelized orange peel, and to the clever miniature cannoli, tubes of crackling phyllo dough that have been painted with chocolate and filled with espresso-flavored mascarpone cream. Food isn't everything. That may sound dismissive, but it isn't. There are dozens of intangibles that go into a meal and contribute to a diner's sense of satisfaction. Scalini Fedeli rates very high on most of these. One evening, when the chef was sending out pre-appetizers of seared scallop, he thoughtfully substituted shrimp for a diner who had ordered a scallop appetizer. Touches like that, added up, create a rosy glow that can color an entire evening. Mr. Cetrulo needs to work on the menu. Everything else feels just about right.

Prial,East Village,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/21/dining/restaurants-rustic-touch-of-tuscany-in-the-east-village.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/21/dining/restaurants-rustic-touch-of-tuscany-in-the-east-village.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE young couple stood uncertainly in the doorway at I Coppi, an eight-month-old Tuscan restaurant on East Ninth Street near Avenue A. He held a toddler by the hand, she was pushing an infant in a stroller. They had no reservation and the place was full. To the couple, the crowd probably looked like just a lively bunch from the neighborhood. Wrong. Word was out about I Coppi. This was a discerning, well-heeled crowd from all over the city that had come to check out this newcomer. The young couple left, having learned that in New York, casual-looking little restaurants are not always what they seem. I Coppi is already something of a hit, and after three visits, I'd have to say deservedly so. The decor is Italian rustic, with exposed brick walls, low ceilings and lots of wood and terra cotta, including several coppi, the big jars in which olive oil was once stored. That is, coppi is the word used by the folks in Pistoia, Italy, where Lorella Innocenti, an owner of the restaurant, was born. The other owner is her husband, John Brennan, who designed and built most of the restaurant himself. This is Ms. Innocenti's first restaurant, but she has worked in New York for almost 15 years, at such places as Barolo, I Tre Merli, Le Madri and Osteria al Doge. ''But my real mentor is Joe Allen,'' she said. ''Anything that works around here, I learned from him.'' She must have been a good student, having worked her way up to manager of Orso, one of the restaurants Mr. Allen owns on West 46th Street. I Coppi's first chef was Ms. Innocenti's mother, Alberta, who created many of the specials before deciding to live in Italy. Running the kitchen now is Sara Jenkins, who grew up in Tuscany and formerly worked in a restaurant in Florence. Among the best appetizers are a Swiss chard and ricotta flan served with mixed greens, and two cheeses -- sweet Gorgonzola and robiola -- with sliced pears. Ricotta turns up again in an intriguing homemade ravioli with herbs in a butter-sage sauce. And one of Alberta Innocenti's enticing creations is eggplant with besciamella, a lighter version of bechamel, which is served with tomato sauce and is sprinkled with that sublimely full-flavored cheese grana Padano. Another is her soft polenta served between two layers of sauteed wild mushrooms and flavored with ground pork. The best main courses are a revelation. They are robust but subtly different from almost anything on other Italian menus around town. Among them is grilled wild striped bass, with just the right crispness imparted by a wood-burning oven. A grilled pork chop served with mustard greens, and a grilled sirloin steak served rare with arugula and shavings of grana Padano, should keep the steakhouses on their mettle. I particularly liked the lemony veal stew served with sauteed Swiss chard and the rabbit, also stewed, with tomato, herbs and black olives and served with polenta. Polenta is ubiquitous at I Coppi, and that is a good thing. Diners tired of heavy, chewy polenta will find this to be delicate and altogether delightful. I Coppi is also a destination for thin-crust pizzas. There are the classic versions, with tomato, mozzarella and fresh basil; tomato, anchovies and capers, and tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto and arugula. And there are several versions of cofaccini, which is called white pizza and resembles a slightly soft matzoh. Sections of it are served in a basket, with olive oil and garlic, or artichokes or grana Padano cheese and rosemary. No surprises among the desserts, but they do include an intensely rich chocolate almond cake served with thick whipped cream, and a panna cotta that resembles a creme caramel with blood oranges. The nutty, crunchy biscotti come directly from Alberta Innocenti's kitchen in Italy. Mr. Brennan, who owns a woodworking business in midtown, is proud of the bar he built at I Coppi and of the restrooms and wine cellar he installed in the basement. The antique bathroom fittings are worth the trip down the handsome curved staircase, which he has illuminated with candles on every other step. Currently, he is turning the restaurant's minuscule backyard into an outdoor dining area, which should be ready in mid-May, about the same time I Coppi will start serving lunch. Mr. Brennan also has a passion for Tuscan wines, and has put together an interesting list. There are Chianti classicos ranging from $28 to $38, and what he calls ''young, simple, Tuscan table wines,'' which are $18 to $38.

479,Heartbeat,2 star,"Feb. 10, 1999",Ruth Reichl,Midtown East,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/10/dining/restaurants-trimming-the-fat-from-power-dining.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/10/dining/restaurants-trimming-the-fat-from-power-dining.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"ONE has ''a delicate lilac bouquet and pale yellow liquor.'' Another offers ''a hint of smoke among notes of honey and sherry.'' A third is ''brilliant with chocolate.'' Is it port? Perfume, perhaps? No, the flowery eloquence is a small selection from the tea menu at Heartbeat. Is there anything else you need to know about the restaurant? Heartbeat, in the newly renovated W Hotel (it was once the Doral Inn), is part spa, part power-lunch place, part hip new restaurant. The result is a very interesting experiment. Entering the restaurant you walk through a cheerful lounge, which looks something like an urban ski lodge. Early in the evening, when hopeful singles are sprawled in front of the fireplace sipping drinks, reading newspapers or just waiting for something interesting to happen, this is one of Manhattan's liveliest spots. So it is somewhat shocking to walk in and discover a retro dining room with tile-encrusted columns that look like they belong in a 1950's motel. But just as you are registering this you notice something else: The room may be strange, but it is also strangely cozy. With its comfortable seats, civilized sound level and solicitous service, Heartbeat soon wins you over. Then the bread arrives, and with it second thoughts. The rolls are truly horrid, heavy whole-grain lumps that are the edible equivalent of Earth Shoes. The accompanying dip is even worse, a sweet-potato puree with boiled garlic and thyme that is a very poor substitute for butter. Suspecting a trick, you wonder: What can this mean? Indeed, although the menu never gets around to mentioning it, Heartbeat has a gimmick. This is not quite spa food, but the kitchen does not believe in added fats. This approach works best when the food is simply left alone. Chilled oysters with caviar, for instance, need nothing but good ingredients to shine. A dish like sliced raw tuna is also dependent upon the quality of the ingredients, but it is greatly enhanced by the beauty of the presentation. The deep red slices of fish are set on pink and white slices of radish and served on clear plates that look like sheets of ice. Drizzled with a pale green wasabi-yuzu sauce, it looks absolutely lovely. So does mackerel ceviche with a lemon-chervil sauce. Whole roasted quail with a mushroom-and-fig hash is another savory way to start a meal. But the more contrived concoctions just don't work. Wild mushroom ravioli are gummy and dense, and one day they were gritty as well. A salad of roasted root vegetables turns out to be an odd combination of heavy roots like squash, sweet potatoes and carrots around a silly little fluff of salad sprouts. The arborio rice with squash and wild mushrooms is mush to me, and both the lobster with corn milk succotash and the lobster salad with truffles and purple potatoes seem extremely sweet. Fortunately, Heartbeat makes no attempt to be vegetarian. A surprising amount of meat is served, and it is surprisingly fine. The fillet of naturally fed beef tenderloin is particularly good, the meat so tender and flavorful that even the baked potato on the side seems special. Pork tenderloin is also excellent, and roasted baby chicken is tender, moist and served with a delicate pear, apple and goat cheese galette. The kitchen also serves a group of dishes that are called ''Simply Plain,'' which turn out to be exactly as advertised. There is something undeniably striking about a piece of beautifully cooked salmon when it is served, unembellished, on a huge black plate. Should you want to continue to be sensible you can choose bowls of berries for dessert, served with nothing but a little pot of honey-topped yogurt. Or you can shock your system by indulging in a chocolate dome filled with chocolate mousse. Embellished with a scoop of cherry sorbet, it is both rich and pretty. And after a spartan meal, it is also very welcome. The tea sommelier arrives right behind dessert. As he stands by your table with a tray of dried leaves, he lovingly describes the attributes of each. How can you resist him when he shows you jasmine pearl, pale green tips of tea that have been dried among fresh jasmine blossoms and that have traveled all the way from China? Especially when it says, right there on the menu, that the tea sommelier's purpose in life is to help you enhance your own well-being.

480,Mr. K's,1 star,"May 27, 1998",Ruth Reichl,Midtown East,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/27/dining/restaurants-fancy-chinese-food-from-another-era.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/27/dining/restaurants-fancy-chinese-food-from-another-era.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"''WHY doesn't he go away?'' my friend said crossly one day at lunch. She looked at the captain standing at attention near the table and added, ''I can't stand being watched while I eat.'' If being hovered over is not your thing, Mr. K's is not your restaurant. The fancy new Chinese restaurant is an import from Washington, where people apparently love having waiters dance attendance upon them. For 15 years, Mr. K's captains have cosseted their patrons with old-fashioned amenities like orchid corsages (for the women), specially printed menus (in my experience, offered only to men) and endless hot towels and finger bowls (for everyone). Whether this will prove popular in New York is not entirely certain. It is equally hard to predict whether Mr. K's not-quite-Chinese food, created by the owner, Johnny Kao, will find an appreciative audience here. There are undoubtedly people who love the idea of sitting in palatial pink splendor while waiters in white gloves serve them hot-and-sour soup. Some people will probably eat Peking duck garnished with red cabbage and plum tomatoes with great joy. There must surely be those who applaud the notion of individually plated Chinese food that is not intended to be shared. Others, I am certain, will be charmed when lemon sorbet in tiny silver goblets shows up between courses. But it's been 20 years since sorbet struck me as a mid-meal thrill. And much as I admire the comfort of those big padded chairs, the spaciousness of the banquettes and the graciousness of the service, it all feels slightly silly to me, as if the clock has been turned back. This would not necessarily be a bad thing, if the food did not share that quality. Unfortunately, Mr. K's is serving Chinese food from another American era, a time when people had not yet experienced the real thing. There are a few dishes I appreciate. The Shanghai-style spring rolls, for instance, are extremely crisp, absolutely greaseless and filled with a pale mixture of chicken and shrimp. If only the dumplings were as good. Alas, Lover's Dumplings, filled with pork, ginger and scallions and colorfully topped with ham on one side, smashed peas on the other, turn out to be rather tough. Crisp bits of veal in a soy and chili sauce have the texture of fried cardboard. And Peking duck, which is good at dinner, turns lackluster at lunch; once, the skin was barely crisp. During the daytime, the Peking duck is not even carved at the table, but simply assembled by a white-gloved group of attendants who spread crepes with hoisin sauce, add a few scallions and spoon in the pre-sliced meat and skin of the bird. It is strange to see a restaurant so dedicated to service pass up such a fine opportunity to show off. But it certainly does not miss a trick with the soups, which are good and served boiling hot in little footed tureens. Afterward, the sorbet appears, icy cold and not too sweet. And then the parade of entrees begins. On the menu, the dishes all sound wonderful, and I suppose if you confined yourself to your own individual plate, as Mr. K intended, you might not notice how similar the sauces are. Whether you are eating Firecracker Fish -- fillets in a sauce of onions, sun-dried tomatoes and just the faintest edge of chilies -- or veal Mimosa in an orange and Cointreau sauce, or eggplant in garlic sauce, the sauces are irritatingly sweet. The best dishes are Mongolian lamb, made with very good meat, and tender pork in black pepper sauce. The worst is macadamia chicken, where whole nuts go bobbing through the sauce like tiny white tennis balls ricocheting between tough pieces of chicken. Bland prawns wrapped around asparagus in a plain egg-white sake sauce have all the appeal of spa cuisine. No matter what you order, it will be served with an array of mostly non-Chinese (but organic) vegetables. Some days there are baby carrots, sweet potato puree, tomatoes and haricots verts. Other days there may be a slice or two of lotus root and a few wrinkly long beans. And always there is rice, served in adorable little silver contraptions with roll-back tops and a charmingly old-fashioned air. Desserts, which are not at all Chinese, are served with more showmanship. The captain appears bearing a plate covered with cakes and urges you to try the Louvre, a dome of chocolate with mousse inside, or some other pastry named for a French edifice. The cakes are all good, but to my mind the raspberry-passion fruit tart is the best of the lot. Now it is time for tea and coffee -- and another show. Tea is served in silver pots set atop candles to keep it warm. Coffee is brewed right at the table. Little chocolate mints appear as a finale. As we waited for our coats one afternoon, our captain stood chatting with one of my guests. ''If you come back for a business lunch,'' he told him, ''call ahead and we will print special menus with your name on them.'' The gentleman mused, ''This would be a great place for a business lunch.'' I guess it would be. If you don't mind having an audience.

481,Chola,2 star,"April 22, 1998",Ruth Reichl,Midtown East,Indian,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/22/dining/restaurants-an-indian-restaurant-breaks-the-mold.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/22/dining/restaurants-an-indian-restaurant-breaks-the-mold.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"INDIA is a country without a serious restaurant tradition. New York, on the other hand, has evolved its own tradition for Indian restaurants, one that divides them into two basic styles. Some are cheap and cheerful, serving a standard repertory of similar dishes cooked with a standard repertory of similar spices. The others are proud and pompous places where costumed waiters glide across acres of marble to serve food decorated with edible gold. A few stellar establishments, however, stand outside this tradition. The new Chola, I am happy to report, is among them. You know this almost instantly. When you walk in the door, you are assaulted by a blizzard of scents. Sniffing carefully, you can make out the friendly aroma of cardamom, the nervous tang of turmeric and the warmth of ginger. Sniff again and you get onions, garlic and the high note of cumin. Citrus is lurking in there, too, along with a faint, exotic edge of tamarind. Hovering above it all is the delicious perfume of roasting nuts. It smells wonderful. You walk a few steps into the dim room, expecting the usual marble palace. Instead, you find a modest restaurant, a little too dark, perhaps, and a little too crowded. Chola's aroma may be encouraging, but its looks are not. On top of that, it can be uncomfortably warm. Should you have any doubts about staying to eat, order immediately. I suggest starting with Mysore masala dosa, a thin, crisp, lacy crepe stuffed with a hot and fragrant potato mixture and served with two sauces: fresh coconut chutney and a dish of sambar, the spicy, soupy sauce of southern India. You might also consider one of the region's other great inventions, idli. These bland, spongy little steamed cakes, made from a fermented rice and lentil batter, come to life when dipped into sambar and chutney. Uthappam is another appealing starter, a scallion-laced vegetable pancake that is among the great pancakes of the world. Having started in southern India, you might want to continue with a fine dish from Kerala, konju pappas. Shrimp arrive in a chili-laden sauce that is more sweet and tart than hot. You taste tamarind, followed by a whole range of spices; at the very end, your tongue finds coconut. Surprisingly, the crisp, tender little shrimp stand up to this treatment. I like to eat konju pappas with lemon rice, a mixture flavored with mustard seeds and citrus. To my mind, sarson ka sag makes an ideal side dish. The menu says these ''pan fried mustard greens'' are cooked with fresh corn, but although I have ordered the dish three times, I have never been able to detect corn in the savory green puree. Rich with butter, ginger and aromatic spices, it is a delicious dish, clearly not intended for anyone on a diet. Sarson ka sag is a recipe from the northern Punjab region. One of the most appealing aspects of Chola is the sheer breadth of the menu, which allows you to take an edible tour of India. The tandoor, a clay oven that cooks food very quickly at searingly hot temperatures, is another hallmark of the Punjab. Chola offers a full complement of tandoori dishes: chicken, lamb, seekh kebab (lamb sausages) and various breads. The breads, like onion nan, are crisp, light and puffy, but in general the tandoori dishes do not display the kitchen at its best. The whole fish cooked in the tandoor, for instance, tends to be dry and bony, and the tandoori chicken is sometimes over-marinated, making the texture unpleasantly soft. There are, however, some very interesting recipes culled from the Jewish community in Calcutta. These tend to be both sweet and sour, like bamia koota, lamb and okra, which make an intriguing pair, or chicken makmura, cubes of white meat bathed in a rich sweet sauce of nuts and raisins. The vindaloo dishes are a perfect antidote to the sweetness. The menu promises that phall, a legacy of the English, is lamb cooked with fresh green chilies in an extremely hot sauce. They are not exaggerating, and if you like hot food you will be ecstatic. Desserts include the usual Indian restaurant offerings. My favorites are kulfi, a grainy frozen dessert flavored with nuts and saffron, and rasmalai, an addictive, sweet sort of homemade cheese. Best of all, however, is the extraordinary Indian coffee in the style of southern India: strong, milky and sweet. India is a vast nation with a diverse population that practices a number of religions and eats distinctly regional fare. The food is far more varied than that provided by New York's standard Indian restaurants. Chola, happily, joins the few that are trying to offer a glimpse into the complexity of this extremely appealing cuisine.

482,Sparks Steak House,1 star,"March 25, 1998",Ruth Reichl,Midtown East,Steak Houses,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/25/dining/restaurants-where-steak-is-both-king-and-jester.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/25/dining/restaurants-where-steak-is-both-king-and-jester.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"KURT VONNEGUT JR. does not seem happy. The author has been hanging around the entryway of Sparks with the actor Albert Finney and about 20 other hopeful diners. The maitre d'hotel does not seem in the least concerned that we are squashed into an uncomfortable crowd, and he is brusque with those of us who ask when our tables will be ready. After about 20 minutes, Mr. Vonnegut's party leaves, and as I watch the men walk through the door, I find myself wondering if there is another restaurant in America where people of such stature would be kept cooling their heels. In the end, we wait 40 minutes for our reservation, but it is some consolation to know that Sparks does not play favorites. The problem is that it does not play favorites with the steaks either. I have had terrific steaks at Sparks. I have had mediocre ones, too. Sometimes on the same evening. And although lobster is usually excellent, there have been nights when it was a disaster. Late last year, Sparks expanded into the space next door, once occupied by Arcimboldo, and the kitchen seems to be struggling. Hash browns are not always crisp, meat is often overcooked, and almost everything is oversalted. But there are two things of which you can be absolutely certain when you are finally seated: the service will be cheerful, and the wine list will make up for almost everything else. It is, however, possible to improve your odds of getting a great meal at Sparks. I hereby offer these guidelines. * Dine on Saturday night. At Sparks, unlike other restaurants, Saturdays seem slow. You are more likely to be seated immediately, and you are unlikely to be seated next to a group of 13 drunken stockbrokers celebrating their bonuses, as I was one Wednesday night. ''How much did they spend?'' I asked our waiter when the table terrorizing us finally departed. ''Oh, not much,'' he said, flipping open his order pad. ''They only had four double magnums and a bottle of port. Just a couple grand.'' * Don't bring a crowd. Maybe it is just coincidence, but the best meal I had at Sparks was the night I took only one guest. Everything came out piping hot, and both the steak and the lobster were superb. * Watch what others eat. You don't see anyone around you eating hot seafood appetizers, and there is a reason for that. The baked clams are very bready and not very baked. You don't see anyone eating melon either. The appetizers of choice are shrimp cocktail (served butterflied and flat on the plate), lump crabmeat, and a sliced tomato and onion salad. The cognoscenti, you will note, ask to have their tomato salads chopped and topped with Roquefort dressing, which makes a very American and curiously delicious treat. You will also find that many around you are eating asparagus vinaigrette. It is not on the menu, but it is very good. * Stick to plain steak and chops. The menu is filled with froufrou food like medallions of beef in bordelaise sauce, steak fromage (topped with Roquefort cheese) and beef scallopine (sliced fillet with peppers and mushrooms). The kitchen seems to have utter contempt for someone wanting anything so effete, and neither the meat nor the sauce is on the same level as the straightforward dishes. Incidentally, the most reliable dish I have found is lamb chops, which are always delicious. * If you want seafood, have lobster. Lobster at Sparks is usually reliable, although once it was so tough I wish I had sent it back. Fish are treated as if they were silly intruders, and those who order chunks of lobster meat and broiled shrimp in lemon butter sauce are going to get what they deserve. This is, after all, a steakhouse. * Don't be embarrassed to send it back. The steaks are prime and aged in a combination of wet and dry aging. The quality varies, and you can only pray you will get one of the great ones. But you don't have to pray about the cooking; if it is not as you like it, ask the waiter to take it back to the kitchen. If you ordered rare meat, you shouldn't have to eat it well done. * Don't expect much from the hash browns. Unfortunately, I have never had a great plate of hash browns at Sparks. They should be crisp on the outside, soft within and very hot. I wonder if the kitchen even knows how to make them? Buttered spinach, on the other hand, is bright green and delicious. * Drink your dessert (unless you're having cheesecake). Skip the tartuffo, the berries and the ice cream, and note that there are terrific ports, Sauternes and late-harvest wines that would make a very sweet ending to the meal. * Confirm your reservation. Sparks can be very casual when you call. I once made a reservation for Sunday night only to show up and discover that the restaurant was closed. Sparks, it turns out, is never open on Sunday.

483,Cho Dang Gol,2 star,"March 18, 1998",Ruth Reichl,Koreatown,Korean,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/18/dining/restaurants-korean-cuisine-uniquely-rustic.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/18/dining/restaurants-korean-cuisine-uniquely-rustic.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"THE soft white custard has the texture of overwhipped cream. It gives, gently, when you dip your spoon into the bowl, allowing a bit of fragrant steam to escape. In the mouth it is warm and savory, not sweet, with the comforting character of chicken soup. It is the most lovable food you can imagine. At least until you hear its name: ''bean curd dregs'' hardly conveys the utter deliciousness of this amiable fare. And ''bean curd restaurant'' cannot adequately express how exciting the eight-month-old Cho Dang Gol can be. On the one hand, it is just another small Korean restaurant among the many huddled together in the West 30's. On the other, it serves uniquely rustic food that is very different from what is available in the surrounding blocks. This is not your typical Korean barbecue restaurant, nor does it have the encyclopedic menu of the fancier establishments. The specialty here is fresh soybean curd, made daily at the restaurant. ''Oh,'' one Korean-born friend said, closing her eyes after the first bite, ''I haven't had this taste in my mouth since my family left our village.'' Cho Dang Gol seems to understand that it is offering Proustian epiphanies to many of its guests; the kitchen makes each dish with extreme care. Even the panchan, the little saladlike appetizers that Korean restaurants bestow upon their customers, are of remarkably high quality. They change with each meal, but they are always fresh-tasting, with a distinct range of flavors. There may be pickled turnips, leaves and all, red with chili peppers, or sliced marinated broccoli stems that snap appealingly when you bite into the bits. Shredded daikon is crisp and bland, especially against the tiny, silvery, pungent fish in the adjacent dish. The colors are vivid, from bright green to deep maroon, and the flavors so clear that a few bites make you very, very hungry. For the uninitiated, searching out the best dishes is not easy. The menu has a back page offering the most familiar Korean dishes. They include soi-kal-bi and bul-go-gi, the marinated, grilled beef dishes. The meat is tender and tasty, but if Korean barbecue is what you are after, you would be better off eating in a restaurant equipped with table grills. You can find hae-mool pa-jun, the appealing seafood-filled pancake, in every Korean restaurant in town; some places even call it pizza. The point of eating at Cho Dang Gol is to order the dishes that are uniquely the restaurant's. To do this, search the menu for the term ''doo-boo'' -- Korean for ''bean curd,'' and the restaurant's name. Some dishes are not listed in English. On the far left side of the menu, you will find appetizers like doo-boo dong-ki-rang-deng, puffy little rounds the size of silver dollars made of tofu and filled with shredded vegetables and bits of beef. They are so soft and light that they seem to vanish as your mouth closes around them. Doo-boo kam-ja-jun, a sort of potato pancake, is also very appealing, floppy little circles folded over a filling of tofu and vegetables. My favorite dish is at the top of the middle column, cho-dang-gol jung-sik. It arrives in three bowls: one filled with rice dotted with beans, another with those comforting bean-curd dregs and the third with a pungent soup-stew containing pork, seafood, onions and copious amounts of chilies. Together they make an absolutely satisfying meal. I love chung-kook-jang, too, soybean-paste stew with an elemental flavor. ''Pure peasant food,'' another Korean-born friend said, ladeling the bean mixture over rice, ''our version of rice and beans.'' She took a bite and added, ''Doesn't this make you feel healthy?'' Yes, it did. In fact, the only dish I have found at Cho Dang Gol that did not have that effect was boo-dae-jun-gol, one of the hot pots listed on the right side of the menu. The waiter recommended it highly, but when it arrived it was filled with what seemed to be sliced hot dogs and Spam. These highly prized foods joined the Korean table in the 1950's, courtesy of the American Army, and I suspect the taste has to be acquired. I would far rather eat doo-boo doo-roo-chi-gi, a combination of pork, pan-fried kimchi, clear vermicelli and big triangles of bean curd whose edges crisp as they sit on the hot platter. Or mo-doo-boo oh-jing-uh bok-um, squid and bean curd on a similar sizzling platter. I never tire of cho-dang-gol jae-yook bo-ssam, the restaurant's finger food. A plate piled high with leaves of lettuce is accompanied by thin strips of grilled, marinated pork and kochujang, the soy, garlic and chili paste that is one of the essential Korean seasonings. You spread the kochujang on a leaf, add pork and roll it all up to make an irresistible sort of Korean taco. To me it makes a perfect final flavor. Cho Dang Gol is not a fancy restaurant. But if you are like me, you will find that it takes only one visit to make you start waking up in the middle of the night, yearning for bean-curd dregs.

484,Il Cantinori,1 star,"Feb. 18, 1998",Ruth Reichl,Greenwich Village,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/18/dining/restaurants-transported-to-tuscany-occasionally.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/02/18/dining/restaurants-transported-to-tuscany-occasionally.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"WHAT do you suppose a plate of spaghetti with olive oil, garlic and peppers costs a restaurant? Let's give the place the benefit of the doubt and assume the kitchen is using the very best olive oil, organic garlic lovingly coaxed from the earth, the finest imported pepper flakes and handmade pasta. Even at that, it is hard to imagine how the ingredients could possibly cost more than a dollar or two. So any restaurant charging $17 had better deliver an extraordinary experience. And that is the problem with Il Cantinori: it rarely does. When the restaurant opened, it was one of the first to serve authentically spare Tuscan fare. I remember the thrill of sitting down to a meal that mirrored what Tuscans call the sincerity and serenity of their food: a dish of white bean soup, a plate of roast pork, a few potatoes cooked with garlic, rosemary and fragrant olive oil. In a world of red sauce, it was a revelation. But that was 15 years ago. Since then Tuscany, like Provence, has become a place whose name evokes romantic fantasies in the American diner. Unfortunately, Il Cantinori has become just another restaurant trading on the image. It certainly looks like the real thing, a charming rustic room with terra-cotta floor tiles, white walls and big, striking sprays of flowers.  There are exposed beams, white table cloths, a fine antipasto display in the front. Yes, this could be Italy. The antipasto's not bad, either. Most nights there are perfectly grilled vegetables and a fine assortment of mushrooms and well-cooked beans. Maybe the mozzarella is not as good as it might be, but still, it is an attractive plate. At least until the bill comes; one night when I asked our waiter to assemble a plate of assorted antipasto for the table, the bill came to $13 a person. I was, truly, shocked. Other appetizers can be equally shocking: calamari, for instance. At a recent dinner, the squid was grilled into toughness and topped with chopped tomatoes that did not have much flavor. The same night, tuna carpaccio swathed in a pesto vinaigrette was equally unsuccessful. The balance was off; too much pesto and not enough vinaigrette muddied the taste of the fish. Pasta e fagioli, a bowl of bean soup, cost an astonishing $9.50. It was adequate, but not more than that. But pasta, on the right night, can be superb at Il Cantinori. A few months ago, I was served pappardelle with a sauce made from Tuscan pot roast and its cooking liquid; it was rich, deeply flavorful, satisfying. Tagliolini with zucchini was beautifully done. And yet at the same meal a plate of pasta al pesto with beans was swimming in an oddly creamy sauce. Main courses display the same disconcerting inconsistency. Meat tends to be handled with incredible care. I was recently served the best piece of calf's liver I can remember having in a restaurant, the meat sliced paper thin and carefully cooked in brown butter and sage. Tender and extraordinarily flavorful, without a hint of the bitterness so often found in liver, it was a perfect example of Tuscan cooking: good ingredients cooked simply and with care. Scaloppine of veal was impressive, too, the veal so gently cooked it needed no knife, nestled against bright green leaves of spinach. And one night filet mignon in a three peppercorn and cream sauce was a reminder of everything that is wonderful about beef. Osso buco can also be a delight, although the risotto served with it (unattractively called ''rice stew'') is often soggy. But fish can be a problem. I have had red snapper, simply served with olive oil and lemon, which was a delight to eat. But a few weeks ago, I was served an unattractive plate of scallops in lemon and butter. On the same night, sea bass in tomato sauce had so little flavor it might have been any random protein. But whenever I am tempted to write the restaurant off, I remember that superlative pappardelle with pot roast sauce. I sit at other restaurants eating tough, bitter calf's liver, and the memory of Il Cantinori's ethereal liver floats into my mind. I recall the taste of biscotti, especially the chocolate ones with just the faintest hint of pepper in the aftertaste. And I go back, hoping that the kitchen will have triumphed over it troubles, hoping for a meal that is spare, simple and satisfying. Because the truth is that I am perfectly happy to pay $17 for a plate of spaghetti with olive oil and garlic if it reminds me of eating in a Tuscan hill town. And I know that Il Cantinori, at its best, is capable of transporting me to Italy. If only it would. Il Cantinori * [rating: one star] 32 East 10th Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-6044.

485,Blue Ribbon Sushi,2 star,"Jan. 7, 1998",Ruth Reichl,SoHo,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/07/dining/restaurants-sushi-for-novices-without-loss-of-face.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/07/dining/restaurants-sushi-for-novices-without-loss-of-face.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"''PLEASE don't embarrass me. Promise that you'll eat everything, even if it seems weird. Don't forget to buy the sushi chef a drink. And if he offers you the salmon skin, be sure to express your undying gratitude.'' My first encounter with sushi, 30 years ago, made me feel as if I were being inducted into a secret society. The man who took me to that first meal had spent many years cultivating a sushi chef, and he was worried that I would ruin the relationship. As we drove to the restaurant, he briefed me on the ritual. By the time he was done, I was terrified: there were so many rules! I was to eat the sashimi with chopsticks. When I put them down between bites, I was to lay them directly in front of me on the chopstick rest, parallel to the edge of the counter. It was permissible to eat sushi with my fingers, but only if I picked up each piece by the far end, so I could flip the fish into the soy sauce. Under no circumstances should the rice touch the soy sauce; my friend repeated this injunction several times. I was to avoid asking for a single piece of sushi. (One slice, my friend informed me, is a pun on the words ''to kill a man'' and is considered bad luck.) And afterward, I was supposed to ask the waitress, not the chef, for the bill. I was nervous all through the meal. But I avoided making any egregious mistakes, and at the end of the meal the itamae-san bestowed the broiled salmon skin upon me. I was properly grateful. All that came back to me the first time I ate at Blue Ribbon Sushi. The experience was so utterly different from my first sushi adventure that it gave me pause. As Americans adopted sushi, we adapted it as well, discarding those parts of the traditional rituals that made us uncomfortable. Blue Ribbon Sushi has good fish and an awesome list of sakes, but beyond that it has very little in common with a classic Japanese sushi bar. If you have ever felt like a clumsy foreigner and worried about doing the wrong thing in a sushi bar, this is the place for you. The major change is in the relationship between the sushi chef and the customer. In a traditional sushi restaurant the best seats are at the counter, right in front of the senior sushi chef. But it doesn't matter where you sit at Blue Ribbon Sushi. The three busy chefs behind the counter might just as well be in the kitchen. They do not talk to the customers. They do not even look at them. Even those who are seated at the sushi bar place their orders with a waiter. You are better off at a table, which has the comfort advantage. You will have to wait for a table, but you'll have to wait for any sort of a seat at Blue Ribbon Sushi, which takes no reservations. As a result, the one person you will develop a relationship with is the maitre d'hotel, an amiable man who handles one of New York's most difficult jobs with extraordinary grace. He seems truly apologetic to keep you standing in the cramped front of the restaurant for an hour, awkwardly balancing a cedar box of cold sake. And he seems delighted when he is finally able to hand you a menu. The menu is enormous, and I have liked almost everything I've tried, from a pretty seaweed salad to broiled yellowtail collar. But the high point of the meal is always sushi and sashimi. You find them listed on the second page, priced by the piece (no superstition here), helpfully divided between fish from the Atlantic and fish from the Pacific. These categories are not entirely accurate, but that's a minor point. For although the quality is not so high as that in the best traditional sushi bars, the sheer variety is enormous. That makes Blue Ribbon Sushi an excellent place to try new sorts of sushi. If you have been curious about the difference between freshwater eel (unagi) and sea eel (anago), why not try it here? You might also taste the difference between hamachi (farmed yellowtail) and kanpachi (the wild sort). The chefs do interesting things with aji (horse mackerel), serving the flesh as sashimi and then taking the bones away to be fried until they crunch deliciously beneath your teeth. Wonderful little sea scallops, oysters and spiny sea urchins are all served in their shells. The sushi chefs are at their best when inventing interesting specials like an appealing roll filled with fried oysters. And unfettered by tradition, they create unusual special platters filled with whatever happens to be best that day. Just name the price you want to pay and let them amaze you. The restaurant also has vegetable rolls for vegetarians and meat rolls (filet mignon, lamb, even pigeon) for carnivores. And should you be in the mood for salmon skin, you don't have to impress anyone to get it. All you have to do is order it.

486,Smith & Wollensky Steak House,2 star,"Dec. 24, 1997",Ruth Reichl,Midtown East,Steak Houses,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/24/dining/restaurants-a-steakhouse-to-end-all-arguments.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/24/dining/restaurants-a-steakhouse-to-end-all-arguments.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IN my family the holidays meant two things: We went to see ''The Nutcracker.'' And we had the annual argument about steak. ''Where should we eat afterward?'' Mom always began. ''The Palm,'' my brother would shout. It was, and is, his favorite restaurant in the world, and his idea of a perfect place to celebrate. My mother, however, hated it. ''They throw the food at you,'' she always complained. She did not have any fonder feelings for my favorite, Peter Luger. As I praised the quality of the steak she said very little. But when I had finally wound down she would say, ''But everything else is awful,'' in a voice that broached no argument. Then my father weighed in with a vote for Gallagher's because he loved the rich history of the place. ''You can't eat atmosphere,'' Mom would sniff. In the end we always forgot about steak and went out for something else instead. Too bad Smith & Wollensky was not around. It is only 20 years old, but it has become the most consistent of New York's steakhouses, and the only one that could possibly have pleased everyone in my family. Although I still prefer the steak at Peter Luger I have to admit that the meat at Smith & Wollensky is dry aged and very, very good. When you order the sirloin rare, it arrives gorgeously cooked, cool in the middle, charred and slightly grainy on the outside. The sirloins are aged for around two weeks to concentrate and intensify the flavor and give the meat a dry edge, but if you like your meat with the funky, mineral tang of more age you are in luck. The special rib-eye steak, which is aged for a third week, is not on the menu, but the kitchen almost always has a few on hand. It can be had grilled or blackened, although I have a hard time understanding why anyone would want to cover up the taste of meat this good. My brother, who goes to steakhouses primarily to eat lobster, would have to admit that the ones at Smith & Wollensky are perfect specimens. And unlike so many other New York steakhouses, the waiter does not arrive at the table announcing that lobsters are $16.50 a pound and, by the way, the smallest one in the house weighs 22 pounds. As for atmosphere, Smith & Wollensky may not have the eccentric ugliness of Palm or the Damon Runyon airs of Gallagher's, but it has a no-nonsense down-to-earth plainness. This is a place for two-fisted eating. The maitre d'hotel is pleasant, even under the pressure of a holiday crowd, and the waiters are pros who do not think they have to be rude to earn their keep. They won't tell you their names or entertain you with jokes, and they fawn over no man (or woman). Dad would have liked that. But the real reason to rejoice about Smith & Wollensky is that almost all the food is good. My mother, in other words, would have found much to make her happy. I imagine Mom would have started her meal with an order of raw clams. They have a fine, bracing quality. Oysters are excellent, too. In fact, all the seafood cocktails are impressive, from the unadorned pile of crab meat to the tender shrimp, which arrive horizontal and not chilled into flavorlessness. I hope my mother would have avoided the rather silly salad, which is embellished with chunks of bacon and pieces of potato. It is certainly not the thing for a real lover of greens. The crab cakes are another disappointment, thin, expensive and almost entirely devoid of crab flavor. But grilled fish is another matter. When you order fish in most steakhouses you know that the person who cooked it considered it a hated chore. ''Miserable sea creature,'' you imagine him mumbling as he flips your fillet. But someone at Smith & Wollensky must like fish; you can order a piece of swordfish knowing that it will actually be edible. Chicken is treated with equal respect, grilled and served with sauteed pepper, and the kitchen does very well with liver, cooking it to perfection and embellishing it with bacon and onions. I can't say the same for veal Milanese; it is just a big flat, thoroughly breaded thing that might as well be cardboard for all the taste it has. Side dishes are impressive. I love the creamed spinach; it is rich and delicious and, best of all, seems entirely lacking in nutmeg. Onion rings are cooked in clean oil, and the hash browns, while they rarely achieve perfection, are very good. Desserts, unfortunately, leave a great deal to be desired. The lemon tart is topped with a meringue containing so much sugar that it is positively gritty. The profiteroles are a little tough. Carrot cake seems like an anachronism best left in the past. As in most steakhouses, cheesecake turns out to be the best bet. But the worst part of the meal is still ahead: collecting your coat. This time of year the restaurant is so packed that getting to the coat room is a trial. Clearly my family is not the only one that thinks the holidays are a fine time for steak. Most people, I guess, skip the argument. Smith & Wollensky ** [rating: two stars] 797 Third Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 753-1530. ATMOSPHERE: If you were trying to design a classic steakhouse, this is what it would look like -- big, plain, comfortable and manly. SERVICE: The men and women who work here are true professionals. SOUND LEVEL: Pleasantly raucous. RECOMMENDED DISHES: Shrimp cocktail, crab cocktail, clams, split-pea soup, rib-eye steak, sirloin steak, lamb chops, swordfish, lobster, calf's liver, creamed spinach, onion rings, hashed brown potatoes, cheesecake. WINE LIST: Big, deep and filled with impressive and expensive wines; for less expensive bottles, ask for the Wollensky's Grill list.

487,Nick and Toni's Cafe,2 star,"Nov. 12, 1997",Ruth Reichl,Upper West Side,Mediterranean,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/12/dining/restaurants-hamptons-hot-spot-has-a-city-cottage.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/11/12/dining/restaurants-hamptons-hot-spot-has-a-city-cottage.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"SOME restaurants fit so perfectly into their neighborhoods that it is almost impossible to imagine a time when they were not there. Payard Patisserie and Bistro, to take one recent example, is only a couple of months old, but it is already hard to remember where the Upper East Side ladies lunched before it opened. Nick & Toni's Cafe is its mirror image: although it has a completely different atmosphere, the five-month-old restaurant fits so seamlessly into the low-key streets of the Upper West Side that it seems to have been there forever. Which is surprising: Who would have expected that an offshoot of the hottest place in the Hamptons would  play so well just off Columbus Avenue? But the owners, Jeff Salway and Toni Ross, have used the slight scruffiness of their small West 67th Street outpost to good advantage. It is resolutely not hip, not chic, not terribly trendy. It seems more a place to drop into for a bite than a reservation restaurant, and only a very discerning eye will notice that the details are impeccable: the copper-topped bar, bucolic murals and wood-burning oven near the door give the room a cozy air. Everything plays against pretension, from the bread sticks casually served in water glasses to the simple printed sheet of paper that serves as the menu. Sometimes the casualness goes too far: the service is so relaxed it can seem nonexistent. The one thing that is not haphazard, however, is the food: it is glorious, simple, delicious. Nick & Toni's starts with good ingredients and leaves them alone. One of my favorite dishes of the year is the restaurant's mussels ''brule-doigts,'' a classic French bistro dish of mussels roasted in the wood oven until the shells become papery and so hot they burn the fingers. It is painful to part the blue-black shells to get at the plump mussels bursting with juice. It is worth it. The menu changes constantly, but there are a few perennials, like the impeccable Caesar salad -- crisp, lightly dressed, perfectly pungent. Often, there is a fine pasta with just the right number of baby clams. Most times, too, there is a baby chicken roasted in the wood oven until the skin crackles and the flesh is moist and silken. The bacon-garlic potatoes on the side are an irresistible bonus. There is usually a grilled rib-eye steak as well, with home-made potato chips. It is not the best steak you have ever eaten, but it is chewy, flavorful, very satisfying. Looking around the small room, you see people hunched over their food, really enjoying it. Mothers come early in the evening, children in tow, to order pastas and potatoes. That is the time when you find single men drinking wine by the glass (the selection is appealing), alternately engrossed in their books and their plates. The groups arrive later, fresh from the movie theater around the corner, arguing passionately about what they have just seen. This is so clearly not a see-and-be-seen sort of place that when the movie stars arrive (and they do), everyone politely ignores them by studiously looking in the other direction. This New York nonchalance leaves you free to spill the sauce from the rich and cheesy penne rigate with ragu all over your shirt. You can drown in the delicious Ligurian fish stew (cooked with tomatoes and oregano) and eat the frito misto di mare with your fingers. Should you choose a pizzetta, an individual pizza that may be topped with clabbered cream and salmon or with late tomatoes and shrimp, you can eat that with your fingers, too. Desserts tend to be simple and seasonal. Spring saw bowls of berries served with nothing more than clabbered cream. Late in the summer, a trifle made with huckleberries, raspberries and strawberries was swathed in billows of whipped cream. This time of year there is almost always an apple crisp (it's good for sharing) and creme brulee. Nick & Toni's is a lot like the neighborhood it serves: casual, crowded and noisy. But there is one thing that sets it apart from most of the neighborhood's restaurants: The food is really delicious. Nick & Toni's Cafe ** [rating: two stars] 100 West 67th Street, (212) 496-4000.

488,Caviar Russe,2 star,"Oct. 29, 1997",Ruth Reichl,Midtown East,Russian,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/29/dining/restaurants-caviar-by-the-mother-of-pearl-spoonful.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/29/dining/restaurants-caviar-by-the-mother-of-pearl-spoonful.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"EVERY time I eat caviar I think of M. F. K. Fisher. The second time I visited America's most famous food writer in Sonoma, Calif., where she was living in the early 1970's, I scraped together enough money to buy a small tin of caviar. It was a very small tin, but it was caviar, and I imagined that with sufficient creme fraiche and toast and chopped eggs and onion, it would feed a roomful of people. When I presented this opulent offering, Ms. Fisher stared at it for a moment and said, ''Oh, lovely, a couple of spoonfuls.'' Since then, whenever I can, I request my caviar that way, too, unadorned and by the spoonful. If you like that idea, you will appreciate the tiny, moderately priced spoons at Caviar Russe, a luxurious caviar parlor, which opened on Madison Avenue in June, brimming with adorable mother-of-pearl spoons and antique silver caviar dispensers. There is something otherworldly about these two deliberately old-fashioned rooms tucked away at the top of the stairs. Ornately carved, white moldings, glittering chandeliers and a robin's-egg-blue ceiling combine with murals from a Russian fairy tale to give the room a look somewhere between the splendor of Versailles and the cozy sweetness of Mary Poppins. Most nights the people sitting in the commodious booths are couples intent on celebration. The service is murmuringly solicitous, which makes this a fine place for that sort of thing. But there is another side of Caviar Russe: it is one of New York's nicest places to eat alone. There is usually a woman or two sitting at the counter, chatting with the chef and treating herself to caviar. Most afternoons a couple of lone lunchers can be found in the dining room, intent on their own pleasure. One day, a man from the South, who had become a regular during his week in New York, was there. As he drank his vodka (the list offers an awesome global tour of clear potent liquors), he needled the waiter with friendly familiarity. ''I love this place,'' he said expansively. The woman a few tables down smiled softly to herself. The sun poured in the window, illuminating her thick dark hair as she sipped a glass of good Champagne and ordered a tiny taste of five sorts of caviar. They arrived on a long rectangular tray, miniature mother-of-pearl spoons holding a glistening mound of roe. She tried the sevruga first, and then the osetra, golden osetra, kaluga and beluga. She considered for a moment and summoned the waiter to order a serious portion. ''Osetra,'' she said, finally, ''I'll have 50 grams of osetra.'' And she did, eating happily, as if not quite trusting her own good luck. The osetra at Caviar Russe is especially fine, mild, a bit fruity, very low in salt. She went on to beef tartare, a great lump of ground steak topped with a smaller lump of caviar. ''Ah,'' she said, as she took her first taste. I could understand her happiness; the steak tartare is extraordinarily good, well-marbled, aged beef, perched on a snappy salad of beets, parsley and marinated mushrooms. The woman looked content. Ms. Fisher, I am sure, would have approved: the woman was treating herself like a guest. Caviar Russe encourages that sort of behavior. And although caviar is the main point, you need not indulge in the straight stuff. The chef, Scott Skey, who worked with Wayne Nish at March, has created an entire menu of small delicate dishes in which caviar plays only a supporting role. These include delicate chilled oysters topped with beluga caviar, and little shot glasses filled with cold potato soup and topped with caviar. The lobster roll, a perfectly cooked lobster claw set into a piece of cream-puff dough with caviar on top, is also an irresistible little morsel. The menu is small; even the $75 prix fixe meal pretty much concentrates on caviar. But there are a couple of impressive dishes that eschew fish eggs altogether. The best of them is a crayfish, sweetbread and artichoke stew, a blend of subtle flavors that work especially well together. The chowder is also rich and delicious, a luxurious mixture of crab meat, corn and oysters that is edged with lime juice and embellished with sage. Desserts, I am sorry to report, are a disappointment. They are ornate, expensive and after the caviar, something of a letdown. So, I might add, are the blinis, thin, listless crepes with very little character. All the more reason, of course, to eat your caviar with a spoon.

489,Il Giglio,1 star,"Oct. 22, 1997",Ruth Reichl,TriBeCa,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/22/dining/restaurants-where-the-show-goes-on-and-on-and.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/22/dining/restaurants-where-the-show-goes-on-and-on-and.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"FOR his first trick, your waiter will ignore your wine request and urge you to have the 1993 Chianti Classico Riserva from Antinori. ''It is,'' he will assure you, ''the best wine on our list.'' Presenting the bottle with a flourish, he will decant it into an enormous stenciled glass pitcher. Later, if you are lucky, he may even confide that he has already sold 30 bottles tonight (at $50 each). For his next trick, he will appear at the table with a hunk of Parmesan cheese and hack off a few pieces. With a wave of his hand, he will then cover the table with small offerings: plates of salami, bowls of garlicky, oil-drenched zucchini and bruschetta with tomatoes. If he is in a good mood, he may also produce baskets of warm garlic bread. The show continues with a soulful recitation of specials. Later, there will be a marvelous change of tablecloth, a feat your waiter accomplishes without disturbing a single dish. For his final act of the evening, he will carefully carve oranges and strawberries to make them look like flowers. At Il Giglio, each meal is a performance. Once upon a time New York City was filled with Italian restaurants, just like this one. Fast-talking waiters in fancy clothes held court in nondescript rooms, terrifying their customers with long lists of specials, entertaining them with tricks and interrupting endlessly to ask about the food. It wasn't very good, but nobody noticed. At Il Giglio, the food is still not very good. But judging by the restaurant's popularity, nobody seems to mind. There are two reasons for this. The first is that the experience of being in this nine-year-old restaurant is such an old-fashioned thrill that the food is easy to overlook. More importantly, by the time most people have eaten all those delicious little nibbles at the beginning of the meal, dinner has become entirely irrelevant. The chunks of Parmesan are grainy and good. The zucchini is satisfyingly swollen with garlic, oil and vinegar. The garlicky tomato bruschetta is very refreshing, and the salami really gives you something to chew on. It is wonderfully welcoming to sit down at the end of a hard day and find so much good food before being obliged to look at a menu. And the menu is not, truth be told, much to look at. You've seen it all before: the prosciutto and melon, the clams oreganato, the veal scaloppine in a thousand different guises. And so you listen carefully when the waiter comes to recite the specials of the day. These do not turn out to be significantly more exciting. On my last visit, there was pappardelle with mushrooms, onions and little sausages in the shape of meatballs. The pasta, swimming in tomato sauce, was overcooked to the point of mushiness. Still, it was better than the equally overcooked rotelle with capers, tomatoes and shrimp. The best pastas I have tried at Il Giglio were a deliciously simple spaghettini carbonara and some achingly rich mushroom and truffle ravioli adrift in an ocean of cream. While it is possible to get decent pasta at Il Giglio, the farther the menu strays from Italy, the better the food. The veal scaloppine dishes are adequate (my favorite is the one with artichokes), but the veal chop, its bone swathed in ribbons of aluminum foil, is a far better bet. The rack of lamb is better still, eight tiny, tasty chops arranged like the spokes of a wheel around a centerpiece of potatoes. Vegetables are also best when they are not Italian. The salads are lovely. Spinach and asparagus are fine. But the broccoli rape is absolutely dreadful, a mouthful of greens so harsh and bitter that swallowing becomes a trial. If this were 40 years ago, the waiters would walk around the restaurant whipping up zabaglione in copper bowls. But that particular piece of theater is no more; at Il Giglio the zabaglione is served cold over berries. Other dessert choices include tartuffo (a silly extravaganza of ice cream, fruit and chocolate), slices of Italian cheesecake and extremely sweet sorbets. They all pale compared to the great fruit performance. ''Some fruit, perhaps?'' the waiter will inquire. Nod your head, and he will come to the table bearing peeled oranges, berries and the largest kiwi ever grown. Rolling up his sleeves, he picks up a knife and sets to work. First he laboriously slices the orange into golden sections. Then he peels the kiwi. He carves the strawberry into a lily. Finally, with the concentration of a true artist, he arranges the fruit on the plate, adds strips of marinated orange peel and anoints his creation with Grand Marnier.  ''Arte,'' he says proudly, presenting the plate. You think for a moment that you really have gone back in time. At least until the bill arrives.

490,Maya,2 star,"July 18, 1997",Ruth Reichl,Upper East Side,Mexican,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/18/arts/restaurants-177822.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/18/arts/restaurants-177822.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The huitlacoche craze swept across Southern California 15 years ago. It was a time when people liked to brag about eating things others had never heard of, and this corn fungus, which is an honored Mexican ingredient, was considered a coup. It was spoken of in reverent tones, as if a great new American truffle had just been discovered. Never mind that it wasn't very tasty. Maybe it was too hard to find. Perhaps the name was too difficult to pronounce (wheat-la-COACH-hay). Its other appellation, night smut, certainly didn't win it any friends. Whatever the reason, the gray-black fungus, which grows on corn kernels, disappeared as quickly as it came. So imagine my surprise to open the menu at the two-and-a-half-month-old Maya restaurant and discover that the roasted corn soup was being served with a huitlacoche dumpling. It is not the only unusual dish on the menu. In fact, the food at Maya is unlike just about anything else being served in New York City. Salads have grilled cactus leaves, a quesadilla is stuffed with zucchini blossoms, and pork comes in a pumpkinseed sauce. The chef uses many chilies, and I would guess that no other restaurant in the city offers corn in so many guises. Richard Sandoval, the chef and owner, left his family's upscale restaurants in Acapulco to open a pair of restaurants in Manhattan. Savann and Savann Est have been successful because they offer sophisticated, French-inflected cooking at reasonable prices; now Mr. Sandoval hopes to showcase the food of his native Mexico. He seems to have put his heart into the venture. Maya is certainly the most attractive of his restaurants. The setting is colorful with rosy walls and an inlaid wood floor. Most of the bowls, glassware and serving pieces seem handmade. And aside from insisting on telling you their names (sometimes three or four times in an evening), the waiters are efficient. But it is the food that really wakes you up. After a single breathtaking bite of rock shrimp ceviche, you understand that the chef is on a mission. You first taste chilies, then lime. Right behind them comes the sneaky, bright green taste of cilantro. Then, just before you swallow, the sweetness of onions kicks in. By the time you are ready for a second bite your mouth seems alive with flavor. The seafood salad is another surprise. The greens, an unusual blend of watercress, cilantro and diced grilled cactus leaves, are tossed with a chile-Serrano-and-apple vinaigrette and topped with grilled shrimp, scallops and calamari rings. I found myself eating one bite after another, trying to deconstruct the tastes. I finally gave up and admitted that it was simply delicious. Even the chile relleno is unusual. The roasted pepper is stuffed with seafood and cheese and served with a black bean puree and cilantro oil. It is quite rich and sneakily sweet: is there honey in there? After these appetizers the tamale, with its shredded chicken, crema fresca and bright red chipotle sauce, is a bore. The quesadillas are dull, too. But I like the chunky guacamole, and I love the tacos al pastor, two little tortillas served with marinated pork, grilled onions and a fresh salsa. I could easily eat five or six servings. The most impressive main course is chicken mole. The chicken is just a boned, grilled breast, but the dark sauce is truly complex. Tasting it I found myself trying to define which chilies were in it and chasing down hints of coriander, cumin, chocolate and cinnamon. The fried plantains on the plate added an entirely different note. Pipian de puerco, grilled pork marinated in tamarind and served on a bed of pureed, roasted corn in a pumpkinseed sauce, is another satisfying dish. So is Mr. Sandoval's fancy chilaquiles, which began as a poor-people's dish to use up leftover tortillas. Moist slices of chicken are topped with fried tortillas, crema fresca and a fine tomatillo salsa. Even something as simple as grilled shrimp and lobster on a bed of rice and beans becomes, in Mr. Sandoval's hands, more than the sum of its parts. There are some missteps. The piramide de res, grilled hanger steak piled on grilled onions, tomatoes and black beans, is made with such terrible meat that even the powerful chile de arbol puree cannot save it. And putting guacamole on top seems absurd. Desserts are not impressive, either. The flan is flat, the sorbets too sweet. Cajeta, caramel made with goat milk, arrives on soggy crepes. The fireworks in platanos flameados, bananas flamed with tequila, have gone out long before they reach the table. But you could always have the roasted corn soup for dessert. Rich and creamy, it derives a pleasantly funky flavor from the huitlacoche dumpling. And if that doesn't appeal to you, I suggest a margarita made with hibiscus flowers. Sweet and slightly sour, it is the perfect final flavor for this food. Maya ** $(rating: two stars$) 1191 First Avenue, near 64th Street, Manhattan, (212) 585-1818.

491,Il Postino,0.75 star,"May 30, 1997",Ruth Reichl,Midtown East,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/30/arts/restaurants-627267.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/30/arts/restaurants-627267.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"In the beginning it is hard to resist the charm of Il Postino. The entrance to the five-month-old restaurant, with its enticing display of prosciutto, porcini and portobello mushrooms, is warm and appealing. You pass more food -- small fragrant melons and strawberries the size of artichokes -- as the jocular maitre d'hotel leads you to your table. Then a busboy arrives with a few free offerings: a pale mixture of seafood on endive; a plate of garlicky, chili-laden marinated zucchini, and an oversize basket of bread. He juggles plates to find room for it all on the small table, and this seems somehow charming, too, as if this restaurant just off Sutton Place were a struggling shoestring operation. It is all so engaging that when the wine list is small and many of the wines turn out to be unavailable, it seems no more than quaint. Then the menu appears, and it, too, is small. No matter; the prices seem fair, the dishes appealing. But just as you are about to tell the waiter what you want, he opens his mouth, takes a deep breath and starts talking as fast as an auctioneer. ''Tonight for appetizers,'' he begins, the words running together as they race into the air above you, ''we have zucchini blossoms stuffed with cheese, smoked swordfish carpaccio, grilled octopus, oysters topped with caviar or baked with bechamel, baby clams oreganata, fresh mozzarella with grilled, marinated peppers and tomatoes, artichokes fried with garlic, grilled porcini, portobello mushrooms . . .'' the list goes on and on. There seem to be a dozen appetizers, followed by half a dozen pasta dishes and as many kinds of meat and seafood, each cooked in some impossibly inventive manner. ''Who can remember all this?'' you wonder. ''Why don't they write it down?'' Then one answer becomes obvious: This is theater. Watching the waiter go through this performance is part of the charm of Il Postino. Not until the very end of the evening do you discover the other reason behind this oral recitation. ''If you want something else,'' the waiter says, coming to the end at last, ''please ask. The kitchen can do anything you'd like.'' It cannot, however, do it consistently well. Baby clams oreganata are excellent, the tiny clams sweet beneath their bread-crumb coating. But zucchini blossoms stuffed with cheese are dipped in an eggy batter and fried to a dreary sogginess. Grilled octopus is fine, but those artichokes are extremely unpleasant; they are not crisp, and with each bite you get a mouthful of fiber. Smoked swordfish carpaccio, dotted with onions and capers, is accompanied by a soup bowl of olive oil, rosemary and garlic. Its presence is never explained, but it takes up so much room on the already overladen table that the busboy is forced to remove the unattractive flower arrangement. The main courses are much more successful. Lobster fra diavolo (''in the shell or we'll take it out, on top of pasta or by itself'') turns out to be a whole small lobster in a deep bowl; it is drenched in a very garlicky tomato sauce and accompanied by a few strands of pasta. The beast arrives with a bib, which is a good thing because eating it is extremely messy fun. Sushi grade tuna with balsamic vinegar is excellent, too, the fish fresh and sweet in contrast to the assertive vinegar. The veal chop Milanese hangs off the edge of the plate and seems to be breaded in pulverized breadsticks, but it tastes just fine. The waiter has forgotten the side dish of broccoli rape, but no matter; there's no room on the table for it anyway. The cheesecake sounds irresistible (''We make it here''), and it is in fact delicious. Then the waiter mentions that there are some French melons in the kitchen. ''A little plate, perhaps?'' he urges. Well, why not? There's a very good reason why not, which we discover with the bill. The fruit plate costs $19. (On another occasion a plate of fruit for three set me back $22.50.) The mystery of the oral specials is solved: would any sane person order a bowl of pasta, even one topped with lobster, knowing that it cost $58.50? Apparently. The restaurant seems to be full of regular customers who do not wince when the bill is presented. I went back a few times, if only to find out why. Much of the food is good. The prosciutto, served with chunks of Parmesan and slivers of marinated mushrooms, is truly delicious. Pasta y fagioli is full of flavor. The mozzarella is excellent. Dover sole is nicely cooked, and steak in mushroom or Gorgonzola sauce is a treat. I like the seafood pasta, too, topped with green-lipped mussels, shrimp, squid, clams and lobster, but I think $42.50 is an absolutely outrageous price. This is not, after all, an elegant establishment. The front room is noisy, and if you are seated in the upstairs dining room you often find yourself surrounded by people who casually light cigarettes. And up there the kitchen door bangs against the wall with such force and regularity it feels like an earthquake. The service can be slow and forgetful. And one night I watched two busboys spend so long arguing over who was going to bone the fish for the people at the next table it took 10 minutes to get the job done. Some people find all of this charming. But even though the food was mostly fine, for me the allure of Il Postino wore off when the bill came. It's hard to smile when you feel like a sucker.

492,Circus,2 star,"May 16, 1997",Ruth Reichl,Upper East Side,Brazilian,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/16/arts/restaurants-627186.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/16/arts/restaurants-627186.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"''There are no restaurants like this in Rio,'' say my Brazilian friends, seating themselves in the warm and festive room that is Circus. ''Nobody wants to go out to eat the food they cook at home.'' The recent spate of churrascarias, where meat in copious quantities is the main thing, is giving us a very odd idea of Brazilian cooking. An entire generation now thinks the people of South America's largest nation sit down to vast amounts of steak and potatoes every night. But while places like Churrascaria Plataforma faithfully reproduce a form of restaurant popular in Brazil, Circus serves the food your mother might cook if you were raised in Sao Paulo or Bahia. Picadinho and muqueca de camarao might not have many takers in an upscale Rio restaurant, but New York is a different story: Circus is usually packed with Brazilians eager for a taste of home. They jump up to embrace each time the door opens, gorgeous women in impossibly tight clothes and elegant men with a nonchalant air. The charming circus drawings on the wall -- acrobats, prancing horses and adorable tigers -- add to the festive feeling. This increases with the hour; Brazilians eat late, and as the night gets older, the restaurant takes on the air of a party. Brazilians speak Portuguese with a soft accent, erasing the edges. Their food has the same quality; it is easy to like. The dominant ingredients (other than beef) are seafood, coconut, rice and beans, often combined in fascinating ways. My favorite dish on the current menu is camarao na moranga, a heap of tiny, tender rock shrimp sauteed with fresh corn, hearts of palm, shallots, peas and coconut milk, mixed with cheese and baked in an acorn squash. The squash becomes soft enough to eat with a spoon, adding its own note to the rich, elusive flavors, which change with each bite. Served with a side dish of rice, it is completely appealing. I like picadinho, too, beef sauteed with wine and thyme, topped with a poached egg and accompanied by rice, beans and cooked bananas. It tastes like earthy home cooking, and if it were only a little spicier it would be fabulous. ''Oh,'' say my friends shrugging, ''Brazilians think Americans don't like salt and spice, so they tend to leave them out when they cook for you.'' I certainly wish they wouldn't. Another particularly satisfying dish on the menu is an appetizer, bolo de milho e rabada, little polenta cakes baked with Manchego cheese and served with a robust oxtail sauce. A single large and meaty oxtail shares the plate. The textures are soft, the flavors gentle; this is just the sort of food that would be good to find on the table after a hard day at the office. I like casquinha de siri, too, sauteed crab meat baked in a shell and topped with cheese and toasted farofa, the manioc flour that is found in almost every Brazilian recipe. And feijoada, Brazil's famously meaty black bean stew, is worth a weekend trip; Circus serves it only on Saturdays and Sundays. But Circus has a tendency to prettify the food, making it fancier than it would normally be. Muqueca de camarao, a stew from the northeast of the country, is a delightful mush in its natural form, but here it becomes too elegant. Shrimp are grilled, fanned out around a mound of rice, embellished with a tomato, red pepper and coconut milk sauce, decorated with shreds of coconut and topped with a mere sprinkle of farofa. The flavors are muted and the dish loses its authenticity. Salmon is another nouvelle creation. The menu promises a sauce of shrimp and dende, the highly concentrated palm oil that is the true taste of the country. I liked the fish fillet, neatly folded into a crust of shredded potatoes and set on a bed of cabbage, but I could not make out the forceful punch of dende. By the time we got to frango com quiabo, chicken with okra and saffron sauce, I was starting to regret the kitchen's tendency to deconstruct plain food. What might have been a tasty stew on a bed of mashed potatoes had turned into a finicky dish of chicken with a side dish of okra. It was a disappointment. Another disappointment was that the caipirinhas, the national drink of Brazil, are made with vodka instead of the more powerful cachaca, which makes them wimpy. On the other hand, the unusual wine list concentrates on Spain, Portugal and Argentina. Prices tend to be high for the less expensive wines, but there are some bargains among the older, big-ticket bottles. Brazilian desserts are sweet and tropical. Circus executes them faithfully. The passion fruit mousse is too sweet for me, but I love the caramelized bananas with ice cream. And I like the soft coconut mousse with fresh coconut called Maria mole, a classic children's dessert. You finish, of course, with cafezinho, the potent little cups of coffee that fuel the country. It reminds your mouth that you have just spent some time in Brazil.

Although the room is huge, it is usually so packed that I have watched eager eaters struggle through the throngs to beg the hostess for a table. Even the cloakroom is crowded: it's as big as a Chinatown store but the coats still spill out onto a nearby rack. Boisterous and lively, Redeye Grill fits so naturally into the neighborhood that in its sixth month it is already hard to remember the area without it. This is undoubtedly due to the proprietor, Sheldon Fireman, who owns Trattoria del Arte next door and Brooklyn Diner around the corner. Mr. Fireman knows exactly what people want: almost everything. To accommodate them, Redeye Grill stays open every day from before noon to almost midnight. Still, it is not enough; next month, the restaurant is to start serving until 4 A.M. Mr. Fireman also offers a choice of ambiance: if the big, bustling space with its tall ceilings and earthy murals is too intimidating, you can ask for the more intimate rear dining room. Lower ceilings and a fireplace give it a friendly, rustic air. Appetite is no impediment either: if you are not very hungry, you can sit beneath the pair of six-foot rotating bronze shrimp that guard the bar, snacking on seafood and smoked fish. Should you be in the mood for a major meal, the extensive menu will almost certainly have something to please you. There is, of course, a downside to all these choices: when you try to please everybody, something gets slighted. In this case, it is the food. It is always perfectly fine. Occasionally, it is better than that. But not often. Consider, for example, the dancing shrimp, the restaurant's signature dish. A dozen shrimp arrive jiggling on the ends of skewers stuck into the top of a pineapple. Half have been dipped in a slightly spicy Cajun marinade and grilled, the other half wrapped in filaments of phyllo and fried so that they have a fat and furry look. The grilled shrimp are good, but the fried ones are more fun to watch than to eat. The shrimp cocktail looks impressive, too, but it can be remarkably, almost magically, tasteless. Of the many shrimp dishes on the menu, I much prefer the popped rock shrimp, cute little fried balls that do have some flavor. The menu also has a fine array of smoked fish. Salmon comes plain, smoked and peppered like pastrami, cured in tequila, with jalapenos and even with orange. Sturgeon comes topped with truffle oil. Trout, sable, chub . . . there is enough variety to please the most ardent deli maven; the kitchen even makes sushi out of it. The lobster section of the menu offers all sorts of preparations: grilled, in salad, with pasta and even in a pot pie. The pastas are never stellar, and the rich pot pie tastes more of tarragon than any creature of the sea. But the small grilled lobster, served with a little potato cake and pristine haricots verts, is lovely. Grilled fish tend to be nicely cooked, and the kitchen also does a good job with more complex preparations. I especially like Asian-style sea bass served with noodles and black beans. Cioppino, the tomato-based San Francisco fish and shellfish stew, is very respectable. And those who eat fish out of duty rather than desire will probably be pleased by mushroom-crusted mahi-mahi, which has a very meaty character. Personally, I'd rather eat a steak. The steak of choice here would be the hanger steak, tender slices piled onto a biscuit. The hamburger is good, too, if you overlook the presentation. It arrives on a messy plate, surrounded by big, dark rounds of fried potatoes, a pickle and a mushy tomato salad. It is hard to imagine that the same person who created this also invented the lovely Cobb salad with its colorful alternating bands of ingredients. The waiter presents the pretty platter before tossing the tomato, lettuce, avocado, blue cheese, egg, bacon and turkey into a very satisfying salad. Desserts are presented in the same flamboyant manner. The waiter appears with a tray and leans across the table, showing off a comically tall chocolate mousse cake, a gooey nut and chocolate concoction and a bunch of bananas, which stands in for banana cream pie. In this company, the plain Jane cream-cheese bundt cake looks so modest you know it has to be the best of the lot. Usually it is. Still, the waiters will all assure you that what you really want is banana cream pie. With its caramelized graham-cracker crust and its mounds of whipped cream, it is certainly a showy creature, but the custard often has a disconcertingly starchy consistency. I tried it four times and only once was it ideal, a sweet dream, an all-American triumph that fit perfectly into that big, bold room.

494,Maloney & Porcelli,1 star,"Nov. 1, 1996",Ruth Reichl,Midtown East,"Seafood, Steak Houses",https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/01/arts/restaurants-074187.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1996/11/01/arts/restaurants-074187.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"On Saturday night, when restaurants all over New York City were cursing the Yankees, Maloney & Porcelli was full. Clearly the restaurant is giving people what they want. Big portions of manly food. Fine service. A warm, attractive room filled with comforting Americana. Why then, do I have so many reservations about Maloney & Porcelli? Because the food is just too cute. This is theme eating for grown-ups, a place where the food is more fun to discuss than consume. ''Look at the size of that thing!'' people exclaim as their meal rolls up on a cart. ''Isn't that clever?'' they say, nudging one another when onion rings arrive in giant paper coffee filters and applesauce appears in an oversize Mason jar. If you need something to keep the conversation flowing, Maloney & Porcelli is happy to provide it. On Saturday, for instance, the special appetizer was Amazon fish ribs. All over the dining room, waiters could be heard explaining that they come from a 150-pound Brazilian fish skulking at the bottom of the Amazon River. Their resemblance to spareribs was so remarkable that I was halfway through my second rib before I realized I would rather be eating the ordinary sort. I had a similar experience with pizza topped with Robiolo cheese, portobello mushrooms and truffle oil. It was artfully nestled into a basket, looking so gorgeous and smelling so good that it took me awhile to realize the crust was crackerlike, the topping dull. Spicy tuna dumplings were another adorable idea, an American version of dim sum. But the filling was fishy and the wrapping so undercooked that it was tough and doughy. Occasionally the gimmicks work. Crackling pork shank, for instance, is an original and delicious dish, a great ball of meat (it weighs two and a half pounds before cooking), deep fried until the skin turns into cracklings, then slowly roasted. The result is an enormous mound of tender pork,  wrapped in its own crisp skin and served on an aromatic bed of poppy-seed-sprinkled sauerkraut. It is far more meat than most people can eat at one sitting, but it is every bit as appealing consumed cold the next day. Too bad the firecracker applesauce (in the Mason jar, with a whole chili pepper on top) has the disconcerting texture of baby food. As you might expect from a restaurant owned by Alan Stillman's New York Restaurant Group (which also owns Smith & Wollensky, the Post House, Cite, Park Avenue Cafe and Manhattan Ocean Club), the meat is good. A hefty grilled rib eye comes with the bone sticking over the edge of the plate, and sirloin steaks are crusty and flavorful. Side dishes, however, are less successful. Sweet onion rings are coated in an admirably light batter flavored with cumin and chili powder, but they are sometimes cold and are often stuck together. Creamed spinach, which arrives in a sweet little Calphalon saucepan, has been at various times salty, watery or both. The whipped potatoes, which the chef and partner, David Burke, made famous at Park Avenue Cafe, taste more of olive oil than potatoes, and the hashed browns are dry and overcooked. Grilled vegetables have been soggy. If you want a wonderful meal here, start by ordering one of the good wines from the large and fairly priced list. Then have a Caesar salad as a first course; tossed with a finely tuned dressing and pleasantly crisp croutons, it is served in a large wooden bowl. Crab cakes are good, too, as is Mr. Burke's trademarked Park Avenue Cafe Salmon Pastrami. Avoid the awkward specialty vegetable salad and the flabby gray ''minute steak'' of foie gras. Avoid, too, the glass of Chateau d'Yquem that is served with the foie gras: it costs $22 extra. Next have the pork shank. Or the swordfish London broil. Or a simple sirloin. The entrees to avoid are the silly monkfish Wellington, a piece of nearly tasteless fish topped with mushrooms and wrapped in soggy pastry, and the ''angry'' lobster. Half a five-pound lobster dusted with peppery flour and sauteed with sliced garlic is a lot to wrestle with. Unlike the similar sauteed lobster at F.illi Ponte in TriBeCa, this one is so tough it made me wonder if the beast had been cooked twice. If you want lobster here, it's much better to have it steamed. End the meal with drunken doughnuts. It's another gimmick, but it's charming. The waiter arrives shaking a pristine white paper bag. He opens it at the table, pours warm twists of sugar-dusted dough onto a plate and sets down three pots of liquor-laced jam. The combination is irresistible. The ''store-bought cheesecake'' tastes like S&S to me, which means it is terrific. And profiteroles come filled with good caramel ice cream and topped with a fine hot fudge sauce. But many of the desserts, like many of the entrees, look better than they taste: the giant slice of airy lemon meringue pie with the word lemon scrawled across every piece; the dry, fluffy mountain of coconut cake surrounded by a sea of apricot puree; the soggy, airy cherry-cheese strudel. Each has the overblown beauty of supermarket fruit: big and beautiful, they ultimately leave you unsatisfied. Maloney & Porcelli * 37 East 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 750-2233 Ambiance: The former Gloucester has been stripped down to a comfortable, wood-toned, masculine room decorated with eagles and filled with lawyers. Service: Very smooth and professional (although there are few large tables and parties of more than four often have to wait). Recommended dishes: Crab cakes, shellfish, Caesar salad, salmon pastrami, crackling pork shank with firecracker applesauce, swordfish London broil, grilled rib eye, sirloin steak, steamed lobster, drunken doughnuts, cheesecake, profiteroles with caramel ice cream and hot fudge.

495,Hatsuhana,2 star,"Aug. 30, 1996",Ruth Reichl,Midtown East,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/30/arts/restaurants-095060.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/30/arts/restaurants-095060.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"If George Rector, the author of the well-regarded ''Dining in New York'' in 1939, were to stroll through the restaurants of modern Manhattan, he would find very little to surprise him. Even then, the city had a lot to offer an adventurous appetite. The most glaring exception was Japanese food, which Mr. Rector dismissed as ''derivative of the Chinese.'' The only Japanese dish he seemed to like was sukiyaki; if he knew anything about sushi, he certainly kept it to himself. What would Mr. Rector make of the city today, a place with such a passion for things Japanese that sushi is sold in supermarkets? It is hard to say. But if he returned to New York, I would certainly want to introduce him to sushi and sashimi. And I would want to do it at Hatsuhana. Sushi bars can be extremely unwelcoming; many of the best make you feel that you have entered a club with incomprehensible rules that no one is willing to explain. Americanized sushi bars, on the other hand, often have showoff chefs who favor quantity over quality and do not know what they are doing. Hatsuhana is different: of all the city's sushi bars, it is the one that best bridges the gap between East and West. Hatsuhana is a comfortable and welcoming restaurant where you can depend on being served high-quality sushi whether you speak Japanese or not. But it can be more than that. Hatsuhana can surprise you. One day I walked in expecting the usual competent sushi. I sat down, ordered some sake and ate the tsukidashi, the little side dish of bean sprouts marinated in sesame oil that so often appears as a surprise first course. I was examining the fish in the case, considering what to order, when a woman sat down two seats away. She smiled but said nothing; without a word the shokunin, the sushi chef, began to give her food. She began with geoduck. Fresh giant clam is one of my favorite ways to begin a sushi meal, too. This was crisp and slightly crunchy beneath the teeth with that sweet, fresh oceanic flavor that characterizes the best. A good beginning. I was considering what to have next when I noticed that a waiter had brought something to the sushi chef. He tilted the bowl so the woman could see what was inside: live shrimp. Dispatching them with a quick twist of the wrist, he pulled them from their shells and placed the translucent bodies before her. I motioned that I would like shrimp, too, and within moments I was eating the delicate, almost perfumed flesh. Then the chef broiled the heads and gave me those. I ate every bit, crunching the shells like nuts. They were delicious. ''Just give me whatever she is having,'' I said now, convinced that I was in the presence of a pro. And I sat back as a feast appeared. We went on to baby abalone, a shellfish that seems overrated until you eat it raw. It was followed by extraordinary chu toro, the tuna that is richer than maguro but less rich than toro, which has the highest fat content (and the highest price). This was as soft as butter. Now the sushi chef cut yellowtail and placed the pale slices before me; it was as smooth as whipped cream. Next came something to sink our teeth into, kanpachi, the delicate wild yellowtail imported from Japan. I was happy to eat anything that my neighbor was eating. Now it was ika uni, pure white squid cut into long strips as thin as spaghetti and tumbled with golden sea urchin roe and a few thin slices of deep green toasted seaweed. It was like the most extraordinary pasta, a cool and refreshing dish for a summer evening. As a finale, the chef handed us each a single hand roll, a cone of seaweed filled with rice dabbed with neri ume, the tart plum paste, a stick of yama imo, the crisp mountain yam of Japan, and a couple of leaves of shiso. The combination was perfect, the tartness of the deep purple paste rubbing against the sharpness of the minty leaves and the bland crispness of the yam. The textures felt good against my teeth and the flavors lingered in my mouth better than any dessert would. That single meal was so exciting that it made me reconsider Hatsuhana. The sushi and sashimi are not always this extraordinary, but they are always very good. On subsequent visits, I have noticed that the quality of the cooked food is excellent, too; chawan mushi, the seafood and vegetable custard, is particularly good, and the broiled yellowtail collar is very satisfying. And although I would be happier if the restaurant did not serve tempura at the sushi bar (the smell of fried food is disconcerting when you are indulging in something as delicate as sashimi), the dish itself is nicely executed. What would Mr. Rector say after a meal at Hatsuhana? I can't be sure, of course, but I like to think that he would take a sip of sake, lean back and say, ''Things have certainly improved in the last 60 years.'' Hatsuhana ** 17 East 48th Street, Manhattan, (212) 355-3345. Atmosphere: The clean lines and typical blond wood decor offer no clue that this is among the most welcoming sushi bars in Manhattan. Service: So pleasant that even the chefs who do not speak very good English try to make themselves understood. Recommended dishes: Giant clam, live shrimp, abalone, tuna sashimi, yellowtail, mackerel, ume-shiso hand roll, kanpachi, scallop, squid with sea urchin, chawan mushi, green tea ice cream. Wine list: The long list of sake offers a few unusual bottles that are excellent. Hours: Lunch: 11:45 A.M. to 2:45 P.M. Mondays through Fridays; dinner: 5:30 to 10 P.M. Mondays through Fridays, 5 to 10 P.M. Saturdays. Closed Sundays. Price range: Sushi and sashimi starts at $2.50 a piece; set sushi meals are $17 to $35. Credit cards: All major cards.

496,Hakubai,2 star,"Aug. 16, 1996",Ruth Reichl,Midtown South,Japanese,https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/16/arts/restaurants-858650.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/16/arts/restaurants-858650.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"What could a restaurant possibly offer that would be worth $150 a person? In the case of Nadaman Hakubai, the answer is serenity and the extraordinary sense of experiencing another culture. A visit to one of this restaurant's tatami rooms is like a quick trip to Japan; if you are not prepared to leave New York City at the door with your shoes, it is hardly worth the voyage. Your arrival will be timed to insure that you meet no other diners; the point is to make you feel you have the entire restaurant to yourself. In my visits to Nadaman Hakubai, I have never heard the voice of another guest or seen any indication that the other tatami rooms were occupied. The beautiful woman who met us at the entrance had carefully hidden all the other coats and shoes. Kneeling in her kimono, she welcomed us, took our shoes and slid open the door to our room. Coming from the street the intensity of the quiet was startling. The room was elegant in its simplicity, carpeted with mats and decorated with a scroll and a single vase of flowers. Beneath the low table was a recessed pit in which to swing our legs, and the legless chairs had backrests. The bright fluorescent lighting was the only jarring note. The restaurant is a branch of an Osaka restaurant known for its interpretation of kaiseki, the cuisine associated with the tea ceremony. This is food for the soul as well as the body, meant to feed the eye with its beauty and the spirit with its meaning. The key to kaiseki is anticipation: the courses follow a strict order and each is intended  to introduce the coming season. That is why one course of the summer meal I had was an autumnal wild duck and why a spring meal featured a tomato aspic. The way to enjoy this is to abandon yourself to the experience, appreciating the peace, the subtlety of the flavors and the sense that you are being pampered as never before. The waitresses knock softly before entering the room, moving with amazing grace as they introduce each beautiful new dish. The last meal I had at Nadaman Hakubai began with sake served in an ice blue glass bottle snuggled into a bowl of ice next to a single orchid blossom. Next, the waitress poured delicate plum wine into seemingly weightless red lacquer cups and left us alone. When she returned, she was bearing long, covered bamboo dishes divided into three compartments. One held soft, seductive sea urchins suspended in clear aspic. Another presented small, salt-roasted sweet fish topped with fresh soybeans. In the middle were tiny roasted Japanese yams, still in the skin, as soft and sweet as  custard. Unless you are an extremely adventurous eater, you will probably not like every dish you are served, but most of the food is disarmingly subtle.  The course after the appetizer is always a light soup. In this case, the covered black lacquer bowl contained a single shrimp and a section of a corn  cob, hollowed out and filled with homemade tofu. Then there was sashimi served in two ice-covered bowls. One held translucent slices of fluke on a leaf of shiso, chunks of lobster on slices of lemon and a round of cucumber filled with freshly grated wasabi. The other bowl was a  disappointment: the toro (fatty tuna) was sinewy and tough, not buttery and delicate as it should have been. The waitress returned to see if we would like some more sake. Tucking her long sleeves into her obi in a graceful flowing motion, she poured the rice wine and left. When she returned, she was carrying covered ceramic dishes cradling slices of duck simmered with eggplant and ginger. The flavor was wild and forceful and, in the middle of summer, surprisingly refreshing. Traditionally, there is a fried dish at this point of the meal. In the spring, we were offered small, whole soft-shell crabs wrapped in a crisp tempura batter. But the chef changes the menu each night, and on this summer evening the waitress appeared with ceramic plates, each holding a sizzlingly hot rock set in salt. She set one in front of each of us, along with platters of thinly sliced raw wagyu beef, mushroom caps and spears of asparagus. Tucking her sleeves into her obi again, she showed us how to cook our food on the rock; the scent of the butter-soft meat spiraled up into the air. At other times, my meal at Nadaman Hakubai  ended with a plate of tidbits (in the spring, smoked salmon and tomato aspic), followed by rice with bits of lotus root, pickles and a small dish of vinegared clams. But now the waitress appeared with what looked like large candy apples. Opening the pretty bowls, we found a bed of ice covered with pale, delicate noodles topped with the deep purple Japanese salted fruit called  umaboshi, and pale green shiso leaves. It was perfectly refreshing. The finale was served on sparkling glass plates, each the color of a different jewel. Each  held a single fresh litchi, slices of crisp Asian pears and a scattering of blueberries. Then the waitress served tea, put her hands together, bowed and indicated a button on the wall. ''If you need me again,'' she said, ''please ring the call button.'' And she disappeared, silently sliding the door closed behind her. Once again the quiet was intense. I sat there in that peaceful room, contemplating the quality of the food. I have to admit that it was often disappointing. The tempura could have been hotter, the sashimi was not extraordinary and the fruit, which is never less than amazing in the kaiseki restaurants of Japan, was distressingly average. In Japan, the best food is said to have umami,  to be everything it can possibly be. It is a term that transcends perfection because it involves not only all the senses, but understanding as well; umami cannot exist unless it is recognized. I think I would recognize it. And I don't think the food at Nadaman Hakubai has umami. On the other hand, in spite of the occasional disappointment, each evening at the restaurant has been an immensely rewarding experience. Worth $150? Think of it this way: A trip to Japan would cost considerably more. Nadaman Hakubai ** In the Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, Manhattan, (212) 885-7111. Atmosphere: The regular restaurant is quite ordinary, but the tatami rooms are like a mini-trip to Japan. Service: The kimono-clad waitresses pamper you in every way. Recommended dishes: Kaiseki dinners, which change nightly. Wine list: There is a wine list, but the waitresses tend to be baffled by it. It is best to stick to sake and beer. Price range: Kaiseki dinners in the private tatami rooms are $150 a person, for a minimum of 4. Traditional Japanese breakfast in the dining room is $24; prix fixe lunch is $45, and kaiseki meals in the main restaurant begin at $80 (and are not particularly recommended).

497,Cipriani Downtown,1 star,"June 14, 1996",Ruth Reichl,SoHo,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/14/arts/restaurants-016330.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1996/06/14/arts/restaurants-016330.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The woman at the next table keeps getting up. Each time she stands, the entire dining room takes notice, our eyes on the leopard skin shorts and the legs that unfold endlessly from beneath the table. The dining room watches, too, as the woman at the table opposite mine unbuttons yet another inch of lime green Chanel jacket. She is not wearing anything under it, and she laughs and swishes  her shiny black hair as she toys with the collar. Everybody seems to be smoking avidly, unabashedly, as if it were not illegal. Clearly nobody goes to Downtown to eat. They go to the newest Cipriani restaurant to smoke, to look swell, to see and be seen. That is a very good thing, because the food served beneath that ornate glass chandelier is astonishingly uneven. Consider two evenings a few weeks apart. Night One: It is 7:30, an unfashionable hour at Downtown, which tends to fill up as the night grows older. We have obviously been allotted two hours for dinner, and the busboy is intent on holding us to it. He keeps trying to clear our plates. Meanwhile, the people at the next table bathe us in a steady stream of smoke. When I mention this to the maitre d'hotel, he replies graciously, ""Ninety percent of our customers smoke, but if people ask us to ask them to stop, we do."" He moves off to incline apologetically over their table. They glare at us and put out their cigarettes. For five minutes. Then three people at the table light up again. The waiter brings them an ashtray. We throw up our hands. Our appetizers include the world's most expensive bowl of bean soup and a mushy tuna tartar. Soft polenta with veal ragu is bland. The only dish I like is an artichoke and avocado salad topped with thin sheets of Parmesan cheese. Veal milanese, which was extremely good in the restaurant's first week, now tastes oily. Gnocchi in tomato sauce are leaden. And kidneys in cognac sauce are tough and overcooked. The side order of risotto is dense and slightly gummy. Across the dining room, I notice a waiter approaching Oscar de la Renta's table  with a plate of risotto that looks fluffy, pale and quite perfect. I am jealous. Is there anything worth eating? Well, mussels and clams veneziana is a nice dish, although it seems overpriced at $19.50. And the thin slices of carpaccio a la cipriani are cut from a gorgeous piece of meat. I suppose most of these people don't mind that it costs $18.50. We eat our fluffy white desserts, zabaglione cake and lemon meringue tart, and flee. Night Two: The tables are too small, the restaurant is too crowded and the people at the next table keep smoking, even though we ask them to stop. I am feeling very mean. But then my first course arrives. I take one bite of the light semolina gnocchi in an even lighter tomato sauce, and my mood changes. It tastes like Italy. The fried calamari are excellent (as they ought to be at $15 a plate). Mussel and clam soup is a treat. And the baked tagliolini, made famous by the original Harry's Bar in Venice, is a sort of grown-up version of macaroni and cheese with ham. Rich and creamy, it is elegant comfort food. The main courses are even better. They include pasta with a fine, flavorful ragu. Chicken is simple, beautifully grilled, and served with nothing but a bit  of zucchini and tomatoes on the side. Grouper comes topped with grilled radicchio and just a hint of cream whose sweetness plays against the bitterness  of the radicchio. Calf's liver is slivered, tossed with an equal amount of sweet onions and cooked so rapidly that the meat retains its softness. I have never had a better version of fegato alla veneziana. It is all so delicious I find myself liking even those airy desserts that I found so sweet on my last go-round. Return visits have proved that neither night was typical: The food at Downtown is rarely all bad or all good. The one sure thing is the prix fixe meal, which includes a good salad, fine pasta, dessert and coffee. At $28, it is a fair deal. Order the other dishes and you take your chances. You take your chances with the wine as well. It is hard to order from a list  that neglects to list vintage years, harder still when the restaurant is out of  half the wines. This time of year you might want to stick with the Bellini, a delicious mixture of peach puree and sparkling wine invented by Harry's Bar in Venice. But there is nothing chancy about the service, which is always gracious and accommodating. And there is nothing chancy about the scene either; as far as I'm concerned, it is, all by itself, worth the voyage. Downtown  * 376 West Broadway, at Broome Street, SoHo, (212) 343-0999. Atmosphere: Uptown has invaded downtown in this restaurant where most men wear suits and all the women are gorgeous. Service: The tables are too small and the aisles are too crowded, but the waiters are very kind and do their best. Recommended dishes: Artichoke and avocado salad, fried calamari, pastas, tagliolini with ham and cream, carpaccio, semolina gnocchi, grilled chicken, grouper with cream and radicchio, calf's liver with onions.

No, it seems, they don't; the service was as nice on my last visit as it was  on my first, and despite the increasing crowd in the dining room, it was never loud or rushed or edgy. Aquagrill has the comfortable air of a neighborhood place. But while it may feel like the sort of restaurant that ought to be serving burgers and beer, the menu is refreshingly original. Devoted almost entirely to  fish, it offers unusual dishes like ""snail snaps"" (bite-size popovers holding a  single snail) and salmon in a falafel crust. For those who want something simpler, the kitchen will happily poach, grill or roast any of the offerings. ""I can't eat any dairy products,"" the man behind me said one day, ""and I'm allergic to fish. I don't want any wine in a sauce and I stay away from wheat products."" He seemed to have eliminated most of the dishes on the lunch menu, but the waitress was not fazed. She pointed to the dinner menu and said, ""Just tell me what you'd like to eat, and the chef will gladly make it for you."" He ordered grilled scallops and sniffed suspiciously at them when his meal came. He took a tiny bite. ""There's butter on this, I know there is,"" he said accusingly. ""It tastes too good."" ""I'll ask the chef,"" the waitress said pleasantly. She returned with a detailed recipe that did not include butter. ""Well,"" said the man grudgingly, ""your chef is very good."" The chef (and co-owner) is Jeremy Marshall, who has big ambitions. He bakes his own breads and serves them warm. He sends out a little amuse-gueule before each dinner, a thoughtful touch in a moderately priced restaurant. He has devoted one end of the room to a raw bar, and he and his wife, Jennifer, who runs the dining room, are passionate about bivalves. They offer a two-for-one deal on Pine Island oysters from 5 to 7 P.M. on weekdays. It's very convivial: people crowd around the bar, talking, eating oysters and drinking beer and wine. But although the iced clams and oysters are seductive, it is Mr. Marshall's menu that is most appealing. I like all the appetizers. The warm octopus salad is so well executed it is hard to believe this tender morsel could ever be tough. A mixture of mussels and snails comes with a fine potato hash; topped with fried leeks, it makes a very pretty dish. Tuna carpaccio is lovely, too, the fish with its peppered edges arrayed across avocados and onions. But of all  the dishes, I like the snail snaps best. A handful of the small, warm popovers are scattered around a leafy little salad, and even though I know they are there, each time I take a bite the garlicky snail in the center is a chewy surprise. Soups are also satisfying. The billi bi is classic, rich with cream, filled with mussels and sparked with saffron. Lobster and corn chowder is hearty and filled with flavor. My favorite main course is the salmon with the falafel crust. Triangles of peeled tomato and cucumber decorate the plate, and the fillet is perched on a bed of hummus. A lemony coriander vinaigrette adds the perfect bit of punch; it  is a wonderful dish. Many of the other fish are prepared with equal imagination. Halibut is paired with asparagus, and red snapper is surrounded by sesame-scented Asian vegetables. Grilled swordfish comes with sauteed broccoli rape, bacon and squares of polenta, a fishy riff on a B.L.T. Roasted cod is cooked with wilted spinach and tiny artichokes in a pungent caper butter. I like the original dishes that Mr. Marshall dreams up, but he also has a way with plain fish. One night I had slices of simply roasted tuna that were perfectly cooked. Paired with a fine side of spinach and a delicious yellow potato hash, it made a substantial meal. The potato hash is so good, in fact, that I have ordered it each time I have eaten at Aquagrill. I am impressed with the wine list, too. It was clearly chosen with a thought  for the food and an eye to the price. I especially like the appealingly crisp Menetou-Salon from the Loire Valley and the interesting array of pinot noirs that go well with fish. Desserts are homey and occasionally too sweet. My favorite is the all-American apple tart with cinnamon ice cream and caramel sauce. I am also   fond of the pineapple skillet cake with coconut milk sorbet. And for something simply refreshing, it is hard to do better than roasted grapefruit with pink grapefruit sorbet. But even if you don't order dessert, a little plate of cookies arrives with the coffee. Another nice touch. Aquagrill  ** 210 Spring Street, at Avenue of the Americas, SoHo, (212) 274-0505.

499,Onieal's Soho,1 star,"April 19, 1996",Ruth Reichl,SoHo,New American,https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/19/arts/restaurants-085405.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1996/04/19/arts/restaurants-085405.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Did you notice the woman with the cigarette? Many people did. And they were outraged. In a photograph that appeared with my restaurant review here on April 5, a cigarette was clearly visible. The letters poured in. ""I would rather,"" one reader wrote, ""cope with a surly waiter than with a cigarette at the next table."" I sympathize. On the other hand, I also understand why many restaurateurs would rather overlook a cigarette than have a confrontation. They are in an awkward situation. When a guest lights up in the dining room, most waiters close their eyes and hope nobody notices. Which brings us to Onieal's Grand Street. Smokers who are tired of being asked to put out their cigarettes flock to the restaurant, which is small enough for smoking to be legal. I've been there on nights when it seemed people were smoking with both hands, trying to make up for all those cigarette-free meals. Normally the smoke would keep me away. But Onieal's is such a beautiful restaurant that I keep being drawn back. I love the light in the place, and the  cozy feeling of the room. I love the warm wood on the walls and the fabric-covered banquettes. I love the elegant simplicity of the handmade lamps.  But most of all, I love the ceiling. Anyone would. It's a 19th-century wonder of carved mahogany and oak. Look up  and you see a big oval with devils dancing at the edges. And you do look up because the entire restaurant has been designed around that ceiling. My first meal at Onieal's was a quiet lunch last fall when the restaurant was so new it had not yet been discovered by smokers. Or for that matter, by anybody. We were the only customers. The chef was roasting beef and the smell drifted out from the kitchen, so maddeningly delicious that we ordered hamburgers and pork sandwiches and sat there, thinking that we had found a swell neighborhood restaurant. What a shock to return a week later and find the place filled with smoke and  noise and young investment bankers puffing cigars as they spooned beluga from a  gorgeous Art Deco server. At one table, 'll the women were dressed in black leather with shoelaces around their necks; at another sat four serious-looking men in suits. But no matter what they wore, everyone was eating serious-looking  food. The dinner menu is a mixture of the straightforward and the inventive. You can have a meal as simple as oysters and a mixed green salad followed by a grilled pork chop with apple and onion dressing. Or you can throw caution to the winds and start with tropical-fruit-braised-rabbit risotto and continue with crab cakes in a habanera lime emulsion. When the chef is at his best, both the simple and the complex foods are very  appealing. Although the risotto is mushy and muddy-tasting, many of the adventurous dishes are excellent: the crab cakes, for instance, are delightfully crisp and pleasantly peppery. And some of the seemingly simple dishes are more interesting than they sound. Roast chicken with mashed potatoes comes with a fine pasilla sauce that is bright and bracingly sharp. The chef, Gavin Citron, is an alumnus of Arizona 206, and he does wonderful things with peppers. A barbecued venison pot pie, for instance, is served in a little copper pot and topped with chili-spiced corn bread. Or try lobster fricassee in a sort of Thai coconut-curry sauce. But not everything is hot; his  ""noodles"" are made of beets that have been cooked and cut into long strips before being tossed with arugula and goat cheese. They're wonderful. So is the juniper-cured salmon with scrambled egg, capers and red onion. Occasionally the food seems too worked over. Grilled calamari, for instance,  comes stuffed with a sweet eggplant caponata and pine nuts in a charred tomato sauce with little fried tentacles on the side. The more restrained dishes are very appealing. Striped bass is light and pretty in a saffron broth with a potato-and-tomato gratin on the side. Breast of duck on a mixed-grain pilaf is straightforward and pleasant. Salmon in a slightly watery mushroom sauce is good, but it would be better if the sauce was  more concentrated. The food can be uneven. One night we had to send a strip steak back twice before it was cooked correctly, and another night the grilled pork chop was painfully dry. The cured salmon can be an exercise in saltiness. And onion rings were soggy and missing half their batter. But none of that kept me away. The smoking did. One night I returned from dinner smelling like an ashtray and decided I did not want to go back to Onieal's until the management did something about the atmosphere. Now it has. The owner, Chris Onieal, has installed a special, very expensive  filter system. I am happy to report that it seems to be effective. Still, if you're the sort of person who would rather not watch people smoke,  Onieal's is definitely not for you. ""I don't feel the least bit sorry for the people who feel forced out,"" said one of my favorite smokers as she settled onto a banquette and considered the fate of the nonsmokers. She lighted a cigarette,  exhaled a stream of smoke and added plaintively, ""There are so few places left for us."" Onieal's Grand Street  * 174 Grand Street, Little Italy, (212) 941-9119.

500,L'Absinthe,1 star,"Aug. 4, 1995",Ruth Reichl,Upper East Side,French,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/04/arts/restaurants-979795.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/04/arts/restaurants-979795.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"If you close one eye to the nearby television station as you approach L'Absinthe, it is easy to believe that you are in Paris. The specialties of the house are scrawled in white script on the outside walls and the doors are folded back to allow the tables to spill onto the sidewalk. Inside, the etched glass, mirrors, polished brass and ancient clocks give the restaurant the familiar warmth of a typical bistro. But there is a difference: the prices are lower than those at most modern Paris bistros. And the food is better. This is not as impressive as it sounds; the sad truth is that the great Paris bistro is an endangered species. Finding one requires research, advice and careful planning, and even then the results are often deeply disappointing. In that respect, L'Absinthe is very French; while the food is better than that of the average bistro along the banks of the Seine, the restaurant serves up its own set of disappointments. This is especially surprising because the chef is Jean-Michel Bergougnoux, the talented man whose American career has encompassed Le Regence, Lutece, Le Cygne and most recently Raphael. In May, he joined Jean Denoyer as a partner in Le Comptoir, and the two renamed the restaurant and changed the menu. Mr. Bergougnoux is working in a homier style than he used to; this is not a man from whom we have come to expect roast chicken. Sometimes this works. His saucisson chaud, generous slices of poached sausage paired with potatoes and lentils, is perfect French bistro food, the sort of dish that rosy-cheeked men sit down to eat in old French movies. And while I have never seen any of the Chanel-clad women who patronize the place eating the dish, they do seem to enjoy the plateau de fruits de mer. Who can blame them? The astonishing assortment of crabs, lobsters, crayfish, langoustines, oysters and clams is enough food to keep six people happily cracking shells for quite some time. At $8 a person, it is also a bargain. And for dessert, there is not a crisper, more buttery or better warm apple tart in all of New York. But why are the mussels, steamed with white wine, curry and chives, sometimes overcooked? Does the roast chicken need to be quite so forceful a reminder that American chickens don't have much flavor? And does the veal risotto really need to be quite so soggy? There have been nights when I imagined Mr. Bergougnoux, a chef I admire, back at the stove and bored to tears. The service has its moments, too. Le Comptoir had a devoted following, which seems thrilled with its successor. One night in May, our waiter was so busy greeting his old and valued customers that he barely had time for us. Between gushing ""You look wonderful, Mrs. So-and-So!"" and gushing ""How nice to see you, Mr. D!"" he managed to shout the specials at us and disappear. As the wait stretched on, he passed by occasionally to squeeze my shoulder and murmur soothingly, ""You're next."" The ultimate moment of the meal came when he delivered the final course with these unforgettable words: ""Yummy, yummy, yummy, this is good. Here comes dessert."" These nights, however, the service is impeccable. It is summer in the city, much of the Upper East Side has gone to the country and L'Absinthe has the leisure to be nice to us. Finger bowls arrive right behind the cold seafood, bread is endlessly passed, wine is punctiliously poured. And if you order just right, a meal here can be a true pleasure. Meals begin with tiny gougeres, peppery little cheese puffs that are absolutely irresistible when they arrive warm. As a first course, the saucisson chaud is unbeatable, and the salad of endive, Roquefort and smoked duck breast is very good. One night there was also a fine tomato tartar surrounded by sauteed chicken livers that tasted like France on a plate. But I have serious reservations about the terrine of foie gras, which is layered with portobello mushrooms. It looks very pretty but the mushrooms have an almost chalky quality that interferes with the smooth richness of the liver. The best of the main courses is the Moroccan-style salmon, the spicy, crusty fish served with couscous and preserved lemons. Loin of lamb is set on a rustic gratin of eggplant and zucchini that is deeply satisfying. The hanger steak with garlicky sauteed potatoes and a red-wine sauce is delicious. And if the roasted free-range chicken is something of a letdown, the accompanying potatoes mashed with chives and perfumed with hazelnut oil are not. Steak tartare, on the other hand, a fine mound of raw chopped meat, would be better without the pedestrian french fries and the too-fried greens on the plate. The potatoes were identifiable, but the oil-drenched leaves were not. Desserts, however, are always impeccable. The warm chocolate cake with the melting center may be a standard New York dessert, but it is well executed. The lemon tart is just as sour as it should be. Creme caramel is perfumed with fennel and lime, and the sorbets are truly fruity. None of them, however, can hold a candle to that apple tart. There are other pleasures here. A pleasant wine list. Good espresso. And the illusion of Paris, which you can hold onto until you get at least halfway down the block. L'Absinthe  * 227 East 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 794-4950. Ambiance: The former Le Comptoir has not changed; it is still a perfect re-creation of a French bistro. Service: Although generally very professional, the waiters tend to take care of longtime customers to the detriment of newer ones.

Wine list: The French and American list is short but beautifully chosen for this food, and it is fairly priced. Hours: Dinner only, from 6 to 11 P.M. Mondays through Saturdays; after Labor Day, dinner will be served on Sundays also. Price range: Appetizers $7.50 to $13, entrees $19 to $25.50, desserts $7.50 to $9. Credit cards: All major cards.

501,Savore,1 star,"June 2, 1995",Ruth Reichl,SoHo,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/02/arts/restaurants-003590.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/06/02/arts/restaurants-003590.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Surrounded by the murmuring Italian waiters, it is easy to get lost in this elegantly spare room. With my eyes on the muted yellow walls and my arms cooled  by the breeze, I imagine that Florence is just outside the long windows. Then a  woman goes to the pay phone near the kitchen and ruins the illusion. Her voice rises, becoming increasingly strident until the sound of her anger has invaded the serenity of Savore and booted me firmly into reality. The woman at the next  table adjusts the silver bracelets on her wrist, looks at the menu and asks: ""Wild boar? Have you ever eaten wild boar?"" The architect of this new restaurant in SoHo has eloquently captured the essence of an Italian trattoria. And the chef is trying to capture the essence of Tuscan Renaissance cooking, offering exotic dishes rarely found on New York menus. But here's the question: Is that possible? The cooking of Renaissance Florence was unlike anything we now think of as Italian food. Tomatoes were unknown in Europe until Columbus landed in the New World, and while the Florentines immediately took to beans (another New World import), it was more than 200 years before they developed a taste for tomatoes.  So it is unlikely that pappa al pomodoro, the first dish on Savore's menu, had a big following in Renaissance Tuscany. The version here isn't likely to gain much of a following either; pappa al pomodoro, a wonderful mush of bread, tomatoes and olive oil, is a great dish when made with first-rate, in-season tomatoes. At Savore, it is a pleasant but slightly dull dish. Tuscan cooking is characterized by quality and austerity. The cuisine is based upon excellent ingredients simply cooked. That is what makes Tuscan food so appealing and so hard to duplicate on foreign soil. Many of the dishes at Savore require ingredients that simply cannot be found in New York City. Consider the many boar-based dishes. Truly wild boar has a robust, gamy flavor that tends to dominate every dish it is in. But the boar that is available in New York is a tame creature with none of those characteristics. So  cinghiale alla maremmana (the marshlands of Maremma are famous for game animals  like wild boar) is not as exciting as its name, but merely a stew made of olives and what tastes like particularly tough beef. Budino di granturco in salsa cinghiale, a sort of timbale of polenta topped with boar sauce, turns into a pleasant but delicate little dish. And the ragu of wild boar is more notable for the lightness of the wide pappardelle noodles on which it is served than for the flavor of the sauce. No matter how they are topped, most of the pasta dishes are excellent. And reasonable; the most expensive is $12.50, a dish of silky spaghetti with half a  small lobster and some simple tomato sauce. Would people in 15th-century Florence have eaten this? No, but it is their loss. They did eat spaghetti alla  chitarra, dense strands of hand-cut pasta, although probably not tossed with basil and roasted tomatoes but with grated cheese, sugar and cinnamon. Still, this dish is good enough to make anyone, from any era, happy. A couple of the pastas are authentic Renaissance recipes. One is tagliolini,  delicate strands of pasta tossed with lots of butter and lemon, a rich and flavorful dish. Another is ravioli filled with ricotta, thinly sliced lemons and a bit of sugar. And if the tomato sauce atop the raviloi is a modern addition, so be it. I like many of the antipasti too. Rotolo di radicchio, leaves of grilled radicchio rolled around a filling of mozzarella, capers and anchovies, is strong and exciting. Alternating bitterness and brininess with the smoke from the grill, it is easy to imagine that this is an ancient taste. Monkfish with artichoke hearts is equally unusual. A pale green still life of artichoke hearts mounded with diced squares of fish and topped with olive oil, it is complex and compelling. Calamari is stuffed with a vegetable mixture, sliced into rounds and served rising from a sea of tomato sauce (again), looking like some great medieval creature. But many of the main courses are disappointing. Pigeon is boned and rolled, mixed with truffles, sliced and served in a wine sauce. A Renaissance dish in both texture and presentation, it would be great made with tasty pigeons and smoky truffles. But since none of the ingredients taste like much, it doesn't quite come off. Boneless pieces of chicken mixed with olives and rosemary also seem authentic, but the forceful flavors leave the poor city chicken in the dust. And cacciucco, like most of the fish soups served in New York Italian restaurants, is a bowl of red broth filled with mussels, mealy shrimp and bits of overcooked fish and perfumed more with garlic than with seafood. Pastry came late to Florence, but given the Tuscan taste for sugar, it was immediately popular. The desserts at Savore pay homage to the tradition; each is a fine sweet. My favorites were a fluffy lemon tart and a densely delicious bittersweet chocolate cake. When did chocolate arrive in Tuscany? I was wondering about that when the woman at the next table got up and started working the room. Listening to her loud, local voice, I realized that no matter how authentic the ambiance, it is impossible to bring a real Italian trattoria to New York City. And even more impossible to import one serving food from the 15th century. Savore  * 200 Spring Street, SoHo, (212) 431-1212.

502,San Pietro,0.75 star,"Jan. 27, 1995",Ruth Reichl,Midtown East,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/27/arts/restaurants-410195.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/27/arts/restaurants-410195.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"For at least some of this season, San Pietro, a wildly popular, two-and-a-half-year-old midtown sibling of Sistina on the Upper East Side, was decorated with baskets of eggplants and cauliflower and plates piled high with tomatoes. But something was wrong with the picture. Those tomatoes were plump and pale, and come to think of it, who wants to eat tomatoes in the middle of January? And wouldn't you think somebody might have remembered to take the cellophane off the cauliflower? Even though it was not straight from the farm, the illusion of freshness is always welcome. San Pietro, it turns out, is not in the illusion business. Nobody bothers to pretend that new customers are favored patrons, and the service is often perfunctory. After a few meals at the restaurant, I was not surprised to be kept waiting one afternoon while the coat-check woman had an argument on the pay phone. In exasperation I finally went in and grabbed my own coat; she didn't even deign to look up. It was pretty much what I had come to expect from the people who work at San Pietro. Consider my most recent dinner. We had asked for seats in the no-smoking section, which turned out to be a mixed blessing. On this particular evening, each of the tables in the more attractive front dining room seemed to be occupied by gentlemen smoking enormous cigars. Wreaths of smoke spiraled lazily into the air. It wasn't particularly appealing but the bare, crowded room behind the bar where we were seated had its own drawbacks. Too many diners were being served by far too few waiters. The servers went dashing busily about but they neglected to bring water, forgot to pour the wine, removed our first courses before we were finished, brought us food destined for other tables and finally delivered coffee we hadn't ordered. I have rarely felt less cared for. Still, I knew it wasn't personal; none of the other people in the crush around us were faring any better. The menu, which features dishes from the Amalfi coast near Naples, looked unusual and appealing. The endless list of specials -- much too long to remember -- sounded great too. So despite the lackluster service, I was hopeful. Especially after the arrival of bruschetta, crisply toasted slices of bread brushed with olive oil and topped with a good, garlicky mixture of tomatoes. Right behind them came skinny strips of fried zucchini, which turned out to be undercooked and faintly greasy. After that, it was pretty much downhill. Grilled porcini were soggy and limp and topped with shavings of tired truffles. Cauliflower salad, a dull blend of marinated cauliflower, onions and sun-dried tomatoes, tasted like a recipe that might have been printed in the Ladies' Home Journal in the 1950's. Grilled eggplant was not quite grilled enough, which gave it a rubbery character. And the pasta we tried was not much of an improvement. Tegole alla San Pietro, an unusual offering, turned out to be long, wide strips of fresh pasta tossed with carrots, artichokes, garlic and olive oil. It was tasty enough, but slightly greasy and unattractively gray. There was one shiningly delicious dish, a perfectly cooked grilled sea bass served with roasted potatoes and a huge heap of spinach. I liked the braised black sea bass, too, cooked with fennel and pungent red wine. Grilled John Dory was simple and enjoyable. But then the rabbit arrived, and it was awful; the poor animal had been cooked with sun-dried tomatoes, peppers and herbs until it was a tough, hard, unappetizing mess. And although a grilled chicken alla diavola was perfectly fine, we had turned cranky: the sheer effort of attempting conversation in the din had worn us out. Lunch a week later was a rather different experience. Arriving at 1:30, we were seated in the front room where, we were assured, the smoke would not bother us. It didn't. The waiter was charmingly solicitous as he recited an entire list of specials. They sounded good. They weren't. The low point was the risotto of the day, seafood. Its aroma preceded it, growing stronger as it approached. And then there it was, a mushy plate of rice filled with hard bits of octopus and squid, a few scallops and some unidentifiable fish. It was decorated with small, overcooked Manila clams, a couple of tiny green-lipped mussels and smack in the middle of the plate, a single wedge of one of those anemic tomatoes. The other special smelled better but tasted every bit as unpleasant. Doughy ravioli filled with a puree of broccoli rape were covered with a bland tomato sauce. The sauce wasn't wonderful, but the ravioli were so gummy that with your eyes closed you could not have said which was the pasta, which the filling. This spectacular repast was crowned by a dreary lemon pie and something advertised as a raspberry-filled vanilla pudding. There were raspberries; the pudding, however, was lemon. San Pietro clearly can produce good food: the many regular customers seem to know how to navigate the menu and each time I've been at the restaurant the food on all the other tables has looked better than mine. In the course of five visits, I had a few wonderful dishes. Fresh sardines, grilled and served with a small salad. Many fine pastas, including handmade fusilli with a lamb ragout and malloreddus, little multi-colored cones that are a specialty of Sardinia. Carpaccio was admirable, and once I had the best roast suckling pig I've had in New York City. And with the exception of a few undercooked vegetables, every dish I ordered from the grill was beautifully executed. The staff can also provide good service when so inclined. Unfortunately, it often isn't, especially in the back room. Maybe I've just had bad luck. Even so, the prices are high and the details sloppy. On my last visit, the cauliflower had disappeared: in its place was a bunch of broccoli rape still wearing a bright pink brand label.

503,Gigino,1 star,"Oct. 21, 1994",Ruth Reichl,TriBeCa,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/21/arts/restaurants-594091.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/21/arts/restaurants-594091.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Each time an Italian restaurant opens in New York City, the owners have to come up with a compelling reason for customers to patronize their establishment instead of the 2,200 other Italian restaurants in town. I don't think chocolate-covered eggplant quite works. When the owners of Positano decided to move their restaurant from the Flatiron district to TriBeCa, they kept the chef, Luigi Celentano, but changed the name to Gigino (pronounced jee-JEE-noh). They also changed the menu; one can only think that the inclusion of a dish like risotto with squid ink and raspberry juice is an attempt to convince potential customers that this is more than just another Italian restaurant. It certainly brought me through the door: I find it impossible to resist a dish like linguine with jellyfish. Having ordered the dish, however, I was doubly disappointed to discover that the jellyfish was little more than an interesting textural note in an otherwise unexceptional plate of pasta. And when the risotto with squid ink and raspberry juice did not turn out to be some fabulous culinary invention but even more horrible than I imagined it would be, I felt cheated. And so I settled into the cozy room, trying to enjoy the frank fakery that makes it look like a set for a play about happy peasants in a rustic Tuscan hall, and ordered the ordinary dishes. Unlike the place on Park Avenue South, Gigino has very reasonable prices and lovely service. ""How are you tonight?"" asked our waiter at my last dinner at Gigino. His accent was so rich and intriguing I began to ask inane questions about the food just to hear him speak. ""Ah, yes,"" he said, ""spaghetti del padrino is one of our finest dishes. The spaghetti is mixed with beets, escarole, garlic, olive oil and just a touch of anchovy. You must try it."" He went on to recommend the grouper sauteed with scallions, tomato and black beans in a voice so delicious that I ordered the dish, even though I knew it would be a mistake. It was; who ever heard of black beans on an Italian fish? He talked me into a pizza too, despite the fact that the last time I tried it the crust was flabby, almost soggy, and the cheese rubbery. It was this time, too. My guest and I consoled ourselves with a bottle of Jermann Vintage Tunina, a good wine and, at $40, a very good buy. As he set the appetizers before us, our waiter had the proprietary air of a cook. ""Look what I have made for you!"" his face seemed to say. ""You will be so happy!"" And I would have been had the grilled baby calamari, which was topped with bits of lemongrass, been cleaned just a little bit better and not arrived astride a mushy mound of couscous. I would have been more appreciative of the fried calamari if there had been a few tentacles mixed in with the rings of squid. And had the grilled vegetables been as flavorful as they were colorful, they would have made me happier. On the other hand, nothing I can think of could have made the cold, dull meats and cheeses on the antipasto plate appealing. The next course was an improvement: on the whole, Gigino's pastas are impressive. Spaghetti del padrino turned out to be as good as the waiter promised: a beautiful mix of colors and textures that tasted absolutely terrific. I'd go back for that. I would go back for the spaghetti with clams, too, an occasional special that is a lovely tangle of pasta, cockles, sliced garlic and parsley. And the bucatini all'amatriciana is an old-fashioned mix of tomatoes, pancetta, onions and cheese that has not lost its charm. But every entree I have tried has been disappointing. A veal chop, ordered on the rare side, was very cooked. Roasted free-range chicken was so sad and dry that even the valiant efforts of the onions, carrots and white wine with which it was cooked could not revive it. A special lamb roasted with red wine, agnello alla romana, was pleasantly flavored with anchovy, but the meat was stringy. The artichokes on the plate were very undercooked, not necessarily a bad thing except that their crisp greenness made them seem as if they belonged in a different dish. And chicken ""osso buco"" had only one redeeming feature: the little chicken ""shanks"" with their naked bones cost only $12. When Gigino is busy, the room can be so clamorous it is impossible to hear what your companions are saying, but as it begins to empty, the buzz dies down. In the calm, the pleasant service can be very relaxing. ""Do try the melanzane al cioccolata,"" urged the waiter with the interesting accent, admitting that he had learned English by listening to Shakespeare. Before I knew it, I had ordered the eggplant. I am fascinated by unusual desserts. I have eaten sweet spinach pies and liked them. I love goat cheese mashed with sugar, too. Still, even I would not normally order caramelized eggplant stuffed with mascarpone cheese and coated with chocolate. I took one bite. Then I took another. This is what I thought: This is not the worst thing I have ever eaten. The other desserts were less exotic and more appealing. Torta bebe was a sort of sweet custard cake with cherries. Tiramisu, never my favorite dessert, was about as good as it ever is. As for the pastiera, an Italian cheesecake, wouldn't you know that Gigino's version was dotted with barley and flavored with orange flower water? The cheesecake isn't bad. But like the other unusual dishes on the menu, it is not reason enough to choose Gigino over the other Italian restaurants in town. But then, the sweet service and reasonable pasta prices might be. Gigino * 323 Greenwich Street, TriBeCa, (212) 431-1112. Atmosphere: The former Tommy Tang's has been stripped down to the bare walls and given the air of a hokey, rustic Italian room. Service: Casual and pleasant. Recommended dishes: Spaghetti del padrino, spaghetti with clams, bucatini all'amatriciana, tiramisu. Wine list: The mostly Italian list has some big names, interesting selections and reasonable prices but it would be much more appealing if it included vintage years.

504,Le Colonial,2 star,"April 1, 1994",Ruth Reichl,Midtown East,Vietnamese,https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/01/arts/restaurants-640484.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1994/04/01/arts/restaurants-640484.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"The woman at the next table is wearing a hat. A black one that makes her look as if she left her horse at the door and strolled in after a ride around the plantation. She slides into her seat, takes a sip from her friend's glass and looks down at the menu. She smiles and says, ""Oh, I adore this!"" She says it in French. This does not distinguish her from the other people in the room, half of whom are speaking French. On an ordinary afternoon, Le Colonial looks like a lazy tropical restaurant and sounds like the Champs-Elysees. But it smells like something else: mingled with all that expensive perfume is the scent of lemongrass and coconut and crushed peanuts. On a good day, you can even detect the racy aroma of fried chilies. This oddly American combination of Eurochic and Indochina could be awful. It isn't. Somehow these overdressed women in this overheated atmosphere, these potted palms in this darkly shuttered room, create an ambiance that is very appealing. Le Colonial is fun. ""We have found our new place!"" cries a women at the next table, waving to her friends and calling for the hostess. They want to book the table for the next day and the next. ""We will come every day,"" she gushes. ""The food is delicious! And it has no calories!"" Is that why they are here? Perhaps; it is entirely possible to order a meal at Le Colonial that sparkles with flavor and has almost no fat. Vietnamese cuisine, as interpreted here, is sedate Asian fare that is more delicate than Chinese food, less spicy than Thai and notable mostly for its abundance of vegetables and its absence of grease. Goi cuon is a perfect example, salad that has been transformed into finger food. Lettuce, shrimp, bean sprouts, skinny slivers of rice noodle and herbs are wrapped up in sheets of rice paper. The compact little bundles are served with an aromatic peanut sauce on the side; you simply pick up a roll of salad and dip it into the sauce. I have had livelier versions of this dish, but I found this one very appealing. Spring rolls at Le Colonial are so delicate you tend to forget that they are fried. Once you have wrapped the crisp cylinders in leaves of lettuce, garnished them with sprigs of mint and cilantro and added a few slivers of carrot, each one seems more like a crunchy bite of salad than something doused with oil. The classic Vietnamese nuoc cham, a dipping sauce made of sugar, vinegar, lime juice, fish sauce, chilies and garlic, adds a bit of punch. It is no surprise to look over at the next table and find that the women have rolled up their silk sleeves and are dipping with gusto. When the banh cuon arrive they exclaim with delight. ""How pretty!"" they chorus, looking down at translucent little dumplings glistening beneath a scattering of chilies and cilantro. The menu translation, Vietnamese ravioli, does not do justice to these clear packets filled with bright flavors. They may be hard to snare with chopsticks, but the effort is rewarded: the dumplings, filled with chicken, shrimp and mushrooms, have a fresh, clean, mildly exotic taste. The waiter has steered my neighbors away from goi bo, which was, I think wise. The beef salad is the only really spicy dish I've had here. Rare slices of meat are sparked with lemongrass, basil and enough chili to make those who do not like hot food unhappy. I loved the dish, and I loved the fact that this salad is served with such a generous hand that it would make a substantial meal. A sweet, rich smell goes wafting past the table. I look up to see a plate of grilled spareribs passing by. The scents of lemongrass, garlic, chilies and pork linger in the air long after the plate is gone. The next table has suddenly become so quiet that I order some ribs for myself. They are good enough to stop conversation: fragrant, chewy and just lightly herbal. Steamed fish is also a conversation stopper. The preparation is simple, but the fish has been cooked with so many herbs, vegetables and spices that the flesh has absorbed a pleasantly savory taste. The flesh near the bone is especially sweet. But there are disappointments too. Goi du du, a classic salad made of green papaya, is soggy and dull. The best versions of this dish offer really crisp shreds of papaya mingled with coriander, roast peanuts and either pork or dried beef. Here the papaya is limp and the meat has been replaced by even limper shreds of chicken breast. I did not much like Le Colonial salad either, an odd combination of mesclun, daikon and pineapple. It is especially unappealing when you think about the other vegetables you could be eating: grilled eggplant in a spicy basil lime sauce, or bright, long pods of steamed okra that crunch slightly when you take a bite and could change forever your image of this often unappealing vegetable. At the next table, they end the meal with mangos and cups of Vietnamese coffee. At our table, we sip the last of the wine, a tart pink Domaines Ott rose that goes perfectly with this food and is extremely well priced. I know my neighbors will be coming back tomorrow, and for a moment I contemplate doing the same. I'd love to see what they'll be wearing.

505,Tang Pavilion,2 star,"March 18, 1994",Ruth Reichl,Midtown,Chinese,https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/18/arts/restaurants-500500.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1994/03/18/arts/restaurants-500500.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Why are there so many bad Chinese restaurants in New York? Blame it on the politicians. The first wave of immigrants from Southern China came to this country from the Pearl River Delta in 1848. The earliest to arrive were men who went to work in the gold mines, on the railroads and on farms, intending to send for their families once their fortunes were made. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 changed all that. Because subsequent immigration was all but prohibited, the first Chinatowns were largely bachelor societies. The men knew very little about cooking, but they yearned for the food of the villages they had left behind. They did their best to recreate it, and this clumsy cooking is what Americans came to know as Chinese food: sticky sweet-and-sour pork, leaden egg rolls, greasy chow mein. The first large group of women did not arrive until 1945, after the repeal of the Exclusion Act and passage of the War Brides Act. But the big change in Chinese cooking in America came in 1965 when the Hart-Celler Act changed the quotas, increasing Asian immigration and bringing an influx of Chinese chefs. In the meantime, several generations of Americans had grown up on a bad parody of a great cuisine. Americans have welcomed each new style of Chinese cooking, falling for the spiciness of Sichuan in the early 70's and the simplicity of Hong Kong cooking in recent years (courtesy of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which greatly increased the colony's quotas). Still, Americans remain lamentably wedded to old ideas. Most Chinese restaurants are so wary of American customers they don't even bother to offer them their best regional specialties. Which brings me to Tang Pavilion. Chinese friends kept insisting that this calm and lovely midtown restaurant served wonderful food. And yet the menu was filled with pedestrian dishes. There I sat, eating dreary Seafood Delight and Big Apple Chicken, watching elegant Chinese men eating what looked like elegant Chinese dishes. What was I doing wrong? I was not, it turns out, asking for the Shanghai menu. The cooking of Eastern China -- from cities like Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou -- is still relatively hard to find in the United States. It is a complex cuisine, much prized in China and quite different from the more familiar southern food. As soon as I found out that there was a special menu of Shanghai specialties, printed in English, Tang Pavilion was transformed for me. I discovered all the rich dishes I had seen on other tables. I immediately ordered a plate of drunken chicken and sat back to savor its deep, musky flavor. The chicken had been steeped in the local shao hsing wine until the flesh was silky and aromatic. It was a cool, simple but extremely satisfying dish. Next we had ""vegetable pie,"" a terrine made of many thin layers of dried bean curd. It was subtle, delicate, deeply delicious. Shanghai, which is famous for its vegetarian dishes, has devised hundreds of interesting ways to use bean curd. One of my favorite dishes at Tang Pavilion is green bean and tofu sheet: long white bands of almost translucent dried bean curd tossed with small bright green beans. The combination was fresh and light, like some delightful new take on pasta. Looking through the menu I spied baby eel, a famous Eastern Chinese dish. It must be eaten with great speed; as soon as the dish loses its heat it loses its appeal. Tang Pavilion's version was fabulous, a mixture of sweet, slender strips of eel, yellow chives and ginger. We followed it with hearts of Chinese cabbage steamed with velvety black mushrooms, a perfect end to the meal. There were even more interesting dishes on the menu, but they required advance notice. So a week later I gathered a group and returned for a feast. We began by nibbling on pickles: triangles of turnip marinated in sesame oil, chewy pieces of pressed bean curd, salty preserved greens. Peanuts sprinkled with shards of dried seaweed were impossible to resist. A beautiful plate of cold hors d'oeuvres contained more of that wonderful drunken poached chicken, long golden strands of jellyfish slicked with sesame oil and crisp curly strips of baby eel, a sort of elegant jerky. Soup was so potent and so fragrant that the scent preceded the tureen to the table. The aroma was chicken, but what you tasted was the salty-sweet flavor of shredded ham and the earthiness of black mushrooms. Nestled in the bottom of each bowl was a single delicate crescent of egg dumpling. The centerpiece of the dinner was braised duck stuffed with sweet rice, a masterpiece the color of mahogany. Soft enough to eat with chopsticks, this dish would make any meal into a banquet. It was so rich it was almost impossible to eat more than a couple of bites, so delicious it was hard to stop yourself from having more. Next there were fillets of yellow fish wrapped in sheets of bean curd and deep-fried. They crackled invitingly each time you took a bite. The crisp puffs of fish had a clean, fresh flavor that filled your mouth and then quickly vanished. One of the most famous Eastern dishes is named for a poet and statesman of the 11th century, Su Tung-po, who wrote the recipe in the form of a poem: Over a slow fire, with a little water, Simmer till soft A very good taste. The recipe has changed very little since then. The pork is braised in soy sauce, rice wine, sugar and ginger, then steamed until the flesh has the texture of butter. At Tang Pavilion the sweet, soft chunks of meat were stuffed into chewy white buns and turned into seductive little sandwiches. If this had been a Western meal, it would have been followed by salad. Being Chinese, there was the simplicity of bright green, quickly cooked pea shoots (dou miao) and small bowls of rice. As we sat sipping tea and eating fruit we wondered why all these dishes had been segregated on a separate menu. Was it because the waiters got tired of telling people, ""you won't like that"" when they tried to order sea cucumber (another wonderful Shanghai specialty that has the consistency of hard Jell-O)? Were they weary of warning diners about all the bones in stewed fish tail? Or does Tang Pavilion simply fear that its best dishes will not be appreciated by an American audience? Whatever the answer, the very fact that the Shanghai menu is printed in English is a hopeful sign. A few years ago, the menu would have been written entirely in Chinese characters. Times do change. Tang Pavilion ** 65 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 956-6888. Atmosphere: Spare, elegant and comfortable. Service: Professional and helpful; ask for advice.

506,Kang Suh Restaurant,2 star,"Oct. 22, 1993",Ruth Reichl,Koreatown,Korean,https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/22/arts/restaurants-351593.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/22/arts/restaurants-351593.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"When you walk into the room, your first impression is warmth and laughter. All around the restaurant, people are huddled over grills, drinking and talking and gesturing wildly as great gusts of fragrant steam go billowing toward the ceiling. Men scurry about with buckets of blazing coals, replenishing the fires at each table, and waitresses walk past bearing trays laden with vegetables as bright as jewels. The air smells of smoke and sugar and chilies and garlic, and the whole atmosphere is so inviting that you are irresistibly drawn into the center of the room. Why hasn't Korean food become more popular in New York City? This is a puzzle because of all the Asian cuisines, Korean is most accessible to the American palate. Long ago we rose above our distrust of garlic and began our continuing romance with Chinese cooking. Then we overcame our fear of raw fish and learned to love Japanese. When Thai food came along, it seduced half the country. But most of us have yet to discover Korean cooking, which offers a great many things we already love (beef, barbecue, the opportunity to graze) and presents very few obstacles. (Well, you do have to love garlic and chilies.) This may be because Koreans are perfectly content to keep their food to themselves. Walk along 32d Street between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas and you find a self-contained little neighborhood of shops, supermarkets and restaurants catering to a mostly Korean clientele. Even Kang Suh, which I have found to be the friendliest restaurant on the street, has a menu that is hard to navigate. Some of the dishes are translated; many are not. If you assume that you won't like the latter, you'll be wrong. Gul pajun is not translated on this menu, but I've never met anyone who didn't like the large floppy pancake full of oysters and scallions, which is one of Korea's most famous specialties. (At Kang Suh you'll find it on the fifth page of the menu, listed with the pan-fried dishes.) Among the world's most seductive dishes, gul pajun is as large as a pizza and comes cut into wedges, which you pick up in your fingers and dip into a piquant soy-vinegar sauce. If you don't like oysters, try the plain scallion pancake, pajun, or the seafood pancake, haemul pajun. In Korea, diners graze their way through every meal, moving across a landscape laden with bowls. Each meal begins with a multitude of side dishes; soon the table is covered with little bowls of kimchi (pickled vegetables) and namul (salad). At Kang Suh you never know what each day will bring, but there is always cabbage kimchi, the fiery chili-laden pickle that most people think of as the only kimchi. Actually, kimchi can be made of many vegetables; you might find kimchis made of cubed radish, cucumbers or turnips, and you might find that they include dried squid, little dried fish or even rich, chewy chunks of raw crab. Then there will be a few salads: almost always minarinamul, which is a refreshing watercress salad, and sometimes potato salad, startling in its familiarity. Usually there is some sort of shredded turnip, drenched in sesame oil and sprinkled with sesame seeds. These flavors -- some hot, some mild, some sour, some sweet -- offer a balance made of contrasts. Balance is the goal in a Korean meal. Kang Suh makes ordering easy by separating its large menu into categories. If you choose dishes from the different parts of the menu, you will end up with a meal of typical Korean variety. The barbecue is the most fun. First the coal man arrives and lifts your glowing fuel into the pit at the center of the table. Then the waitress appears with your meat: bul goki and kal bi (steak and short ribs) are the best known, but the adventurous might want to experiment with tripe, tongue or squid. She will also have platters of lettuce, dipping sauce and little pots of kochujang, a sweet red pepper paste that is one of the staple foods of Korea. The waitress puts the meat on the griddle with long tongs, but after that you're on your own. When the meat is cooked, you put a piece on a leaf of lettuce, spread it with a bit of kochujang, add a little rice and roll the whole thing into a neat bundle. It is entirely satisfying food. In Korea, nobody would make an entire meal of meat. They might alternate bites of barbecue with one of the so-called pan-broiled dishes. These are actually stir-fries; I particularly like o-jing ae bokum, or spicy squid, and duk bokum, an odd juxtaposition of sliced rice cake as bland as baby food with a sauce that is pure pepper. To temper these dishes, slurp a little bowl of naeng myon, long slippery buckwheat noodles in icy broth. Jap chae is also good as a fire-chaser; the clear noodles are stir-fried with little bits of beef and vegetables. Jap chae is listed in the section of the menu called side dishes. This is the most puzzling part of the menu because most dishes are not translated.  Here you'll find kalbi zim, the wonderful Korean beef stew, ribs braised in soy and sesame and ginger and spices until the meat falls from the bone. And mandu, the ravioli of Korea, which makes perfect little pauses between bites of spice. For the final dish, look at the section of the menu called chef's specialties. The list is long and varied, but virtually everything here is a soup. Korean chefs have more interesting ways with tofu than almost anybody else; try doo boo jigae, bean curd floating in an aromatic and very spicy broth. Or soon doo boo jigae, which is made from soft tofu, each curd as tender and enticing as a just-poached egg. And I almost always order a bowl of jo gae tang, a simple soup made of large steamed clams that has a clean and refreshing character. By now the fire is out, the last crunchy bits of meat have been eaten, and you are left with just a few sultry bites of kimchee. Wash it down with soju, the refreshingly sweet vodka made from sweet potatoes, and a bite of orange. Then go out into the raucous streets, the sweet smell of garlic and sugar and chilies still clinging to your hair, grateful that this restaurant is always open. Kang Suh   ** 1250 Broadway, at 32d Street, Manhattan, (212) 564-6845 Atmosphere: Smoky, unadorned, very casual.

507,Orso,2 star,"June 4, 1993",Bryan Miller,Clinton,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/04/arts/restaurants-180393.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/04/arts/restaurants-180393.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Like a long-running Broadway show, Orso has remained vital and fresh despite many cast changes over the years. This offshoot of the Joe Allen empire opened in 1985 when Restaurant Row on West 46th Street seemed headed toward gastronomic senescence. Almost single-handedly, Orso brought back the Broadway movers and shakers, instilling new life into the block. Orso's step-down main dining room is dominated by a high arching skylight that creates a cheerful, sunny setting at lunch; in the evening it creates a sense of spaciousness. Soft ocher tones and wood trim contribute to a casual, contemporary setting. Walls are covered with publicity photographs of sports and entertainment celebrities. In the back an open tile-and-steel kitchen churns out pizzas, pastas and appealing grilled fare. Orso's service style can be off-putting. If you order wine, a waiter or waitress brings it, removes the cork, plops the bottle on the table and leaves. Self service, they say. A waiter explained that management feels this adds an easygoing ""trattoria feeling"" to the dining room. This laid back attitude extends to servers not knowing who gets what dishes at the table, neglecting to refill water glasses and starting housecleaning while some customers are still in the room. Notwithstanding these lapses, the staff more often than not is good natured, helpful and hard working. The changing menu carries nearly a dozen starters, a selection of small pizzas and a blend of North Italian pastas and entrees. The pizzas are still winners, thin-crusted, crisp and fresh. Among the better ones are those topped with Italian sausage, onions, mozzarella, Parmesan and tomato sauce; and eggplant, spinach and provolone. Fried calamari is hardly worth leaving ""Guys and Dolls"" early for: more spongy than crisp, they get lost in a big green salad. Lentil and spinach soup is better, thick, herby and nicely textured, as is the wonderful smoky potato and cabbage soup. A Neapolitan-style starter of baked eggplant was soothing and tasty, too, essentially a sandwich of sliced eggplant, molten ricotta and sliced tomatoes. Pastas are still a big draw. A lusty Mediterranean composite of shell pasta with black olives, tomatoes, green beans and garlic was tantalizing. So, too, were fusilli with eggplant, pancetta, onions, tomato, mozzarella and onions. Taglierini is a summer winner, tossed with garlic, olive oil, broccoli rape, fava beans, olives and pecorino. One of the best pastas sampled lately was a homey blend of tagliatelle in a veal stew sauce along with Italian sausage, asparagus and Parmesan. Orso has a sensible wine list that matches the food well. Whites begin at $16 and gradually ascend to $38; reds start at $15 and reach $43. Plenty of good selections are available for under $25. Main courses are not so steady as starters. Sauteed sweetbreads with artichokes were as bland as white bread and had a similar texture. An overcooked halibut steak could not be rescued by summery tomato-and-black-olive sauce, and roast pheasant one evening was paper dry. Snapper, on the other hand, arrived perfectly cooked and enlivened with sun-dried tomatoes, garlic and white beans. Garlicky sauteed spinach has an invigorating douse of fresh lemon. One of the best seafood dishes is charred jumbo shrimp, sweet and smoky at the same time, with white beans and garlic. Grilled chicken with eggplant and broccoli rape makes for a light, satisfying lunch, as does grilled swordfish with orzo-and-vegetable salad. When the menu offers spicy sausages it means it: the lean, pepper-laced sausages are accompanied by fire-dousing polenta, olives and roasted sweet peppers. A dessert that is making the rounds in Italian restaurants these days is risotto rice pudding, often made with Arborio rice. The effort was in vain, however, for the texture was glutinous and the flavor nondescript. Better choices are the fresh figs mired in vanilla custard, Amaretto cake with brandy-laced mascarpone and mixed berries, or well-made zabaglione with sliced bananas. Orso is hardly a flawless restaurant. But what it lacks in consistency it makes up for in verve and lack of pretension. After eight celebrity-packed years, that is nice to see.

508,Il Mulino,2 star,"June 19, 1992",Bryan Miller,Greenwich Village,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/19/arts/restaurants-057092.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/19/arts/restaurants-057092.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Let the rakish trattorias around town get all the fashion plates and media mentions. Night after night, Il Mulino is packed more tightly than the box seats at Shea Stadium. And what is this unassuming 11-year-old place's enduring appeal? Certainly not the decor. Il Mulino is a nondescript place with crepuscular lighting, a small bar up front and tables close together in its small wallpapered dining room. The last time Il Mulino was reviewed, in 1988, management had an arrogant habit of making nearly everyone wait 15 minutes or more for a table, even with confirmed reservations. Happily, that seems to have stopped. Il Mulino is not for the itinerant trend-chaser. It attracts conservatively dressed, solid citizens with substantial appetites and incomes to match. While the food is always gratifying, there is another irresistible appeal here. The staff ingratiates itself with customers by serving awesome quantities of food that could make an Italian grandmother look stingy. Before you have a chance to unfold your napkin, waiters charge over with platters of delicious peppery fried zucchini and slabs of toasted Italian bread smothered with minced garlic, chopped basil and tomatoes. Then come slices of richly marbled salami and a plate of zesty marinated mussels. Just as you are contemplating making a meal out of the freebies and calling it a night, a straining waiter hauls over a block of Parmesan the size of an air-conditioner and gouges out a big chunk. ""Now,"" says a beaming captain, ""are you ready to hear the dinner specials?"" The most impressive aspect of the specials is the captain's ability to remember them all, and with such gesticulating drama. My eyes glazed over after 18 dishes. Add to that nearly 60 items on the regular menu, and you need a lap-top computer to keep track of it all. ""Oh, yes,"" the captain adds as an afterthought. ""If there is any other dish you would like, just tell me and we'll make it for you."" Il Mulino is not a spot for cutting-edge cuisine, but many of the old standards are performed with zeal. Baked clams oreganato, for example, that war horse of the cocktail party circuit, are light, fresh and aromatic with herbs. A special of shrimp sauteed with garlic is equally well turned out, as is the lean, semi-dry bresaola set over salad greens in vinaigrette. Pastas may be the best way to start, although what Il Mulino calls half-portions is called family style elsewhere. Capellini all'arrabbiata is a paragon: al dente pasta with a spicy but not fiery sauce and a perfect balance of tomato and garlic. Also good is pappardelle with a pure, bright sauce of ripe tomatoes and basil. The only letdown was a bowl of angel hair pasta in a flat-tasting chicken broth. Risotto here is as refined as you'll find in town; particularly pleasing is the wonderfully textured rendition with porcini and Parmesan. Plenty of gutsy wines are available to go with this lusty food. But it would be nice to see a broader selection under $25. A house favorite entree is osso buco, which must come from a calf of staggering proportions. The shank meat, lean but remarkably tender, is paired with a creamy risotto redolent of saffron. A monstrous veal chop is of unassailable quality, but it could use salt or other seasonings to complement the fresh sage leaves over it. Veal medallions with artichoke hearts and mushrooms were terribly dry on a first sampling, near perfect a week later. One can get a good crusty sirloin steak here or tender fillets of beef in a muscular red wine sauce with shallots and sage. The best poultry dish combines chicken pieces on the bone with artichokes, garlic, sausage and white wine. Among seafood main courses, a worthy special of salmon is reminiscent of a popular dish at Harry Cipriani in midtown. The fillet is seasoned, covered with zucchini ""scales"" and roasted. Declining dessert at Il Mulino is about as easy as persuading a Marine drill sergeant to let you doze an hour later in the morning. The sweets arrive whether you ask for them or not. ""The chef wants you to taste this,"" our waiter offered. Mascarpone and ricotta cheesecake is sublime, minimally sweet and crumbly. Tiramisu is drenched in Kahlua, and hence just sweet. Lemon sorbet served in a hollowed-out lemon and velvety chocolate mousse cake are much better. Then there is the histrionic citrus dessert in which a captain spends 15 minutes surgically dissecting an orange, then dousing it with Grand Marnier. Il Mulino is an alimentary orgy of classical proportions. To some the portions may seem profligate, even offensive. Yet it is obvious that beneath this gesturing is a quality establishment, and a most genial one at that. More risotto, anyone? Il Mulino ** 86 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 673-3783. Atmosphere: Dim, crowded, unprepossessing dining room. Service: Congenial, helpful, professional.

509,Da Umberto,2 star,"Aug. 30, 1991",Bryan Miller,Chelsea,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/30/arts/restaurants-884791.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/30/arts/restaurants-884791.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"From the outside, Ristorante da Umberto, hidden on an inconspicuous block off the Avenue of the Americas, has all the charm of a plumbing supply outlet. As you pass through the two glass doors, though, you encounter one of the most animated dining scenes to be found in this languorous summer. Da Umberto is the kind of low profile place that is fueled by steadfast repeat clientele. My four visits revealed why. Da Umberto has two spare but attractive dining rooms with soft gold-yellow walls, indirect lighting and a wall covered with wine racks. The front room, with a long bar, is noisier than the back room, which faces the glass-fronted kitchen. Much of the noise seems to float up to the high ceiling, however, resulting in a tolerable background hum. With its sharp, congenial waiters and stylish crowd, da Umberto exudes a bustling elan that is fun to experience. The menu, I should say the written menu, is merely a token, something for you to hold as the waiter plunges into his 10-minute dissertation on the nightly specials. If our waiter on a recent visit had not been so earnest (""Tonight we have wild duck in red wine, roast pheasant. . . .), his performance would have been a great parody. The specials went on forever (""pappardelle sauce Bolognese, tagliatelle. . . .) and then some. I enjoyed watching my dinner guests' eyes glaze over (""the fish specials are. . . .) and their heads bow in resignation as he droned on (""If you like veal, we have. . . .). This practice, which is annoying and a supreme waste of time, prevails in a number of restaurants, despite objections from customers. A simple printout would be so much easier. Good bresaola with sliced artichokes, crostini and salads are available as starters, although pastas are so good and ample you should go with half portions of those. Pansotti, little half-moon ravioli stuffed with radicchio and in a grainy walnut sauce, was extraordinary. Penne came with a lusty and well- seasoned Bolognese sauce, but the pasta was undercooked. Rigatoni all'amatriciana was exemplary, perfectly balanced with tomato, pancetta, garlic and onion; so, too, was the simple but explosively fresh orecchiette with radicchio and tomato. A special starter one evening was described as eggplant stuffed with ground Italian sausage, ground sweetbreads and herbs. What arrived was an elegant eggplant canoe filled with mostly sausage; not bad, but not what I had expected. The copious antipasto selection on display in the dining room is worth exploring: roasted peppers, marinated artichokes, marinated mushrooms, grilled radicchio, cauliflower, chick pea salad, grilled eggplant, fried zucchini and more. Da Umberto has a well-conceived and adequately sized wine selection, with good options starting in the high teens and low 20's. One clean and refreshing white wine bargain that goes well with this food is the Ruffino Libaio for $20; another is the elegant Voellenzer Sauvignon Blanc ($26). Among reds, good deals are the Ceretto Barbaresco Asij ($30) and the Voerzio Dolcetto ($24). There is something for every taste among the main courses. Among my favorites are the nicely charred, firm and fresh grilled sweetbreads flavored with vodka and rosemary. I don't know what role the vodka plays, but they are delicious.  Grilled, zestily spiced Cornish hen is a sure bet, as is remarkably tender osso buco with a strained vegetable sauce and triangles of moist polenta. Wild Muscovy duck is rich and assertive. It deserves a better sauce, though, than the port, white wine and tomato it comes with. A quality breaded veal chop under a salad and balsamic vinegar is a pleasing seasonal dish. Skate, the sinewy firm fish that has finally earned the respect of American chefs, is lustrous in an herb broth with black olives and herbs, while salmon is splendid with a delicate mustard sauce.  One of the most popular dishes, judging from nearby tables one evening, is half a steamed lobster with a claw the size of a wall phone, flanked by scallops, shrimp and clams, all in a garlicky tomato sauce. The pastry chef evidently never heard of cholesterol. His cart sags under a strawberry studded napoleon that packs enough cream to support a couple of upstate New York dairy farmers. The lemony ricotta cheesecake is moist and crumbly, while the chocolate mousse cake is outrageously rich but just ordinary tasting. Chocolate fiends should aim for the chocolate bombe, and brace themselves for a nuclear sugar rush. Actually, there is one mixed fruit tart that, to my taste, was excessively sweet. Cheese aficionados will find a small but well-maintained selection. To finish off the meal, there is serious espresso, something that is not easy to come by these days. Da Umberto has been gaining speed and strength since it opened four years ago. For its rakish scene and restorative cuisine, it can be strongly recommended. Ristorante da Umberto  ** 107 West 17th Street, Manhattan, (212) 989-0303. Atmosphere: Bustling, animated dining rooms; moderately noisy. Service: Sharp, professional and congenial. Recommended dishes: Antipasto plate, pansotti stuffed with radicchio in walnut sauce, penne with Bolognese sauce, rigatoni all'amatriciana, orecchiette with radicchio and tomato, grilled sweetbreads with vodka and rosemary, grilled Cornish hen, osso buco, skate with black olives, salmon with mustard sauce, lobster with shellfish in tomato sauce, veal chop with salad, chocolate bombe, strawberry napoleon, ricotta cheesecake.

510,Cafe Un Deux Trois,1 star,"April 5, 1991",Bryan Miller,Times Square Theatre District,French,https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/05/arts/restaurants-215891.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/05/arts/restaurants-215891.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Raoul's For all those nouveau bistros striving to stay above water for more than three American Express statements, Raoul's is a paradigm -- 15 successful years of cassoulet, Cotes-du-Rhone and cigarette smoke. What makes Raoul's thrive while so many others tremble? After three recent visits, the answer seems to be a genuine feeling of neighborhood, an affable staff and better-than-average food. Raoul's is owned by Serge and Guy Raoul, who also own the recently opened Raoul's Brasserie and Grill on Varick Street. The original restaurant, tucked away on cluttered Prince Street, looks as if it could have been there since Tammany Hall days. The barroom up front has a black stamped-tin ceiling, an Art Deco wooden bar and a row of candlelit cafe tables in front of long black banquettes. The French garage-sale wall decorations include sundry mirrors, posters and even an antlered buck's head. To reach the dining room, you go past a fish tank with a submerged Statue of Liberty. To reach the nonsmoking skylighted back room, you traverse the steamy kitchen, nodding good evening to the toiling cooks. The traditional bistro menu is scrawled on a little chalkboard that should come with little flashlights. Fresh asparagus is sprinkled with a good vinaigrette and garnished with confetti of red peppers; leeks vinaigrette are pleasing, too, served with tomatoes and black olives. Another salad combined chilled sweetbreads with tomatoes and greens in a mayonnaise dressing. This drew a split decision at my table -- cold sweetbreads are not my idea of a delicacy, although several others at my table liked them. Wellfleet and Belon oysters were fresh but served indifferently on a metal tray with no ice, allowing them to get warm quickly. Two of the better starters were a casserole of chanterelles, pleurotes, cepes and oyster mushrooms sauteed with white wine and a touch of cream, and buttery, Armagnac-tinged goose foie gras ringed by a full-flavored gelatin. The wine list carries ample quality selections at good prices to go with any of these starters. Servers, who know both the food and wine well, are not as keen on cleaning tables between courses or removing empty bottles. For main courses, cruise in the bistro mainstream and chances are you will do well. Broiled salmon with a good bearnaise was faultless, as was thick tuna steak stippled with black pepper and cooked perfectly rare in the center. The steak au poivre I had was not the most tender piece of meat ever to hit a pan, but it had plenty of flavor, a good sturdy pepper sauce and crispy french fries. Rack of lamb au jus was buttery and delicious with little potato fritters and julienne of zucchini and carrots. While most seafood dishes were recommendable, the same cannot be said for the dryish swordfish crowned with a tart disk of goat cheese, a combination that escapes me. More harmonious are the firm-fleshed cobia (also known as ling) from gulf waters or sauteed cabillaud (fresh cod) garnished with citrus slices and basil butter. Veal chop forestiere replete with morels was flat tasting for lack of salt. Don't bother with the sour rhubarb puree, the bland apple tart or the flossy raspberry mousse in a chocolate shell. The thin lemon tart is citric and fresh, and chocolate Bavarian cake is unremittingly rich. Raoul's may not be the most refined bistro in town, but its elan is palpable. Anyone feels right at home there, which is partly the definition of a good bistro. Cafe Un Deux Trois New York City, with its frenzied late-night scene, seems ideally suited for that casual French agora known as the brasserie, where food of all sorts can be had around the clock in a wide open, convivial setting. Aside from the 24-hour Brasserie on East 53d Street, though, no such prominent place exists. Cafe Un Deux Trois, the 14-year-old French restaurant in the Broadway theater district, resembles many timeworn brasseries in Paris, although it is not one in practice. It is a vast space with a faux antique look achieved through deliberately chipping mustard-colored paint, marbleized columns, crumbling walls and trompe l'oeil murals. Tables are draped in paper and come with glasses of crayons. This is not the best place to conduct business, for the din can be nettlesome -- but hundreds come daily to do just that. Servers, who are generally nimble and efficient, sometimes get distracted. For as long as I have been frequenting Cafe Un Deux Trois, I have found several dishes to be reliable. One of the better steak tartares in town is served here, the meat of impeccable quality and mildly piquant with Tabasco. Steak au poivre is always pleasing, too. The cream-tinted peppercorn sauce carries a good kick of pepper and a sweet blush of brandy. Coq au vin comes with a moist leg of chicken, breast meat, carrots and mushrooms in an herby broth. And fans of tripe will enjoy the version here with tomatoes, garlic, boiled potatoes and deep-fried parsley. Couscous on the current menu comes out in a wheelbarrow portion, but generosity is all it has going for it. The meats are dry and the grain is beyond rescue from the broth served on the side.  At lunch recently, penne with salmon, tomato and fried parsley was unpleasantly pinguid; better was a room-temperature chicken salad combining eggs, potatoes in vinaigrette and marinated cucumbers. Seafood is usually a 50-50 bet here.  Broiled salmon recently was inedibly dry, while fried calamari on the appetizer list was deliciously crisp and tender. Other good appetizers are the big meaty baked mussels swathed with bread crumbs, and the lean, delicately smoked salmon with capers and onions.  I have never seen the Thai specialty beef sate in a French restaurant, and now I know why. Rather than being a bite-sized morsel of grilled beef on a skewer, these monsters required a knife and fork to eat -- ""Texas sate,"" quipped a co-eater. They were tasty, though, especially with a sweet peanut sauce. Another Oriental inspiration, pork-stuffed dumplings redolent of fresh ginger, was tantalizing with its garlic-soy dipping sauce. Pre-made Caesar salad, though, was sodden and tasteless. Cafe Un Deux Trois has a small but wide-ranging wine list with plenty of selections in the 20's. An upbeat way to end a meal here is with a walnut cookie basket holding cut-up strawberries and pineapples with vanilla ice cream and hot chocolate sauce. Profiteroles are run-of-the-mill.  The charlotte with strawberries, cream, chocolate mousse and creme anglaise can send you home with a smile. Cafe Un Deux Trois remains one of the more diverting, drop-in spots in the theater district. It's good enough, and reasonably priced enough, to keep them coming back. And that's what they have been doing for 14 years. Raoul's (*) 180 Prince Street in SoHo, (212) 966-3518. Atmosphere: Agreeably timeworn ambiance, with black stamped-tin ceiling and cafe tables.

511,Les Halles,2 star,"Feb. 15, 1991",Bryan Miller,Kips Bay,French,https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/15/arts/restaurants-922491.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/15/arts/restaurants-922491.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"Les Halles Since leaving the struggling dining room in the Peninsula Hotel two years ago to go out on their own, Max Bernard and Jean-Michel Diot have had a golden touch. First they opened the unremittingly popular Park Bistro on Park Avenue near 28th Street with a third partner, Philippe Lajaunie; November saw the debut of Les Halles just across the street, a combination boucherie and casual restaurant specializing in gutsy French meat dishes. The owners spend much of their time loping across Park Avenue to check on their establishments. Without question, they are the most fervid jaywalkers in town. It is not easy to absorb all of the interior details at Les Halles, for every time I go there it is packed tighter than an Iowa holding pen. A little tiled butcher shop is up front, and just behind is the bar, where chances are you will spend 10 to 20 minutes waiting for a table -- the booking system needs work. The lofty space has a Parisian feel, elaborate wood molding, off-white walls, tulip sconces that cast soft light, tables draped in butcher paper, and the odd juxtaposition of charcuterie posters paired with black and white photos of the comedic French actor Fernandel. This is not a place for confidential business lunches, as tables are practically glued together and the noise can be nettlesome. Patrons come to Les Halles for the cooking not the comfort. You can start with a salad of duck confit -- not a buttery, falling-off-the-bone confit but flavorful nonetheless -- with chicory; a tangle of leeks in a good mustardy vinaigrette; lean pork sausage and deliciously vinegared green lentils, or any of the superior terrines, like duck with prunes. One Provencal dish that has become popular in New York City in recent years is brandade de morue, which traditionally is a puree of desalinated salt cod, milk, potatoes, garlic and olive oil. The version prepared by the Portuguese-born chef, Jose de Mereilles, contains hardly any milk, thus is lighter than most versions. It is no less appealing, though. The mostly French service staff has the snappy efficiency of Parisian brasserie waiters -- and they need it here. The wine list at Les Halles is a delight, not only for its sensible prices but also for delightful little-known country wines like Bourgueil ($16), Chateau Aiguilloux from Cahors ($14) and Vidal-Fleury from Vacqueyras ($20). Any of these reds would go splendidly with the earthy and well-seasoned boudin noir (blood sausage) with sauteed apples and soothing mashed potatoes, or the thin-sliced, well-seared bavette (flank steak), which is juicy and full of flavor. It came with superior french fries. One of the special French portions of meat served here is called onglet, or hanger steak, a sinewy cut from around the diaphragm. When onglet is aged well and cooked properly, as it is here, it can be wonderfully moist and toothsome. Any bistro like Les Halles has to serve cassoulet, and the one here -- made with garlic sausage, duck confit, pork and white beans -- is a bit on the dry side but rich in flavor. Rotisserie-cooked chicken is tasty and moist with its herb juices, although the french fries with it were soggy. An order of sauteed vegetables on the side was tasteless, too. Fans of tripe will swoon over the wonderful Portuguese-style preparation here, served in a cavernous crock along with cumin, chorizo, boudin noir and bacon. Desserts, appropriately, are reserved here. The delicate creme caramel is suitably light, and apricot-custard tart won't tilt the scales unduly. A semisweet chocolate mousse may be too fluffy for chocoholics, so they should opt instead for the denser chocolate tart. Heaping portions, consistent quality and a dynamic setting make Les Halles a happy eaters' place. It may not top the American Heart Association's dining-out list for convention week in New York City. Just as well -- there'll be more seats for us. Petrossian For much of its six years, Petrossian has been primarily a sumptuous caviar palace and only secondarily a restaurant -- and a tentative one at that, often lacking direction and consistency. All of that changed last year with the arrival of Marc Salonsky, a Brooklyn-born veteran of La Varenne in Paris, and in New York City, Le Regence and the Sign of the Dove. Now Petrossian can be recommended for more than just blinis and beluga -- although those are still nothing to scoff at. The dining room is an Art Deco fantasy, with its long marble bar facing mirrors engraved with Erte etchings, rose-tinted Italian marble floors, crystal chandeliers, a kid-leather-lined banquette and romantic lighting. At the entrance is a shop that sells Petrossian products like foie gras, caviar and smoked salmon. Those are for the way home, though. First you can sample the products on the menu. One good starter on the dinner menu is thin slices of glistening sea scallops nested on mixed greens and garnished with invigorating salmon roe. A similar dish on the lunch menu, made with sliced scallops, salmon roe and olive oil, had so much lemon juice on it that all else was nullified. All of the caviar can be recommended. Those on a budget might try blinis with pressed caviar, which is made from the damaged or softer sturgeon eggs. They are pressed together and salted to resemble a thick marmalade. Ratatouille-filled ravioli got a boost from fresh thyme and a heady lobster sauce, and all three soups on the menu are well seasoned and built upon sturdy stocks: borscht with pirogi, mussel with vegetables, and rosemary-infused shrimp soup.  The shrimp soup is astoundingly good, a velutinous shellfish-cream base perfumed with fresh rosemary and served with two skewers of perfectly broiled shrimp. Servers at Petrossian, wearing spiffy blazers with company logos and red ties, look like members of a college glee club. They go about their ministrations with grace and efficiency. As for the wine list, it is strictly for the beluga crowd, beginning in the high 20's and rising faster than a Patriot missile. Mr. Salonsky has a light, deft touch with seafood.  One of the best main courses is seared fillet of salmon, still rosy in the center, with a grainy mustard sauce and surrounded by smoked salmon ravioli. Halibut is another winner, moist and well seasoned, garnished with a slice of smoked salmon and adrift on a zesty fennel puree aromatic of tarragon oil. The technique of encasing fish in potatoes remains in vogue as evidenced from the lightly smoked salmon and salad greens between crispy potato pancakes -- a sprightly textural combination. The strategy does not work as well with lobster and leeks, however, for the pancakes were flaccid and the lobster chewy. Caviar finds its way into a dish of nicely roasted red snapper, presented with a warm potato salad and light cream sauce stippled with pressed caviar. And both pressed caviar and salmon roe elevate roasted monkfish with a lobster consomme and herb sauce. Another monkfish preparation, featuring a marjoram-caper sauce, came out unpleasantly acrid. On the other side of the menu, grilled quail with shiitake mushrooms over vermicelli was a harmonious combination, as were tender veal medallions with a carrot puree and marjoram sauce. Loin of lamb with a potato-turnip puree and brussels sprouts is a homey delight. And roast chicken with sun- dried tomatoes is moist and crisp-skinned, but it is spoiled by an avalanche of greasy fried onions. Desserts are fittingly regal here. If they have it, don't miss the extraordinary banana napoleon, a tower of puff pastry, banana slices and whipped cream in a pool of warm caramel. Chocolate macadamia torte with raspberry sauce is crunchy and irresistible, and creme brulee is as refined as you will find it anywhere. Another superb special is the apple-pear pithiviers with a warm, puffed crust and vanilla ice cream. The current regime has given Petrossian the depth and diversity that it lacked.

512,Trattoria dell'Arte,1 star,"Jan. 20, 1989",Bryan Miller,Midtown,Italian,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/20/arts/restaurants-617989.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/20/arts/restaurants-617989.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"One-shtick restaurants, like one-shtick comedians, can be amusing for a while, but their routines soon wear thin. That was my impression after repeated visits to Trattoria dell'Arte, a restaurant designed by Milton Glaser with an anatomical theme that is about as subtle as Pee-wee Herman. At first the loud (aurally and visually) peach-toned main dining room adorned with giant renderings of everything from noses to derrieres was fun, even though the lighting was harsh. But on subsequent visits the art, like a bad comedian, just didn't let up. The oversize drawings do not adorn, they attack. And the colors - a smaller side dining room is sort of an eerie chlorophyll shade - seemed more suited to interrogation that dining. An upstairs dining room, which is comfortable except for its oppressively low ceiling, is a virtual nasal hall of fame, with sketches of famous proboscises, from Joe DiMaggio's to Mussolini's. It is the food, not art, though, that is of primary concern here, and some of it is worth highlighting. Shortly after being seated, you are presented with a big silver tray of savory-looking appetizers. This is the antipasto platter, which waiters promote with such zeal that I began to suspect they receive bonuses for each one sold. That aside, the $8.50 platter, which easily feeds two, carries some tasty morsels: a delicious white-bean-and-shrimp salad, baby artichokes with olive oil, well-seasoned grilled eggplant, sauteed broccoli rape, zesty caponata, sheets of prosciutto wrapped around thin breadsticks, and more. The Caesar salad is freshly prepared but so showered with Parmesan that you barely taste the anchovy or garlic. The thin-crusted pizzas sampled were light enough to enjoy without getting full. The version with fennel sausage, roasted peppers and garlic disappeared quickly at my table. I can't say the same for the pallid so-called Tuscan tomato stew, which tasted like a bowl of watered-down marinara sauce. White bean soup threaded with escarole was far better. The staff members at Trattoria dell'Arte could not be more pleasant or accommodating: they actually appear pleased that you came in, and they say so. Waiters are chatty but generally efficient and eager to please. Better yet, they leave little peppermills on the table rather than assault you with mechanized tree trunks. As for the wine, cone-shaped wine glasses may be pretty, but they are impractical: they hold little and you can't swirl the wine to aerate it. The wine list is appropriate for trattoria food, starting at $14, but unevenly stocked, with many vintages missing. Pastas, which can be ordered in half portions as starters, are among the best options here. On the lighter side are pinci, little handmade dumplings, tossed with al dente broccoli and zucchini along with roasted garlic cloves in a nice olive-oil-based sauce, and penne with salmon and radicchio. Two blood-warming seasonal specials are maccheroni alla chitarra, a thin hand-rolled spaghetti with a rich wine-based lamb ragu sauce, and pappardelle alle lepre, or flat, thick noodles with moist rabbit meat and a sweet-edged Barolo wine sauce. More puzzling than pleasing was a special of bucatini with a clashing combination of fennel, currants, Parmesan and anchovies. Among other main courses, odds are in your favor with three charcoal-grilled options: steak garnished with garlic and rosemary (along with a haystack of good french fries), lamb chops and the swordfish presented over sauteed radicchio with garlic. The mixed grill met with mixed respones: the rosemary-scented chicken and the spicy sausage were terrific; the lamb was nearly raw and what was advertised as venison looked and tasted like beef. Grilled sea bass, a special, was deftly cooked but our waiter's bumbling boning job left it looking as if it had collided with a boat's propeller. A tempting winter dish called clay-pot-roasted chicken was little more than a dry bird heaped with fresh rosemary (obviously the chef's favorite herb), with onions and roasted potatoes. Desserts are not worth the guilt. There is the obligatory tiramisu, which was merely a bland custard; undistinguished cherry-flavored chocolate tartuffo, and an equally boring chocolate-hazelnut square with vanilla sauce. A napoleon the size of a cornerstone looms on the dessert cart. This stratified monster of almond-flavored cream and burned flaky pastry is impressive only for its dimensions. It is difficult to predict how first-timers will react to Trattoria dell'Arte. The trattoria part has some engaging food going for it; it's the arte part that could be unappetizing to some.

Take, for example, the Ambassador Grill, a coolly urbane restaurant in the United Nations Plaza Hotel. Never terribly distinguished in matters gustatory, the Ambassador Grill has been pegged as a convenient spot for diplomatic types to take a breather from solving the world's woes by having a tall drink and grilled slab of all-American steak. It was quite a surprise, then, to find an ambitious new menu there, half of which is devoted to the foods of Gascony in the southwest of France, the glorious region of ducks, geese, foie gras, confit and truffles. The recipes were developed by three leading French chefs from that region during a weeklong Gascon festival at the restaurant early this year. They were Arnaud Daguin from Hotel de France in Auch, Maurice Coscuella of La Ripa Alta, a hotel-restaurant in Plaisance, and Roger Duffour, chef-owner of Relais de l'Armagnac in Luppe-Violles. Several of the Gascon dishes alone make a trip to the Ambassador Grill worthwhile - and with prix-fixe meals of $19 at lunch and $24 at dinner, you would have to have your own duck supply to find less expensive foie gras. The rest of the menu rolls through peaks and valleys, but by ordering wisely it is possible to have a more than satisfying meal. The subterranean dining room is striking with its interplay of dark walls, smoky glass panels and starry lighting. Overhead the illusion of a skylight is created by the angling of many glass trellises that seem to reflect lights out to infinity. In a small open kitchen three white-toqued cooks tend to the sizzling grills. Service can be proper and well informed or spirited but callow depending on the roll of the dice. Upon being seated you can begin excavating a ramekin of well-seasoned duck rillettes with toasted croutons. If you are in an experimental mood, try the special Gascon cocktail called a pousse rapiere - roughly translated as a thrust sword - a French sparkling wine tinted with a regional orange-flavored liqueur. The wine list also carries some moderately priced regional labels, such as the fresh and easy-drinking Colombard, an Andre Daguin label, a white ($17), and the young faintly tannic Madiran, Domaine Bouscasse, a red ($17). The unqualified best starter is the warm duck foie gras salad, which is on the Gascon side of the menu. It has strips of rare-grilled salmon paired with a meltingly rich slice of the foie gras, seared just enough to form a micro-thin crust, set over a bouquet of mixed greens in a mild wine vinegar dressing ($3 supplement). Soft nuggets of mellow garlic confit add a heady rustic accent. The cold terrine built upon successive layers of foie gras, vegetables and lobster arrived underseasoned and too cold from refrigeration. Two selections that need more consulting from the Gascon trio are the duck soup with truffle juice, a turbid and tasteless broth holding arid duck sausage, and the mixed seafood pasta, which had everything going for it except a final adjustment of seasonings. Recommended appetizers from the other side of the menu are the peppery rockfish chowder, which is actually more like a stew, made with an assertive shellfish stock, tomato and fillets of rockfish, and a lovely dish of lightly poached shrimp served in a buttery shellfish stock blushed with sweet Sauternes. A cold assorted seafood salad, a special one evening, was also delightful. Magret, the meaty breast of a fattened moulard duck that is raised to produce foie gras, is competently prepared - sliced, sauteed to rare and glossed with a red wine sauce ($3 supplement). The restaurant's cassoulet with duck meat may be less rich and complex than it could be, but it is flavorful nonetheless. A dish misleadingly called lobster cake with endives ($3 supplement) is really a cluster of glossy endive encasing tender morsels of lobster and mushroom in a stock sauce boozy with dry vermouth - aggressive but pleasing. On Fridays the kitchen turns out a generous and oceanic bouillabaisse spiked with a garlicky aioli ($4 supplement). The most interesting seafood selection on the regular menu is called grilled John Dory andouillette with mustard sauce. The fillet of John Dory, also called St. Pierre, having firm, flaky white flesh, is rolled around a stuffing of shrimp and scallop mousse, then cooked over a wood fire to impart a strong smoky flavor. The dish, however, needs more of a kick than the pallid mustard sauce provides. An unusual preparation that succeeds is lean Black Angus steak poached to medium rare in beef stock and an emulsion sauce melding egg yolks, mustard and just a hint of vanilla that comes through moments after you swallow. Bland veal with candied lime peel in its sauce is forgettable; try instead tarragon-perfumed lamb chops coated with minced vegetables. High spots of the dessert tray are lush plum tart with a cracker-thin crust, a first-rate creme brulee and a fabulous mille-feuille made with sugar-dusted puff pastry disks floating on layers of whipped cream with fresh raspberries. Apple tart on two occasions had a slightly soggy crust. Even if the Ambassador Grill's new menu is not 100 percent successful, the initiative and imagination demonstrated by this young team deserves recognition. It is yet another example of how top hotels in this country are taking food seriously once again - a long overdue phenomenon that will benefit us all.

Since it opened two months ago, its simple fresh food, prepared with style, has attracted diners from far beyond the neighborhood. The fact that it is open until 4 A.M. is an added attraction. The core of the appealing menu is food cooked on a huge gas-fire rotisserie in an open kitchen, where all the preparation takes place. Rotisserie cooking, an excellent method for sealing in juices and heightening natural flavors, demands an attentive cook, who knows when to move the food away from the heat, when to baste it and when to take it off. The cooks at Amsterdam's are paying attention. Salmon basted with wine is moist and served at room temperature, with a light lemony mayonnaise flecked with chives. Though a half-chicken for just $6.95 may be falling off the bones, it retains its juiciness and is deliciously complemented by a richly flavored basil sauce. Cooking an entire shell steak on a rotisserie makes it impossible to get an individual serving to order, but one that was requested rare came fairly close, the slightly chewy meat pungent with garlic. A stuffing of seasonal fruits enhanced succulent slices of pork. For lighter fare, yellow and red pepper strips and sun- dried tomatoes are stylish additions to a chef's salad bathed in a balsamic vinaigrette. The same mellow dressing that is served with the salads accompanies the meats. At lunch, the roasted chicken may turn up in a sprightly salad, its sharp brown mustard-accented dressing sweetened with mint. The pork and beef become sandwiches, the semolina bread spread with a zesty mustard-mayonnaise dressing, spiked with capers. Several of the appetizers are available all day and, as with all dishes, the portions are generous. There is a richly satisfying peppery, smooth duck- liver mousse, garnished with tart lingonberries, for two. My only complaint about the gravlax and its sharp-sweet mustard dill sauce is the way it was cut - too close to the skin, so that the salmon-color flesh was marred by oily gray patches. Mildly smoked trout, prettily arranged with cherry tomatoes and red onion rings, and the unusual gazpacho, refreshingly redolent of basil (a special), are other good choices. And one evening there was an appealing assortment of vegetables, each cooked to enhance its essence, all glistening under a light coating of olive oil. Only mushy shrimp, served in their shells, were out of keeping with the rest of the food. When they were ordered, the waiter, anticipating a problem, offered to take them back if they were not satisfactory. His concern is typical of the young staff, which takes its work seriously. One other trouble spot is the french fries. Since the cooks can produce crisply fried new potatoes, they should be able to do the same with Idaho potatoes, which, though delicious, are limp. I suspect the fat is not hot enough. The deeply chocolate velvet mousse cake needs no tinkering. But the hazelnut torte tastes of stale hazelnuts, and a wonderful tart gooseberry filling has a thick, sadly underbaked crust. Berries and cassis, topped with whipped cream, are refreshing when sweet. But sometimes a judicious sprinkling of sugar would help, and a better quality whipped cream is needed, one with less air and more butterfat. A sparkling plate of fruits and cheeses, in the first-course column, would also make a splendid finale. The simplicity of the menu is carried through to the decor. The owners of Amsterdam's have created a casual cafe, using white paint on the plaster and bricks, black on the tin ceiling, the bar and the chairs. Red and white, and blue and white homespun tablecloths add an accent note. The lower level of the restaurant, with bar and jukebox, is noisy, but the noise disappears in the dining room a few steps up. For those who have always wondered what the Upper West Side is really about, Amsterdam's would be a good place to start exploring. New Yorkers like to tell visitors about a a favorite out-of-the-way restaurant that serves the best old-fashioned something - hamburgers, Italian food, steaks, whatever. For years, the establishment that has filled the bill for seekers after chicken cacciatore and beef braciola, for linguine with clam sauce and eggplant parmigiana, has been Gargiulo's in Coney Island. The happy, boisterous atmosphere combined with old-fashioned Italian service and hearty Neapolitan fare, so lovingly prepared, were New York treasures. But now only the contagious atmosphere and old-fashioned waiters remain. The food at Gargiulo's is no longer worth the trip, nor the three-star rating it received in The New York Times in 1977, stars it proudly hangs from its ceiling. The quality of the raw ingredients remains good, but they are being handled carelessly. It is as if the kitchen staff got tired of cooking and began to take shortcuts. Much of the food, like the fritto misto and mozzarella in carrozza, tastes as if it had been cooked early in the day and reheated. Zuppa di pesce was treated as if it were a beef stew and cooked for hours. Overcooking turned chicken scarpariello and chicken cacciatore bone dry. It toughened pork chops pizzaiuola, the braciola and veal parmigiana. The blandness quotient is high. Sauces that should be pungent and lusty are pale imitations. Normally spicy sausage and peppers tasted like hamburgers, and a mountainous veal rollatini was stuffed with a mixture that had no discernible flavor. Unseasoned tomatoes, passing as spicy fra diavolo sauce, marred an otherwise juicy lobster, while some pasta dishes had so much salt that they were inedible. Tartufo, spumoni and fresh fruit are recommended for dessert only because they are safe, not because they are wonderful. What should have been a wonderful zabaglione was overwhelmed by a crude alcoholic taste, while cannoli filling looked and tasted like library paste. Yet an occasional dish provided a hint of the glory that was once Gargiulo's. The pasta was cooked to order and, combined with a couple of the sauces, provided a good and inexpensive meal. Bits of prosciutto and mushrooms added an earthy note to a lovely light tomato sauce served over fettuccini Gargiulo and to a delicate cream sauce for cheese-filled tortellini Michelangelo. Risotto, deeply scented with mushrooms, was appropriately firm and chewy. Once you get past the unattractive appearance of overcooked stuffed green peppers, they can be enjoyed for their savory bread filling. A tender grilled veal chop and two items not on the menu, chicken paillard, with a zesty dressing of artichokes, mushrooms and red peppers, and pork chops with vinegar peppers, were the best of the entrees, in part because they were freshly cooked. Several vegetables also had the homey flavor that one expects in this kind of Italian restaurant: broccoli rape, escarole and spinach, pungent with garlic. While it may be a Herculean task for the city to restore Coney Island to its former charms, it would take only a competent and caring kitchen staff to perform that miracle at Gargiulo's.

517,Kodama Japanese Restaurant,1 star,"July 29, 1983",Mimi Sheraton,Clinton,"Japanese, Sushi",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/29/arts/restaurants-light-japanese-fare-for-hot-weather.html,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/29/arts/restaurants-light-japanese-fare-for-hot-weather.html?rref=collection%2Fcollection%2Frestaurant-guide,"IF ever a restaurant was perfectly suited to its location and to the season, it is Kodama, a trim, bright Japanese restaurant on 45th Street, just west of Eighth Avenue. The raw-fish specialties and small intricate dishes of dumplings, grilled eggplant and chilled bean curd, the light grilled-fish specialties and the cold-noodle combinations are just right for our hot, humid summer. By coincidence, these dishes are equally suitable for pretheater dining, when lightness before the curtain goes up can prevent drowsiness once it is up. Kodama provides competently prepared, simple dishes in an entertaining variety, and with just a little fine tuning it might well rate two stars. Sushi, the raw and cooked fish packed onto rice with or without seaweed bindings, is generally decent, although lacking in the extra measure of flavor to make them outstanding.  Crisper seaweed and a more generous dab of wasabi horseradish would be improvements. A few sushi varieties, however, are outstanding; among such are the futomaki (a wide seaweed roll filled with rice, sweet omelet, crab, grilled eel and pickled vegetables), the California roll with its crabmeat, cucumber and avocado filling and its outer coating of packed rice, and the hand-rolls or seaweed cones of sushi rice with tiny grilled fish, cucumber and sesame seeds. The cones are traditionally served at the end of a sushi meal. Sashimi (sliced raw fish), could not be better - either plain or in an assortment atop rice with pickled vegetables in a boxed selection known as chirashi. To the management's credit, fish that is not available fresh is simply not offered at Kodama, a policy other sushi restaurants would do well to follow. As at most such establishments, the raw-fish meals are more interesting when taken at the sushi bar, where you can order single pieces of whatever looks best, instead of taking a standard assortment at a table. Small dishes are among Kodama's strong points. Gyoza are tender, juicy, crescent-shape dumplings that are filled with meat and are greaselessly baked. The tatsuta-age, marinated strips of crisply fried chicken, is brightened by a dash of fresh lemon juice. A sweet and pungent miso sauce and toasted sesame seeds mellow the flavor of thick grilled eggplant slices; the yakitori, succulent tidbits of marinated chicken, is gently grilled on tiny skewers. Whether the clams at Kodama are actually broiled as stated or are steamed hardly matters because the big clams are so good, served puffed up and sizzling in their own saline liquor. For some reason, tempura frying is excellent on individual mushroom caps, served as an appetizer or side dish, but this method of cooking is less successful on the standard tempura array of shrimp, fish, vegetables and chicken. The batter on these dishes is heavy and limp and conveys an aftertaste of grease. Breaded deep-fried foods are far more skillfully prepared, to judge by the excellent fried pork cutlet (tonkatsu) and the fried pork on skewers. Donburi, lacquer boxes or casseroles that combine meats, vegetables and rice, are satisfying main courses, especially oya-don - bits of chicken, vegetables and scrambled egg nestled in rice. Simple butter- and salt-broiling of all kinds of fish (salmon, cod or trout) are well done. Teriyaki-broiled steak, fish and chicken are also savory and satisfying. Boiled or steamed hot-pot dishes, such as the fish and seafood specialties yosenabe and hamanabe, are delicate and blissfully dietetic, as is shabu-shabu, the caldron of broth in which meats or chicken with noodles, bean curd and vegetables are cooked at the table. An unpleasant sogginess mars such dishes as sukiyaki (prepared in the kitchen instead of at the table); negima-yaki (stringy braised beef rolled around scallions), and all dishes of meats or fish sauteed with vegetables. Another flaw is the addition of second-rate Western garnishes to flesh out the Japanese fare. Iceberg lettuce accompanies deep-fried dishes, and potato with two vegetables are added to several others. These garnishes are out of character and detract from the enjoyment of the food; Japanese pickles or oshtashi (cold spinach or watercress with bonito flakes and sesame seeds) would be preferable. Cold noodle soups with greens and cold buckwheat noodles (soba) served on ice with a dipping broth seasoned with green horseradish and minced scallions are among the most restorative choices for a hot summer day. Refreshing desserts include pineapple, honeydew melon or sliced oranges, or ice cream, the best of which is spiced with candied ginger. Prices are fairly moderate, and a satisfying meal can be obtained for $12 to $18 before tip and drinks. The staff is delightful - friendly and altogether accommodating. Kodama offers full bar service and is also open after the theater. A la carte ''Coffee and ... '' is a pleasant prospect at St. Honore, the patisserie-cafe that opened last March at 235 East 57th Street, between Second and Third Avenues (355-6478). Yeasty Danish pastries are the best of the offerings, especially the puffy cheese buns ($1.25), the almond-encrusted crescents filled with preserves ($1.15) and the pinwheel schnecken ($1.25). All these are better than the plain croissants and brioche. Anyone with a more demanding sweet tooth should opt for the individual St. Honore pastries - glazed cream puffs filled with whipped cream. All pastries may be taken out or eaten in the cafe, and there is a variety of coffees. Prices are a bit lower for takeouts. St. Honore is open Mondays through Fridays from 9 A.M. to 7 P.M. and Saturdays from 9 A.M. to 5 P.M. Greener Pastures, the stylish vegetarian restaurant at 117 East 60th Street, between Park and Lexington Avenues (355-3214), remains one of the better possibilities for simple summer salads. Egg, tuna and vegetarian-chopped-liver combination (smorgasbord salad, $5.50) are especially sprightly and crunchy with bean sprouts. And except for the inclusion of canned California black olives, the salade Ni,coise ($5.95) is several cuts above average. Good grainy breads accompany all salads. Lunch is served Mondays through Fridays from noon to 4:30 P.M., Saturdays and Sundays from noon to 4 P.M. Dinner is served from 4:30 to 9:30 P.M., Mondays through Thursdays and on Saturdays, and from 4 to 8:30 P.M. on Fridays and Sundays. In reviewing La Ripaille on July l, we related, as we had been informed, that Theresa and Nelly Laurent, the wives of the owners, Patrick and Alain Laurent, continue to do the cooking as they did when the restaurant opened three years ago. But Alain and Nelly Laurent were divorced eight months ago, and she is no longer connected with the restaurant. Alain Laurent manages the dining room. Menus are planned and recipes are created by Patrick Laurent and his wife, Theresa, who oversees the kitchen. Arnold Rossman is the chef who assists Mrs. Laurent and who takes over when she is away.
