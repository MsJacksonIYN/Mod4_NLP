       " 'review': 'By the early 1980s, New Yorkers knew that something major was happening in the kitchens of California. They had heard about the revolution, but most of them hadn’t tasted it until Jonathan Waxman opened Jams in 1984. Here was a report from the West Coast front lines brought by a chef fresh from Michael’s in Santa Monica and, before that, Chez Panisse in Berkeley. To put it in terms readers born after 1980 will understand, this was a bit like being the first person in town to have cooked at both Noma and Relae, but bigger. Styles in food didn’t get around as fast in those days. Jams had an open kitchen. Mesquite flared under the grill. Vegetables, in their prime, were barely cooked. Salsa, citrus and cilantro breezed in. Low-fat sauces sat beneath the meat and fish, not smothering them on top. Small portions (critics called them “stingy” and “skimpy”) were ringed by arctic expanses of white china. Mr. Waxman brought a loose, unbuttoned American spirit to nouvelle cuisine, still nouvelle at the time, and the city loved it. Andy Warhol went to the Upper East Side to eat at Jams once or twice a week, Factory apparatchiks in tow. Then came overexpansion and the 1987 stock market crash. As the decade ended, one of its most influential restaurants went down with it. I can’t blame Mr. Waxman for dreaming he would bring Jams back from the grave one day. But after a few meals at the Jams that returned to Manhattan in August, I also can’t help wishing it had stayed there. This zombie Jams, at the corner of 58th Street and Avenue of the Americas, inside the 1 Hotel Central Park, trudges ahead steadily, but it’s stiff in the joints and short on joie de vivre. Some writers have seen the return of Jams as a sign that ’80s cuisine is coming back. But anyone who shows up with a Flock of Seagulls haircut expecting to see customers exclaiming over kiwis and Jay McInerney doing lines of Bolivian marching powder in the men’s room will be disappointed. The first sign that this revival will not set any new paradigms is the design of the dining room, which looks like a reclaimed factory. You’ve been in this room before, downtown or in Williamsburg. White pipes and ducts creep along a soaring ceiling, and the walls are scraped down to the bricks and structural terra cotta. The wood tables are bare, the chairs midcentury in style. There are some flashbacks to the original, like visible flames in the open kitchen, and a handful of items branded as Jams classics on the menu. The Jams chicken, half a bird grilled over wood, is charred on the skin and juicy inside, dressed with a little tarragon butter. It won’t eclipse the roast chicken with a crackling skin that has made Mr. Waxman’s downtown restaurant, Barbuto, a landmark, but it could be the centerpiece of a fine relaxed dinner if you are in the neighborhood. Mr. Waxman does not lay the pieces of bird in a nest of skinny, golden fries the way he did in the ’80s, which is just as well because the Jams fries are soggy with oil and can be limp, too. They arrive with the Jams burger, a juiceless, saltless, flavorless flap of overcooked meat that could have come from the most influential Greek diner of the ’80s. It would have been a complete loss without the help of bacon, cheese and aioli. The Jams pancakes, pink with sweet red peppers, were starting to curl at the edges when they appeared and weren’t quite tender. They weren’t cooked four decades ago, but apparently they weren’t cooked four minutes ago, either. There were three, each topped with a twirl of bagel-shop-grade smoked salmon and just enough caviar to cover my thumbnail in a single layer. Only the summery creamed corn with flecks of red pepper spread out under the pancakes had any real flavor. A restaurant that trips over its signature dishes is as hard to trust as a person who misspells his own name. (Good thing there are only four letters in Jams.) The chicken aside, I tended to have better luck when I treated the Jams name as a warning label and ordered things without it. Toasted fregola sarda under a big heap of plump mussels in a tomato broth warmly spiced with chorizo, for instance. Or the seared gnocchi with lots of corn, a little lobster and some cherry tomatoes. Or the hunk of swordfish, gently cooked so the interior still had a tinge of pink, with a smooth and mild romesco. Desserts can be likably retro, such as the simple and very fresh apple turnover made with puff pastry, or the more complicated charlotte with toasted ladyfingers forming a soft fence around a filling of moist, fruity fig jam. Recently the menu promised a “German chocolate angel food cake”; while it was nowhere near as angelically light as the name implied, it still had its appeal. But the non-branded items can also be tricky. Rigatoni with crab in a spicy sauce was fine up to a point, that point being the rigatoni itself. Some tubes were floppily overcooked, others leathery and half-raw at the ends. The ingredients, which do a lot of the work at Barbuto, sometimes seem unwilling to lend a hand at Jams. The cooked fresh tuna tossed with aioli and piled on a bun (a sandwich sold, misleadingly, as pan bagnat) had almost no presence. A raw fluke appetizer with cubes of flavorless, brown-spotted avocado tasted like nothing except salt. Servers do their best to cope with delays between courses that can stretch up to 20 minutes even when the dining room isn’t full. They seem well trained, delivering smart wine recommendations with confidence. But some of the lines they’ve been given are odd. Mine volunteered the information that the aioli on the burger “is a garlic mayonnaise.” For a minute, it really did seem like 1984 again.'}"
