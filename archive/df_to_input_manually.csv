1,Faustina,★,20100406,Sam Sifton,East Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/07/dining/reviews/07rest.html,"JEAN-CLAUDE IZZO wrote a terrific series of French noir novels, a Marseille trilogy of sun-baked bad guys and beautiful women, smart cops and mean situations. Mr. Izzo was a marvelous food writer in addition to being a poet of violence and regret. His books are filled with winning descriptions of Provençal meals run through with the flavors of north Africa, Italy, Greece. Also, violence. Of life in Marseille, Mr. Izzo wrote, “Even to lose, you have to know how to fight.” Mr. Izzo died 10 years ago, but he could have been writing about cooking, and in particular about cooking in New York restaurants, circa 2010. He could  have recalled the line over dinner at Faustina, which the phenomenally talented chef Scott Conant opened in February on the ground floor of the Cooper Square Hotel, in the space that had been Table 8. For more than a decade  — first at the elegant L’Impero and later at the more precious Alto, most recently at the lusty Scarpetta, which begat an outpost in Miami and soon another in Las Vegas —  Mr. Conant has shown himself to be one of the city’s most inventive practitioners of Italian-American top-dollar cooking. He is a chef of great skill and intelligence. He knows how to fight for flavor, for intensity, for the art of good food. But while his kitchen is exciting, Faustina is not. The restaurant offers what may be the city’s best pork chop, a shoebox-size Berkshire behemoth currently recommended for two or more diners; it might serve four, and happily. You can find a wealth of interesting raw-bar small bites and bread-dippers, delicate salads and ridiculously hearty, delicious pastas. On hand is a wine list that affords a chance to drink well at reasonable prices, up and down Italy. This being a hotel restaurant, you can have lunch, even breakfast  — some oatmeal, perhaps, or a protein shake. But no matter the meal, you will eat it uncomfortably, in a tough concrete dining room that juts off a large bar crowded with tall tables, in what is unmistakably an institutional setting, down to the space on the check where you can sign the bill to your room. Faustina might be in West Hollywood or Munich or London  — anywhere people travel for business and think themselves luxe as anodyne pop loops around on the sound system. Faustina’s service is strong and professional. There is little that is personal about it, though, little that places a diner here in New York. And while the cooking is mostly excellent, the menu prolongs the maddening trend of shareable plates that crowd the table with disparate flavors while simultaneously enlarging the check and rendering the meal confusing. You will invariably order either too much or too little at Faustina, and thus leave feeling either cheated or dazed — and in either case a little unclear what has just happened. Of the two avenues to take, though, gorging offers the more pleasurable ride. Start with a poached duck egg set into a bath of fontina fondue, accompanied by grilled ciabatta, in which the rich yolk redoubles the flavor of the cheese. Even when the dish is mostly gone, and there are only gooey bits of translucent egg white left in the black iron bowl to be scooped up with the smoky bread, it remains one of the better meal starters in the city, a pure example of what the chef Jimmy Bradley calls stoner food, appropriate to people who need to eat something gooey, something delicious  — and, like, right now. (If that’s a little heavy, a plate of focaccia served with whipped ricotta and a drizzle of olive oil will do the trick.) Follow this with a turn toward the raw bar, where Mr. Conant has assembled a series of crudi that expand on offerings he has made at Scarpetta and elsewhere. There is pink snapper, soft and sweet, set beneath leeks that underscore both  — and smoked steelhead roe that offsets it. There is raw lobster that tastes of the ocean, of cold New England water and a summer sun, served with concentrated tomatoes that might be a distillation of San Marzano itself. It is a brilliant combination. Belly tuna with sea urchin vinaigrette and cucumber? It is a Scarpetta dish, but have it here, too, and a plate of thin-sliced scallops with citrus and American caviar as well, simply because you can and they’re great. Indeed, you might add two more choices off the list to make up the restaurant’s “puzzle,” a rectangle of six plates. At $68, this offers real value for taste. The best of the other appetizers include a plate of sweet prawns wrapped in lardo, served above a spoonful of toothy, rosemary-scented lentils; a beautiful dish of clams in brodo, with tomatoes and garlic; and a plain salad of tomatoes and stracciatella, drizzled with olive oil, that serves as complete explanation of why Italian food can be at its best when it is at its simplest. There is also a terrific dish of strozzapreti with suckling-pig ragù, the sauce strong and fragrant over the pasta, and a light little number that offers porcini and Parmesan folded into ravioli cooked to the texture of heavy silk. It tastes exquisitely of mushrooms, Parmesan and egg. Only maccheroni with tomato and sea urchin fails  — muddy in flavor, and overcooked to boot. The main courses loom above all this food as specters do. They threaten, even as they attract. (That pork chop!) But roasted black bass, with vin cotto and a celery-root purée, makes for excellent eating on the cusp of warm weather. And spring lamb chops, served as if they were veal Milanese, with preserved lemon and artichoke, are a smart notion, well cooked, and lovely alongside a side dish of nutty fregola with grain mustard and pork belly. The desserts do not rate, really, after all this: a half-dozen options that emphasize architecture over flavor. It is better, perhaps, to take a grappa or an espresso, then brace yourself for the winding trip out through the bar to the street. The crowd surges close to the bare tables, eats its salumi, consumes its specialty drinks, laughs a little too loudly at jokes told by people it barely knows. All this would be less depressing if the food weren’t so good."
3,Bar Milano (CLOSED),★★,20080702,Frank Bruni,Kips Bay,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/dining/reviews/02rest.html,"ITALIAN cooking is about a lot more than pasta, but an Italian restaurant that bungles its pasta dishes is like a Las Vegas resort that doesn’t let you gamble. There’s still plenty to enjoy, but you’re likely to feel that the essential point and signature pleasure of the place have been lost. Bar Milano bungles its pasta dishes. Not all of them, but too many, sometimes in small ways, sometimes in big ones. And by pasta dishes I mean the “primi” section of the menu, which includes a few risotto dishes. Bar Milano bungles them as well. That it still manages to be impressive, and at times immensely enjoyable, says a great deal about the seriousness that its proprietors and chefs bring to it. Bar Milano is easily the most ambitious enterprise in which any of them have taken lead roles, and they have lavished money and thought on it, creating an Italian restaurant that is not just an anagram of so many others in a city that never tires of its tagliatelle. Among the restaurant’s antipasti, primi, secondi and dolci you’ll find dishes that aren’t entirely familiar and dishes with lovely grace notes. If your path through them is fortuitous, you’re in for a terrific meal. But there are also less rewarding routes, along with an overall sense — surprising, frustrating — that a dedicated team of accomplished pros have undercut a potentially excellent restaurant with some significant missteps. What they do well, they do superbly: a rabbit terrine, crunchy-edged duck breast with duck sausage and lentils. What they do less well — orecchiette with lamb, lobster risotto, tagliatelle with favas — is hard to overlook. Bar Milano’s DNA comes from Lupa, ’ino and ’inoteca. Its main partners — the brothers Jason and Joe Denton, who run the front of the house, and the chefs Steve Connaughton and Eric Kleinman, who supervise the kitchen — made their names and careers at one or another of those restaurants, all more casual, all less slick. Bar Milano is slickness incarnate, in a glossy, contemporary way that befits its name and indeed evokes northern Italy. Smooth, handsome wood surfaces define the lively bar area, where there is a succinct menu (spoken, not written) of salads, panini, fried food, skewers and the like. That menu channels some of the ’ino and ’inoteca spirit, though much of what I sampled during lunch there was curiously off  key. The dining room conjures a spirit of its own. One design element trumps all others, and it’s one of the restaurant’s missteps: a long, mesmerizing wall of marble strips and rectangles in different colors. The owners must have paid a fortune for it, and are still paying for it, in terms of the room’s awful acoustics. You can see — in the carpeting, in the fabric on banquettes — attempts to fix the problem, but the cure isn’t taking. At a crowded hour you’ll spend much of your interactions with servers asking them to repeat what they just said or repeating what you’ve just said. Bar Milano is like a cellphone with constantly bad reception. The menu is refreshing. It takes pains to honor northern Italy but also takes chances, reflected in four standout starters. There is a silky garlic sformato, which is a molded savory custard. A scallop carpaccio is, as its name suggests, a flat, round sheet, and that might be too wispy a scallop fate were it not for the Meyer lemon that glosses the dish and the orange hillock of uni rising from its center. Faro-stuffed cabbage keeps company with fried oysters in another happy surprise, and yet another involves slices of potato wrapped around egg yolk, enriched further by melted Fontina and capped by some caviar. A spud never had it so good. While most Italian restaurants overwhelm pasta with its co-conspirators, Bar Milano sometimes gives it too little help. I wanted more of the lamb nuggets in the orecchiette, undercooked and doughy. I wanted more fava beans and also more of the promised mint with the tagliatelle, thickened with a goat-cheese sauce not appreciably more nuanced than an Alfredo. Plastered to the top of “cuscini,” veal-stuffed cushions of pasta, were shards that the server identified as bread crumbs, but they did an uncanny textural impression of birdseed. As for the lobster risotto, it tasted mainly of something doing an uncanny impression of soy sauce. Put this dish in a trapezoidal paper carton and you have Chinese takeout. And yet a subtly peppery, faintly briny dish of eggless noodles with cuttlefish and razor clams was a beautifully tuned marvel. Tagliatelle alla Bolognese had the right ratio of noodles to tender, flavorful meat. The section of the menu devoted to main courses is the most straightforward: a lightly breaded, wholly satisfying veal chop; a flattened, boneless, crisp-skinned half chicken; an aged rib-eye with a marrow compound butter; plump scallops bejeweled with darkly glistening caviar. All were cooked to perfection. Less straightforward, but also appealing, was grilled tuna with braised veal, a partnership possibly inspired by vitello tonnato. The anchovy mayonnaise and capers in the dish suggest as much. Desserts aren’t one of Bar Milano’s strengths, but drinks certainly are. The wine list’s tight focus on northern Italy means you’ll find an uncommon depth of selections from such regions as Friuli-Venezia Giulia and the Piedmont. And Bar Milano puts enormous care into cocktails, both those of its own invention and classics that it resurrects and tweaks. Try the 323 (named for the restaurant’s address on Third Avenue), because it combines rosemary-infused gin, reduced balsamic vinegar and strawberries. Also try the bracing, biting Corpse Reviver, if only for the pleasure of saying its name. Throw back a few of these and you might not even notice the pasta.

15,Parea,Two Stars,20060705,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/dining/reviews/from-delphi-by-way-of-cleveland.html,"FOR a while it seemed that most of the restaurants that promised updated, upscale takes on Greek food merely delivered the same old dishes -- grilled branzino, grilled octopus, stuffed grape leaves, moussaka -- in fancier digs. Parea has the branzino (albeit roasted), the octopus (pickled) and the grape leaves (stuffed, as it happens, with lobster). But you won't find the moussaka. And once you've perused the menu and begun to sample its highlights, you'll know that you're indeed encountering something more than a taverna with a better tailor, something beyond Hellas in Hermès. Not that Parea doesn't have stylish threads. It beckons the downtown cocktail crowd with a sleek, sexy room that devotes more space than usual to the lounge and bar areas and catches the eye with well-chosen flourishes. A few cunningly shaped brick columns mimic the bones of an ancient temple, while orange light fills a cavity in the ceiling and flickers through a sculptured canopy of what look like leaves. It's sunrise at the Parthenon, or maybe sunset at Delphi. But above all else, it's a fittingly arresting showcase for a sophisticated chef's efforts to recast Greek cuisine by approaching it with atypically high standards, unearthing neglected traditions and finding novel assignments for commonly used ingredients. The chef's name is Michael Symon, and the tack he's taking isn't unique to him or Parea. It has begun to pop up around Manhattan, most recently at Dona on the East Side, where Michael Psilakis, another chef determined to tweak Greek, is building on his work at Onera on the Upper West Side. Parea builds on work from a more distant and even less glamorous place: Cleveland. That's where Mr. Symon, 37, lives, and it's where he opened the restaurant Lola nine years ago. Lola brought him national culinary acclaim and its contemporary byproduct, Food Network appearances. He did a cooking show, ""The Melting Pot,"" which, he joked, ""was very big in prisons and nursing homes."" He did a segment of ""Iron Chef."" And along the way he opened a second Cleveland restaurant, Lolita, the template for Parea and the training ground for its executive chef, Jonathon Sawyer, who stays put in New York while Mr. Symon toggles between cities. Much of Parea's menu is devoted to small plates, or mezedes, that cost $7 each. In place of Italy's crudo or South America's ceviche Mr. Symon presents ""spinialo,"" a term and concept he encountered while rummaging through old Greek recipe books. He said in a telephone interview that spinialo refers to the unsold, uncooked seafood that Greek fishermen would save and store in salty liquid, lightly curing or pickling it. His present-day riffs on this practice include tuna brined in olive juice and garnished with almond bits and salmon marinated in vinegar and paired with pickled veal tongue. The latter dish appeared on Parea's evolving menu precisely when an appetizer of pickled lamb's tongue vanished, and Mr. Symon conceded it was an offal transplant of sorts, a slyer attempt to slip diners some tongue, which he needs to keep around for selfish reasons. It's his favorite lunchtime sandwich meat. Despite their intriguing pedigree, the spinialo dishes proved less memorable than another clever deployment of organ meat, an excellent mini-salad that mingled nuggets of lamb brain, which were crunchy on the outside but molten at the core, with fingerling potato and pickled onion. Zucchini keftedes, or fritters, achieved a similar textural dynamic -- a crisp surface giving way to a spongy center -- with a less divisive ingredient. But cubes of cured pork belly, tossed with roasted beets and toasted pistachio nuts, were all crispness, all crunch. Neither of these starters should be missed. Parea's dishes varied widely in their degrees of obvious Greekness, though either yogurt or feta was never far from the picture, serving as the base of a dip or the creamy centerpiece of a sauce. Mr. Symon doesn't treat these mainstays as clichés to be spurned, the way a vainer chef might. He regards them as clutch players to be recruited for, and bent to, his own pleasurable purposes. Fig joined yogurt and tempered its sourness in a silken sauce for beautifully grilled loin of lamb, one of many strong main courses. A tzatziki accompanied that branzino, which was also coddled by sweet onions. These accessories were a welcome departure from the usual capers, and the dish's gooey opulence defied the spare cleanness of many a branzino around town. Mr. Symon had wrapped the fish in grape leaves before roasting it, and the payoff was pudding-like flesh. A sauce with yogurt and veal stock enriched braised veal, which was rolled in a spiral around sausage made from ground veal and pork. And whipped feta skirted a boneless half-chicken that had been roasted to succulent perfection and cut into round wedges of ideal thickness. Was the feta too salty? Depending on the amount in a given bite, it could be, underscoring a tendency at Parea for some flavors to be too emphatic. The dish that combined lobster and grape leaves had an excessive tartness, and used an increasingly tired trick, adding a dissonant delicacy to something humdrum. An array of cured meats hewed to a Greek tradition of spicing -- with nutmeg and cinnamon, for example -- that Mr. Symon described as aggressive. I'd call it downright bellicose. The mezedes concept recurred with desserts, all portioned modestly. The pastry chef, Jodi Elliott, turned out a decadent rice pudding with a strong vanilla character, grapes and almonds. She displayed a deft touch with pastry in a glorious, custardy concoction called a phyllo milk pie. ""Greek doughnut holes,"" on the other hand, were dreadful -- chilly, chewy. But by the time several companions and I got to them, we had bigger troubles. Our voices were shot. Although the word Parea means ""group of friends,"" the restaurant retards their conversation, becoming so loud on crowded nights that it's necessary to bellow or even pantomime. Perhaps Parea should change its name. What's Greek for charades? And can you hear, through this din, what Mr. Symon has to say? Yes, because his food speaks clearly and persuasively, articulating a repositioning of Greek cuisine that's not just tongue -- er, lip -- service.

19,Onera,two stars,20041201,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/01/dining/reviews/greek-reinterpreted-in-manhattan.html,"THE bright lights of this big city stoke different dreams in different people. They put Michael Psilakis in mind of seared brain, grilled kidney and braised tongue. Mr. Psilakis looked at New York and saw all the usual enticements -- a more competitive arena, a more sophisticated stage -- and one more. He saw a place to cook and serve organ meat. He was doing some of that already in Garden City Park, on Long Island, where he was the chef and one of the owners of an Italian restaurant named Ecco. He made his living there on the inevitable fried calamari and the ineradicable baked clams; he salved his soul with sweetbreads, the easiest innards to sell. But he wanted to explore a richer, riskier offal canon, a specific wish that reflected a broader desire: to prepare more adventurous food. For that, he decided, he needed a new area code. In September he got one. Having sold Ecco and taken the deep breath that all first-time Manhattan restaurateurs must, he opened the felicitously christened Onera, which means dreams in Greek, his ancestral language and ethnic identity. His big gamble turns out to be our happy reward: a restaurant that puts a fresh, liberal spin on Greek cooking, taking it well beyond the virtues of grilled fish. That brings impressive versions of crudo (although Onera does not call it that) all the way uptown. That offers squab and poussin. And, yes, that embraces offal, presenting a five-course tasting of it, with wine pairings to boot. As with many ambitious dreamers, Mr. Psilakis's reach sometimes exceeds his grasp, an outcome you pretty much expect when you survey his multifaceted menu, listen to a recitation of the nightly specials and contrast the grand scope of the food with the modest physical dimensions of the restaurant. During my visits the possibly overstretched kitchen produced a few clunkers, including overcooked medallions of tuna and a mushroom and veal risotto that needed salt the way Meg Ryan needs a hit movie. But more dishes at Onera succeeded -- sometimes brilliantly -- than failed. And Mr. Psilakis deserves credit for moxie, especially because he is bringing culinary panache and invention to a section of Manhattan that needs more of it. The Upper West Side is not quite the gastronomic Sahara that some downtown partisans claim: Zabar's, Fairway, Citarella and, if you stretch your geographical definitions only a bit, Whole Foods are all here. But where sophisticated restaurants are concerned, the climate is undeniably arid, and Onera represents a tall, cool, welcome drink of water. This oasis could easily be overlooked. It sits a half-story below ground level, its exterior so indistinct that the restaurant's staff has resorted to setting up a menu on a conductor's stand on the sidewalk to lure customers. Those who take the bait find themselves in a soothing dining room of navy blue and pristine white, colors that evoke the Greek isles. Mr. Psilakis treats Greece the way many New York chefs have long treated Italy or Southeast Asia: as inspiration rather than doctrine, a set of seasonings, ingredients and ideas to draw from and disregard. He bows as much to American trends as to Hellenic traditions. I have not, during extensive travels in Greece, encountered many medium-rare slices of duck breast, but Onera serves them, using a Greek dessert wine for a portlike sauce. I never noticed an uncooked fish craze in Athens, but New York is in the grip of one, and so the first stretch of Onera's menu is devoted to raw meze, most of which were terrific when I had them. Sweet, glistening ocean scallops were dressed with a vibrant mix of yogurt, cucumber, fennel and anise. A briny dab of sea urchin came atop a thin, round, quarter-size pedestal of pickled beet. There were meat selections as well: slices of lamb entwined with feta, fried shallots, olives and a sun-dried tomato emulsion; ribbons of veal that were part of a geometrically deconstructed vitello tonnato. These too were great. The menu goes on (and on) from there, encompassing appetizers, salads, Greek pastas, fish and meat. It hits a few dull spots (a bland branzino, a listless pork dish) but more than a few stunners. Can you imagine a transcendent moussaka? Before Onera I couldn't, but here it is assembled piece by piece -- with fresh pasta instead of potato, and braised goat, no less -- when a diner orders it. The sheep's milk dumplings are equally delightful, because they keep salty, spirited company: lamb sausage, sun-dried tomatoes, pine nuts and feta. Sun-dried tomatoes and pine nuts reappear in the crust around grilled slices of loin of lamb, which were a perfect medium-rare. Onera does something more delicate with pan-seared John Dory, my favorite fish entree. After it is on the table, a server baptizes it with a subtle broth of butternut squash. Almost all the desserts at Onera have their charms, but if you want your brain and eyes tickled as thoroughly as your palate, your path is clear. You must order the rose sampler, with four vessels for the flower's flavor: a tiny milkshake, a version of panna cotta, an overgrown gumdrop of sorts and an ice cream from Il Laboratoria del Gelato in Manhattan that I adored. As for the offal, which can be ordered à la carte, the sweetbreads and the brain made the best impressions, while the tart, gelatinous headcheese made the worst. But the individual merits of these dishes said less to me than their existence, which suggests Mr. Psilakis's daring and conviction. That conviction is apparently contagious. Most of his kitchen staff and many of his servers followed him from Ecco to Onera and, like him, commute from Long Island. They make for a decidedly exuberant crew: at one typical moment, a server instructed me to make absolutely, positively sure that I combine certain components of an octopus salad in each forkful. ""Then,"" he explained, ""the party begins in your mouth."" It was an off-putting pronouncement, excused and redeemed by its motivation. Mr. Psilakis and his cheerleaders are immensely proud of what they are doing and want you to be pleased by it. I'll take that brand of earnestness over jadedness any night of the week. Onera  ** [Rating: two stars]  222 West 79th Street, Upper West Side; (212) 873-0200. ATMOSPHERE -- A cramped front lounge and a modestly elegant back dining room, both in navy blue and white.

26,Fatty 'Cue,★,20100511,Sam Sifton,Williamsburg,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/12/dining/reviews/12rest.html,"FATTY ’CUE, Zakary Pelaccio’s funky new barbecue joint on South Sixth Street in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, looks like a biker bar for the kind of bikers who don’t ride Harleys in leathers and boots, but stripped-down Schwinns in boat shoes and skinny jeans. The entrance sits low and dingy below the sidewalk, next to some stained traffic cones. It’s dark and shouty inside, with spartan dining rooms spread out over three small floors. These are all faintly scented with oak smoke, and packed with people in beards or vintage dresses, everyone talking loudly over tiny tables that are not quite sticky, peering at menus in the low light, ripping into their meals. The food is incredibly good. Fatty ’Cue is a restaurant worth traveling to visit. To expand on the playbook of awesome, Malaysian-ish cooking on display at the Fatty Crab restaurants in Manhattan, Mr. Pelaccio’s Fatty Crew — with Corwin Kave as executive chef and Andrew Pressler as chef de cuisine — has added to their roster Robbie Richter, the Queens-born pitmaster who helped start Hill Country in 2007.  Fatty ’Cue offers smoked crabs and smoked lamb ribs, coriander-dusted bacon and pieces of pig. You can eat smoky noodle soups and pickled chilies. There is brisket and bao. That said, it sure would be funny to roll up to the place with a white-shoe lawyer, some actuarial accountant from Tucson or dramaturge from the Upper West Side, anyone who goes to restaurants expecting the small courtesies that make up the usual experience of spending close to $100 for a meal for two people. No reservations are taken, so unless you eat in daylight or draw good luck, there’s going to be a wait for a table, time spent standing at a bar that was crowded when you arrived and will be when you leave. Also, as the waiters will tell you when you do get a seat, the food comes out when the kitchen prepares it, according to the kitchen’s own needs and schedule, which means there is no real structure to the meals. Indeed, the food can arrive at such a rush as to make the service at Big Wong on Mott Street seem like that of Eleven Madison Park. Forewarned is forearmed: Fatty ’Cue might be uncomfortable for those who hear more music at Lincoln Center than at Southpaw. So embrace your place. Start with a “recession special” cocktail: a shot of rail bourbon, a shot of spicy pickle juice and a tallboy of Pabst. The drink is best consumed in that order, pausing only to thrill to the way that pickle juice refracts the flavors of first the whiskey and then the beer. (After taking a sip or two of the Pabst you may consider the experience complete, and ask the waiter to replace it with something drinkable.) Then get ready to throw down. The menu at Fatty ’Cue comes in two main sections: snacks and specialties. Diversify your holdings in each area, aiming to bring at least a snack and a specialty per person, perhaps more. Dessert is delicious, but is not strictly necessary: fat Tumbador candy bars named for the restaurant and a selection of pies from First Prize, a newish bakery run by Allison Kave, Mr. Kave’s sister. Really, all 10 snacks are worth trying, with the exception perhaps of the cucumber salad, over-dressed in smoked chili and brown-rice vinegar, with toasted sesame seeds. Among the best is a broth created from smoked bones, with galangal and Chinese celery: light and fragrant, slightly spicy. “A bowl of noodles,” meanwhile, arrives with scallions and chilies, acidic with lemon juice and young ginger, slicked with “meat juices” collected from resting meats. It doesn’t look like much, beneath its dusting of dried, fermented baby shrimp powder. Yeah, well. It is the OxyContin of ramen. And coriander bacon, fatty and rich, is served with steamed yellow-curry custard, fiery and light. The combination is insanely agreeable, particularly if you pair it with an order of Chinatown white-bread toast slathered in fat rendered from every animal in the kitchen: pork mixed with beef mixed with duck mixed with lamb. Master fat: schmaltz for the deeply Reform. Each weekend the crew puts a whole pig in a smoker, then sells it off in pieces, with bao and more yellow curry. If this is available, it’s a must as a main course. So, too, are long, elegant spare ribs, in a sauce made of palm syrup and a smoky fish sauce. Fatty ’Cue is pig heaven. (In keeping with the restaurant’s interpretation of kashrut, even the Manila clams come with huge hunks of house-made bacon, in yet more of that bone broth, with curry leaves and a honking undercurrent of fire.) But for specialties, you’ll want the beef brisket as well, made with way-smoked, meltingly tender American wagyu and served with chili jam, aioli and pickled red onion, with some bone broth and warm steamed bao: deckle deliciousness from psychedelic Texas. There is excellent red-curry-rubbed duck, too, soft and meaty and hot, with sweet pickled daikon. A smoked dorade’s worth asking for, too, with a chili-garlic-lime sauce, if only so that you can tell the waiter you’d like the bones cooked crisp and edible as a second course. These are fine, indeed. (Pass on the seafood sausage, wan and damp.) And while hand-pulled lamb turns away from Asia to embrace the Mediterranean, with goat yogurt, mint and warm, house-made pita, it still feels of a piece with the rest of the meal: smoky and intense, with a crunchy bark outside its luscious interior. Best of all is smoked-crab laksa, a spicy noodle soup the proper preparation of which can start arguments up and down the Strait of Malacca. It is Chinese by way of Malaysia. At Fatty ’Cue, it has been sent to school along the Chesapeake Bay: a funky, deeply smoky crab broth that packs heat like an oven door, with cold-smoked lump crab meat, tiny anchovies, maitake and shiitake mushrooms, a lot of grated daikon, brown-rice vinegar, unrefined palm syrup and soft, thick lai fun noodles. The combination of American barbecue technique and South Asian flavors is brilliant and unsettling. It recalls, almost perfectly, what the Buddhist teacher Chogyam Trungpa called the magic of the present moment. To eat at Fatty Crew’s new restaurant is to experience the very essence of nowness. No one else is cooking like this anywhere. It is difficult not to sound like Mrs. Cleaver saying so, but can you imagine what this young man could do if he straightened up his room?

29,10 Downing,★★,20090310,Frank Bruni,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/dining/reviews/11rest.html,"WHEN last we left the restless young chef Jason Neroni, he was a fugitive from justice, living on scraps sneaked through back doors of restaurants and wondering if he could nab a spot working the garde manger station in the Big House. I exaggerate. Just the teensiest bit. But it’s true that one of Mr. Neroni’s last gigs ended with accusations of crime and threats of punishment, his boss filing petty larceny charges, which Mr. Neroni staunchly denied. The charges were dropped. Mr. Neroni’s record is clean. But the drama surrounding his departure two years ago from the Brooklyn restaurant Porchetta, which has since closed, reflected the sort of kerfuffle that he seems to have a special gift for stirring up. Just before his legal contretemps, he did time as a blogosphere whipping boy for his Internet groveling for a James Beard award. Now he’s at 10 Downing, which  went through  its own turbulence, the proposed kitchen lineup changing repeatedly before a November opening. That opening was unusually delayed even by the standards of an industry in which “five weeks out” translates into “maybe next millennium.” Mr. Neroni, by many reports, wasn’t the owners’ first choice to run the kitchen (which he does with input from Katy Sparks, a consultant). But they took a chance on him. And it turns out that they were right to, because he has rewarded them with cooking more complete and grounded than much of what he’s accomplished before. He did some excellent work at 71 Clinton Fresh Food on the Lower East Side, but that was a smaller room than 10 Downing’s, with a more succinct bill of fare. At 10 Downing, in the Village, there’s enough space for about 65 diners now and more than 100 in warm weather, thanks to an outdoor cafe facing the Avenue of the Americas. And the menu is substantial, not just appetizers and entrees but also a half-dozen sides, some dishes to be shared, and an assortment of charcuterie or salumi (pick your ethnic term and allegiance). A clarifier before we go any further: 10 Downing’s name makes a British allusion but 10 Downing doesn’t serve British food. The menu has Mediterranean leanings, if any. It does the requisite contemporary genuflection before swine, though not as floridly as Porchetta did. That restaurant served a margarita with a rim coated in cracklings. This one merely quotes Miss Piggy on the menu. “Never eat more than you can lift,” she is credited as saying. If you’re A-Rod or Madonna,  that leaves you a lot of wiggle (or is it piggle?) room. Shaped like a triangle and situated on a corner, 10 Downing has the blessing and curse of glass walls on two sides. They give an open feel to the restaurant, which looks like a high-gloss, low-clutter brasserie, but they’re two additional hard surfaces in a restaurant with plenty already. The din can be excruciating. And the layout is awkward, the narrow side entrance and cramped bar area contributing to a bottleneck of human traffic on the way to the tables. But the food was more than ample compensation for the aggravation —  except on my first visit, around the one-month mark. I’ll long remember that visit for the way a server pitched a steak special. She described it as Piedmont-style, referring to the northern Italian region. “How so?” one of my companions asked. “Well, it’s from grass-fed cattle raised in the mountains,” she said. “In Italy?” I asked. “Montana,” she conceded. That night the gnocchi was awash in too much butternut squash  — it was all orangey sweetness  — and a dish of squid ink agnolotti, filled with a cauliflower cream, was a mushy muddle in which the peekytoe crab over the pasta didn’t really come through. But months later these dishes were terrific, their proportions fine-tuned, their flavors sharpened. The mushrooms had more say with the gnocchi; the pasta forming the agnolotti had more weight, and the crab had more personality. Slippery red strands of piquillo pepper with it added to the fun. The kitchen seems to be getting better and better, and I seldom had the sense that Mr. Neroni was showing off, which he’s been known to do. What was strongest about the best dishes wasn’t some fanciful conceit or adornment, but rather the quality and preparation of the centerpiece ingredient. For a recent appetizer special, sweet Maine shrimp were flash-fried to crunchy (but not dry) perfection, their dusting of sea salt, pimentón and cayenne merely an added bonus, though an appreciated one. The fillet of merluza (Spanish for hake) in one of my favorite entrees had the opulence of excellent lobster, and if you find yourself wondering whether it and the béarnaise sauce on it are fully responsible for its oomph, the answer is no. The fish is glazed with a beef jus as well. The kitchen obviously has a talent for brining, because it brines its roasted chicken, served in a thicket of panzanella salad, and it brined a recent pork chop special. Both were superb. But don’t overlook the charcuterie. While it’s no longer impressive for a restaurant simply to hang or smoke its own meat  — the way this trend has taken hold, every McDonald’s in Manhattan will soon trumpet house-cured bacon in Egg McMuffins  — 10 Downing does a commendable job of it. What’s more, the restaurant is generous with the results. For just $25 it presents an assortment that can meet the appetizer needs of at least three people. The platter includes morcilla, which is Spanish-style blood sausage; mortadella, presented in cubes, as it should be; and slices of duck prosciutto, each with a substantial rim of fat. Mr. Neroni supervises the sweet as well as the savory side of the menu, and the standout dessert  straddles that divide. It puts  goat cheesecake in the company of beet sorbet, thus redeploying familiar salad partners for an unfamiliar mission. I wish the wine list were more surprising. But you can find what you need to go along with a robust duck meatball cassoulet, actually an appetizer, or with rich braised beef cheeks. They’re served with bone marrow and spaetzle, and are as piggy as beefy gets. 10 Downing ** 10 Downing Street (Avenue of the Americas), Greenwich Village; (212) 255-0300 or 10downingnyc.com.

31,RECOMMENDED,DISHES,20060222,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/22/dining/reviews/22rest.html,"JOHN LAFEMINA'S first restaurant, Peasant, romances Italy to the point of presenting a menu entirely in Italian. Servers stand over your table and, item by item, for minutes on end, channel Berlitz instructors. At  his second restaurant, Ápizz, a bilingual menu relieves servers and diners of the lengthy tutorials. But the food remains fixed on Italy, and a wood-burning oven, the visual and spiritual cynosure of Peasant, is the focal point of Ápizz as well. Mr. LaFemina's new restaurant,  the Orchard, finds him in a much different frame of mind. Its menu sticks to English. The kitchen, without a wood-burning oven, is hidden from view. And while Italy again seems to be his touchstone, he touches down in many other places as well. Along with risotto and agnolotti, he serves a Latin-themed appetizer of lobster empanadas and an Asian-inflected starter of grilled slices of filet mignon wrapped in butter lettuce and paired with a chimichurri pesto and sriracha mayonnaise. In place of the more conventional pizzas at Peasant and Ápizz, he bakes crispy, rectangular sheets for what he labels flatbreads, which have unexpected toppings: a combination of steak tartare and Dijon-flavored potatoes; a mix of braised short ribs and creamy horseradish. His evolution is an interesting one, on its own terms and in a larger sense. The Orchard typifies this culinary moment, when more and more  restaurants don't just flit tentatively across a few borders but knock down a whole bunch of them altogether. I don't mean familiar fusions, like Thailand and France, or pan-Asian excursions with stops in Japan, China and India. I'm not referring to those generically ecumenical menus, prevalent in glorified lounges and nondescript hotels, that traffic in alleged spring rolls, nominal quesadillas, beef satay and chicken teriyaki. I'm thinking of new restaurants with serious ambitions and uncommon culinary partnerships. Take Dani, which constructs a bridge between northern Africa and southern Italy. Or Morimoto, where an appetizer ""pizza"" bedecks a tortilla with raw bluefin tuna,  an anchovy  aioli and jalapeño. It's Asian, Italian, a nod to Nobu, a wink at Taco Bell. The Orchard bops around the globe in a less flamboyant fashion, but it, too, covers great distances. And while the itinerary may not be coherent, the trip is a world of fun. Atmospherically, the restaurant embodies its Lower East Side neighborhood, taking unglamorous materials and applying a moody gloss. Its light maple chairs and tables are basic. The drab brown carpet beneath them better suits an office than a dining room. But Mr. LaFemina has installed lighting that bathes everything in a seductive orange glow, a magical, last-gasp sunset that never ends. He has bound the menus in suede. The little flourishes add up, giving the Orchard real style. The restaurant, which opened in November, bears only a slight resemblance to its forebears. At Peasant, which opened in 2000, the kitchen is under the control of the restaurant's co-owner, Frank DeCarlo. At Ápizz, which came along two years later, Mr. LaFemina runs the whole show and supervises the cooking but doesn't give himself as much license to experiment as he does here. The Orchard's excellent flatbreads, their crusts about as thin and crispy as they can be without disintegrating,  provide a case in point. Of the five on the current menu, only one has cheese, wedding robiola to sautéed spinach, bacon and dried cranberries. Appetizers appear in a category on the menu just below the flatbreads, and that's where you'll find the beef wraps and empanadas, both somewhat disappointing, along with several respectable, pro forma salads and a yellowfin tuna tartare that might not jump out at you. Try it, because the tuna is part of an amusing, flavor-building assembly kit. You scoop some of it onto one of many round, deep-fried slices of green plantain, put some guacamole over the tuna and some crème fraîche on top of that. The entrees are more straightforward, and they do a more uniformly successful job of showcasing the strengths and skill of the kitchen.  It prepared fish with care, producing succulent halibut and equally fine arctic char, the latter adorned with identically coin-shaped slices of purple potatoes and pickled cucumbers. Lamb tenderloin was pounded into thin sheets; seasoned with shallots, cilantro, parsley, basil and thyme; and then rolled into cylinders before being grilled. A creamy mint orzo beside the meat took a good dish and made it even better. The flavorful risotto brimmed with sautéed langoustines, braised octopus and roasted red, yellow and orange peppers. The daringly sweet, dauntlessly rich agnolotti were filled with a purée of butternut squash and brown sugar and sauced with vin santo, cream and toasted hazelnuts. Among the desserts there was yet another appealing assembly project, custard-filled tarts that needed a final application of fruit. Raspberries and blueberries waited in the wings. The tarts came in a group of five, as did a brightly colored phalanx of carrot cupcakes, some with a cream cheese frosting, others with carrot custard on top. They captured the Orchard's playful spirit. Behind the scenes, that spirit is being challenged by Mr. LaFemina's battle with his local community board. The board has thus far blocked his liquor license, a financial setback for him but a cost-saving opportunity for diners, who can bring their own bottles without incurring a corkage fee. He has a wine list ready to go, and Italy shares space on it with Germany, New Zealand, Chile and Argentina, among other countries. Mr. LaFemina said he doesn't want to be ethnically pigeonholed, when it comes to both drink and food, even though that reluctance leaves him hard-pressed for accurate names and characterizations. He initially identified that filet mignon appetizer as a wrap, then designated it a salad, then went back to wrap. In a telephone conversation he said he still wasn't sure about the tag. He wondered aloud whether he should add the words Vietnamese or Korean to the dish's description and whether the restaurant should be called New American, Italian or something else. Got me. But no matter the label or language, the Orchard takes you on an enjoyable tour. THE ORCHARD  ** 162 Orchard Street (Stanton Street), Lower East Side; (212) 353-3570.

34,The Modern,Two Stars,20050504,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/04/dining/reviews/at-moma-dining-with-picasso.html,"MANY New York restaurants boast great views, glorious architectural flourishes or other sparks and balms for the soul. But perhaps none claims as utterly distinctive and privileged a perch as the Modern, where only a wall of glass separates the dining room from the Museum of Modern Art's sculpture garden. The first time I ate here, at a table for two snug against that wall, Picasso's ""She-Goat"" kept entering and exiting my peripheral vision, as if grazing in an adjacent field. When I pivoted my head more purposefully, I could take in a Calder or a Miró, each one bathed in moody lighting. Backdrops for fine dining don't come any more mesmerizing than this. In ways sweeping and intimate, the Modern is a visual knockout, an impressive response to the challenge of creating a space as beautiful and refined as the museum to which it is attached. Its glowing white entrance evokes a space-age tunnel to heaven. This corridor opens onto a casual dining area with a 46-foot marble bar, almost 100 seats and a wall-size photograph, by the German artist Thomas Demand, of a verdant, enchanted forest. Beyond that area, behind a partition of frosted glass, is the more formal dining room, with almost as many seats. Its view of the garden is exclusive, but its emphasis on clean, sleek design isn't. Throughout the restaurant, furniture and flatware, water pitchers and water glasses, bud vases and butter pedestals feel like understated works of art. The Modern represents the most ambitious project yet by Danny Meyer, the ace restaurateur whose winning hands include the Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern. It has the makings of another triumph, and if it follows the arc of Mr. Meyer's other establishments, it will only become better. But during my visits from February through April, its pleasures were inconsistent, its menu a patchwork of bold hits and noble misses. The chef, Gabriel Kreuther, who worked at Atelier in the Ritz-Carlton, can and does dazzle. But he seems at times too strenuously determined to do that, producing some dishes that are overthought and overwrought and others with lofty pedigrees but curiously flat effects. Alsatian-born, Mr. Kreuther filters that background through his embrace of global influences and less traditional flavor combinations. He does so across an impressive array of selections. There are separate menus for the bar room, which emphasizes small plates, and the main dining room, which has a more conventional appetizer-entree approach. On any given day, the kitchen is turning out about 55 dishes, not including desserts, for hundreds of diners, and every one of these dishes strives to be singularly memorable. Many succeed. At lunch in the bar room one afternoon, two companions and I ordered three soups -- sorrel, butternut squash and wild mushroom -- of such vibrant, humming flavor that we were hard pressed to determine which we loved best. Maybe it was the sorrel, which enveloped roasted foie gras, an ingredient Mr. Kreuther uses as frequently and creatively as any chef. Then again, the wild mushroom soup was served with toasted chorizo ravioli, another unexpected pow to the palate, another ingenious but not overly assertive way to lift an already accomplished dish to an even higher level. The menu for the bar room encompasses creamy ""rillettes"" of smoked eel, yogurt, jalapeño, chives and shallots; decadent ravioli stuffed with sweetbreads and foie gras, and a delicately poached egg, which is surrounded by cockles and rests atop layers of fried serrano ham, spinach and an almond, garlic and sherry vinegar sauce. On unhappier notes, the bar room menu also includes a potato and marrow cassolette that was unbearably salty and gratuitously buttery. Diver scallops did not benefit at all from a dense cloak of poppy seeds. The dining room is a less lusty and even more elaborate production, each dinner beginning with a trio of precisely arranged amuse-bouches and ending with a flurry of irresistible petits fours. Between those poles lies uneven terrain. The high ground belonged to lamb tenderloin carpaccio with black truffle and roasted celeriac; a sweet pea soup thickened with whipped cream and bejeweled with diced carrots, diced celery and bits of grated Parmesan; sautéed skate in an exquisitely nuanced nage, which included pimiento, chorizo and red bird chili pepper; a rich crayfish gratin; and a gently roasted loup de mer with a faintly sweet ragout of pearl onions, grapes and truffles. But a riot of flourishes in other dishes proved counterproductive. The least resonant components of a chilled lobster salad were the somewhat bland, stiff petals of the lobster itself, bullied by such sidekicks as black radish and Thai long peppercorn sorbet. A roasted lobster entree came in what our server announced was a profusion of 14 herbs and spices, at least twice as many as it needed. Poached halibut was similarly entangled in and trapped by an unruly garden of garnishes. Langoustines were foiled by a single culprit: the applewood bacon that encased and essentially erased them. A wild boar chop sounded more exalted than mere pork but had less flavor. In a similar vein, buffalo tenderloin, which had been poached in spiced cabernet to an exemplary tenderness, had less presence and appeal than beef. I adored most of the desserts by the pastry chef, Marc Aumont, including a crunchy and tangy lemon napoleon and passion fruit ravioli with a pistachio parfait. I appreciated the attentive service, although aspects of it sometimes contradicted the elegance of the dining room in jarring and seemingly unintentional ways. A server struggled at the cheese cart, cutting strangely oversize and undersize portions. A hostess, connecting coats to their owners, looked at the label of one and asked-shouted, ""Made in Honduras?!"" But at no point did the Modern feel less than wholly conscientious in its aspirations. Never did its missteps obscure its graceful strides or the serious talents of the people pushing it forward. And no afternoon or evening there was without its significant joys, the setting foremost among them. The Modern  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  9 West 53rd Street, Midtown; (212)333-1220.

36,Freemans,SATISFACTORY,20060920,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/20/dining/reviews/hiding-in-notsoplain-sight.html,"IN this restaurant-packed city, all sorts of clever business people have toyed with all kinds of locations, designs and cuisines to try to make a splash and a buck, and what do you know? A forlorn alley, a few walls of taxidermy and hot artichoke dip do the trick as well as anything else. Behold Freemans, where the new Lower East Side, Appalachia, a British hunting lodge and a suburban 1950's dinner party all converge. It's the kind of unlikely restaurant you'd sooner expect to find in a David Lynch movie than in reality, but here it is, and here it's been since the summer of 2004, at times pretending to shun attention as a cunning means of getting it. Like the folks who market Pabst Blue Ribbon and Converse sneakers, the impresarios behind Freemans understood that the nexus of retro and downscale is a lucrative spot, so long as it's packaged in the right, knowing way. And these men, William Tigertt and Taavo Somer, understood that a nook at the terminus of a tucked-away alley would be an equally lucrative location, given the way New Yorkers like to feel that they're in on a secret. So they serve that cheesy, mayonnaisey dip -- along with grilled Cheddar toast, macaroni and cheese and filet mignon with a horseradish cream -- in a hideaway with an address that still stumps cabdrivers. They do it with a whimsical wink, which is what the artfully nicked walls, the stuffed ram's head, the stuffed goose and all those antlers are about. And the hordes come, steadily enough that on some nights you can spend as much time hoping to score a table as sitting at one. (Freemans doesn't accept reservations for groups smaller than six.) Like the Spotted Pig, another no-reservations restaurant with an aura of transcendent coolness, Freemans seems to be helped, not hurt, by the forbearance it requires. The wait proves the worth, or so the logic seems to go. And like the Spotted Pig, Freemans has answered success with an expansion. Earlier this year it grew to about 105 seats, including bar stools, from 60. It subsequently overhauled its kitchen, which had been entirely electric, with new equipment and gas lines. Literally, Freemans is now cooking with fire. Metaphorically, not so much. But first the positive: the restaurant looks as good as ever. Although it rambles over more space, it remains a collection of intimate rooms. The largest of the new ones has a curving zinc bar facing a wall of Victorian bird boxes, which are taxidermy dioramas, at once strangely beautiful and oddly hilarious. I smiled every time I walked into and through Freemans, and I smiled every time I watched someone else arrive. That person invariably did a double take, then giggled. It's sweet of a restaurant to make that happen. But it's wrong to let so much else fall by the wayside. Twice I had poached chicken with celery and carrots, and twice it tasted like the remnants of a stock that was supposed to have been the promising genesis of a dish, not the sorry conclusion. Baby back ribs longed for succulence, while grilled trout with thyme and lemon cried out for a dash of excitement and a dew drop of moisture. As for service, well, let's get there by way of one of Mr. Somer's pre-Freemans commercial enterprises. He designed T-shirts with cheeky messages. One said, ""My girlfriend is out of town."" Another: ""Emotionally unavailable."" That's the shirt that should be worn by some of the servers, including the bossy, brittle man who wouldn't let us order the artichoke dip and the Cheddar toast -- a version of Welsh rabbit -- while we studied the rest of the menu. He said we needed to give our whole order at once, so our meal could be properly paced and we could have ""a much more pleasant experience."" Of course that prohibition had nothing to do with our enjoyment and everything to do with the kitchen's convenience. It also had no place in a restaurant as studiously unfussy as Freemans, but it exemplified the real attitude here. Bartenders forgot drink orders. A hostess had all the cuddly charisma of Cujo. There were better, friendlier servers, and there was some wholly enjoyable food, including at brunch. There was good drink, thanks to an impressive list of bourbon, Scotch and other spirits. The Freemans cocktail, with rye, pomegranate molasses and orange bitters, was a bracing treat. New dishes from the newly empowered kitchen included a mixed grill with plump, flavorful lamb and boar sausages, which kept company with a decent lamb chop. The spinach salad was as deftly assembled -- lots of bouncy slivers of egg white, a generous smattering of bacon -- as any I've had. A platter of Camembert cheese with apricots and a platter of Stilton with almonds had grilled sourdough from Pain D'Avignon, a bakery that provides Freemans with all its excellent bread. But those cheese boards spoke to one of the restaurant's curiosities, one of the ways it pales beside a peer like the Spotted Pig. Most of its dishes -- including a dessert that's essentially a brownie à la mode and another that mashes together berries and poundcake -- could be quickly and easily replicated at home. If cooking were a sport involving a pool, a springboard and numerical degrees of difficulty, nearly everything Freemans does would be a swan dive. There's not a triple flip in the bunch. That's not a fatal knock, and Freemans must be commended for keeping the average price of entrees to about $20. But the limits of the kitchen's imagination and ambition mandate a more skilled performance, matched by less dismissive service. And the people jamming the entrance, eager to see what the fuss is about, need to know that what awaits them isn't a memorable feast. It's iceberg with ranch dressing under a stuffed boar's head.

37,Florent,One Star,20050427,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/27/dining/reviews/a-fanciful-bistro-but-not-too-fancy.html,"ABOUT a year and a half ago, in a fit of unwarranted panic, Florent Morellet determined that he could no longer close his restaurant, Florent, between 5 and 9 a.m. on weekdays and had to return it to its original 24-hour schedule. The trigger for that decision said everything about the evolution of Manhattan's once gritty meatpacking district. Mr. Morellet had heard a dread prophecy: that Starbucks, which already operated one store about six blocks away, might open another within a few hundred feet. And he couldn't abide the thought of too many more early risers going over to the dark side of skim caramel macchiatos. To compete, he put green Florent logos on to-go cups. ""Always be positive and proactive,"" he explained during a recent telephone conversation, laughing a tinkling laugh. An upbeat, mischievous spirit is much of what has propelled Florent, with its pink neon sign and red vinyl banquette, its goofball servers and eclectic clientele, through nearly two decades since it served its first steak frites in August 1985. But despite its minor adjustment for a Starbucks that didn't come, it has less often bent to shifting trends and times than bucked them, staying largely the same while all around it changed, while the muscle of the Mineshaft gave way to the Manolos of Spice Market and risqué was usurped by chardonnay. The secret to Florent's enduring success is its integrity, which has now brought it full circle. After years when it was a naughty urban adventure and years when it felt like a tired cliché, it is once again what it was always meant to be: a simultaneously sensible and kooky bistro with onion soup and escargots, boudin noir and burgers, crème caramel and chocolate mousse, at reasonable prices that underscore its welcoming way. Florent is open to all and it is open all the time. I went at 9:45 p.m. on a recent Friday and found it jammed, but Darinka, who began working there 19 years ago and wears her hair in a retro beehive, promised me a table in five minutes. I arched an eyebrow. ""Would I lie to you?"" she said coquettishly. My friends and I had to wait only four minutes, which whizzed by as we surveyed the other diners: a lone fortysomething man reading The Economist at the Formica counter; a gaggle of thirtysomething Italian speakers at a round Formica table; smatterings of twentysomethings with bulky black eyewear, the training wheels of hipness. Our food came almost instantly, and almost all of it was evidence that Florent was not coasting on mere nostalgia. The grilled tuna in a generous Niçoise salad was rare, tender and nestled beside a sliced egg that had not been boiled too long. A duck pâté delivered the creamy richness we wanted. Roasted chicken was crispy and moist. Many fancy restaurants bungle that. I went at 2:30 a.m. on a Saturday and chose a juicy, plump cheeseburger on an English muffin as a sponge for too much alcohol earlier on. It was gone in a flash, as was a friend's equally juicy, plump chicken breast sandwich. But we lingered in a happy crowd of young revelers, straight and gay, who canoodled in corners and tried to make the night last just a little longer. And I went for weekend brunch, walking past the hordes clamoring for admission to Pastis. Florent had open tables. There were tourists with maps but also downtown parents with strollers, and there was a younger waitress who might someday be Darinka. She didn't have the hair, but she had the arch attitude. ""Give me one second,"" I said as two friends and I glanced at menus. ""One second,"" she said. ""Another second."" We ate an omelet, sausage, French toast and eggs Benedict, the bland, sticky hollandaise proving to be the lone false note. There were quick, regular refills on the coffee, which was seasoned with cinnamon, a trick I hadn't employed or experienced since college. It made me smile. Florent has never chased sophistication or, for that matter, excellence. The wines in its limited selection are listed by region or grape, but not producer and year. Its desserts are uninventive and unexceptional. Its shoestring fries, which are central to its mission, sometimes sag a bit. Its crab cakes, which are not, look and taste as much like falafel as anything born of the sea. Sane people don't go to Florent for them. They go for the basics, expecting satisfaction, not bliss. They go for its frumpy individualism, which once made it a darling of the downtown art crowd and which it wears in too blunt and low-key a fashion to lapse into shtick. And they go because Florent is more than a restaurant. It's a piece of social history and an ode to Mr. Morellet, 51, a transplanted Parisian so famous in some circles that his last name is as unnecessary (and unknown) as Bjork's. She, of course, has come to his restaurant many times. He put it in the meatpacking district because he romped in the gay bars in the area at the time. He took over a Greek luncheonette, with its shiny aluminum and careless lighting, and he never changed the layout or cosmetics all that much. But he sprinkled it with his brimming wit and his quieter sentimentality. Among the unmarked maps of unidentified cities on the walls are three imaginary ones, which he drew, and one map of a country, Liechtenstein. It hangs above the spot where the artist Roy Lichtenstein, who died in 1997, used to sit. On the menu board are ever-changing lists, such as a spring to-do list (""abolish Congress"") and ways to survive 2005 (""vacation outside the U.S.""). The unexplained numbers on the bottom track Mr. Morellet's T-cell count, which he said has been improving with new medications. He tested positive for H.I.V. in 1987. His restaurant, like him, is a survivor, and it has adapted, but not so very much. That Niçoise has been supplemented with a seared tuna salad with wasabi aioli. That roast chicken is now free-range. The baguette that used to cradle that chicken sandwich has been replaced by seven-grain bread. And then, of course, there are those cups with green logos. Just don't expect Florent to be filling them with frappuccinos anytime soon. Florent  * [Rating: One Star]  69 Gansevoort Street (Washington Street); (212)989-5779.

42,Le Cirque,★,20080206,Frank Bruni,Midtown East,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/dining/reviews/06rest.html,"IN the first clipped sentences of his current best seller, Michael Pollan, distinguished author and designated repository for the nation’s food conscience, writes: “Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants.” I’m glad he wasn’t with me at Le Cirque the other night. I bet he’s glad, too. The meal started with ravioli swollen with an addictive substance outlawed in an entire swath of the country, by which I mean foie gras and by which I mean Chicago. This filling pretty much guaranteed the dish all the opulence it could want, but Le Cirque wasn’t taking any chances. The ravioli were shaped to mimic top hats. And while a plant came into play — the recipe called for cabbage — its use wasn’t what Mr. Pollan had in mind. To be turned into a bed for the pasta, it was cooked with cream, black truffle oil and black truffle trimmings, at which point it was less vegetable than opiate. What sort of entree was apt after an appetizer like that? Chilean sea bass. Le Cirque served it without apparent shame but with considerable ostentation: a sauce of Champagne, butter, cream and hon shimeji mushrooms; a darkly glittering crown of black caviar. It was wanton, craven and totally delicious. At Le Cirque you will indeed eat too much food, of a kind that neither your physician nor your local Greenpeace representative would endorse, in a setting of deliberate pompousness, at a sometimes ludicrous expense. The ravioli, all three of them, are $35. But that has long been the way of certain restaurants, which exist to be absurd, to speak not to our better angels but to our inner Trumps, making us feel pampered and reckless and even a little omnipotent, if only for two hours and three courses with a coda of petits fours. And while I’m not calling for the spread of these establishments (or the massacre of Chilean sea bass), I’m charged with noting when one of them fulfills its chosen mission with classic panache. Le Cirque now does. It didn’t in 2006, when it opened in the Bloomberg Tower in Midtown, having moved from the New York Palace Hotel. There were too many blips in service and flops on the menu, which didn’t match extravagance with enough finesse. I gave it two stars. Since then there have been extensive changes, most notably the arrival of a new executive chef, Christophe Bellanca, in place of Pierre Schaedelin. Mr. Bellanca, who cooked at L’Orangerie in Los Angeles, has provided just the injection of energy and discipline that Le Cirque needed. His menu nimbly straddles the line between predictable decadence — white truffles in late fall, sizable cuts of aged prime beef year-round — and creative flair. The foie gras ravioli are new, and they’re not merely a triumph of luxury ingredients. The cabbage’s faintly sour notes are a terrific foil for the fatty intensity of so much else in the dish. New, too, is an entree of sautéed John Dory with a mustard sauce that’s zippier than the stolid ablutions with which proudly archaic restaurants like Le Cirque often content themselves. The onion, fennel and cauliflower with the fish are sprinkled with ground kaffir lime leaves, another of the adventurous touches Mr. Bellanca brings to the food. He brings a voguish sensibility as well, pairing different cuts of meat prepared different ways, a crispy wedge of flesh sharing the plate with a soft tangle of it, something seared embellished by something braised. To wit, a lamb dish comprises lamb saddle, belly and shoulder. The saddle, roasted, has a gremolata crust; the shoulder, braised, is shredded and mixed with dried apricots and pistachios. As if that weren’t diversity and diversion enough, the dish is rounded out with artichokes, olives, a tomato confit and minuscule ravioli stuffed with pecorino. Not everything is as big a hit. I had slightly gummy risotto on one visit, undercooked pumpkin ravioli on another. The kitchen doesn’t produce meals on a par with those from four-star chapters in the restaurant’s storied past. Le Cirque isn’t quite as reliable as other  three-star restaurants. But the quality of its French-Italian food has improved to the point where it sufficiently complements, and doesn’t undercut, the rest of what makes this restaurant such an haute hoot. At Le Cirque you can survey an inimitable parade of fastidiously dressed, coiffed, tanned and tucked patrons, some of them important and some just scarily expert at looking that way. You can marvel (or giggle) at the décor, an evocation of a circus big top that actually looks more like the inside of a humongous lampshade. You can relish the white linens and tableside rituals that need to survive in a few establishments as much as they needed to go away at others. And you can trade smiles with its owner, Sirio Maccioni, who seems to be there every minute of every night, ready for you, beckoning you to come in and exhorting you to go for broke, a stubborn evangelist for unblushing indulgence. What he’s selling isn’t so much one evening of pleasure as a whole history, a whole legend, of privilege and pampering. He takes pride in it, and that’s manifest in the promptness with which he addressed a widespread feeling that the latest Le Cirque wasn’t clicking the way the greatest Le Cirques did. There’s new furniture in a newly appealing bar area, and a more consistent buoyancy in the moods and movements of servers. A great many of them hustle to and fro, replacing what is probably too much silverware with too much frequency and contributing to a yeti-size carbon footprint. They’re out of step with the direction in which Mr. Pollan, whose latest best seller is titled  “In Defense of Food,” and other arbiters of eating are rightly tugging us. But in some restaurants, at least some of the time, it’s still the way to go. Le Cirque *** 151 East 58th Street; (212) 644-0202, lecirque.com. ATMOSPHERE A less ornate but nonetheless elegant answer to its regal forebears, with a tall ceiling intended to evoke a circus tent. SOUND LEVEL A sweet spot between moderate and loud.

50,Shorty's .32,★,20071226,Frank Bruni,SoHo,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/26/dining/reviews/26rest.html,"THE timing of a restaurant’s debut has more to do with finances, equipment deliveries and Con Ed permission than the weather, but it seems fitting, even fated, that Shorty’s .32 and Smith’s opened just as the mercury dropped. They’re the kinds of restaurants, gentle and comforting, that you want to fall into at the end of a shivery winter day. At Shorty’s you can fatten up for the long haul until spring with braised short ribs, distinguished not only by their tenderness but also by the company they keep, a four-cheese macaroni that’s a merry poke at the gut. For dessert you can have chocolate bread pudding, though the toasted pound cake with mixed berries is better. At Smith’s you can warm yourself with roasted lamb saddle: two juicy, rosy medallions on a salty Parmesan purée. Here, too, you can have chocolate bread pudding, although you really shouldn’t miss a criminally good cup of hot chocolate, the centerpiece of a generous cookie plate. And at both restaurants, separated by two blocks and connected by agendas of low-impact pleasure rather than high-wattage excitement, you can savor the way in which skill, standards and a few well-chosen grace notes lift what might otherwise be favored neighborhood charmers into a slightly loftier league. These days, earnest, principled restaurateurs are lavishing more attention on less ostentatious enterprises, and, to varying degrees, Shorty’s and Smith’s are warm, welcoming examples. Shorty’s is the warmer of the two. It’s also the simpler, except for its strange name, the first part of which refers to the chef, Josh Eden. Some of his friends call him Shorty. And the subsequent punctuation mark and digits? A publicist explained that .32 is the caliber of a “small, concealable” gun and Shorty’s is a “small, concealable” restaurant.  Perfect, I  guess, for an N.R.A. meeting, provided local members didn’t exceed the 32 seats, the other explanation for the restaurant’s name. They’d have a great chicken dinner because Mr. Eden roasts a bird with tender flesh and crisp skin. He pairs it with a garlic-spiked chilled green bean salad that’s irresistible and that can also be ordered as a side. Befitting its humble posture, the sides at Shorty’s  — including the macaroni, which mingles Piave, pecorino, Gruyère and Beemster cheeses  — are among its greatest strengths. Mr. Eden finds a few opportunities on his short menu to branch out creatively from the chicken, the short ribs and an excellent hamburger made with short rib as well as sirloin. For a satisfying appetizer he does crab sticks instead of cakes, and they’re delightfully crunchy contrarians. For a flavorful entree, he places cod in a Gruyère broth and adds hunks of toasted sourdough with a caramelized onion spread. It’s as if a fish swam into a French onion soup. He’s perhaps overly fond of wet fish and wet food, and makes the questionable decision of submerging skate, a mushy fish that cries out for crispness, in a tomato-flavored pool. A pork chop struggles to transcend a soggy milieu of mashed yams. Shorty’s has its flaws, little elbowroom and big noise among them. The main decorative feature  —  more than 20 colorful shades on low-hanging lighting fixtures  —  goes a tad overboard. But this restaurant deftly works its way into your affections. The pickles with the burger are made in-house. The pricing and selection of wines make sense. It wisely has just a few special house cocktails, and the one made with Campari as well as tequila and triple sec is called a Stargarita. You just know that somewhere out there, a stripper goes by that name. On the subject (again) of names, Smith’s is easily explained. Cindy Smith, who is also one of the owners of Raoul’s, opened the place with Danny Abrams, a former partner of Jimmy Bradley’s in the Red Cat. In fact, Smith’s, which shares that restaurant’s American-bistro straightforwardness and remarkably friendly service, could be called the Black Cat. It has a black banquette in its front room, and black tables and black booths in a narrow dining passage that leads to the bar in the rear. The passage looks like a chessboard that morphed into a train car. With more than 60 seats, Smith’s is larger than Shorty’s, and its menu is longer. But many dishes are minimal-fuss affairs: bibb lettuce with buttermilk dressing; arugula with apple and Parmesan; sautéed brussels sprouts with almonds; roasted eggplant with piquillo peppers and much too much vinegar. This cat likes his veggies. An artichoke purée vaguely mimics a basil pesto in a pasta appetizer that’s too vaguely flavored, despite some prosciutto in the mix. The chef, Pablo Romero, who cooked at Bouley, has infinitely more success with a starter built around a steamed egg, cousin to the poached egg that has become restaurants’ farmhouse allusion of choice. He puts creamy polenta under it and covers it with a Gorgonzola foam as wispy in texture as it is forceful in taste. Heaven is a place where I get this for breakfast every day. To no benefit at all, Smith’s serves “a grilled rib-eye steak” as two insufficiently juicy rectangles of sculptured meat off the bone. And the bone is gone from a “pork chop,” really a pork circle, unremarkable but redeemed by braised pork cheek to its side. You’re better off with the fantastic lamb or with lobster, out of the shell and splashed with a lobster reduction that has cinnamon, clove and orange. It’s a sauce like sunshine, appreciated around this time of year. Shorty’s .32 * 199 Prince Street (Macdougal Street), SoHo; (212)  375-8275.

52,Insieme,★★,20070620,Frank Bruni,Midtown,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/20/dining/reviews/20rest.html,"RESTAURANTS, like people, aren’t easy. They seldom come in tidy packages of all good or all bad. One minute you’re madly in love and then  — snap! — you’re not sure, the spell fracturing as the next course comes, as you readjust your gaze. You wish you could change half a dozen things. You wouldn’t tinker at all with half a dozen others. At Insieme, an exciting new Italian restaurant from the chef Marco Canora, I wouldn’t tinker with an appetizer built around a combination of slender asparagus spears, each painstakingly wrapped with a thinly shaved slice of Kobe-style beef, and tiny ravioli, each filled with creamy, earthy La Tur cheese from the Piedmont region of Italy. These delicacies bob to the surface and drift to the bottom of a broth that tastes like the most elegant distillation of beef flavor imaginable, clear and light and yet hauntingly intense. There’s an edge to it, too, a rebel whisper. What is that? Ah, star anise. I wouldn’t tinker with the wine service, either. The restaurant’s sommelier, Paul Grieco, is as fantastically geeky a finder of unusual, affordable options as this city has, and the right way to navigate his bold wine list is the best way of all. Tell him your likes and dislikes. Articulate your mood. Give him a budget. Then let him do his thing. But Insieme’s setting? Mamma mia. I mean it: “Mamma Mia!” That’s what I see when I look up from my broth: the Winter Garden Theater, where the Abba-palooza soldiers on, bound for eternity. I see the people and cars skittering past it, the glaring electronics store beside it. I see it through fringelike white curtains that suggest the lower half of some dress Renée Zellweger might have worn in the movie version of “Chicago” and that don’t adequately insulate Insieme from a messy bustle at odds with its sleek interior and steep prices. I’d change that, and I’d change the salmon, one of those “slow poached in a plastic bag” wonders whose flesh has been converted to mush, its tenderness achieved at the expense of textural contrast or anything you can actually bite into. Do the results concentrate or dissipate flavor? In the case of this entree, I’d have to go with the latter. When Insieme is good, it’s outstanding, and any serious food lover should head here fast for (apologies to Del Posto) the best version of bollito misto in the city; for a sumptuous beef tartare, reminiscent of Piedmont’s carne cruda, with subtle spikes of porcini; and for the pastry chef Amadou Ly’s memorable desserts, highlighted by a warm, moist semolina cake with a chocolate core. Mr. Canora, who worked at Craft and is an owner of Hearth in the East Village, has high standards for the quality and seasonality of ingredients and,  more often than not, sound judgment and smart ideas. What’s more, he and Insieme’s chef de cuisine, Edward Higgins, demonstrate an attention to detail that often prompts smiles of delight. They surround the salmon with  halved sugar snap pea pods in which brilliant orange beads of salmon roe replace every other vivid green pea. These painterly sidekicks, like the delicately cloaked asparagus in the beef broth, reflect an impressive labor-per-morsel ratio that’s also apparent in the kitchen’s multiplication-tables approach to meat. There’s lamb four ways (chop, saddle, breast, sausage); chicken four ways (breast, wing, liver, thigh); and veal four ways (a fritto misto encompassing liver, sweetbreads, tongue and a thin cutlet). But Insieme is the second new Midtown restaurant this year where I’ve been frustrated by the way some dazzling cooking is undercut not only by unevenness across the menu or inconsistency in the kitchen but also by atmospherics that don’t pull their weight and live up to the rest of the production.  It reminded me of Anthos, which serves nouveau Greek food in a borderline gloomy room just a five-minute stroll away. Insieme’s room, a blunt rectangle inside the Michelangelo Hotel that’s furnished with tables of bleached white oak, isn’t gloomy, but it lacks warmth. It also has practical shortcomings, most notably a teeny-tiny bar that can accommodate just four stools. That’s a problem if more than a few people are waiting to be seated. The restaurant’s name (pronounced een-see-EM-ay) is the Italian word for together, and it ties into the restaurant’s conceit, which is to unite traditional Italian dishes, listed in one column of the menu, with modern interpretations, listed in another. For example the fritto misto, which is excellent, gets a home on the left, keeping company with roasted pork loin and a shellfish stew (both very fine), linguine with clams (pleasant) and lasagne verdi (a complicated verdict, to be examined shortly). The equally excellent lamb, meanwhile, takes a place on the right, along with a lovely lamb carpaccio brightened by fava beans; an appetizer of shrimp-stuffed calamari in which potent blasts of orange don’t quite fit; a nicely cooked risotto in which bonito and sea urchin join forces to stunning, lingering effect; and the salmon. The chicken is in this crowd as well, and it speaks to the restaurant’s variability. Every component of the dish was a success the first time I had it. The last time, though, the skinless breast was dull and slightly rubbery, and a crisped chip of skin that had wowed my companions and me was gone. Mr. Canora should bring it back. The lasagne — layers of spinach pasta, béchamel, Parmesan and a pork-and-beef ragù — was another study in flux. It has drawn both raves and complaints, both probably justified, because the dish was different each of the three times I had it. One night the bits of meat were overcooked. Another night the cheese registered too strongly, producing a saltiness that also plagued black olive fettuccine with a duck ragù on one, but not all, of the occasions I sampled it. That said, Insieme warrants  respect, and repeat visits, because if the arc of Hearth is any indication, a Canora restaurant improves with age, like many a wine. As for Mr. Grieco’s wine list, a diverting document interspersed with meditations on the history of a given region or the glory of a given grape, there’s no need for improvement. It gets an unconditional summary judgment. It rocks. Insieme"
53,Desmond's,★,20110621,Sam Sifton,Upper East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/dining/reviews/desmonds-nyc-restaurant-review.html,"THE greatest restaurant fish in the world may be Dover sole, an exquisite flounder of eastern Atlantic heritage that takes its name from the English port from which its best hunters once sailed. Diners love the fillets for their mild, sweet flavor and for the way the edges crisp in the heat. Add a film of clarified butter as a kind of force multiplier and you have a dish of intense simplicity. Dover sole does not come cheap. Hauled from the sand and mud seabeds of coastal Europe and North Africa (and mostly sold out of the Netherlands now), then shipped by air to the United States, the fish commands prices commensurate with the journey and the power of its name. It is rare to find it in a New York restaurant for less than $40 a plate. At Desmond’s, a society-crowded new restaurant at the southern end of the Upper East Side, across from the loading docks at Bloomingdale’s, you often see Dover sole on more tables than not. (It is to the restaurant as wet money is to the bar of the gritty Subway Inn tavern down the block: vital to its aesthetic and mood.) Grilled and served with butter, lemon and a totally unnecessary topping of sweet shrimp that you ought to scrape off as a child might, knowing that some foods should not touch, the dish offers diners an uncomplicated taste of club food at its best. This is fish sticks for the sophisticated. The rest of the restaurant’s menu, prepared by the chef David Hart, a veteran of Soho House in London, follows a similar course. It is mostly well-prepared haute nursery food with a vague Continental accent. For those who thrill to the idea of a lobster-bedecked Cobb salad with crisp bacon and slick avocado to accompany an evening gibson, or who might protest at the appearance of a dish of truffle-oiled macaroni and cheese (and then consume it happily), the restaurant is a balm. Desmond’s is a Caprice where you might actually wish to eat dinner. The space, a former bank that retains the airy solidity of a county-seat financial institution, is to match. There is a bar up front and a high hayloft terrace in the back, above a gleaming white open kitchen, with a wide and tremendously high-ceilinged dining room between them. The tables are all sheathed in thick white linen, with a heavy silver pineapple candleholder sitting in the center of each, gleaming attractively. The ratio of staff members to customers is comfortable, and the experience of eating a number of meals in the restaurant suggests that even those who are not recognizable members of Manhattan tribes receive good service. Only the art on the walls distracts: paintings of the limp Euro-pop variety and, across from them, a large square of pastel fabric that hangs with a kind of pregnancy on the restaurant’s large western wall. If you knew there was a Lucian Freud hanging behind it, it might be interesting. There is not. You may be on the Upper East Side, but not at the Met or a private home. An order of crisp-fried lobster tails with tarragon and caper mayonnaise can whisk you right back to Park Avenue and 71st Street, however. The tender, sweet little nuggets are of the sort you might run into as hors d’oeuvres at a dinner party in one of those magical old apartments where it is possible to get lost. And if they are not world-changing or radical, they are at least base and exciting. Eat one and it’s as if you are Earl Long looking at Blaze Starr for the first time. Desmond’s takes seriously the mandate to comfort the comfortable while avoiding the afflicted entirely. Smoked salmon with soft, silken scrambled eggs and a dab of caviar is a fine appetizer with a flute of Champagne. A square block of roasted, meaty pork belly arrives beside a pool of salted caramel sauce, with a bright apple salad on the side for astringency and tartness. Tuna tartare, served with watermelon and avocado, deftly avoids a clash of flavors to deliver a sense of summer excess, a barefoot weekend enjoying the fruits of hard work. The entrees do similar duty, just as tamely, almost as well. A grilled tenderloin steak had its requisite buttery taste increased by béarnaise and bone marrow. Moist, hugely flavorful lamb chops with mint and caper relish might have been served at that same dinner party where the lobster tails showed up. And a whole lobster, halved, grilled and served with butter and a thatch of French fries, called for more Champagne and a new tax bracket — it was a $40 version of whatever dish is your favorite down at the local diner. You really could eat it once a week, perhaps alternating it with a side dish of mashed potatoes with thick, luxurious gravy and a plate of the restaurant’s sweet, buttery peas. This is pensioner food for those who run pension funds. But huge seared scallops arrived with cauliflower and a mound of shredded oxtail meat in a dish perhaps best described as surf versus turf. A salad of iceberg lettuce with Cashel blue cheese and bacon delivered just those three ingredients, with the bacon uncomfortably close to burned. It mounted a powerful argument for the silliness of iceberg lettuce in general, which was sad: iceberg lettuce should be honored even if not championed. Desserts returned to aristocratic form. There is a tart lemon pudding with raspberries well worth eating if you have ever wondered about the British fascination with pudding as the pre-eminent dessert form: it was grandly silky. And a lovely dish of frozen vanilla yogurt (it is “yoghurt” at Desmond’s, naturally) with roasted strawberries tasted emphatically of the fruit. This bested toasted carrot cake with cream-cheese ice cream despite the ice cream’s rich, tangy excellence. Desmond’s is not for everyone, even if recent customers have included both George Stephanopoulos up on the balcony and the Kiss frontman Gene Simmons on the main floor. It is very expensive (the sole was $58 last week) and hardly ambitious in its cooking or its style. But that does no more harm to the quality of its food than the cost does to the plain good looks of a suit from J. Press. Pork belly to start with a Dover sole to follow (hold the shrimp). Some yoghurt? It is a kind of living.   Desmond's ★ 153 East 60th Street, Upper East Side; (212) 207-4949, desmondsny.com. ATMOSPHERE Clubbish and comfortable in the uptown senses of both.

60,Le Cirque,Two Stars,20060719,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/19/dining/reviews/ringmasters-back-stroking-the-lions.html,"RESTAURANTS, like poker players, often have tells. The tip-off to Le Cirque's inner musings and true intentions is just inside the entrance, on a table to the left. Arrayed there are copies of Sirio Maccioni's autobiography, each with his face beaming proudly, maybe even a little complacently, on the cover. A clumsy sign makes clear that they're for sale -- $29.95 each. But the display from which it rises only hints at something more important: that Le Cirque isn't peddling a particular dining experience so much as a larger legend, constructed by its ringmaster, Mr. Maccioni, over more than three decades of soufflés and stroked egos. Le Cirque means luxury. Le Cirque equals privilege. Le Cirque connotes a culinary pecking order by which the rich and famous get the best tables and others get to breathe the same air. The name has so much iconic resonance that it's molded into the butter on every table, stamped in gold on the chocolate flecks in some desserts and scrawled in red across the restroom towels. But the restaurant itself is no longer an especially exciting one, at least not in its current incarnation. The new Le Cirque, in the Bloomberg Tower in Midtown, seems to be coasting on its myth, counting on the star power of Mr. Maccioni to compensate for a menu that could use more spark and a kitchen that could show more finesse. It does a superb foie gras terrine, a sorry risotto Milanese. Its ethereal Dover sole meunière makes you believe that this fish was put into the seas to await its appointment with butter and lemon. Its drab lobster salad makes you question the crustacean's gastronomic calling. There are more imaginative dishes, including a few that nod in a voguish and perfunctory fashion to the Greenmarket or the spices and traditions of continents other than Europe. Like the subdued décor, which trades the whirl of the big top for the dignity of the boardroom, they represent attempts to bring Le Cirque into an era of diminished fussiness and less hidebound rites. But this restaurant by and large speaks the same language it has for many years, an endangered idiom of haute French and Italian cooking and profound self-regard. It does so less fluently and musically than in the past, when chefs like Daniel Boulud and, later, Sottha Khunn ushered it into chapters of four-star glory. And it feels a bit like a museum piece, at once timeless and badly dated. Of course it has celebrities -- on one starry night alone, Henry Kissinger, Bill Cosby and Helen Gurley Brown -- but I didn't see many who looked younger than 65, the exertions of their plastic surgeons notwithstanding. I detected a great deal of hair spray, spotted many pocket handkerchiefs and marveled at the gargantuan white toupee on a man who preened on a nearby banquette, seemingly unaware that a Samoyed had fallen on his head. I also experienced Le Cirque's famously split personality, half dismissive and half pampering, depending on who you are. On my first visit, when a companion and I arrived before the two other members of our party, a host let us know we should wait in the bar area not by asking or telling us to go there but by gesturing silently in that direction with his head. Most of the seats were occupied, so we stood. Over the next 10 minutes, no one asked us if we wanted a drink or anything else. After we were taken to our table, servers seemed to figure out who I was and offered to move us to prime real estate with better sightlines. (We declined.) So on a subsequent visit I sent three friends in ahead of me. One sat at the bar for 15 minutes without getting a server's attention, and a bartender quarreled with the two others when they asked that the charges for their Champagne be transferred to the table. At a place as self-consciously posh as Le Cirque, such a request should be granted instantly. But I was treated like royalty when I showed up, and on another night, when I dined with a filmmaker whom the staff also knew, soft-shell crabs, which weren't on the menu, appeared almost as soon as she mentioned an appetite for them. They were fantastic: crunchy, meaty, sweet. Almost as good were firm, exquisitely cooked ravioli with bacalao on the inside and, like an echo of the filling's saltiness, capers on the outside. And even better were the desserts, big in size and impact, including a criminally intense chocolate soufflé, a floating island that came in a majestic chalice and a multi-tier napoleon that appeared as a veritable skyscraper of light, crisp pastry. For the right diners on the right night, Le Cirque can muster a magnificent performance. The restaurant, which initially opened in 1974, has occupied two previous locations, most recently the New York Palace Hotel, where it went by Le Cirque 2000, a name with a millennial braggadocio you had to admire. Its digit-pruned successor seems taciturn by comparison, but then everything's relative. Its regal palette is burgundy and gold. Varnished ebony covers its walls. There's the expected monkey business -- monkey sketches on the plates, stuffed monkeys among the plants -- but it's kept in prudent check. The overall effect is stately, even a bit lugubrious. Pierre Schaedelin, who was the last executive chef at Le Cirque 2000, continues in that role here. The menu is new but not really novel. For every expression of ambition, like a trio of tomato treatments that include a chilled gazpacho and a tomato sorbet, there's a safe fallback, like duck glazed with honey and orange, or pan-roasted cod with mussels, clams and chorizo. For every knockout, like succulent langoustines in a light, fragrant, deftly integrated pool of red curry paste, ginger and kaffir lime, there was a fizzle, like steamed branzino stuffed with shrimp and calamari and seasoned, according to the menu, with star anise, saffron and fennel. Despite all that seafood and all those promised flavors, the dish somehow managed to be bland. A casserole of peas, spring onions and bone marrow that accompanied a pro-forma steak also defied its ingredients to achieve insipidness. The fanfare of a roasted chicken's table-side carving was more noteworthy than the bird itself. A different, ginger-inflected, chicken served at lunch was equally dull and borderline dry. But a lunchtime dish of trout amandine had incredibly moist flesh and a lavishly nutty crust. The lunch menu differs slightly from the two dinner menus: a main one and one that, after Labor Day, will be available only in the bar area. The latter menu is where the Dover sole resided, along with the roasted chicken and risotto. But it would be silly to attend this circus and bypass the center ring, which has a value that transcends the uneven food, little of which is unappealing, most of which is conventionally and unremarkably decadent, some of which (the crispy deboned pig's feet in one appetizer, the mix of peas and morels in another) is truly memorable. With its formally attired servers, puffed-up patrons and transparent hierarchy, Le Cirque clings to a kind of pomp that undid most of its competitors. It upholds a tradition that's increasingly rare. How it survives has a lot to do with Mr. Maccioni, 74, who still Cadillacs among the tables, sprinkling affirmation on the chosen few. His story and secrets are beside the path to the door.

64,Momofuku Ssam Bar,★★★,20081202,Frank Bruni,East Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/03/dining/reviews/03rest.html,"IF you’ve had just about all of the fawning over David Chang that you can take, think about how those of us dishing out the praise feel. We’d love to move on to a more original object of adoration and would be happy to pronounce him overrated or just plain over  —  we’re cranky and contrary  that way. But he won’t let us. He keeps demanding more from himself and his restaurants, keeps giving us reasons not to stray. Exhibit A: Momofuku Ssam Bar, the cornerstone of the Chang legend. It opened in the summer of 2006 and before its first birthday established itself as the go-to, drop-in mess hall for enlightened food lovers on all budgets at all hours, its menu a relatively unstructured collection of small and large dishes, its kitchen open well past midnight on weekend nights, its backless stools doled out on a first-come-first-served basis. It justly enshrined Mr. Chang as a chef who went further than any of his peers in wedding serious, sometimes challenging food and an ultra-casual, spontaneous dining ethos in tune with unbound times. And it no more wanted for business than it did for acclaim. Mr. Chang might have let Ssam Bar coast from there. He had other projects to tend to: the relocation and expansion of Momofuku Noodle Bar; the openings of Momofuku Ko and, just weeks ago, Momofuku Bakery and Milk Bar, an annex of Ssam with a major  sweet tooth. But bit by bit and month by month, he tinkered. When I gave Ssam two stars in The New York Times in February 2007, it had only a smattering of wines. Now it has about 200, smartly and creatively chosen. Back in early 2007 its only dessert was a mochi ice cream sampler. Now it has three choices, courtesy of the ascendant pastry whiz Christina Tosi, who deftly integrates salty and sweet by adding Gorgonzola to a pear sorbet and, in another dessert, sandwiching a saltine panna cotta between peanut butter pastry and a Concord grape sauce. If those aren’t enough, you can toddle down a short passageway to Milk Bar, get a cookie or a slice of pie, and eat it, standing, at one of the counters there. The late-summer renovation that created Milk Bar also reconfigured Ssam, now graced with a better layout and about 70 stools, up from 55 before. In addition, Ssam has expanded its daytime offerings, which until recently focused on Asian burritos. Now more than half of the dinner menu is available at lunch, and Ssam has abandoned the burritos, which were long its least successful items. But these advances aren’t my only prompts to reappraise it. In the last year and a half, I’ve found myself returning to Ssam again and again, and not just because new dishes regularly appear  — that happens elsewhere, too  — or because its steamed buns with pork belly remain the city’s most perfect finger food. I’ve circled back because eating at Ssam feels so unencumbered, honest and joyful, and because I can’t stop reflecting on the daring and importance of Mr. Chang’s work there. Yes, he and his team of skilled helpers demonstrate greater finesse and more culinary ambition at Ko, designed to be the polished, precious Momofuku. But you expect nothing less than excellence from a restaurant with just 12 coveted stools and a no-choice, multicourse tasting menu that lasts two hours and costs $100. At freewheeling Ssam, you can drop in for just 30 minutes, have a snack of one or two small dishes, pay just $20 for them. And yet the quality of the food  — its fastidious sourcing, vibrant seasoning and ingenious  grace notes  — isn’t dumbed down in the least for an informal context. Ssam’s best raw fish compositions  are on a painterly par with Esca’s. The whole pork butt  — meant to be eaten by six or more people  — is a pigout as fatty and fantastic as any great barbecue joint’s. Such disparate options don’t usually appear on the same menu, but Mr. Chang trusts diners not to be disoriented by an assortment of dishes without any instantly clear theme or overriding ethnic allegiance  — by platters of artisanal American hams next to a tangle of Sichuan-style beef tendon alongside a hanger steak with a romesco sauce. He pulls off this eclecticism, which could easily lapse into incoherence, by keeping the menu sufficiently succinct and making sure everything on it counts. No dish comes across as a compulsory sop to unadventurous eaters or an obligatory nod to some trend. It seems, instead, that Mr. Chang & Co. are simply feeding you what they themselves most enjoy eating. Usually that means pork, which pops up in some form in more than a third of the dishes. Often that means offal, clearly one of his passions, reflected in the terrific panko-crusted, deep-fried pig’s head torchon on the current menu. But sometimes it just means a crunchy baguette with a cow’s milk butter from Vermont and a goat’s milk butter from Britain. Ssam charges $8 for this, rightly wagering that if you really value bread and butter, you’d rather pay for something superior than get something ordinary for free. Seemingly straightforward dishes harbor attention-getting surprises, like the Dijon spaetzle with slices of duck in a relatively new entree that’s outstanding, though not as outstanding as the crisp-edged pork blade steak dressed with buttermilk, pickled ramp juice and Kewpie mayonnaise. Not all the surprises are created equal. A pumpkin chawan mushi studded with chunks of Grana Padano cheese deserves more points for seasonality and originality than for out-and-out appeal. And Ssam has irritations. There’s no hot coffee or hot tea, and that seems less an interesting aesthetic choice than a stubborn mannerism in light of their unavailability, too, at Milk Bar, which is open for breakfast. The wait for a stool can be long and the music very loud and a meal’s pace fleeter than you desire. But those realities amount to a dining idiom that suits many circumstances better than a more conventionally coddling one  —  and that’s every bit as valid. With Ssam, Mr. Chang has made as confident and compelling a case for that as any New York chef. Momofuku Ssam Bar *** 207 Second Avenue (13th Street), East Village; (212) 254-3500,   momofuku.com ATMOSPHERE A sleek, rollicking room with about 70 backless stools, many at a long counter, and a partially open kitchen.

67,Señor Frog’s,Fair,20151229,Pete Wells,Times Square Theatre District,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/dining/senor-frogs-review.html,"I was having my second Frogasm of the night when dinner got weird. Not that this or any other night at Señor Frog’s in Times Square was ever fully conventional. In point of fact, I had already danced in a conga line wearing a three-foot-high crown of yellow and orange balloons that made me look like Simba in a production of “The Lion King” staged by balloon animals. In further point of fact, I had also eaten a foot-long chili dog presented on a skateboard. Consider, too, that outside Señor Frog’s I had passed a sign promising that “Drinks go in, fun comes out!” (If nothing else, I was looking forward to seeing the restrooms.) The drink that was going in, a deviant margarita, came in a plastic cup that had a long, thrusting, curved, ridged shaft, ostensibly modeled on the trunk of a palm tree but impossible to grasp without thinking: “ribbed for her pleasure.” Still, total weirdness didn’t kick in until the ice cream truck parade. It began with an air-raid siren followed by a loudspeaker announcement: “All Señor Frog’s staff report to the kitchen!” We had said we were celebrating a birthday. (A lie.) Employees began marching across the stage, blowing whistles and waving glowsticks. Others were bearing aloft two ice cream trucks, each the size of a picnic cooler. Then a server in a light-up Santa cap stood on our table and sang, along with his colleagues, “Froggy, froggy birthday. Na-na-na-na-na. This is how we do it. Na-na-na-na-na.” (Another verse is sometimes added when it’s time to eat the cake: “Put it in your mouth, put it in your mouth.”) What happened next was captured in a fast-moving video that, like the Zapruder film, I have watched dozens of times. There is a piece of paper on a stick planted in a birthday cake. Then it is on fire. The birthday boy tries to blow it out. He fails. A powerful wind comes out of nowhere. It raises sparks from the fire. The birthday boy’s balloon hat starts to tremble, then shoots straight up in the air like an Apollo rocket. It hits the ceiling. Chaos reigns. Many thoughts went through my head at that moment. I wondered, briefly, why anyone trusted me with an expense account. But the dominant idea was: Señor Frog’s, where have you been all my life? I came to Señor Frog’s later than most of its customers. Founded in Mexico in 1969, the chain thrives in Caribbean beach towns and caters to college students on spring break who will fake orgasms on stage to win a margarita. I wasn’t one of them. My most memorable spring break was whiled away in my room reading “The Sorrows of Young Werther” in German. This did not get me invited to many orgasm contests, but I was inclined to think the time with Goethe had been well spent until Señor Frog’s opened on 42nd Street last summer. For the first time, I wished I had some memories of the chain. So when I ate there, I brought people who had gone to Señor Frog’s in their wilder years. Unfortunately, none of them recalled anything about it, either. One volunteered that he had climbed onto a giant speaker at the Cancún branch and danced furiously, a fact he knows only because witnesses later told him about it. “I think I went on a water slide,” said a woman who had also unwound in Cancún. “But I can’t remember where it ended.” “In jail,” her husband said. There is no water slide at the Times Square location, which offers a more sober and family-friendly version of the Frog experience. (“Do not show underwear,” the dress code posted at the door warns.) In early evening the place is filled with children, like the two who got up to sing “Let It Go” and gamely karaoked away when a blizzard of confetti snow erupted from the foot of the stage. Later the crowd got older, with more New Yorkers and fewer tourists than I had expected. Cocktails in embarrassing palm-tree vessels abounded, but I never saw anybody get really tanked, myself included, even after multiple Frogasms. All the mixed drinks seemed tame, and the shot that a server squirted into my open mouth when I hopped by in the conga line tasted like orange Gatorade. Señor Frog’s is not a good restaurant by most conventional measures, including the fairly basic one of serving food. One night I got just two of the half-dozen appetizers I had asked for. Another time, the starters showed up on schedule, but after nearly two hours the main courses still had not appeared. “What happened to our food?” we finally asked. “That’s what I’m wondering!” our server said brightly. “Like, where is it?” Getting just half of what you order at Señor Frog’s can be a blessing if it’s the right half. The chili, rich and chocolate-brown, does just what you want it to do for the thick, juicy hot dog or the nachos, whose chips were flaccid one night but crunchy another. Honey-sriracha wings, which ping-pong between sweet and spicy, are preferable to the Buffalo wings, which taste like a mild case of acid reflux. The ribs meet chain-restaurant standards, and so does the pulled pork sandwich once you scrape off the questionable coleslaw. You can get far worse guacamole at far more serious restaurants. (All other restaurants are more serious than Señor Frog’s.) The Reuben is good, for some reason. Most other things I tried may as well have stayed in the kitchen, except the chicken enchiladas, which should have been sent back to Cancún. I thought they tasted like tuna, but a more acute observer said the flavor was like pork sprinkled with fish food. But … here, hold my Frogasm, I need to stand on the speakers and dance. Because I had more fun at Señor Frog’s than at almost any other restaurant that has opened in the last few years. True, it’s a particular kind of fun: compulsory hilarity, scheduled spontaneity, a scripted theater of the inane with random outbreaks of mediocre Tex-Mex. Señor Frog’s brand of fun is so mindless that it’s embarrassing to give in to at first, but eventually everybody I brought there did give in, maybe because we’re all so desperate to let go a little bit. In the 1980s and ’90s it was a cliché to say restaurants had become theater. Hardly anyone says that now, because it’s not true anymore. A few chefs and restaurateurs still understand that people go out to have a good time; Daniel Humm would serve a chili dog on a skateboard if he had thought of it first. But too many restaurants have become church without the singing and costumes. The next time you’re in one of those places, try starting a conga line. If you’re asked to leave, there’s a place in Times Square that’s ready to welcome you as long as you keep your underwear out of sight."
69,Centro Vinoteca,★,20071017,Frank Bruni,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/17/dining/reviews/17rest.html,"ANYTIME Anne Burrell gets near hot oil, I want to be around. The woman can fry. And if that doesn’t sound like a real achievement, or a real compliment, you’re not getting out much. There’s some nasty, soggy, greasy business out there. But not at the new Italian restaurant Centro Vinoteca, where Ms. Burrell, her messy blond hair held up by a glittering headband, jitters and skitters through a tiny open kitchen like a punk rocker doing a panting encore. Some of her energy is going to waste. Not the energy that’s going into frying. Here’s the ordering guide you need for Centro Vinoteca: if you see the word fried, or if you see any apparent derivation of the Italian word fritto (which means fried), or if you see a word that calls to mind either of those other ones (e.g. fritter), get whatever it’s attached to. And get anything else that you suspect may be fried. With this strategy you’ll find your way to the small whole cippolini onions, each wearing a crisp wisp of a casing that speeds you to the inside, which pops juicily in your mouth. And to the wedges of fried cauliflower, whose thicker casing carries the sharp, salty punch of a generous dose of Parmesan. The arancine, or fried rice balls, have none of the leadenness that afflicts many of their kin. But they have an exterior-interior contrast similar to the onions’, only what’s inside is a molten mix including fontina and ham. All of these treats appear on a special card titled piccolini, which means very small things, that you’re given as soon as  you sit down. It’s a big moment right now for very small things, which permit the very persuasive illusion that you’re eating only very small amounts while you’re in fact racking up very large quantities of food. It’s wise to linger over the piccolini — the best of which  include a pistachio-flecked mortadella spread and figs stuffed with Gorgonzola — partly because they’re so enjoyable and partly because the subsequent appetizers, pasta dishes and main courses chart a bumpier course. Both on and off the plate, Centro can alternately elate and deflate you. It’s owned by Sasha Muniak, who also operates the Mangia chain and, more to the point, Gusto, another Italian restaurant in Greenwich Village. To oversee the kitchen, he recruited Ms. Burrell, whose résumé includes time at Felidia, in Italy and — the current era’s crowning touch — on TV. She works as Mario Batali’s sous-chef on “Iron Chef America.” To design the restaurant, Mr. Muniak tapped Thomas Juul-Hansen, who transformed Perry St. into a pale, minimalist jewel. Centro has a similarly spare glamour, its chocolate-colored banquettes set against white brick walls. From the ceiling dangle sparkly, translucent chandeliers that reminded me of the crystalline ice cave that Marlon Brando’s character inhabited in “Superman.” Centro is where Jor-El would get his salumi misti. The restaurant’s pedigree, flourishes and consciousness of trends (not just salumi and piccolini but also the availability of many thoughtfully selected wines by the quartino instead of the glass) announce its determination to be a bona fide hot spot. So does the lack of any discernible effort to diminish the screeching noise on the main, street-level floor, where the crowd around the semicircular bar leaves you almost no room for loitering if your table isn’t ready. Try to get seated upstairs. Grovel. Trade your firstborn child if it’s the only way. An annoyance in addition to the deafening commotion is the presentation of that piccolini card apart from the rest of the menu, so that you can’t evaluate your interest in these snacks, which take on a compulsory air, before you’ve seen your other options. Is this method designed to guarantee larger aggregate food orders and higher tabs? The menu itself doesn’t prompt such cynical thoughts. More than the chefs at many other Italian newcomers downtown, Ms. Burrell fashions bold dishes meant to snap you to attention instead of cautious ones that lull you into complacency. I admired her approach even when the results disappointed me. I wasn’t wowed  by an appetizer of what she calls calamari noodles, which turned squid into squiggly strands that were a textural disaster. Without any sear, char or crunch on the outside, the calamari was just plain wormy. A much better starter of braised oxtail cakes captured the gusto and up-to-the-precipice saltiness of some of Ms. Burrell’s best cooking. The big-flavored ingredients on top of a thin-crusted, super-crunchy rectangular pizza appetizer included stracchino cheese in place of mozzarella and spicy pork sausage. In tune with these times, she’s a pig-and-sausage lover, and this serves the best of a number of excellent pasta dishes. A tangle of pici  —  like much thicker, hand-rolled spaghetti — stood up nicely to a sweet and spicy pork sausage ragù whose forcefulness and liberal application would have overwhelmed a flimsier noodle. Crispy nuggets of guanciale, along with a pleasant degree of heat from peperoncino, worked magic in bucatini all’amatriciana. But Ms. Burrell went overboard with a sloppy, heavy amalgam of lamb Bolognese, fried onions and fried gnocchi — it’s the fried exception that proves the fried rule. Her judgment erred as well with overly bitter broccoli rabe and Swiss chard ravioli. It’s revealing that among the main courses, a bony, limp-skinned baby chicken and two kinds of fish — mushy skate, overcooked red snapper  — paled next to juicy slices of rib eye and my favorite entree, a mixture of rabbit, pork sausage (again!) and pine nuts pressed into thick, broad coins. You obviously have to plan for dessert, and for two reasons you should. One is the cappuccino panna cotta — a loose pudding, really — that’s given accents that cleverly touch on, and bring together, elements of cappuccino: chocolate-covered espresso beans,  a salty chocolate and cinnamon shortbread cookie. Another is a silky, subtly tangy goat-cheese cake. As best I could tell, nothing on the dessert list is fried. Among other possible adjustments, Centro Vinoteca may want to revisit that.

73,Niko,★,20110412,Sam Sifton,SoHo,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/13/dining/reviews/13rest.html,"COBI LEVY was greeting guests at the top of the stairs at Niko, his new restaurant in the second-floor space on Mercer Street that used to be Honmura An. He did so with cool professionalism, apparent disdain or bro-hugging intensity, as the situation demanded. His eyes scanned the room constantly, a driver watching his mirrors, keeping an eye on his gauges, going fast at night, destination certain. Around him were blousy models smelling of soap, bearded European men smelling of cigarettes, their tables full of fried chicken, silken tofu and what seemed like miles of sashimi. James Murphy was playing on the sound system. SoHo streetlights glinted through the tall loft windows up front. Mr. Levy is wide-shouldered and tight-suited, with careful hair and a saturnine expression. He glides as big cats do: a little sulky and totally in charge. He passed a new guest off to the crowded bar and returned to his post, the welcoming smile on his face vanishing as if someone had thrown a switch. He might have been Don Draper fast-forwarded out of “Mad Men” and into a new decade and a new line of work, and if he were nervous about this turn of events, it would be the last thing he would ever allow an observer to see. Niko is a Japanese restaurant, basically. Hiro Sawatari, formerly of Sushi Yasuda, runs the sushi bar, cutting fish below a collection of bobble-head dolls depicting baseball stars. James London and Marina Schulze operate the hot kitchen, bookending Mr. Sawatari’s fish with Tokyo-style fried chicken and steak basted in Suntory whiskey, among other offerings. There is a tight and interesting list of wines put together by Laura Maniec, with some good values to be found amid the broker-bait pinot noirs. Dessert is not offered, beyond a collection of complimentary mochi pills that are relatively unappetizing. Particularly good are the starters. An appetizer of “soy-burnt” octopus brings tender, caramelized tentacles set amid a salad of watermelon radish and kiwi fruit, with macerated cucumber as a kind of dressing: salty sweet, with a crunch. Another offers a collection of mild West Coast seaweeds interspersed with persimmons and pumpkin seeds, then enlivened by a jalapeño vinaigrette. There is a tempura-salad hand roll built around a soft and flavorful hunk of fried sweet potato, with greens to balance its meatiness and a ginger-yuzu dressing zipping along the top, a melody to remember. Soft cubes of tofu in a dashi broth are offset by shiitakes and a peppery zing of watercress. The combination is terrific, a soup and salad made one. And red king crab legs are sweet and excellent, served with drawn butter and a bean-sprout kimchi: get these if you can. Mr. Sawatari’s sushi is estimable. (Some of the fish is from the southern and western coasts of Japan, where the menu declares the fish “entirely safe to eat, as judged by local health officials and the F.D.A.”) It is also fashionably green, with another menu note declaring that the restaurant’s fish is gathered in accordance with the guidelines of both the Marine Stewardship Council and the Monterey Bay Aquarium. So there is plenty of sustainably harvested mackerel, shellfish, fluke, salmon and char — and no bluefin tuna. (The restaurant uses Kindai instead, a farmed tuna that is a subject of much debate among fish fanatics, over its effect on the environment.) All of it is competently prepared, perfectly delicious and — in the dining room, at least — delivered by a staff that seems woefully underprepared to talk about it. At this late stage in the life of our oceans, and particularly in a restaurant that trumpets its allegiance to sustainable fishing, the answer to the question, “What kind of tuna is this?” cannot be “Um, toro?” No such bumbling occurs with the hot food. “This is dry-aged Creekstone beef,” a waiter says proudly, delivering to the table a beautiful slab, rosy red below its crisp, griddled crust, faintly smoky from its whiskey bath. It is great. So, too, are the nuggets of crisp fried chicken served with a fiery mayonnaise and the sweet crisp shrimp with sriracha salt, all suitable for sharing. The single-portion entrees are also quite good, in particular a miso-cured salmon with Asian pear and celery root, and the sansho-glazed pork cheek served with collards, a crisp pig tail and a gently poached egg. A slow-roasted spicy chicken served with consommé can improve a mood immediately, and sustain it for hours afterward. Still, the point of Niko is not really the food, though good food will bring people to the restaurant and keep them coming back despite the din that rises in the room when the hour grows late. The important thing about Niko is the scene that Mr. Levy is attempting to build in conjunction with the food: a crowd that is mostly modish and young, though still welcoming to the occasional group of people who remember the old days at Honmura An, when Yoko Ono sat in a quiet table by the windows, and everyone knew Leo Castelli by sight. The design of the place, by Rafael de Cárdenas, helps: it reads more as a thoughtful renovation than a total teardown. People with Wooster Group subscriptions, Yamamoto suits and homes out east will be comfortable dining at Niko, at least early in the evening, before the room grows loud. The restaurant feels like homage to the SoHo that once was. It is mostly pleasant and warm. It is exceedingly handsome. But maintaining that vibe is a delicate balance. Mr. Levy’s last restaurant, Charles, was exclusive to the point of silliness, with no sign, papered-over windows and reservations available only to those well known to the house. “If my dad walked in and he didn’t tell them he was my father,” Mr. Levy told The New York Times in an interview last October, “we would have shoved him in the corner and said, ‘See you next week.’ ” Niko is not nearly that bad. Mr. Levy is not so obviously making people feel unwelcome. Instead, he has created something old-fashioned and rare, a restaurant with good food run by the guy who actually owns the business, devoted to its regulars. Mr. Levy plays fair by those rules, a New Yorker to his core. For him, all are welcome. And everyone else can scram.   Niko ★ 170 Mercer Street (Houston Street), SoHo; (212) 991-5650; helloniko.com.

75,Eleven Madison Park,Two Stars,20050223,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/23/dining/sometimes-a-great-notion.html,"IF anyone has cracked the code for high-end restaurants in this fickle city, it's Danny Meyer. Beginning with the opening of the Union Square Cafe two decades ago, he has time and again proven his ability to figure out what attracts diners, what pleases them and what turns them into besotted loyalists. The Zagat Survey for New York is his annual validation. In the 2005 edition Mr. Meyer's restaurants rank as the most popular (Gramercy Tavern), second most popular (Union Square), 13th (Eleven Madison Park) and 19th (Tabla). His magic touch explains why he was awarded the contract for the restaurants and cafes in the newly renovated Museum of Modern Art. If you want a smash hit, you go to the producer with the most gold records. How does he do it? Over recent months I visited and revisited Eleven Madison Park, making side trips to several of his other winners, with that question in mind. The answer came quickly into focus. Better than any other New York restaurateur Mr. Meyer knows how to achieve sophistication without self-consciousness, polish without pretension. His restaurants reach for culinary excellence without visibly or palpably straining. (If anything, they seem to be on automatic pilot, with all that implies.) They blend varying degrees of elegance with the homey feeling -- an illusion, given the rush on reservations -- that you can just drop in. And they never lose their grounding in an understanding that when you plunk down good money for what you hope will be a special meal, you want not only to feel privileged but also to feel appreciated. At Eleven Madison, for example, there are smiles on the faces of everyone who greets or serves you and smiles in the voices of everyone who takes a reservation. Always using pseudonyms, I repeatedly called to adjust the size of my group or the time of our arrival. Not once did I encounter the kind of huffiness that restaurants as busy as this one often project. Eleven Madison, which opened in October 1998, was and is a born crowd pleaser, starting with its dramatic situation: an expansive space in the old Metropolitan Life Building with marble floors, marble walls and ceilings that soar straight to heaven. Its grandeur is crucially tempered by the coziness of the seating arrangement, which puts nearly every table along a banquette. The menu, long without being unwieldy, has something for everyone, assiduously balancing adventurousness and accessibility. Rather than choose between trendy Arctic char and tired salmon, Eleven Madison offers and does right by both, especially the char, its succulent flesh tucked beneath a thin, crispy layer of skin. The appetizers include sautéed sweetbreads and a pig's feet croquette, and among the entrees are a roasted loin and a braised shank of venison. But there's also the populist tuna tartare, the requisite roast chicken and the dutiful aged rib eye for two, not to mention an unforgettable dish of roasted lobster atop a squash and lemon grass velouté. That lemon grass represents a rare Asian accent on a menu that otherwise mines a Continental vein. The chef, Kerry Heffernan, doesn't take many steep flights of culinary fancy, but he draws from a diverse garden of vegetables to bracket and crown his creations. He composes his dishes with an eye to prettiness and a sense of opulence, manifest in one of the best appetizers, a warm fricassee of delicately roasted root vegetables -- carrots, beets, parsnips -- that fan out like multicolored sunbeams from an intense goat cheese and black truffle parfait. For another photogenic appetizer there's the wild mushroom martini, a mushroom soup that's been given the outfit and contours of a cocktail and the striated company of spinach, poached egg and apple-wood bacon. Or the blue Hubbard squash flan, rich but not overwhelmingly so, with a pucklike shape and a hue not unlike that of Christo's ""Gates."" Mr. Heffernan seems to have a special gift for flanlike textures, shared by that goat cheese parfait and a cauliflower royale that is part of a seared squid appetizer. As a reflection of the seasons, the squash flan will be replaced soon by an English pea flan. I bet it will be terrific. The best of Mr. Heffernan's food is. But much of his food is unremarkable and some of it is poorly executed. That chicken was overcooked. Those sweetbreads were dry. Zinfandel-marinated beef cheeks tasted like day-old pot roast and came to the table almost cold. A frisée aux lardon was overdressed. Even when nothing goes wrong, it's possible to glide through a meal at Eleven Madison Park and not be stopped short by the taste of something truly wonderful. As with many mass-appeal mega-hits, there's a fetching melody but an absent jazz. At least until the end. The desserts by the restaurant's immensely talented pastry chef, Nicole Kaplan, continue the theme of geometrically appealing compositions, but they crank up the volume of pure pleasure. A white chocolate and passion fruit tart and a raspberry mille-feuille with ice wine granité were divine. So were a chocolate, peanut butter and banana medley and a chocolate and caramel meditation. But top honors went to a collection of tiny cookies and cakes that struck me as a paean to Mr. Meyers's recipe for restaurants, a metaphor for his bridging of the everyday and the elite. Many of these confections were upscale riffs on downscale classics: haute Ho-Ho's, fancy Oreos, refined and miniaturized Hostess crumb cakes. There were 16 of these treats in all, reflecting the prudently generous dessert portions. Mr. Meyers knows that parting glances are the ones that linger. Like his other restaurants, Eleven Madison is user-friendly on all levels. It has a long list of wines by the glass, each also available by the half-glass. It has a special bar snacks. But its skin shines brighter than its soul. Although the dining room is flooded with those smiling servers, their dance is less a ballet than a military drill, glaringly mechanized. They hastily lower and lift plates. They scoop horseradish crème fraîche onto braised short ribs as if spackling walls. That observation does not rise to the level of a complaint; it's more a rumination on the limitations of all formulas, even Mr. Meyer's. You can hone fine dining into a science, but you may lose out on some of the art. Eleven Madison Park  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  11 Madison Avenue (24th Street); (212)889-0905.

78,Sip Sak,One Star,20060823,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/23/dining/reviews/a-turkish-chef-playing-hideandseek.html,"THE best dish I had at Sip Sak, an artfully constructed lamb gyro platter, isn't on the menu. Neither are the terrific stuffed meatballs, versions of kibbe with beef, pine nuts and mint. Or the outstanding lamb sausage. Or, for that matter, the Turkish pizza, which is really Syrian pizza, made with a thin, soft crust that's folded over toppings of minced lamb and tomato, so the end product looks more like an omelet or even a burrito. Why so secretive? Sip Sak's principal owner and chef, Orhan Yegen, said in a recent telephone conversation that these dishes hinge on fresh ingredients that the kitchen might run out of, or on labor-intensive preparations that can't always be sustained during busy periods. Since he can't promise them, he said, he doesn't put them in writing. I wonder. His explanation doesn't cover the sausage, made in advance. It doesn't address why servers don't bother to mention these dishes, even when they're available, unless asked about them directly. No, I think Mr. Yegen likes to be difficult. He's one of the New York restaurant scene's greatest and most befuddling characters, and Sip Sak mirrors his personality. It's a kooky artist's warped -- and sometimes wonderful -- canvas. Never heard of him? I'll bet you've heard of at least one of his restaurants, because he's caromed through an insane number, seldom staying long. He helped start Turkish Kitchen back in the early 1990's. He went on to cook at Efendi, Beyoglu, Deniz, Dervish and Divane, among other restaurants, some long gone. At some of these places, he would immodestly prime diners for rapture, telling them that they were receiving their first true glimpse of Turkish cooking. (He was born and reared in Turkey.) He's nothing if not grandiloquent, though age has mellowed him. Now 50, he has moments when his voice is inflected with something that sounds suspiciously like self-effacement. ""I used to say I'm the best food you can eat,"" he told me. ""These days I can't say that. I'm not able to catch every mistake anymore."" Sip Sak opened in 2004 but didn't take on the contours of a conventional full-service restaurant until this year, when Mr. Yegen erected a bar just inside the entrance, where several cases for prepared food had been. The restaurant's name, which means fast or instant in Turkish, is pronounced ""ship shock."" Past the bar is a deep, unadorned dining room with sunshine-colored walls. And in that dining room, during a typical lunch or dinner, is a crowd that speaks to why this city maintains such a splendid array of restaurants. These people, it seems, don't come to Sip Sak out of ethnic allegiance: few of them look Turkish. They don't come for an electric scene, which doesn't exist, or the wine list, which is meager. But they know special food at special prices when they taste it, and they reward its providers. The most expensive dish on Sip Sak's menu is $17.50. As you would expect, lamb, eggplant and yogurt reign supreme, but they don't always assume predictable forms. The lamb gyro platter, called iskander, had at its base a layer of sautéed cubes of pita bread, crunchy outside and spongy within. They swam in garlicky yogurt and tomato sauces. On top went the gyro meat: thin, fatty shavings with real lamb flavor and crisp edges. Mr. Yegen's yogurt sauces were lighter, more garlicky and less tart than the ones you find elsewhere, and that's one reason a dish of handmade manti, a sort of Turkish tortellini, was so sublime. But the dumplings themselves made an important contribution. They were delicate and so tiny that the ground beef in their centers came as a surprise. I'm convinced that Mr. Yegen performs some incantation as he whisks eggplant, olive oil, garlic and lemon into a silky spread that he calls eggplant salad, because while none of the ingredients are unusual, they attained an astonishing richness and smokiness. That spread was served with triangular wedges of a bread that was like crunchier, fluffier focaccia. It put the usual pita to shame, and it stood ready to convey the restaurant's excellent tarama, made with cod roe, and its hummus as well. Between Sip Sak's peaks lie many valleys. Lamb kebabs were gorgeous on one visit but grainy on another. Patties of ground chicken with red peppers were moist, but a dish of chicken kebabs was arid. Cubes of baked lamb over an eggplant purée were overcooked, as was a whole branzino. Stumble across enough of this low ground and you're not so willing to overlook the unimpressive desserts, the unfilled water glasses and the fact that you're so much better off if you happen to know about the unadvertised dishes before you show up. A friend had clued my companions and me in, and Mr. Yegen, his graying ponytail hanging low, stopped by to congratulate us on our savvy. He said he wasn't really interested in less committed eaters. ""It's why I never advertise,"" he said. ""I don't want all kinds of diners. I want one kind of diner."" That's a strange business plan. But if you get to know Mr. Yegen just a little, it's not a surprising one. Sip Sak  * [Rating: One Star]  928 Second Avenue (49th Street), East Side; (212) 583-1900. ATMOSPHERE -- A plain yellow-walled room with dim lighting, decent space between the 65 seats and room for the eccentric owner, Orhan Yegen, to roam.  SOUND LEVEL -- Very loud when crowded.

79,Jovia,One Star,20051207,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/07/dining/reviews/looking-for-a-nod-by-winking-at-italy.html,"VENETIAN glass dangles from the ceiling, Campari spikes one of its signature cocktails, and polenta and prosciutto come out to play. But at the gorgeous and perplexing new restaurant Jovia, Italy seems less a calling than a calculation, less a matter of inspiration than a case of opportunism. Jovia smartly and necessarily introduces itself not as an Italian restaurant but as an American restaurant with Italian influences, giving itself wiggle room without solving an essential problem. None of a half-dozen pasta, risotto and gnocchi dishes to which it devotes the middle section of its dinner menu was an unqualified success during my visits, and several of them were qualified failures. They can be skipped in favor of the appetizers listed above them and the entrees listed below, but they raise larger questions that aren't as easily overlooked. Is the food at Jovia as heartfelt and wisely considered as it is self-consciously conceived? Is there enough sheer gusto behind the cooking, whether that cooking is entirely or negligibly Italian? Beyond the fettuccine, does the payoff equal the promise? It often didn't. The menu read better than it ate. The dishes looked better than they tasted. Jovia's chef, Josh DeChellis, 32, caught restaurant lovers' attention at Sumile, which opened in Greenwich Village just two years ago and marked his first stint as the chief steward of a menu and a kitchen. Working with Japanese ingredients and flavors but paying as much heed to his own imagination, he paired octopus with pickled watermelon, built a tasting menu around cherry blossoms and received rapturous notices. He was hired to be the executive chef at Jovia by Stephen and Thalia Loffredo, who are also the owners of the restaurant Zoë in SoHo. With the help of the designer Jeffrey Beers, the Loffredos have given him a stunningly attractive stage in the broad Upper East Side town house that the restaurant Rouge used to inhabit. The downstairs bar and lounge is decked out in deep woods and red leather chairs. A grand, gleaming staircase just beyond those chairs points and leads the way to two dining rooms. The front one has tall, broad windows overlooking East 62nd Street and a vibe that's at once classic and contemporary. A diner could happily linger here for many hours. And a diner would indeed be happy with the best of Mr. DeChellis's dishes. Combined with the best of the desserts (courtesy of Monica Bellissimo, the pastry chef) and the setting, those dishes can make for a sumptuous evening. Among a diverse collection of appetizers, which range from delicate, crudo-style seafood compositions to an almost insanely rich mix of duck egg, braised rabbit, bacon and snails, there was a clear and compelling standout: a terrine built from layers of duck liver mousse and suckling pig meat. These appetizers included the most successful of the restaurant's overtly Italian efforts: little ravioli in a beef consommé that had presence but not too much, buoyancy as well as depth. The ravioli were filled not just with cheese -- taleggio, in this case -- but also with dates, which provided murmurs of sweetness that lightened everything else. Fowl seems to bring out the best in Mr. DeChellis. One of the most enjoyable entrees was layers of duck and quail breast, which had been poached slowly in a plastic bag, sliced thinly, and served with a mash of sunchokes and duck fat. Another winner was a chicken breast cooked in a similar fashion; sauced with bacon, tomatoes and olives; and served with a roulade of chicken leg meat, pork fat and parmesan. Mr. DeChellis works hard to make loin of venison memorable. He briefly sears the flesh and then, to bake it, places it in a pot with juniper branches (from a bush in the kitchen) and roasted chestnuts on the bottom and a caul of pastry on the top. The process yielded lovely nuances of flavor, but the sear didn't quite take, and the venison possessed a through-and-through, surface-to-center sameness in consistency that characterized too much of the meat and seafood at Jovia. Late into one dinner a frustrated friend asked: ""Do they even have an open flame in the kitchen?"" Although his sous vide dishes work, they signal an attachment to sponginess that Mr. DeChellis takes too far. It's not the only oddity in his approach to texture. He contrives textural echoes instead of contrasts, blurring the boundaries between components in several dishes. The grilled octopus and fingerling potatoes in an appetizer salad blended into each other, as did small chunks of cod and the potato gnocchi in one of the dishes on that middle section of the menu. In another of those dishes, warmed oysters represented another slippery effect in a risotto that didn't hold its ground so well in the first place. ""It's a lovely soup,"" said the same friend. This risotto also had bacon and porcini in it, and the gnocchi had duck sausage and mussel broth. But neither had as much flavor as these ingredients suggested they would and should. Their flat effect was repeated to varying degrees in several pasta dishes, including tagliatelle with wild mushrooms and fettuccine with an asparagus and hazelnut pesto. One night several friends and I watched a man at a nearby table pour an alarming volume of salt onto that fettuccine. We figured him for a rube, until our own serving of fettuccine arrived and we too craved salt. The best pasta dish I tried was confined to the lunch menu: nicely cooked rigatoni with muddled tomato, sweet sausage and a delightful balance of acidity and oiliness. Apart from the pasta, Jovia's flirtation with Italy is evident in such tweaks as mascarpone spinach instead of creamed spinach and a limoncello sabayon with lemon poundcake. It's also reflected in the wine list, heavy on Italian selections. Some of the bottles have not just prices next to them but also numerical rankings from the Wine Spectator. The Loffredos set off debate 13 years ago when they opened Zoë and employed the same device there. By Jovia's own admission, its relationship with Italy is indeed just a flirtation, not a full-blown romance. But it consumes enough of Jovia's energies and claims enough of its menu to call for more palpable amore than Jovia musters.

85,Tenpenny,★,20110531,Sam Sifton,Midtown East,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/01/dining/reviews/tenpenny-in-midtown-nyc-restaurant-review.html,"YOU may hardly believe it, walking in through the narrow, undistinguished lobby of the Gotham Hotel on East 46th Street to enter Tenpenny at the end of the hall. It looks like a half-finished Bennigan’s in there, all brick face and wood and half-filled bookshelves, with room on the walls for flair. A skylight in the rear of the dining room offers a view up the backsides of surrounding skyscrapers: it is the view from the bottom of a well. This is a good restaurant? Against heavy odds, it is. This place has all the charm of a lobby bar in Albany, and produces a similar mood. But an order of the spring vegetables on the appetizer menu provides the first inkling that at Tenpenny, all is not what it appears. The dish brings peas and wax beans and favas and more. Some are roasted, some pickled, some crisped, some raw, some candied. Everything sits on cookie crumbles that are really caramelized sunchokes, and there is a fine dusting of ranch-dressing powder over the top. Now concentrate on the flavors that are contained on this plate — each vegetable’s taste magnified by the dust to its maximum intensity. Crazy! It is great to eat this, and to imagine yourself telling friends how you used to eat the chef Chris Cipollone’s food back when he was cooking in that grim hotel space in Midtown. Start with a drink, which may help erase the image of the white-jeaned British tourists struggling with their wheelie bags near the hostess stand in the restaurant’s front, of the long table of office friends near the bar shouting at one another in place of conversation. Jeffrey Tascarella, who owns Tenpenny with Mr. Cipollone — and who works its dining room with the same good humor and cool professionalism that brought him success as the chef Scott Conant’s floor boss and wine director at Scarpetta, in the meatpacking district — has built for Tenpenny an unpretentious and clever group of cocktails to accompany his smart and largely Italian wine list. He offers a super manhattan with root beer extract, and a wicked Negroni to boot. The best option for the current season is an elixir Mr. Tascarella calls the Unstrung Harp. It contains prosecco, Gosling’s dark rum, a splash of ginger syrup and another of lime juice, and comes with a lot of ice in a gigantic stemmed glass. It is a drink for summer holidays and house-guest excess. It would be an excellent start to a bender at Ina Garten’s house in East Hampton. Some of Mr. Cipollone’s appetizers would fit right in during just such a long weekend. His salad of baby lettuces with crispy tomato and fennel, served with a drizzle of white balsamic vinegar over a thick purée of pistachios, would be perfect to eat outside on a terrace under a full moon, with a slight breeze off the water. It is only somewhat less enjoyable in the restaurant itself. Crisp artichokes with a bright and eggy lemon aioli invoke similar feelings, with the added delight of smoked trout roe to mix with the aioli. It is just right. Mr. Cipollone is a vegetable shaman. But it is no error to start a meal with some of his heavier offerings as well. There is a terrific appetizer of sea scallops with scallion sauce, beautifully dressed with crisp chicken skin and soft chanterelles, and another of potato-flaked pork belly chunks crisped into the shape of Tater Tots, with a hard-cider glaze that stops the fat. Steak tartare comes slicked with quail egg and seasoned with Parmesan crumble and crisp watercress. This is food to give pause, intricately flavored and plated with an emphasis on beauty. It is ambitious and fascinating, much more so than the plain wooden tables, lunchtime burgers menu and vapid, anonymous atmosphere would suggest. The dinner entrees hammer home the point: a marvelous tangle of black-garlic spaghettini with lump crab and chorizo, with charred scallions, say; or a sweet pan-seared chicken breast served with a thigh-meat roulade spiced with cardamom, cinnamon, clove and turmeric, with a green garlic purée beneath it, and roasted Romanesco on the side. There is a golden portion of seared halibut below a fan of dehydrated Meyer lemon, above braised artichokes and potatoes in a slightly sour white wine sauce, with an intense purée of calamata olives. One bite: wow. (Take a glance around to share the excitement, see only people eating the bar chips as they yap into mobile phones.) And there is a pork rack to recall the chop Mr. Cipollone cooked when he was chef de cuisine at Faustina, the restaurant in the Cooper Square Hotel where he and Mr. Tascarella met, became friends and were introduced to the company that would eventually bring them to the Gotham. (Faustina, which belonged to Mr. Conant and was run by Mr. Tascarella, has since closed.) Luscious beneath its crisp skin, with a powerful bourbon sauce, delightfully bitter greens and a small savory apple pie that sets forth beautifully the argument for the combination of fruit and meat, it is an entree of great seriousness of purpose and a lovely follow to the vegetable plate that could begin every evening meal. Besides the regular menu, Mr. Cipollone and Mr. Tascarella serve tasting menus, the best and most dangerous of which is the six-course “drunken taste.” This offers a greatest-hits look at Mr. Cipollone’s menu paired with selections from Mr. Tascarella’s collections not simply of wine, but of beer and grain alcohol. (A rye boilermaker accompanies the last-course pork rack.) “The aim is intoxication,” Mr. Tascarella said one night last week. “And so far we’re batting 1,000.” That average is not true for the desserts, though a minor-league joke would be taking things too far. The list is simply too brief to compete with Mr. Cipollone’s savory offerings. Neither he nor Mr. Tascarella seems much interested in pushing sweets, anyway: only a small selection of petits fours accompanies their six-course tasting menus. (Your best bet of the five à la carte dessert options: a selection of shaved, compressed, crisped and diced fruit that is meant to mirror the appetizer vegetable plate. Avoid the coconut Catalan.) Tenpenny is not the prettiest restaurant, nor does it offer diners a compelling reason to visit beyond the promise of good food in a weird environment, amid customers who have arrived there seemingly by chance. But if it were in Brooklyn or on Avenue A, you might have already heard about it from your coolest friend, and you would probably have to wait in a long line to get in and pay for your meal in cash. Here in dead-at-night Midtown, at the heart of the city’s grid, you can simply call for a reservation, before Mr. Tascarella and Mr. Cipollone check out of hotels for good."
86,Annisa,★★★,20100622,Sam Sifton,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/23/dining/reviews/23rest.html,"TEN years ago this summer, Anita Lo opened Annisa on Barrow Street in Greenwich Village. The restaurant was quietly ambitious. It was the sort of place serious couples went to for serious dinner dates, elegant without being fussy, adult. The décor was beige and said little. The point was on the plate: food that was vaguely Asian and informed by classical French technique. This was still a novel conceit, then. In the years since, Ms. Lo has tried on the roles of television celebrity chef and food-world entrepreneur. She showed up on “Iron Chef America” and defeated Mario Batali in what that program called “Battle: Mushrooms.” More recently, she was a contestant on the ill-punctuated “Top Chef Masters.” She started a fast-food-style dumpling business that has waxed and waned. She opened and closed a short-lived barbecue restaurant on Bleecker Street. Then, in the early hours of July 4, 2009, an electrical fire broke out in the kitchen of Annisa, and the restaurant was destroyed. Ms. Lo and her business partner, Jennifer Scism, who is the restaurant’s manager, host and wine director, vowed to rebuild the space. Negotiations with insurance companies and the landlord ensued: New York City, just as you imagined it. Ms. Lo’s days as a high flier might have been over. But Annisa reopened in April, scrubbed and clean and new. And the food Ms. Lo is cooking there is as good as any she has made in her career. The dining room was given a feng shui treatment, courtesy of a  design consultant, Doris Ingber. There is now an auspicious mirror in the raised room, some red accents and a few life-force trinkets here and there to keep the whole scene in alignment. Whatever the reason, it is now extremely comfortable to eat there, looking out through the giant picture windows onto Barrow Street. There is little jostling or hubbub. As before, date-night cheer and old-pal warmth abound. There are good reasons for this, in addition to the design. Chief among them is Ms. Scism, who runs Annisa’s public spaces with the firm and friendly self-assurance of Julie Andrews in   “The Sound of Music.” Ms. Scism champions a service culture that is rare and noteworthy. It dictates that restaurants are about much more than eating, or ought to be. They serve a social purpose, as well. And so here is something novel in New York City in 2010: You can hear every word of conversation at your table at Annisa, without hearing every word of the one going on at the table across the way. People act like grown-ups in the restaurant. They are polite. The ambitions of the kitchen are as quiet as they were a decade ago, but no smaller for the time elapsed since Ms. Lo first introduced us to them. There are the requisite Asian influences, as well as African ones, none of them overwhelming in taste or technique. Ms. Lo is not by any means a flashy chef. She does not stalk the dining room in gleaming whites, glad-handing patrons and accepting praise. She simply stays in the kitchen and works, cooking as the Puget Sound novelist David Guterson writes: precisely, with earth in closest proximity to sea. A plate of delicate, pinkish veal tenderloin with artichokes showed this plainly, dressed up not simply with pillowy, crisp-edged sweetbreads but also with oysters and a sauce of black truffles. There was sweetness to it as well as hints of brine, and a funky earthiness to counter both textures, soft and rough. An appetizer cup of chawan mushi, a Japanese egg custard, enlivened with morels and uni and topped with a piece of crisp lotus root, did as well, its silky, steaming richness enveloping the cool saltiness of the uni, and softening the vegetal crunch of root. A beautifully cooked piece of chicken breast, crisp on its exterior and stuffed with chanterelles and bits of pig’s trotter, was a marvelous second act, the textures and flavors playing off one another delightfully, but never getting in the way of the simple taste of the bird. And fluke with caviar and beets brought the same happy laughter you hear drifting out of car windows at beach-town sunsets: the salty pop of the fish eggs set softly against the sweet, fresh flesh of the fish, with a snap of beet sugar to tie it all together. Other successes included a marvelous dish of barbecued squid with Thai basil and fresh peanuts, crunchy and sweet; a salt-broiled Spanish mackerel of uncommon beauty and flavor; and a creamy, perfectly cooked fist of halibut. But there were missteps, too. Annisa is very good. It is not perfect. Ms. Lo’s famous foie-gras soup dumplings, for instance, which have been on the restaurant’s menu since the start, their interiors filled with mousse and a thick, spicy soy broth, have grown tired with age. Twice they arrived at the table as if assembled, cooked and served by rote, with diminished flavors and little broth within them, small slabs of foie gras placed ineffectually across their tops. Ms. Scism’s wine list is hamstrung by a presumably laudable conceit that would be winning if it didn’t seem so anachronistic: it is made up only of wines made by women, or from wineries owned by them. Still, for reasons that have nothing to do with gender, a viognier from Oregon’s Lynn Penner-Ash is a fine place to begin an exploration of it. And the desserts offer less pleasure than a restaurant so apparently devoted to the serene contemplation of fellowship probably should. In some sense, that is not surprising. Ms. Lo is Annisa’s pastry chef as well as the boss of its savory side. As such, she appears to award sweets the status of a sullen stepchild. A dish of pecan and salted butterscotch beignets with bourbon ice milk is probably the best available option, but it doesn’t taste of Ms. Lo’s cooking so much as of every other beignet on a Manhattan dessert menu right now. It is the sort of dish a restaurant consultant would tell a chef she ought to serve. It is both borrowed and blue — a riff on someone else’s food, not a part of Ms. Lo’s vision. The overall quality of that vision is inarguable, however. Annisa, which received two stars from The New York Times when William Grimes reviewed it in 2000, remains a destination for grown-up and serious restaurant-goers, both for its cooking and the experience of eating it. Chefs preparing vaguely Asian food using French technique seem to open restaurants on every third street corner in New York these days. Ms. Lo, an original gangster in this regard, remains one of the better ones. Annisa ★★ 13 Barrow Street (West Fourth Street), Greenwich Village; (212) 741-6699.

88,Mai House,★★,20070103,Frank Bruni,TriBeCa,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/03/dining/reviews/03rest.html,"IT would be easy to feel cynical about Mai House. Here comes the restaurateur Drew Nieporent, a one-man larder for much of TriBeCa, larding the neighborhood with another clangorous destination for buzz-conscious diners. Here come the rolls, skewers, noodles and black cod of an Asian-themed menu with echoes of many others. Here come the house cocktails, nearly a dozen of them, with their flavored vodkas, fruit purées, pronounced sweetness and attendant questions: when did the line between adults’ elixirs and children’s punch become so thin? Is this happy hour or recess? Cynicism would be easy, no question. But it would be a mistake. It would also be hard to maintain for anyone who takes a seat, grabs a set of chopsticks and makes his or her way through the menu, rife with surprises and out-and-out delights. Combining Vietnamese flavors with other Asian influences and many of the go-to meats of the moment, Mai House produces an unusually appealing roster of dishes, the best of which make statements at once louder and more nuanced than those at less thoughtful restaurants with roots in Southeast Asia. Credit for that goes largely to its chef, Michael Huynh, who is also an owner of Mai House. But credit goes as well to Mr. Nieporent, who had the good sense to pluck Mr. Huynh from Bao 111 in the East Village, shuttle him across town and set him up with a bigger budget, kitchen and stage. At Bao 111, which opened in 2003, I was consistently impressed by Mr. Huynh’s refusal to coddle diners with indiscriminate sweetness or assault them with intemperate heat. But I was also convinced that while he had a fine arsenal of ideas and ingredients, he and his partners, who now operate Bao 111 without much involvement from him, hadn’t aced the running of a restaurant. Dishes were overcooked. Service was erratic. Enter Mr. Nieporent, to some extent repeating what he did in mid-2005 when he opened the Mexican restaurant Centrico in TriBeCa. For Centrico he also forged a partnership with a rising chef who had garnered attention at a less splashy enterprise in a less upscale neighborhood. The chef in that case was Aarón Sánchez, the force behind Paladar on the Lower East Side. Mai House works better than Centrico, though it’s not as visually arresting. By the design standards of downtown restaurants with more than 100 seats, it’s a tame affair, making do for the most part with exposed brick, latticed woodwork, silk panels, a semi-open kitchen and dangling lighting fixtures that look like overgrown, airborne Hostess Sno Balls. There are more impressive efforts on the plates. Mr. Huynh has transplanted some of the dishes from Bao 111, tweaked others, come up with new creations and, of course, raised the prices, though not absurdly. At Bao 111 he wrapped thinly sliced beef short rib around thick stalks of lemon grass. At Mai House he swaps in tender lamb  —  a combination with a more distinctive personality. Those improvised skewers were among about a dozen appetizers, a few of which you can skip. Don’t bother with the pro forma summer rolls or hot fried mushroom rolls in which the flavor of the mushrooms, including chanterelles and shiitakes, didn’t fully come through. But don’t miss a thick white yam soup with a bevy of succulent rock shrimp and bracing currents of a classic fish sauce. Make sure to try crunchy nuggets of cuttlefish, which answered the pesky question of how to give fried calamari a fresh spin. Easy: substitute a sea creature that’s a close cousin, but more delicate, and limit the seasoning of the rice-flour batter to salt and pepper. But the best appetizer of all was an exquisitely balanced salad with ribbons of grilled hanger steak folding under, over and around pineapple, pomelo, kaffir lime, cucumber, chili pepper and rau ram, a minty herb often called the Vietnamese coriander. The salad had heat, tartness and a teasing sweetness that never went overboard or wore you out. It was serene and sassy, juicy and crisp. Mr. Huynh cranked up the fire for two of the best entrees. One was a clay pot of cubed chicken and whole quail eggs swimming in a deep pool of fish sauce and chicken stock. The irresistible perfume of lemon grass rose from the pot, lulling you into a calm soon shattered, in the happiest of ways, by bird’s eye chilies. The comparable heat in the spicy house laksa, an Asian soup of sorts, spread through a thick, tawny curry stippled with fat, squiggly noodles. As a bonus, a gigantic prawn jutted up from the surface, ready to be reeled in and gobbled up. A purée of toasted curry powder, cream, cauliflower and white pepper formed the backdrop for spicy beef cheeks in another standout entree. And in another, Mr. Huynh jazzed up what could have been a familiar pinwheel of duck breast slices by laying them over a fried hash of daikon radish, rice flour and duck confit. As for that black cod, it defied convention by spurning  miso. Instead the impeccably steamed fish hooked up with king mushrooms and an ecologically incorrect shark fin consommé that contributed little to the taste of the dish but plenty to its pleasantly sweaty, slippery texture. As with the appetizers, there were entrees that didn’t measure up, among them a mash of glass noodles and Dungeness crab in which the crab didn’t register, and, similarly,  a mix of rice noodles and lobster in which the lobster took too retiring a role. The lobster appeared in a category of noodle and fried rice dishes that represented one of the menu’s weaker spans. Desserts were another letdown, with the notable exception of an almond and banana cake whose sauce of coconut-flavored tapioca became more engrossing with each bite. And with the equally notable exception of sticky rice with Chinese sausage, the sides (sautéed long beans, steamed mustard greens) seemed like afterthoughts, or rather like connivances to plump up the apparent bounty of the menu and the amount of the check. Is that too negative a read? While Mai House provides enough pleasure to keep cynical thoughts in check, it doesn’t banish them altogether.

91,Boqueria,Two Stars,20061101,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/01/dining/reviews/tapas-its-not-about-commitment.html,"BY all rights New York should have more places for tapas than it does. The tapas spirit, or at least versions of it, took root here long ago, spreading wide and far. In many of the city's Japanese and Italian restaurants and even at a French enclave as punctilious as L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon, you can build meals incrementally, with modestly portioned dishes. You can flit noncommittally through appetizer and side-dish selections more numerous and ambitious than main-course options. The whole concept of grazing? It's just the tapas spirit wrapped in a gerund with reassuring connotations of restraint. But blistered Padrón peppers haven't achieved the profile that edamame has. Prosciutto crowds jamón serrano off the stage. And Spain, the realm of true tapas, doesn't enjoy the top billing that other culinary wonderlands do. In New York it's easier to make like you're having tapas than to actually have them. The happy, peppy new Spanish restaurant Boqueria, named for the food market in Barcelona, is doing what it can to change that. It devotes about two-thirds of its menu to tapas, most of which cost $6, and to what it calls ""media raciones,"" or half portions that are slightly bigger and, at $11 each, relatively inexpensive. In other ways as well Boqueria sends the message that you needn't commit to a conventional meal, that an early evening or late-night snack -- which is what tapas are really about -- provides ample reason to drop in. The restaurant's no-reservations policy is in part a call to spontaneity, a rejection of ceremony. So is its clever seating arrangement. At Boqueria, every perch is a high chair, and no matter where you sit -- at one of the small cafe tables in the front, at the large communal table in the back or on banquettes that trace the restaurant's perimeter -- your feet are many inches above the ground, as if you were on a stool at a bar. This has a practical benefit, along with a theoretical one. It puts you at eye level with servers, making your interactions with them feel smoother and friendlier. And it means that if Manhattan somehow flooded, you could dine at Boqueria and keep your shoes dry. You could also eat extremely well. Although an early visit left me with doubts, this restaurant has improved steadily and markedly since it opened in mid-August. And although its menu still harbors a few disappointments, they're eclipsed by plenty of standouts and by a charismatically bustling, remarkably warm scene. Glossier than Tía Pol, cozier than Barça 18, Boqueria manages to have the virtues of stylishness without the vanity, luring relatively young, good-looking diners who turn out for the eating more than the posing. During a recent visit, one of the specials was a terrific dish of sardines two ways -- either oil-cured, or stuffed with olives and pine nuts and then fried -- on a bed of potatoes and heirloom tomatoes. I saw it being delivered to table after table, even though it wouldn't seem a born crowd-pleaser. Sardines aren't for sissies. Neither are anchovies, but they were among the specials as well, fried and smartly paired with fried slivers of candied lemon and, at the base of the dish, a salty tapenade. Usually for better but sometimes for worse, the chef, Seamus Mullen, relishes salty effects: the regularly offered tapas include salt cod fritters and a salt cod brandade, both satisfying, and a media ración presents frisée with salt cod and white anchovies, a dish that teetered into salty excess. He has teamed at Boqueria with Yann de Rochefort, a restaurateur who also owns Suba on the Lower East Side. Neither of them is Spanish, but Mr. Mullen has studied and cooked in Spain. That exposure is reflected in the full justice he does to classics like patatas bravas, fried potato wedges bathed in a spicy and smoky red pepper aioli; tortilla Española, a Spanish omelet with potato and onion; and ajo blanco, a chilled almond soup with red grapes and chorizo oil. He paired chorizo and fried quail eggs on little pieces of toast: my kind of finger food. He sprinkled an appropriately generous measure of coarse salt over those Padrón peppers. A dozen or so dishes are labeled tapas. Subsequent menu categories -- media raciones, raciones and ""para compartir"" (""for sharing"") -- chart escalating portion sizes while expanding your Spanish vocabulary. It's in these categories that Mr. Mullen displayed more creativity and came up with some of his biggest successes. Foremost among them was a fantastic salad showcasing baby squid, which he seared quickly on a plancha, giving it external crunch and internal tenderness, then tossed with baby arugula, fried chickpeas (more crunch) and fried breakfast radish (even more). The salad underscored the care he lavishes not only on the cooking of a dish's central element but also on finding surprising, flavorful ways to round out a composition. A beautifully braised lamb shank was placed over prunes and a celery root purée, with a rosemary-seasoned yogurt on one side, a glittering green basil and tarragon pistou on the other and a dusting of crushed hazelnuts on top. Suckling pig came as a tightly packed rectangle of irresistibly crisp, fatty skin over slick, succulent pork. Three almonds crowned the skin, while sautéed figs lapped at the edges of the meat. Mr. Mullen wisely leavens his salty impulses with sweet ones -- remember those candied lemon slivers -- and often achieves a winning balance in the process. Dishes that seem designed for tamer tastes -- prime rib for two, shrimp sautéed with garlic in olive oil -- were well executed. So were desserts, including crema Catalana and a tower of hazelnut ice cream, chocolate mousse and candied hazelnuts. Paella didn't work out as well, but then it's long been the Bermuda Triangle of Spanish restaurants in New York, breached at considerable peril, with likely hazards of overcooked shellfish or clumpy rice. Boqueria's paella avoided neither. So navigate your way around it. Do what a tapas bar intends you to. Sample some of the Spanish cured meats and cheeses on hand. Have a glass of sangria -- there's a bracingly tart variant made with beer -- or one of the many affordable Spanish wines. Let your appetite wander while your feet dangle. That's the tapas spirit, and at Boqueria it's found a Spanish home. Boqueria  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  53 West 19th Street (Avenue of the Americas), Chelsea; (212) 255-4160.

93,Del Posto,Three Stars,20060301,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/01/dining/reviews/new-rituals-in-the-adoration-of-italy.html,"MUCH has been said about the marble, mahogany and millions of dollars poured into Del Posto, but the risk that Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich have taken with this grand Italian restaurant is best measured in the gutsy way they have defied what their fans expect. They have crumpled up page after page of the script that made their previous ventures so beloved and written a new libretto, emphasizing refined notes over rustic ones, sacrificing hip on the altar of elegant. Spacious and tranquil, with a piano player in place of a rock soundtrack, Del Posto is the anti-Babbo, the un-Lupa. And that's not the whole of it. Teaming for the first time with Mr. Bastianich's mother, Lidia, whose restaurant Felidia is a more relevant point of reference, the two men have challenged New Yorkers to accept Italian cuisine presented with fastidious rituals and opulent trappings usually reserved for French fare. Their reward? I hear a lot of grousing that Del Posto feels soulless and spurious, that it's the culinary equivalent of an epic Hollywood folly: Dishtar. The naysaying makes me wonder whether many New Yorkers are as open to new experiences as they like to think. Del Posto dares to speak in an unfamiliar idiom, only to be told it has a phony accent. That's a parochial response, and a largely unjust one. Del Posto, which means ""of the place,"" has ample ethnic grounding in Italy's fancier restaurants. It also has something more important: mostly terrific food, distinguished by first-rate ingredients (the arugula here makes arugula at many other restaurants seem like iceberg in drag), clear flavors and, more often than not, superior cooking. Ignore the traffic jam of service carts and the purse stools (and, beyond Del Posto's doors, the loud, ugly battle between the restaurant and its new landlord). Focus instead on what lands on the tables. It can be inventive and delicate: a cauliflower sformato, which is a puck of ethereal custard, rising above a salad of grapefruit and skate. Or simultaneously luxurious and earthy: ravioli that are filled with a chestnut and Parmesan purée and paired with pigeon and myrtle. It can be fiery and populist: spaghetti with crab, jalapeño and toasted breadcrumbs, the kind of go-for-broke flourish Mr. Batali indulges less often here than at Babbo. Or more obscure and regal: a purplish risotto with Barolo and Castelmagno cheese, which combines cow's, goat's and sheep's milk, atop a bright orange carrot purée. Move on to main courses and you find an unusually indulgent array of fish and meat. Not only striped bass and cod but also grilled turbot, orata steamed in parchment and Arctic char baked in salt. Not only duck and squab but also roasted guinea hen, the skin over the breast golden and crisp, the flesh from the leg mixed with risotto and served in a hollowed baby pumpkin. There's veal rack, veal shank, lamb kidneys, leg of lamb. In fact there's a bit too much. At a restaurant this self-regarding and pricey -- the veal rack, for two, is $95 -- you pay in part to submit to expert judgment and you want more guidance. You don't want to hear a server say unbidden that the menu can be overwhelming, a concession that should clue the restaurant into the need for more scrupulous editing. Such editing would improve the ratio of outstanding dishes to less successful ones. The veal shank, roasted and served with spaetzle, was dull and slightly dry, as was swordfish. Pappardelle with wild boar needed more kick, maybe because this particular pairing of noodle and beast has become so widespread. Of the three savory chapters of the menu, which cover antipasti, pasta (and risotto) dishes and the main courses, the most consistently impressive is the second one. I was delighted to find bucatini alla gricia, noodles mixed with guanciale, red onions and an emulsification of rendered guanciale fat and pecorino. Mr. Batali's love of offal finds expression in pici, a sort of fat Tuscan spaghetti, with coxcombs, chicken livers, duck testicles and, for conventional decadence, black truffles. Less predictably, agnolotti of veal, pancetta, chicken, mortadella and Parmesan are served slightly crunchy and unsauced, to be plucked and eaten with your fingers. The ceremony surrounding main courses can indeed be fussy, with glistening slabs of flesh exhibited in their cooking vessels for adoration before being taken away and plated. The meats in the bollito misto, which include pork-stuffed pig's trotter, arrive in a cart and are hoisted from the water and carved tableside. But one of the ways Del Posto stays faithful to Italy is the straightforwardness of most of the preparations themselves. Mr. Batali, Ms. Bastianich and the executive chef, Mark Ladner, tend not to go off on precious, rococo tangents. The grilled turbot is gussied up with little more than a last-second application of olive oil. The potent appeal of a mixed grill with pork loin, a lamb chop, quail and a goose sausage hinges on the kitchen's care with these elements, not on a flurry of embellishments. Like the guinea hen, the veal shank and four risotto dishes, the turbot comes in a serving for two. Like the char, the veal rack and the leg of lamb, the mixed grill is for four. In a disconcerting and sometimes disappointing fashion, dining at Del Posto can demand more than a generous budget and several hours. It can require a quorum. Some adjustments should be made, to both the food and the ambience. Del Posto needs more blockbuster desserts, the best of which are a cranberry and apple strudel (yet again, for two), an apricot cassata that's like an Italian baked Alaska, and mustard-colored zabaglione, studded with green bits of pistachio-flavored amaretti. Ms. Bastianich can be seen and heard whisking the zabaglione in a copper pot, and the incessant clanging, coupled with the tinkling of the piano, quickly teeters into parody. But the central vision and ambition of Del Posto are valid ones. Why shouldn't an Italian meal be bracketed by a breadbasket as bountiful as Del Posto's and a plethora of complimentary cookies? Can there be much complaint with the extensive Italian wine list, which has a laudable number of bottles of white for under $50 and red for under $80? Valet parking may seem molto suburban, but I suppose it's a welcome convenience for diners with cars. And while the vastness of the space, a whopping 24,000 square feet over several levels, brings to mind a hotel lobby, it's one swanky lobby. It also affords real room to maneuver between tables, enough quiet to facilitate conversation and a lounge area in which you can wait for your table in cushioned comfort or graze on modestly portioned dishes from a separate menu. No doubt about it: this isn't the Babbo or the Lupa way. But why shouldn't Mr. Batali and Mr. Bastianich try a different path? And why bristle at the pageantry, so long as the pleasure is intact?

97,Masa,Four stars,20041229,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/29/dining/reviews/sushi-at-masa-is-a-zen-thing.html,"Correction Appended I COULD reach deep into a heady broth of adjectives to describe the magic of the sushi at Masa. I could pull up every workable synonym for delicious. Or I could do this: tell you about watching a friend bite into one of Masa's toro-stuffed maki rolls. His eyes grew instantly bigger as his lips twitched into a coyly restrained grin. Then the full taste of the toro, which is the buttery belly of a bluefin tuna, took visible hold. Forget restraint: he was suddenly smiling as widely as a person with a mouthful of food and a modicum of manners can. His eyes even rolled slightly backward. This play of emotion mirrored my own toro-induced bliss. It also explains why Masa, despite its chosen peculiarities and pitiless expense, belongs in the thinly populated pantheon of New York's most stellar restaurants. Simply put, Masa engineers discrete moments of pure elation that few if any other restaurants can match. If you appreciate sushi, Masa will take you to the frontier of how expansively good a single (and singular) bite of it can make you feel. If you don't, you have no reason to visit this restaurant, which stakes its claim for the most part on a narrow patch of culinary turf. The unyielding boundaries of a meal here are just one of many ways in which Masa bucks the increasingly wobbly traditions of fine dining in this city. The chef and owner, Masayoshi Takayama, who operated Ginza Sushiko in Beverly Hills before relocating to Manhattan, does not present you with a menu or choices. You are fed what he elects to feed you, most of it sushi, in the sequence and according to the rhythm he decrees. You do not seize control at Masa. You surrender it. You pay to be putty. And you pay dearly. The price fluctuates with the season and the availability of certain delicacies. It now stands at $350 a person before tax, tip and sip of sake or bottled water. Masa, which reopens Jan. 11 after a holiday break, is arguably the most expensive restaurant in New York. Lunch or dinner for two can easily exceed $1,000. Justifiable? I leave that question to accountants and ethicists. Worth it? The answer depends on your budget and priorities. But in my experience, the silky, melting quality of Masa's toro and uni and sea bream, coupled with the serenity of its ambience, does not exist in New York at a lower price. Masa is not merely sushi. The first third of a nearly three-hour meal here entails other indulgences, presented at methodically paced intervals and in prudently restrained portions. There may be an uni risotto with white truffle; dollops of a perilous blowfish's prized liver; slices of foie gras, to be cooked slightly in a ceramic hot pot; a mound of toro tartare and caviar to be spread on toasted rectangles of Japanese sweet bread. But the last two-thirds of a meal are devoted to sushi, and Masa is devoted to doing this one very worthy thing to perfection. You get the best sense of this pursuit if you sit in one of the 10 seats at the hinoki wood bar, sanded so frequently that you catch its faint scent the second you leave the glare and hubbub of the Time Warner Center and enter this diffusely lighted, windowless sanctuary. Behind the bar stands Mr. Takayama, in a simple white or gray shirt that looks like the top of a monk's robe. He is often flanked by two other chefs, both in simple black shirts, both with extremely short hair or heads shaved like his, as if any grooming more fanciful would compete with their calling to be vessels for immaculate yellowtail. A chef makes your sushi a piece or two at a time, reaching for a pristine slab of fluke or Spanish mackerel and using a bone-handled knife to carve a sliver. He presses wasabi or maybe shiso flakes onto a bed of warm rice, lays the fish atop it and then anoints this jewel with soy sauce, yuzu or sudachi, a limelike Japanese fruit. From just inches away, you watch this ritual, which culminates in the chef's placing the sushi in front of you with a bare hand. You in turn use a bare hand to lift it to your lips. Now the chef watches you, palpably anticipating your delight. This whole exchange has an immediacy and intimacy unlike anything at more conventional restaurants or for that matter at other upscale sushi bars, which tend not to have Masa's low ratio of sushi priests to sushi supplicants, sometimes one to two, especially at lunch. Masa deals not in wide-angle splendor and broad-canvas fireworks but in tight close-ups and miniaturist flares. It prizes simplicity not only in its cuisine but also in its uncluttered environment, which keeps the focus on the food. Other restaurants strive to be extravagant theaters. Masa, with 26 seats in all, intends to be a minimalist temple, all neutral colors and reverential hush. The servers, who bring you finger bowls of lemon water and tell you to turn off your cellphone, seem to have been hired for their genetic inability to speak above a whisper. The only implements they give you are the ones you need at a given instant, and these are usually made not of silver and crystal but of lacquered wood and bamboo. Masa is the first Japanese restaurant to receive four stars from The New York Times since Mimi Sheraton gave that rating to Hatsuhana in 1983, and it speaks a culinary idiom distinct from that of New York's other current four-star establishments, all French-inspired. But it is very much a restaurant of this time and place. Of a dining culture in which linens and petit fours are no longer nonnegotiable badges of class. In which a blockbuster main course often cedes its eminence to a subtler succession of small plates. In which a chef's seriousness is judged not only by his skill but also by the distances he will reach -- and the courier bills he will amass -- in the service and worship of superior ingredients. Mr. Takayama trawls the globe, reeling in bay scallops from as nearby as New England and grouper from as far as Japan. He receives shipments daily and whittles down what he receives to what he finds worthy: yellow clam and red clam; squid and octopus; eel, cooked and brushed with a sweetened reduction of its cooking liquids; needlefish, upon which are drizzled purple shiso flowers. Some of this flesh was so luxurious it made me feel flushed, giving me a buzz that undulated across a meal and crested with the toro rolls: insanely dense, obscenely intense clumps of fatty red tuna surrounded by rice and seasoned with wasabi and scallions. After these Masa gently brought me down, starting with a combination of rice, cucumber and sesame seeds wrapped in a shiso leaf. Dessert was a bowl of snowy grapefruit granité, as clean, pure and exquisite as the seafood before it. Masa certainly has drawbacks, including its reverie-rupturing location in a mall. If you do not reserve a spot at the bar and wind up sitting at one of the tables away from it, some of the immediacy of the ritual is diminished, and the restaurant's pleasures are dimmed. But they are by no means extinguished. It was at a table, in fact, that I dined with my toro-tipsy friend. Three nights later he called and left a message. He said that he had almost gone to eat sushi for lunch but had decided that he needed a longer pause after experiencing what he called ""the sushi of the gods, so it's not so painful when I have to go back to mortal living."" He had it just right. Masa is divine. Masa  **** [Rating: Four stars]  Time Warner Center (fourth floor), Columbus Circle; (212) 823-9800.

98,Le Turtle,★,20160405,Pete Wells,Lower East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/dining/le-turtle-restaurant-review.html,"The premodern look in restaurants and bars that has prevailed for the last decade or so is marked by salvaged wood; fireplaces that may or may not function; bare electric bulbs dimmed to mimic gaslight; warrens of small rooms hung with framed lithographs and, sometimes, taxidermy; servers in humorless aprons or lumberjack shirts or both; wine drunk from pickle jars; and short, historically minded cocktails stirred by men who trim their facial hair into antiquated contours. The style is distinct from the current Scandinavian aesthetic of twigs and fronds and rocks, but overlaps with it. Both lift the handmade and natural and imperfect above the machine-made and synthetic and shiny-new. They try to fill a void in our digitized lives, offering ancient virtues like community and integrity amid the pixels. But styles age. The premodern look increasingly appears to be a studiously crafted illusion — all the harder to swallow because it asks us to see it not as mere set dressing but as the outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual purity. Sooner or later, a trend-conscious restaurateur had to realize that the 19th century had overstayed its welcome. It happens to have been Taavo Somer, whose first restaurant, Freemans, was the most complete and successful statement of the antler aesthetic. Together with Carlos Quirarte, owner of the artfully rustic cafe the Smile, he opened what they call a “French new wave” restaurant on the corner of Chrystie and Rivington Streets in December. It goes by the gloriously fake-Gallic name Le Turtle. Replacing the artificially genuine with genuine artifice, Le Turtle’s dining room mixes building materials that have nothing in common but their shiny new surfaces. Glossy, unchipped marble sits next to raw concrete. Metallic vertical blinds of a kind last seen in “Miami Vice” hang in the front window. Mylar that looks as if it had been taped up five minutes before the doors were unlocked covers one wall. Another is sheeted with unfinished plywood with circles cut out by a jigsaw. A third wall is a two-way mirror. Stand behind it, near the restrooms, and you can spy invisibly on the dining room like a security guard at Studio 54. It’s like a private joke that’s funny even though I suspected I didn’t quite entirely get it. I felt the same way about the small table set in a half-hidden nook a few steps above the bar; I couldn’t imagine eating dinner with another adult up there in Rapunzel’s tower. I have no idea why the servers wear gray jumpsuits that make them look as if they could change your oil after they refill your water glass. At least I knew that no matter how fashionable the other diners looked, I would never be the worst-dressed person at Le Turtle. “Who designed your jumpsuit?” a woman at my table asked our server. “I don’t know,” he said. He didn’t sound happy. “They’re very hot now that it’s spring. I hope they give us something else to wear in the summer.” “Like rompers?” I asked. He seemed to flinch. Sit inside Le Turtle, and you can almost hear a new page in Manhattan dining turning over. “Almost” because you can’t hear much of anything above the Eurodisco and the Francophone covers of Nancy Sinatra and the Beach Boys. The chef, Greg Proechel, who comes to Le Turtle from Blanca and Mr. Nilsson, a short-lived tasting-menu experiment in Long Island City, Queens, seems to have no idea how to translate the French new wave into edible form. Intelligently, he stays away from Godard references; there is no À Bout de Soufflé au Chocolat. But he also stays away from anything you could really call French cooking. He does have an excellent contender in the city’s roast-chicken sweepstakes, a bird that once pecked and strutted in Pennsylvania. To show off its barnyard bona fides, it is initially presented in its entirety, head tucked in and feet stretched out on top of a smoldering nest of hay. The first time one of these platters went by, one of my guests looked up and said, “Do you smell pot?” I didn’t taste any smoke in the meat, though I did taste some sugar from the brine. Other than that, Le Turtle’s chicken is great. The skin has the lacquered crackle of Peking duck, and once the bird has been carved, it comes back with all the parts, so you can gnaw on the feet if you wish, though there’s more satisfaction to be had in burrowing into the fatty heart-shaped nugget where the tail feathers were once plugged in. Servers will tell you that quantities of this chicken are limited when they recommend it, which they invariably do. This is one restaurant where the dishes suggested by the house tend to be the best things on the menu. The poached lobster, for instance, is juicy and well flavored. It was slightly chewy when I had it, but I still liked experimentally pairing it with the mix-and-match accompaniments on the plate, the crunchy tarragon dust, cubes of Asian pear and spicy strips of pickled ají amarillo. The impressively smooth chicken liver mousse is as good as the servers promise it will be. So is the kohlrabi soup, unlikely as that sounds, served with wonderful cubes of browned lamb bacon. They’re also right about the assortment of mushrooms on a spookily good sauce of brie and oysters; the mushrooms are splattered with black truffle shavings that taste wonderful, even if they do make the dish look like a bowl of potting soil. Stray too far from the recommended dishes, though, and you could end up with the peculiarly unappealing seared foie gras with a fluffy, cloying lemon sauce and something that looks and tastes like cornflake crumbs. Leathery rectangles of squid had very little to say to oroblanco, a cousin of grapefruit. And while Mr. Proechel gets some deep flavors out of his braised oxtail, he’s had the meat trimmed into long sections that are interwoven with equally long sections of connective tissue; after awhile, it starts to feel more like dissection than eating. The best of the abbreviated dessert menu is the hazelnut financier, busted up into chunks and surrounded with spicy pear purée and yogurt sorbet, among other treats. You can drink wine from Burgundy and Bordeaux or from more obscure regions like Côtes Catalanes on the handy, affordable, single-sheet list. You can’t get a cocktail right now. This will change later this week when the hard-liquor license comes through. At the moment, though, the absence of bitters and the men who obsess over them is another way in which Le Turtle can give you a one-night vacation from all the aspects of New York dining you’re just starting to realize are getting old."
100,Fatty 'Cue,★★,20111129,Eric Asimov,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/30/dining/reviews/fatty-cue-nyc-restaurant-review.html,"CONSIDER butter. It’s exalted, whether in the copious amounts that flavor and enrich classic French haute cuisine, in the supremely pure examples reverently served at Per Se, or even in the farmer-labeled bars peddled at the shop on the corner. It’s been vilified, too, blamed for all the nasty heart conditions and obesity that fearfully fuel the salad and margarine industries. But rarely has the nature of a butter pat been so altered and improved upon as it has at the new Fatty ’Cue in Greenwich Village, the latest and best of Zakary Pelaccio’s small group of Fatty restaurants. Simply put, Vermont butter is wrapped in maple leaves that have been smoked and then soaked in rye whiskey. The butter package is next stored to age in a cool place for three months or so, like a fine cheese. When ready to serve, the butter is cut into pieces and dusted with powdered cincalok, a condiment of tiny fermented shrimp that is integral to Malaysian cuisine. This enhanced butter, which combines notions of controlled spoilage from the European and Southeast Asian canons, arrives on a plate with exquisitely flavored pretzel bread, superb Virginia ham and a pot of superfluous jam. Painted on the nutlike pretzel bread, the creamy richness of the butter, amplified by age and given resonance by the pungent powdered shrimp, is a perfect foil for the funky-sweet ham, the flavors of each rising and twining like snakes to a charmer’s flute. I wouldn’t call this dish cooking. But as an idea, and as a composition of flavors, it epitomizes the witty, creative and delicious mashup of traditions from Southeast Asia, Europe and the American South at which the new Fatty ’Cue excels. From Mr. Pelaccio’s first restaurant, the short-lived Chickenbone Cafe in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which opened and closed in 2003, through his somewhat misbegotten experience as chef at 5 Ninth in the meatpacking district, through the rise of the Fatty Crabs and Fatty ’Cues and the various odd steps in between, I’ve had the pleasure of watching his arc of growth as a chef and culinary thinker. His restaurants have not always succeeded. Dining rooms, service and other front-of-the-house issues have sometimes weighed them down. But the food has never been less than creative and occasionally verges on genius. While the new Fatty ’Cue shares a name with the original, which opened last year in Williamsburg, it is a departure from the minimalist barbecue joint in Brooklyn. The new restaurant combines the best of the original’s smoke-oriented menu with the cross-cultural Asian influence of its Fatty Crab siblings in a hybrid of hybrids that improves on both. In the new place, the front of the house works well. A busy little bar opens into a casual, comfortable yet boisterous dining room. In prior incarnations at the same address — I remember Mr. Pelaccio’s Mexican-inspired Cabrito and Sara Jenkins’s trattoria 50 Carmine — the dining room was boxy and generic at best. Fatty ’Cue is now a handsome little place, simply through the adroit placing of room dividers, booths and tables. Service is informed and attentive. The menu is divided into four sections in which dishes increase in volume, if not always complexity. Almost all dishes are meant for sharing, which can make the process of seeking consensus as annoying as an endless business meeting. My advice: take immediate charge. With an awareness of the profusion of powerfully flavored dishes to come, it makes sense to start with something light and soothing, like cured arctic char served with, among other things, urfa biber, a smoky dried pepper. It refreshes and cleanses. You could place in a similar category nasi ulam, a generous portion of Indonesian rice salad sprinkled with tiny dried anchovies, quite savory yet refreshing as well. Or roasted carrots, a deceptively simple dish in which the chef, Dan Ross-Leutwyler, has coaxed out both rich, hearty flavors and the vegetable’s inherent sweetness, served in a bone-marrow broth. Big broiled sardines reveal charms in stages. With chopsticks, you can pick the penetrating, pleasantly fishy flesh off the bones. Quickly, the skeleton, head and all, is whisked away, only to return just as quickly flash-fried as a crunchy, delicious snack. Now, you are ready for heartier fare. Who can resist a half-pound of deep-fried bacon? Not here, not now. This is simply pork belly, crisp around the edges and not nearly as oily as it might sound, served as a sliced loaf with a cilantro salsa verde. How about deep-fried rabbit? It’s the best fried chicken in town! Crisp and moist under the crust, it’s full of flavor and comes with an excellent house-made chile-vinegar sauce that takes to the rabbit like malt vinegar to fish and chips. Fermented fish sauce adds a captivating Southeast Asian funk to generously endowed pork ribs, while a pile of Manila clams arrives with bacon in a broth redolent of curry leaves. It’s worth pausing the throw-down a moment to savor this bright, aromatic broth with a few pieces of crisp baguette. Now, have back at it: smoked lamb shoulder is fall-apart tender, robbing from the Middle Eastern palette its puffy pita and thick, cumin-scented yogurt sides. Nothing too fierce yet, until you try the Northern Thai-style duck laab, a veritable blowtorch of chile spice that demands a side of rice for balance. The disappointments include two somewhat conventional dishes: whole roasted turbot, flavorless despite the sea urchin sauce, and a salt-and-pepper-crusted côte de boeuf that was priced at $95 for two, but could easily have satisfied one trencherman. Mr. Pelaccio’s restaurants have always taken drinking seriously, and this is no exception. Creative cocktails, some very good beers and idiosyncratic wines like Andrea Calek’s insouciant Blonde, a sparkling blend of chardonnay and viognier from the Ardèche, fit the place beautifully. One discordant note: display cabinets of overpriced spirits, termed “Thai Bottle Service,” seem absurd, unless velvet ropes come out after midnight. Desserts feature savory, herbal, even vegetal ingredients repackaged in surprising, intriguing and altogether pleasing ways. I’ll mention just one, simply labeled as “Squash,” which uses four kinds of squash and presents them smoked, spiced, candied and caked, swathed in leaves, and thoroughly delicious. Where will Mr. Pelaccio’s extraordinary culinary journey venture next? Who can say. Judging by the stops he’s made so far, it will never be less than fascinating. In me, at least, he has an eager and captive audience. Fatty ’Cue ★★ 50 Carmine Street, near Bedford Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 929-5050, fattycue.com.

103,Bar Basque,★,20110215,Sam Sifton,Chelsea,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/16/dining/reviews/16rest.html,"THE codfish at Bar Basque is ethereal. It provides a taste of the North Atlantic that is as soft on the tongue as a cloud. The fish comes bathed in a gorgeous shellfish velouté that owes much to the Basque sauce known as pil-pil, an emulsion that uses olive oil to elevate the flavors of fish and garlic to lordly heights. Baby root vegetables sit around the plate as throw pillows might surround a feather bed. Served after a platter of acorn-fed, free-range Iberico ham — an amazing flavor, nutty, elegant and rare — it makes for fine eating. Coming after that and a pile of sweet razor clams bathed in olive oil and wine, with a glass of greenish-gold Verdejo, cool and honeyed with spiciness well suited to the garlic and richness that stands up to the fish, then it is something quite a bit more. It is a refined taste of the Basque country in a city that has never properly embraced that pleasure. Yuhi Fujinaga, the executive chef at Bar Basque, is hardly Basque. (He grew up in Hawaii, and worked for the chef Ed Brown at Sea Grill and 81.) But he cooks this food beautifully, and his menu offers real pleasures, particularly in the precincts of appetizers and side dishes. From faux ravioli stuffed with oxtail, essentially a sandwich of crisp-fried bread, the whole dish bathed in a sticky reduction of red wine, to a bowl of piquillo peppers baked slowly into sweetness and mellow heat, there is much to enjoy about eating this restaurant’s food. There is little to enjoy about the actual restaurant, though. Bar Basque is a strange, glass-walled and tube-shaped spaceship on the second floor of the new Eventi Hotel in Chelsea, with a view of a jumbo television screen across the alley park behind it. Red and black and clattery, with a substantial, low-seating lounge area that vibrates with dinkadinkadinka club music and the repressed desire of hotel guests traveling with hard-body work associates, it could appear in a sequel to Bret Easton Ellis’s “American Psycho.” Naturally, Bar Basque is owned by Jeffrey Chodorow. Mr. Chodorow, the irrepressible restaurant entrepreneur who brought the world the juggernauts China Grill and Asia de Cuba, is interested beyond measure in the theatricality of dining. His restaurants pulse with showmanship and risk much in its pursuit. (For all his success, there have also been spectacular flops. Remember Brasserio Caviar & Banana? Wild Salmon? Kobe Club? Tuscan Steak? Remember “The Restaurant,” on NBC?) At Bar Basque, Mr. Chodorow has taken a thrilling cuisine and able practitioners of it, and put them in what amounts to a nightclub. The cynicism of this enterprise is notable. The most comfortable parts of the restaurant are inside the main structure of the hotel, near the bar, where the bulk of the money is made. They are not in the dining room, which takes up a long, glass-ceilinged balcony space attached to the side of the hotel in the manner of a lanai off a house in suburban Miami. It is uncomfortable out there. The tables are small and become crowded with food almost immediately. There is a big space heater, against the chill. Behind half the people that immense television screen looms, sometimes playing old movies or video art, other times sports. It towers over everyone else, drawing eyes away from friends and food. This is a shame. Terry Zarikian, a Miami epicure and officer of Mr. Chodorow’s China Grill Management team, who developed the Bar Basque concept, did extremely well in bringing on Mr. Fujinaga to cook. Emmanuel Pena, the sommelier, has done a nice job of building a wine list that offers both surprises and values to newcomers and students of Spanish wine. For less than $50 a bottle, either group can do very well with Txakolis and tempranillos, with garnachas and godellos. (Look for him in the bar area, where a Horn & Hardart-style self-serve wine bar takes up one interior wall.) The food is balm against annoyance. For appetizers, Mr. Fujinaga serves a crisp fried-poached egg over smashed potatoes with olive oil, a wrap of Serrano ham, peppers and a cheese “broth” that ties the dish together as dressing does a salad. It offers beautiful contrasts of flavor and texture. Squid arrives in two forms — the tentacles fried crisp, the mantles gently seared — alongside a garlicky mayonnaise and a slash of squid ink. Escabeche is made with glistening, just-grilled mackerel that is served alongside a salad pungent enough to match its big flavor. Shrimp are sautéed with copious amounts of garlic and Basque chilies, then tossed with garbanzo beans: a taste of the region’s simplicity. Scallops arrive in a cauldron of truffled cauliflower under sheets of lardo, with crisp bits of jowl meat: a taste of its ambition. (Revolutionary, perhaps, but hardly what revolutionaries eat.) The entrees are less successful. That cod is perfection. There are some marvelous short ribs, served with whipped potatoes. But the restaurant’s selections of other fish and meat served “fresh from the grill” are both less interesting and less well prepared. Red shrimp in piperade was bland despite the flavor of Espelette pepper that gives the dish its name. An 18-ounce bone-in New York strip lacked crust (though it did take up much of the table). Sea scallops dressed in frothy olive oil held no more interest than that and were soon cold to the touch. Suckling pig was a marvel, though, with crisp skin and a melting interior, served with fat beans and few thick slices of morcilla, the Spanish blood sausage. And a plate of creamy calasparra rice on the side only enhanced the satisfaction, its risottolike nuttiness a good foil for chanterelles and preserved tomatoes. (Follow with great torrijas for dessert — French toast, essentially, with a rice-pudding ice cream and lemon peel.) All of this is a little too heavy and rustic and intense and excellent for a restaurant whose design — in part by Syd Mead, who worked on “Blade Runner” — would seem to evoke a future in which everyone lives inside a mobile device. It would be better to eat it all in some place less jittery, less obviously geared toward artifice, with waiters who don’t wear Secret Service earpieces hovering about.

104,Felidia,Three Stars,20060830,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/30/dining/reviews/comfort-between-regal-and-rustic.html,"THE kitchen had been kind enough to divide the risotto into four portions, and each of us took a bite at pretty much the same time. Then it happened, that characteristic moment of wide-eyed silence, followed by a telltale overlapping of voices determined to register something much stronger than approval, something closer to awe. This was the scene and sound of a clique of food lovers discovering something wonderful. The setting was Felidia, and the risotto had been colored and flavored with red beets. Along with a tableside drizzle of aged balsamic vinegar, they gave the dish a faint sweetness that was the first sensation out of the gate. That sweetness was quickly joined and tempered by Humboldt Fog goat cheese, at once sharp and round, with an effect that lingered. The acidity of the vinegar held any richness in check, everything in balance and my companions and me in thrall. A risotto like this could put pasta out of business. It could keep Felidia going strong for another quarter century. Felidia turned 25 this year, and its matriarch, Lidia Bastianich, has gone on since its opening to achieve celebrity independent of it. With her television shows, books and supermarket sauces, she has earned admirers far and wide who know little about the restaurant that helped set her on her path. But the splendid dishes that Felidia continues to turn out -- dishes that hit a midpoint between regal and rustic that's all their own -- suggest that Ms. Bastianich, edging up on her 60th birthday, hasn't lost sight of her beginnings. So does her frequent presence in the narrow, charming East Side townhouse that the restaurant inhabits. On many nights you can still find her on a stool at the mahogany bar just inside the entrance or at a table in one of the dining rooms, where deep yellow walls and glass sconces the color of midseason tomatoes emit a warmth in sync with the kitchen's full-bodied dishes. Felidia hasn't changed all that much since it was last reviewed in The Times in 1995, when Ruth Reichl gave it three stars. That's a good thing. Its food, rooted in Istria, a region once in northeastern Italy and now mostly in Croatia, remains big -- even heavy -- and surprisingly distinctive in a city infatuated with, and just about saturated by, various kinds of Italian cuisine. In terms of main courses, Felidia excels at game, like a terrific quail saltimbocca and a pan-roasted venison loin with a horseradish-mustard sauce that speaks to this restaurant's particular geographic orientation. It also emphasizes organ meat, like braised tripe and a seared calf's liver, served with polenta, that no liver lover should miss. There's plenty of seafood as well, but with the notable exception of a starter of sautéed rock shrimp in a creamy lemon and garlic sauce, it's not Felidia's strength. While grilled branzino, finished tableside with a gloss of olive oil, had a clean, clear taste, it mostly seemed like a sop to health-conscious or timid eaters. A poached fillet of striped bass couldn't quite stand up to the mushroom and tomato broth and celery root purée around it. When it comes to pasta, some of Felidia's best selections rely on slow-cooked sauces made with fatty meats. Fusilli lunghi -- or long fusilli -- was topped with not only succulent strands of pork rib but also meatballs of pork, beef and lamb. A dish of spaghettini thickened with egg yolks didn't stop the decadence there. Onto this unusually rich pasta went braised, shredded duck. Then again, the lighter pasta dishes -- light being a relative term in the context of Felidia -- made their own music. Felidia's signature ""wedding pillows,"" delicate pockets of pasta filled with orange zest, lemon zest, clove, cinnamon, raisins and three kinds of cheese, didn't overplay its sweet notes. And the dish, on the menu for decades now, hasn't overstayed its welcome. Ms. Bastianich leaves most of the cooking these days to her longtime executive chef, Fortunato Nicotra, but the food itself, which commands attention without groveling for it, reflects her personality, sensibility and palate. And to return to Felidia is to be reminded of her role in the restaurant Del Posto, which opened late last year and has been framed more often in terms of Mario Batali's involvement. Ms. Bastianich did more than stand there for hours on end, whisking zabaglione and courting carpal tunnel syndrome. She contributed recipes, ideas and a crucial refinement, evident in some of the roasts, risottos and flourishes. The jalapeño and toasted bread crumbs on a dish of spaghetti and crab? That's Mario. The spaetzle with an elegantly arranged platter of carved veal shank? That's Lidia. Del Posto's bountiful bread service can be traced to Felidia, where every meal begins with a basket of grissini, focaccia and peasant bread, along with three chickpea spreads, one flavored with carrot and orange, one with garlic and lemon, and one with a basil pesto. It's a carbo-phobe's Waterloo. Del Posto's final plethora of cookies has its antecedent in a similar coda at Felidia, where the desserts are an otherwise uneven affair, the joy of a peach-flavored tiramisù undercut by the joyless pairing of a watermelon sorbet with a chocolate-almond cake. Felidia is uneven in other ways, too. Humdrum lamb chops didn't live up to heavenly beef cheeks. A dull dish of fettuccine with soft-shell crab couldn't compete with a salty, zesty dish of chitarra with speck and razor clams. And just about nothing matched the risotto. But Felidia's wine list, brimming with interesting northern Italian selections in the $60 to $90 range, doesn't permit disappointment. An informed server found my companions and me a robust 1979 nebbiolo for under $100. Just before that, he had guided us to a less expensive white that blended sauvignon blanc, tocai, ribolla and riesling. ""It's a symphony,"" he promised, and he was almost correct. ""More of a chamber orchestra,"" determined a companion, who got it just right. We couldn't imagine anything more pleasing. On its best nights, Felidia is like that.

105,Oceana,★★,20080716,Frank Bruni,Times Square Theatre District,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/16/dining/reviews/16rest.html,"I RARELY hear people chattering about Oceana anymore. They don’t mention it as a special-occasion restaurant they yearn to try. They don’t mention it as a favorite they circle back to. Say the restaurant’s name even to some diners who diligently canvas the city’s dining scene, eager not to lose touch with anything noteworthy, and you can tell that Oceana has slipped away from them. Oceana — that’s the seafood restaurant in Midtown that looks like an ocean liner, right?  They can’t quite remember when they were last there. They don’t know who took over when the chef Cornelius Gallagher, who received three stars in The Times from William Grimes in 2003, left a few years later. They’re not 100 percent sure it’s still open. In a city less promiscuously blessed with great restaurants, that wouldn’t be the case. In this one, Oceana sometimes gets lost, a ship adrift in a sea where trendy frequently crowds out classic, where the chefs with celebrity wattage grab the most attention and where restaurants that hew to a staid idiom of tables draped in cloth and servers dressed in suits aren’t speaking the preferred language of many younger diners. But more than a decade and a half since it opened, Oceana presses on, still proud, still vital, still very much worth boarding. Its owners, the Livanos family, who also operate the Greek restaurant Molyvos and the Italian restaurant Abboccato, obviously care about Oceana, which they’ve steered through several chef changes: from Rick Moonen to Mr. Gallagher, and then  to Ben Pollinger, who took over in late 2006. Mr. Pollinger worked previously as the chef de cuisine at Tabla, and didn’t get off to an entirely smooth start here. The first time I visited Oceana after his arrival, I had an uneven meal with too many unfocused, unbalanced dishes. But when I returned a few months ago, I had an infinitely better experience that set the tone for most of several subsequent visits. The fish was excellent, and superbly cooked. More than that, it was a vessel for an exhilarating voyage around the world, through culinary traditions as disparate as Italian and Indian. What has long distinguished Oceana and what distinguishes it still is its polyglot approach to  its menu, on which different dishes turn in different directions for the sidekicks and seasonings to accompany different fish. Pompano is wrapped in taro leaf, and placed beside an emerald-colored coconut and cilantro curry, which is nuanced, layered, sublime. Swordfish gets an aptly salty black olive bagna cauda, along with escarole. Arctic char gets a Scandinavia-inspired lingonberry and caraway sauce, as well as some buckwheat spaetzle, and the char is just fleshy and fatty enough not to be clobbered by that company. Mr. Pollinger matches seafood with its adornments carefully and cunningly, taking into account not only the fish’s boldness and other intrinsic attributes but also the ethnic logic of it all. For a northern European production, he plumbs cold waters. There is certainly classic French technique and in some ways a French soul here, but they’re pressed into the service of an internationalism that is adventurous and imaginative enough to connect Oceana to the present, to give it a contemporary edge and relevance. In that way and some others, the restaurant recalls Le Bernardin, and could be characterized as Le Bernardin Lite (or maybe Le Bernardin Heavy), dedicated to showcasing the sea’s bounty and structured as a multicourse prix fixe. Its prices are slightly lower than Le Bernardin’s, its execution less precise, some of its sauces more emphatic and some of its compositions busier. Oceana definitely wants your attention, and usually earns it. It does that, in part, by bringing unexpected ingredients into smart play. Mr. Pollinger embellishes the sautéed scallops in a terrific appetizer with a purée of mamey sapote, a salmon-colored tropical fruit that weds the creaminess of banana or avocado with a controlled sweetness that amplifies that of the scallops’. He also scatters charoli nuts across the plate. A seemingly pro forma tuna tartare appetizer turns out not to be pro forma at all, and it’s a full-spectrum salute to tartness, sweetness and the gentlest of heats. For starters Mr. Pollinger uses white tuna, then studs it with pickled green papaya and candied ginger, along with some Thai basil and finger chilies. The capper, literally as well as figuratively, is a hood of shaved toasted macadamia nuts, their texture like that of thin sheets of Parmesan. Mr. Pollinger gives careful consideration to texture, looking for crunch, looking for contrast. That’s why the pompano is wrapped in taro before being sautéed, and that’s why it is placed on a rice cake. That’s why a fillet of wild striped bass is crusted with pink lentils. And that’s why lily bulbs are added to a dish of steamed halibut in a rhubarb broth sweetened with jaggery, an unrefined sugar used in much of Asia. Oceana’s pastry chef, Jansen Chan, who started last year, is as attuned to texture as Mr. Pollinger, or at least that’s what I deduce from his frozen banana mousse, presented with both sticky rice and puffed, caramelized rice. It’s the transmogrification of a bowl of Rice Krispies with bananas into dessert, and it’s killer, though it only barely edges out the chocolate chip-pecan bar. Desserts on the whole are splendid. There are odd lapses — a wan washout of an abalone consommé, rubbery lobster on one occasion — but they don’t shake my conviction that this is a restaurant worth celebrating, both now and when it moves to the McGraw-Hill Building in Rockefeller Center a little more than a year from now. That move was announced toward the end of my visits, and I find it cause for excitement more than worry. The inside of the town house Oceana occupies feels dated, especially the main, ocean-liner dining room. I prefer the secondary room on the second floor. In any case a year is longer than you should wait to taste what Mr. Pollinger and Mr. Chan can do. They’ve put new wind in Oceana’s sails.

106,Crema,One Star,20060517,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/17/dining/reviews/with-cactus-as-a-counterpoint.html,"A CHICKEN entree that Julieta Ballesteros serves at her new restaurant, Crema, is one of the most enticing dishes I've encountered in a while. It's also the most heartbreaking. That's a lot of drama to attribute to poultry, but the poultry in this case is being put through unusually dramatic paces by an exceptionally talented chef. It more or less summarizes the story of Crema, which entrances and then disappoints you, its come-on stronger than its follow-through, and not just with that flirty bird. The chicken arrives decked out in many colors and layers. It's a sectioned, skinless breast, placed atop a faintly orange purée of squash blossoms and below dark, meaty slices of portobello mushroom. Over them, like a fleecy cloud at the very summit, hovers warm goat cheese. The elaborate art and architecture of the dish, which also includes an inky swish of chili paste along one edge of the plate and a verdant swish of cilantro and lime emulsion along another, boldly announce Ms. Ballesteros's desire to take Mexican cooking in the kind of nuanced directions that too few Mexican restaurants here do. That's great news, and it's delivered in this dish with a mingling of assertive flavors and rich textures that make you swoon. But there's a big problem that stops you short of total surrender. At least there was both times I sampled the dish, and I gave it a second try in the ardent hope that the letdown on the first go-round was a fluke. The centerpiece -- the chicken itself -- didn't warrant all the finery coddling and swaddling it. Although it had ostensibly been grilled, it carried none of the fiery, smoky charge that might have compensated somewhat for an even more troubling shortcoming. It had all the moisture of the Mojave. And it suggested that Ms. Ballesteros's carefully considered recipes aren't being matched by sufficiently careful execution. Broadly speaking, there are two principal steps to producing superior food in a restaurant, and Ms. Ballesteros has one of them -- the conceptualization -- down pat. Dish after dish at Crema comes with imaginative flourishes or impeccable judgment calls, leaving no doubt about the seriousness of her gifts. Ms. Ballesteros, 32, is a chef to watch. She constructs an eloquent melody of bitter, sweet and salty notes by coating broiled Chilean sea bass in achiote paste, skirting it with a tangy pineapple relish and scattering sesame seeds across the plate. A similar melody serenades broiled spareribs, which are heated by ancho and guajillo chili peppers and cooled by piloncillo, an unrefined sugar used in Mexican cuisine. Guajillo, piloncillo, hoja santa (a leaf with mintlike effects) -- these uncommon terms stud Ms. Ballesteros's menu, and these specialty ingredients ennoble her dishes, giving them subtly distinctive shadings. But during my visits, Crema too often bungled the second step to complete success: the cooking. That chicken wasn't the only flesh betrayed. The ribs, too, wanted for the kind of succulence they could and should have had. A red mole sauce redolent of the clove, cumin and hoja santa that went into it couldn't disguise the toughness and blandness of the rib-eye it cloaked. And while I loved the chipotle aioli and mango salsa that formed a bright sea around sautéed scallops, the scallops themselves were dead weight. It's possible that the sporadically flawed cooking at Crema is exacerbated by meats and fish that aren't of the highest quality. Ms. Ballesteros cooked at Mexicana Mama, a tiny West Village haunt that became a cult favorite and spawned an offshoot near Union Square. She didn't have a direct financial stake in Mexicana Mama, but she shares ownership of Crema with Shaun Smith. It's a more ambitious, larger venture, with a speck of lounge seating up front, about 10 stools at a long bar and about 35 seats for indoor dining and about 10 outside. It occupies the space that once belonged to Snackbar and then became Sandía, a nuevo Latino place that didn't last much longer -- or have much more meaning -- than a David Blaine stunt. Ms. Ballesteros and Mr. Smith have replaced Sandía's deep reds with oranges and off-whites. They have also put a phalanx of cacti and yucca in front of a big mirror in the center of the long, narrow dining room. It sounds kitschy but it plays cheerful, and it seems to be going over well. The one time I ate at Sandía, only one other table was occupied. The many times I ate at Crema, the restaurant was populous and lively. As well it should be. Apart from its flaws, which include unimpressive desserts, it has ample charm and merit, and its most diligently executed dishes make it a leader of the pack of stylish Mexican restaurants, including La Esquina and Centrico, that have opened over the last 18 months. That sea bass was silken and delicate. Queso flameado, a crock of baked cheese rendered slick by the oil from chorizo in its midst, was an extraordinary version of an ordinary dish, and the corn tortillas that accompanied it were light and fresh. Get an order for the table as soon as you sit down, to go with your $12 margaritas, which were worth the price. Get a second order to supplement your other appetizers, which should include soft tacos filled with pan-seared hanger steak. They came with a tomato-chorizo paste, a green splash of sauce made from tomatillos, cilantro and jalapeño and a white dollop of the slightly sour Mexican cream from which the restaurant takes its name. This full-throttle array of finely measured effects typified Crema's virtues. Make sure one of the entrees is the flautas, which also came with vibrant flourishes and were delightfully crunchy to boot. Within that crunch was shredded chicken, but in this dish, the bird kept up its end of the deal. No heartbreak here. Just pleasure, along with a palpable, laudable regard for Mexican cuisine that makes you wish Crema were more constant and trustworthy.

107,Kin Shop,★★,20101214,Sam Sifton,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/15/dining/reviews/15rest.html,"THE black soup arrives at the table already staining the sides of its wide white bowl, an inelegant-looking thing, lampblack-hued, shimmery with oil, menacing, its velvet surface rippled by off-white tangles of squid, by dull green spears of long bean. Stab a spoon into it to discover coins of flesh that lie in its depths, squid rings stuffed with brisket. The smell of sesame drifts upward on threads of steam. The flavors are intense and specific  —  squid ink and the sesame oil, long bean and soft brisket, the squid itself and a chili fire. They combine beautifully. And consumed on a winter’s evening as snow flurries whip the streets outside, they serve as a marvelous introduction to Kin Shop, a new restaurant on Avenue of the Americas in Greenwich Village. Kin Shop is notionally a Thai restaurant. (Kin means “to eat” in Thai.) But it isn’t a Thai restaurant, really, even if there’s a magical food stand somewhere in Phuket serving squid-ink and hot sesame-oil soup featuring brisket-stuffed squid rings. Kin Shop is instead an American restaurant that serves food prepared using Thai flavors, a restaurant that nods at Thailand respectfully and uses its cuisine to fine effect. It does so in an atmosphere that is at once cool and neighborly, downtown in a box. There is something of that small-town-in-the-big-city feel. The food is served family style, as it comes from the kitchen. Service is of the nice-people variety, professional without being snide, competent without being overeager. Piles of sweet Massaman curry with braised goat sit on some tables, alongside wide stir-fried rice noodles  with chicken sausage, broccoli rabe and slick oyster sauce. Here is happiness in a piece of sweet Montauk fluke marinated in kaffir lime, with pomelo, radish and a sauce made of galangal and turmeric: Southeast Asian Suffolk County food, as fresh as morning. There is a bowl of egg noodles swimming in a broth of maitake mushrooms, with a poached duck egg, some tiny leeks, some flags of spinach: umami-rich, coating mouths in silk. The chef and an owner of Kin Shop is Harold Dieterle, who some years ago was the winner in the first season of the televised cooking competition “Top Chef.” With Alicia Nosenzo, his business partner and floor general (a veteran of the similarly smart-casual restaurants the Red Cat, the Harrison and the Mermaid Inn), he also has the more subtly Asian restaurant Perilla on Jones Street, a few blocks south. Mr. Dieterle is as Thai as John Boehner. But he cooks from the Thai larder as if he had stepped out of a novel by John Burdett, a farang who can see ghosts, who knows that the mind is Buddha’s seat, who bleeds fish sauce. His red curry, which he serves as a dipping sauce for ruby-red roasted duck breast, comes with the crisp, thick roti common to southern Thailand, with green mango, cilantro and basil. Place a meaty slice of duck on a piece of the thick, slightly greasy bread, cover it with fruit and herbs, then add a drizzle of sauce. The intensely concentrated red-curry flavor is a beautiful match for the rare duck meat, and cloaks it as cheese does a transcendent hamburger, elevating the protein by its presence. Mr. Dieterle does well by duck in general, though a terrific early salad of boned duck tongues has sadly disappeared from view. (They might have become the General Tso’s chicken of Thai-inspired restaurant cooking.) But his duck laab is excellent  — a salad of minced duck meat with toasted rice and ground chilies that he serves with hearts of romaine. The dish carries a fish-sauce tang along with red-alert heat, and is recommended to all who will otherwise complain that the restaurant isn’t authentically Thai enough for their liking. He serves a honking good salad of fried pork and crisp oysters in which both the mollusks and the pig parts are significantly larger than you might expect, and enhanced by a vinaigrette of mint, chili and lime, with celery and peanuts for contrast. A tangle of stir-fried “aquatic vegetables” (water spinach and watercress, with water chestnuts), meanwhile, offers a welcome purity of flavor, while a collection of grilled eggplant varieties dances under  a dressing redolent of fish sauce and mint, studded with pearls of toasted rice cereal. It makes for good eating. That is not to say Mr. Dieterle never stumbles. Desserts are lame: a steamed passion-fruit pudding with chemical-flavored buttermilk ice cream; muddy Thai iced-tea ice cream; a sickly sweet pineapple-tamarind sorbet. And some of the savory dishes clank as well. Pan-fried crab noodles with yellow chives and tatsoi is fiery and bland at once. Grilled river prawns with fresh lime and a Phuket-style black pepper sauce lacks pow: it tastes of hotel cooking and evokes mild depression. Better to order fiery Thai sausages with a steamed duck egg in a red-onion congee, with razor clams and a sauce made of garlic and fried Thai basil: a winter’s stew from a land that knows no winter. That and some roasted bones, their marrow glistening alongside taro root, radish greens, a yellow bean sauce and a pile of roti. It can keep a table occupied for some time. The restaurant has a smart and modest wine list, one that leans heavily on bright whites and sparklers that can hold up to Mr. Dieterle’s food. (Cocktails include a wonderful martini named for Ms. Nosenzo, made with Farmer’s gin and spicy pickle juice.) But beer may make more sense, with selections that include the requisite Singha lager and an excellent India pale ale from Nectar, as well as a fascinating dark lager from Laos that pairs nicely with that squid-ink soup. Kin Shop is not a fancy restaurant. Nor is it precisely an ambitious one. It is, simply, a neighborhood gem, serving heat and comfort alike, to great effect. Locals crowd the bar, drink beer, devour their goat and can count themselves lucky.  "
112,The Hurricane Club,★,20101116,Sam Sifton,Midtown South,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/dining/reviews/17restaurant.html,"REMEMBER Trader Vic’s in the Plaza Hotel, all dark wood and sweet drinks, steel guitar and Polynesian dreams? Donald Trump closed the restaurant in 1993 when he bought the hotel, calling it “tacky,” but it had 25 years under its grass skirt before that day. Trader Vic’s served pu pu platters and mai tais to generations of New Yorkers delighted to dream of the South Pacific and all its naked, willing charms. Michael Stillman surely must recall the place, even if he was only a child when the ax came down. Mr. Stillman, the son of the legendary New York restaurateur Alan Stillman and himself the owner of a number of Manhattan restaurants, recently opened the Hurricane Club on Park Avenue South. It is a sprawling, hilarious restaurant that evokes the style and hubris of Trader Vic’s while improving on its food. The Hurricane Club is by no means for everyone. It is a crowded dining hall hidden behind billowing white curtains as if it were a nightclub, staffed by waiters in “Casablanca”-style white dinner jackets, the sort of place where, as happened recently, a bachelorette party might gather under tiaras depicting penises to drink deep from a hollowed-out watermelon. (Coconut drinks are also available, and ones served in empty red peppers.) It is also very loud. The restaurant seats close to 300 full-throated human beings. Their voices can combine into a roar that resembles an endlessly crashing wave. Even in the relative safety of the Lagoon Lounge up front, or the glossy confines of the Volcano Room in back, it can be difficult to hear anyone at the Hurricane Club who is not either shouting at you, or in your lap. But the food is close to reliably good, a menu of sticky, sweet, fried and wok-tossed dishes of high flavor if low spice, which Mr. Stillman calls faux Polynesian. And everyone in the place appears to be having a good time eating it. The Hurricane Club is surprisingly winning. It might not be the best, the most interesting or the most important new restaurant in town. It may not prove to be the longest lasting. But it is among the most enjoyable places to open in recent months. It is also a fine remedy for the blahs and blues of encroaching winter. Naturally, there is a pu pu platter on the menu. Sadly, it doesn’t offer the traditional tiny hibachi in the center of the plate, but the fried shrimp on the long wooden board that the kitchen sends out will be recognizable to anyone who spent time eating at restaurants like Kowloon in Saugus, Mass., or South Pacific Ports, in suburban Rochester. Sriracha-enhanced “Samoan” deviled eggs are of a higher quality, however, than anything those restaurants ever put out, as are substantial, almost rustic Peking duck tea sandwiches on hefty white toast. These are delightful with any number of the restaurant’s tiki drinks, which are listed on a complicated, deeply silly triptych-style menu in various strengths and levels of viscosity, and mostly contain fruit juice and clear liquors, abetted by spices, various kinds of ice and darker liquors. They are not delightful with coconut water, however, that addiction of young mothers across the city, unaccountably served here in small plastic bottles, which somehow ruins the effect. If you can get a rum drink in a coconut, you ought to be able to get coconut water in one as well. Craig Koketsu, a partner at the Hurricane Club and the executive chef of Mr. Stillman’s other restaurants, has developed — along with his own chef de cuisine, Lawrence Knapp — a menu for the restaurant that successfully spans an imaginary Pacific Ocean. In a nod to Vietnamese cuisine, the appetizer menu offers lettuce cups that a customer can fill with delicately fried spring rolls. In a nod to some generalized Asian one, there is also a selection of grilled skewers of protein (hunks of Pacific mahi-mahi, for instance, or California tri-tip steak) served with a wide selection of salts and sweet sauces in a tiny cigar chest. And there are chicken wings — a large, sticky and just-fiery bowl of them, in fact, served with a wading pool of cilantro aioli — that are an essential order for anyone eager to embrace the restaurant’s spirit. They make for a nice start to an evening: shtick, but well executed. Moving along to main courses, little grilled lamb chops come beneath a crust of black pepper and Chinese black-bean sauce, with a pool of chili beneath them and a shower of mint leaves above. Dover sole arrives with a delicate ginger-scallion sauce, addictive and luscious against the sweet of the fish. And if a large bowl of Shanghai lobster noodles fra diavolo was overdone one night in shellfish and pasta alike, it could not erase the memory of another night’s success with the same dish, when it was deeply flavorful, luxuriously approachable. Best of all is a large serving board loaded with crisp-fried pork chunks served as if the dish were Peking duck, with scallions, cucumbers, a rich hoisin sauce and some spiced applesauce alongside, along with a large number of steamed buns. Accompanied by a plate of long-cooked pork ribs with a tamarind-chipotle barbecue sauce, and perhaps some Hawaiian fried rice as well, the combination makes for deeply serious dinner theater, in a deeply unserious space. After all these proteins and sugary drinks, desserts at the Hurricane Club are almost redundant. Some number of diners will order the restaurant’s hefty take on devil’s food cake, or the Samoan, a gallon-size coconut mousse. Better, though, is a selection of fresh fruit — hunks of astringent pineapple and clear-flavored watermelon, on one night, with a few bits of orange. Time was you could find a restaurant like the Hurricane Club on nearly every hilltop in the near-urban United States, a neon-lighted, dark-walled loft festooned with fishing nets and drooping plastic palms. “Quasi-Polynesian traps,” Lucius Beebe called these places, writing for Gourmet in 1962, “a gastronomic manifestation that, in recent years on the West Coast, has been making millionaires of third-rate entrepreneurs and ruining the digestions of millions of customers.” Beebe made an exception for Trader Vic’s, writing that there was no other inauthentic Polynesian restaurant in the land with  the least bit of that restaurant’s “flair for endowing the commonplace with romantic overtones.” He would have liked the Hurricane Club quite a bit.   The Hurricane Club ★ 360 Park Avenue South (26th Street); (212) 951-7111, thehurricaneclub.com.

116,Tempo,One Star,20041110,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/10/dining/italy-and-all-things-mediterranean.html,"NEW YORK CITY does not lack for Italian restaurants or want for pasta, which has charmed its way into kitchens of many ethnic affiliations and managed to maintain favored status in carbohydrate-phobic times. Pasta greets me at every turn. I eat pasta perhaps every third night. At this point it takes a pretty saucy, sexy pasta dish to give me pause. It takes the bucatini at Tempo. More muscular than spaghetti, less clumsy than fettucine, bucatini has a split-the-difference appeal all its own, so the dish starts on a propitious note. Then the music swells with a pesto that pairs pignoli with Sicilian pistachios, giving the whole production a heightened, deepened nuttiness. Fagiolini lend a bouncy beat; toasted bread crumbs rumble in. A rich, riveting symphony is born. The bucatini is just one of several reasons for Tempo's praises to be sung, and the fact that this Brooklyn newcomer has not attracted a broader chorus of interest reflects the striking evolution of the borough's dining scene. A decade ago, maybe even five years ago, Tempo would have been awash in buzz, heralded as a relatively rare example of Manhattan-style sophistication and Manhattan-caliber aspirations on Brooklyn's spotty restaurant landscape. But the opening of Tempo in September did not draw any special attention, and I have not heard all that much chatter about it since. There should be a bit more talk, because Tempo does a few things remarkably well. It does many other things respectably. While it has its share of flaws and disappointments -- for example, too few of the main courses measure up to the best appetizers and pasta dishes -- its kitchen on balance makes a solid effort, turning out a fair share of accomplished food. The setting, moreover, is seductive: spacious, romantically lighted, warm and gleaming with immaculately polished wood. Tempo occupies the space that used to be Cucina, one of the pace-setters on the stretch of Fifth Avenue in Park Slope that has become a vibrant restaurant row. Its chef, Michael Fiore, was also the chef at Cucina when it closed in June; he is now one of three owners of Cucina's replacement. The other two are the general managers: Robert Amato and Michael Elliott, both of whom worked at Babbo in Manhattan. Babbo's influence can be felt at Tempo both generally and specifically, from its emphatic eagerness to please and heartiness of fare to the serving of wines by the quarter liter rather than by the glass. While Cucina planted its roots in Italian soil, Tempo branches out to more of the Mediterranean, one of several ways in which it strives to stay up to the culinary minute. By resisting rigid boundaries, it embraces a world of seasonings, and so there is a gentle, enticing undercurrent of curry in the wonderful lentil soup, which is one of the best ""small plates,"" or appetizers by a trendier name. Another of the best small plates, a duck pastilla roll, nods in the direction of northern Africa and comes with a ""Moroccan barbecue glaze"" that includes cumin and cardamom, cinnamon and coriander. But my favorite small plate was the house-made porchetta. Mr. Fiore and his partners know they have a hit here and wisely use it as well to fill one of four kinds of panini on the menu. The pasta dishes can be ordered as appetizers or main courses, and they vary widely in appeal. Although no longer on the menu, a ravioli special I tried one night spoke to how shrewdly and fetchingly assembled these dishes can be. The ravioli were stuffed with sweet corn and dressed with a lemon and poppy seed butter, chives and Parmesan cheese -- a well chosen, balanced mix of effects. The linguine with baby calamari, tomato, garlic and hot chili peppers was pleasant enough, but it needed a jolt of some kind: maybe just an extra measure of chili peppers. The foie gras and apple ravioli were too sweet. The only portion of Tempo's menu that held more letdowns than delights, however, was the stretch devoted to entrees. On the night I tried it, the grilled pork chop was dry. The ""smothered steak"" had been suffocated with a too distracting layer of mushrooms, and the very fine beef would have benefited from a crisper exterior. The accents that had been lavished on steamed red snapper -- orange, clove, cumin, black onion seeds -- produced a disconcerting, overly perfumed effect that brought to mind air freshener. Among side dishes, the oddest was a tangle of thin fried potato slivers and fried sprigs and leaves of rosemary, thyme and sage. It looked and tasted like the messy collision of a spud and a Christmas wreath. A marriage of succulent brussels sprouts and hunks of pancetta represented a much happier union, and butternut squash came not in the usual purée but in cubes coated with rosemary honey. I loved it. Tempo makes its own gelato, which is quite good. So is a sticky date and toffee pudding. Either dessert offers the possibility of a fittingly great finish to a meal that, with informed and careful choices, can be terrific. Combine a small plate with a full-size order of one of the best pasta dishes. Try one or more wines from a list of quarter liters that emphasizes the Mediterranean, includes selections that are not instantly familiar and changes constantly. In that way and others, Tempo endeavors to broaden your horizons and keep pace with what the most popular restaurants in the city are doing and what savvy diners, no matter their borough, seem to want. This effort extends to the service, which is polished, and the servers, who are more informed and excited about the kitchen's efforts than their peers at less ambitious establishments. They should be. Tempo holds itself to a high standard and often clears that bar. Tempo  * [Rating: One Star]  256 Fifth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn; (718) 636-2020.

132,El Jardín,NYT Critic's Pick,20190311,Tejal Rao,San Diego,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/11/dining/el-jardin-restaurant-review.html,"SAN DIEGO — The cooks at Tacos Fitos, just across the street from the Mercado Hidalgo shopping center in Tijuana, are guardians of a vat of birria. The goat meat shimmers with ancho- and guajillo-stained fat, and the scent of it calls to shoppers, among them Claudette Zepeda-Wilkins. Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins is the chef at El Jardín, in San Diego, and often drives an hour south, across the border, to pick up ingredients and eat a few of those tacos de birria doraditos. The version of the dish she makes at El Jardín is a tender, crackling half-moon — a fresh corn tortilla filled with delicate shreds of her own Jalisco-style birria and fried — set over a bowl of broth that is lean and vivid, full of small, creamy beans. The taco is formidable. And like many of Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins’s dishes, it is neither an unrecognizable aggrandizement nor a straightforward replica of established regional fare. It is a glimpse of the Mexican canon, refracted through the lens of a border-kid-turned-chef coming into her full powers, who understands her cuisine as a jumble of Indigenous, immigrant and colonial influences. Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins worried at first that expectations in San Diego, when it came to Mexican food, might be narrow. Diners were used to the industrial tortillas of fast-food tacos. Chips and guac. Fat burritos. What would they make of her red pozole and beef tongue confit? At El Jardín, which opened last June in Liberty Station, a new mixed-use development on a former Navy training base, there is sometimes a sense that she is cooking against all those presumptions — correcting people before they have a chance to misunderstand her or raise an eyebrow at the prices. Oh, you want guacamole? I’ll show you guacamole. And she does. The guacamole is presented as a kind of fairy ring, trimmed with colorful pickled vegetables and ash. It is dramatic, and very pretty, but every garnish is essential. And the guacamole’s most savory notes are only amplified by chunks of queso fresco and the umami-rich, almost cheesy-tasting corn tostadas, imported from Jalisco, with their veneer of fine, Champagne-size bubbles. Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins’s work is both uninhibited and exact. With an annotated menu to indicate regional sources, the restaurant brings together dishes that don’t ordinarily live under the same roof: immense Sonoran hot dogs, Yucatecan-style octopus cooked with sour oranges, the fava-bean-filled tlacoyos of Mexico City. The result, no matter what you order, is a meal that weaves an epic culinary narrative in finely rendered and often delicious details. It makes sense, given Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins’s more inclusive view of Mexican cuisine, that the broth she uses to season the bright, focused red pozole and mellow black mole, would be an infusion of kombu, or kelp. And that the bar manager, Elizabeth Hoar, would mix makrut lime leaves into her cocktails. Desserts are composed with the same care as the savory dishes, in a way that is increasingly rare in a restaurant without a pastry chef. Servers will suggest the churros, because servers always suggest the churros, but make sure to get a second one. Next to a bar of almost chewy almond cake, made with a respectable amount of brown butter and then covered in a squiggle of dense, torched meringue, there is ice cream infused with the shiny black pit of the mamey sapote fruit. As it melts in your mouth, it unfurls its delicate, floral flavor, something close to sun-warmed apricots and almonds. Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins used to be the chef de cuisine at Bracero, and cooked at El Bizcocho, though outside San Diego, she may be best known for her time on Season 15 of “Top Chef.” Competitive cooking shows, like most reality television, tend to flatten people out into easily identifiable characters: the villain, the nerd, the jock. And Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins was cast as the villain. As a result, the YouTube clips that survive have fairly ridiculous titles like “Did Claudette Throw Tanya Under the Bus?” and “Is Claudette Only Out for Herself?” Men receive the most attention for their work in Mexican cuisine, but it is a world of recipes and techniques traditionally maintained at home and passed on by women, to women. So it is reassuring to see Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins working with the kind of financial resources typically reserved for men in the restaurant business. El Jardín’s big, new open kitchen gleams, and has a staff, including cooks and servers, of about 25 people. Quietly, in a way that doesn’t interfere with dinner, Ms. Zepeda-Wilkins uses her position to make a sharp point about how public space can be gendered and politicized. The men’s bathroom hosts a changing table with three sizes of diapers and wet wipes. The women’s room has the same, along with pads and tampons — a low-key effort to normalize the products. In the dining room, lush with plants, there are rainbow-beaded bull skulls affixed to the walls, the work of a Huichol artist from Nayarit, on Mexico’s west coast. The booths along the wall are upholstered with a shining crushed velvet the color of mermaid scales. And just outside, in an expansive garden, the restaurant grows finger limes and nasturtium, beets and radishes, fava beans and English peas. Planes taking off from San Diego International Airport, right next door, often interrupt this serene atmosphere, their engines blaring so loudly, and so close, that servers have to pause midsentence, like comedians for applause. But El Jardín is too determined to let a few planes get in the way. At first sign of a chill in the air, the vertical flames of space heaters flick on outside, and servers offer soft, oversize blankets to guests on the patio, circling several times, with the affectionate insistence of an abuela, coming back, always giving you the chance to change your mind.

134,Mas,★★,20080326,Frank Bruni,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/dining/reviews/26rest.html,"TOO many restaurants start off like gangbusters, only to sag into a sour, cynical middle age while they’re still young. Once they’ve made their first impression, they focus mainly on making money. In lumbering lock step, the Champagne flutes and the servers lose their sparkle. Not at Mas. You could walk in tonight and be convinced you’d stumbled across a restaurant that just threw open its doors. I’m not just supposing. I’m recounting the reactions of friends I toted there over recent weeks. “How old is this place?” they’d ask. “About four,” I’d answer. “Weeks or months?” they’d press. “Oh, years,” I’d correct, at which point I could sense them going through a mental checklist of things that didn’t compute. The peppy, grateful greeting from whoever stood at the host stand: wasn’t it the kind of welcome extended by someone still promoting a beloved fledgling to a potentially uninterested world? The exquisite place settings, with gleaming silverware propped in flawlessly parallel lines on  carved slate wedges: wasn’t this the jittery perfectionism seen in enterprises still awaiting judgment? It was and it is, but there are restaurants with every bit as much vim and vanity after years on the scene as they had when they unveiled themselves, and Mas is a great example. It’s an example, too, of the favors that age can bestow on a restaurant, or rather the way a restaurant can use age to its advantage. In growing older Mas has indeed grown wiser. Its talented chef, Galen Zamarra, is making better decisions and his kitchen operates with more discipline than in 2004, when I gave the restaurant one star. Mas has also grown bigger, to 55 seats from about 40, thanks to a room in the back that was added in December. Fans of the restaurant’s original look needn’t worry. That room, opening off a rear corner of the main dining area, isn’t visible to most of the rest of the restaurant, which is still bordered by a sleek creamy gray banquette with throw pillows. The atmosphere remains at once cool, cozy and  — in a front lounge with a bar of stacked stones and tree-stump stools  — somewhat whimsical. The restaurant’s name is a Provençal word for farmhouse, and that not only explains some of the decorative conceits but also sets up a menu with French influences and an earnest emphasis on seasonal fare. Mr. Zamarra revises his menu not just monthly but nightly. It’s printed on small, matte ecru sheets held together with twine, and its length is restrained: maybe six or seven appetizers, maybe eight or nine main courses, balanced judiciously among vegetarian, fish and meat options. Dishes are expensive  — on one recent menu, à la carte entrees ranged from $34 (for mushroom and pumpkin ravioli) to $36 (for scallops with crab meat)  — but they’re intricately wrought, with flourishes aplenty. (A four-course prix fixe, for $68, is the smarter way to go.) For the most part this isn’t a restaurant for diners with big, blunt appetites. It’s for those  who revel in little surprises and unexpected nuances, like the smoked celery root purée that came with grilled turbot one January night. A root-vegetable purée may be a winter cliché, but by smoking the celery root over apple wood, Mr.  Zamarra  summoned summer barbecues and created something infinitely more enticing. And he rounded out the plate not just with baby carrots but also with bluefoot mushrooms. I was even more smitten with an entree of house-made sausages of ground pork (shoulder, neck), red wine, onion, brioche, mustard and sauerkraut. They were sculptured into  — and tasted like  — a trio of meat loaves, but meat loaves are seldom this piggy, juicy, tangy and just plain cute. They had company, of course: red cabbage braised in apple cider, roasted cauliflower florets. Mas is the anti-Craft, choosing the sides and usually choosing several. Mr. Zamarra has some neat tricks up his sleeve, including spaghetti squash. You see that phrase and you think of ersatz noodles, a bowl of macaroni manqué, but imagine instead that the strands are mixed with flour and eggs to form a kind of cake, which becomes a crunchy hood over a puck of braided shrimp. Imagine the way the crunch highlights the shrimp’s delicate softness. Add some crème fraîche and aged sherry vinegar and you’ve got a knockout appetizer. An appetizer that’s been around since the start is just as impressive when it hits its mark. It’s shaved yellowfin tuna that’s flash-seared by having hot beurre noisette poured over it, and what the squash does for the shrimp, fried shallots do here, adding a crisp texture. But on the second of the recent occasions when I tried this dish, it had an overly tart, vinegary dimension, which spoke to the kitchen’s occasionally odd calibrations. For instance a tomato confit stuffed with pine nuts had been hit with so much fennel pollen that in some bites, fennel was all that registered. Mas still isn’t as reliably thrilling as it could be — and, at these prices,  should be. Some dishes seem too dainty, too retiring. But for a restaurant of a relatively modest scale, it  has a laudably immodest commitment to all aspects of a meal: special cocktails that also change with the season; a sophisticated wine list that mingles the Old and New worlds; a serious cheese selection; memorable desserts. A darkly, deeply flavored chocolate torte with espresso ice cream was a huge improvement over a deliberately strange lavender-infused chocolate ganache with Guinness-stout ice cream that I recalled from the restaurant’s immature days. A horn-shaped hazelnut tuile filled with white chocolate mousse struck me as a cannoli’s regal cousin, while a butternut squash cake with a cream cheese sorbet evoked a higher form of carrot cake. Relishing these treats, my companions wondered aloud why they’d never caught on to Mas before. Four years along, the restaurant is still making fans.  More than ever, it deserves them.

149,Double Crown,★★,20081125,Frank Bruni,NoHo,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/dining/reviews/26rest.html,"YOU don’t encounter all that  many unabashed celebrations of colonialism these days, but that’s what you’ll find, in a fashion, at the new restaurant Double Crown, which dabbles in what might be considered diplomatically incorrect cuisine. Its take on British imperialism goes something like this: Sure, foreign lands were plundered and indigenous peoples oppressed, but think of the snacks! A crumpet-bound monarchy had its palates opened to fragrant, exotic curries as the spices of the East wafted westward. Those Asian lands, in turn, got Marmite and fish paste sandwiches.  I don’t want to take sides here, but I can’t say this was a wholly even exchange. Double Crown doesn’t keep score. It just ponders the glories of culinary cross-pollination, making a promise of “British-Indio-Asian” fusion that sounds more like a threat, given that it’s a two-hyphen fusion and that one of the words bumping up against one of the hyphens is “British.” And isn’t India in Asia? Note to self: bone up on world geography. As kooky and borderline scary as all of this sounds, Double Crown makes it work, and work well, for several reasons. It doesn’t take its pledged fusing too seriously or execute it too strenuously: while the menu indeed combines British and Asian traditions, it doesn’t always insist on doing so in a single dish. Double Crown lets bangers and mash (sausage with potatoes) be bangers and mash, not dousing it in coconut milk or subjecting it to some other tropical makeover. It lets a curry laksa (noodle soup) be a curry laksa, as vibrantly seasoned as it might be in a restaurant not wearing any crowns at all. It has an executive chef, Brad Farmerie, and a chef de cuisine, Christopher Rendell, who ground its imperial conceit in good judgment, their smart calls outnumbering their foolish ones. Last but not least, Double Crown, in a patch of the East Village that bumps up against NoLIta, has received the charmed attentions of the design firm AvroKO, which has done nearly as much for filament bulbs as Nobu Matsuhisa did for black cod. On many of its projects, including the E.U. and Quality Meats, AvroKO’s chief function was to dictate where the votive candles went and just how much brick to expose. But AvroKO is the principal  owner of Double Crown (as it is of Public), meaning it could really have gone to town here. The results are more restrained than you might expect  — meticulously scruffy, in a manner the firm has mastered before. In the restaurant’s front dining room  — there are other rooms in the back and in the basement  — several handsome soapstone screens lean against one (exposed brick) wall. Nearby hangs an orange-glowing oversize Oriental tchotchke with a dangling cord that hasn’t been concealed  — a deliberate touch, no doubt  — from view. Double Crown could be the industrial-loft apartment of a couple of discerning globe-trotters who made out really well at a flea market in the Far East. It’s an intensely pleasant place to hang out, the friendly service and festive atmosphere  papering over the menu’s weak spots. And if you have any doubts about how carefully that’s been engineered, feel the undersides of the tables. There’s a thick, thick layer of padding there, and it’s not for knees. It’s for ears  — for sound muffling. The cocktails, evocative alternately of warm breezes from the Indian Ocean and frigid gusts from the Thames, are for mood lifting. The tart Gooseberry Smash does that especially well, combining gin with gooseberries, elderflower foam and even a bit of red chili pepper. The menu is divided into snacks, starters, mains and sides, a category I mention because as happens frequently these days, it’s where I found two of my favorite treats. One is the ginger cabbage, cooked to such softness it could almost pass for butternut squash and rich beyond rich, thanks to ghee and more ghee. Even better: the diced garam masala potatoes, similarly ghee-graced, with faint, teasing hints of cumin and turmeric. On the basis of these and the pecorino potatoes at Convivio, I’m almost prepared to christen this era in Manhattan dining the golden age of spuds. The snack section, where a curiosity of sausage-stuffed litchis named “pigs in a wet blanket” makes its home, is the least successful. Avoid the crispy whitebait. At all costs. But most of the appetizers  — including the laksa, which adds jumbo lump crab to the green-tea noodles in their curried broth  — are first-rate. The fusion works out like this: the figs beside “streaky ham,” which is cured in house and not so much fat-streaked pork as  pork-streaked fat, have a glaze of fenugreek. That’s all the say Asia gets. And instead of sour cream or such, the condiment with terrific cured Scottish salmon is a coconut labne that performs a similar role with just the quietest of tropical top notes. The cooks don’t ace everything. An entree of venison Wellington was mushy and dreary, while lamb-and-cashew meatballs were much too hard. But on balance this is a kitchen cleverer and more deft than it probably needs to be, given the way the restaurant’s trendy (it’s true) Bowery location and the AvroKO imprimatur beckon the pretty types. The perfume  of star anise, garlic, ginger and cilantro  that rose from a steel crock of “twice-cooked chicken” was heady, even elegant, and the chicken, poached and then fried, had a nicely brittle, salty skin. The strength of a more simply seasoned entree of snapper was the delicacy with which the fish had been steamed. For something with a more wintry spin, try the braised short rib, better than its brethren on 4,921 other menus around town. Or go for the pheasant and licorice pie, basically a chicken pot pie that puts on airs. But when and how do Victoria and Vishnu really wrap their arms around each other? It happens at dessert time, when you can (and should) order samosas filled with rice pudding. They’re inventive —  and proof that you can have your empire and eat it, too.

154,Hospoda,★,20110913,Sam Sifton,Upper East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/14/dining/reviews/hospoda-nyc-restaurant-review.html,"THERE is something charmingly Old World about Hospoda, the sleek new restaurant on the ground floor of the Bohemian National Hall on the Upper East Side. With its plain bare tables, elegant inlaid wood floors, high ceilings, whimsically engraved wood walls and soaring glasswork, the dining room suggests a beautifully renovated Prague apartment. The evocation is in no way dispelled by the food. The menu is filled with dishes that make absolute sense in a restaurant in the same building as the Consulate General of the Czech Republic (the offices are upstairs, along with those of the Bohemian Benevolent and Literary Association). There is ham and horseradish and pickled beets, and smoked beef tongue with pickled onions, along with huge gleaming tankards of beer. But these are hardly student meals for junior Tom Stoppards and Vaclav Havels. Seared striped bass is also on the menu, with fennel, maitake mushrooms, almonds and a fragrant lemon sauce. So are rainbow trout with sorrel, and eggs poached within blankets of pasta. Everything is prepared delicately, stylishly, the big flavors made demure by featherweight sizes, emphasizing modern presentation over traditional ones. There are no tables groaning under the weight of pork loins and tubs of sauerkraut in the dining room. Hospoda is Dvorak in a Thom Browne suit. That ham, for instance, is a thin-fingered delight, a dainty portion served in a bath of horseradish foam, with pickled beets that appear to be mere architectural details until their sweet acidity explodes in the mouth. They temper the smoky fat of the pork, the airy heat of the foam. The dish is old made new, history scrubbed of nostalgia. (The tongue dish achieves a similar effect, lately atop a purée of yellow peas.) Duck confit, served smashed almost flat, with an excellent crisp-to-fat ratio, arrives with an haute cloudlike dumpling. Accompanying it is not the mound of red cabbage one might imagine receiving in Ostrava, but instead a small sauce of red cabbage “essence,” pure and intense, the demi-glace of the vegetable kingdom. And poached flatiron steak, luscious in texture and taste, is served with a wide run of cream sauce heightened with dill oil, and braised potato that seems more silk than starch. Part of a poached flatiron steak anyway. Portions at Hospoda are small. The menu is arranged as a prix fixe (two plates are $32, three are $45 and a seven-course tasting menu is $88) that hardly encourages grazing and cannot support satiation. It is tapas in the style of the Eastern Bloc. Which is confusing. The ambition of the kitchen, run by Olda Sahajdak and Marek Sada, the restaurant’s chefs de cuisine, is large. Their chic, even beautiful food shows this plainly, on the plate and in the mouth. But numerous meals in the restaurant required numerous after-dinner meals at other establishments. “Small plates,” reads a notice on the menu. Larger ones would be welcome. Service at Hospoda is game and pleasant, if amateurish and poorly directed. Servers at the restaurant need to be schooled either in menu specifics or in the charm of copping to ignorance. Because: fluke is not a freshwater fish, people! Meanwhile, a staff member wearing a single comically ill-fitting white cotton glove moves about the dining room placing silverware on each table. The gesture is meant, perhaps, to evoke European gentility. In a restaurant with no tablecloths, it only stirs up worry: What is so wrong with that guy’s hand that he needs to wear a glove to touch the silverware? The restaurant’s wine list is small and Mittel-European, with some decent options in the mid-two-figure range. But the real beverage point of Hospoda (“pub,” in Czech) is its only available beer, Pilsner Urquell, the bottom-fermented brew that has been made in the western city of Pilsen since 1842. Lukas Svoboda, Hospoda’s chief barkeep, is apparently something of a European draught master (the restaurant touts him as the winner of the 2010 International Master Bartender of the Year competition). Mr. Svoboda uses his taps in amazing ways, pulling very different tastes and textures from single kegs of beer. (A native of the Czech Republic, he would have thrived in the Greek life of American universities.) Customers are welcomed to the restaurant with a small glass of airy foam — mliko, it’s called — that displays a sweet creaminess. Other options include great, magical heads that have a few inches of beer beneath them and a “neat” version, without any at all, that highlights the beer’s clean bitterness. This last tastes marvelous with a bite of rosy lamb dressed in thyme glaze, or with a tripe salad served with Champagne grapes, celery and raisins, in a light vinous dressing. Still, in its fat glass and towering height it manages to dominate both, an elephant dancing gracefully at the mouse’s tea party. Only the restaurant’s chewy excellent rye bread manages to keep the beer in check. It would be marvelous to have a full loaf at every table. Desserts are of a piece with the savory dishes: pretty and delicate, informed by the larder of the region, but beautifully composed and plenty small. Best is a small bowl of fresh strawberry dumplings that pairs well with a glass of mliko. There is real skill at work in the kitchen at Hospoda. (It is a gleaming, open space down a flight of stairs near the restaurant’s front, by the restrooms.) The bar offers beery pleasures that are relatively unknown to the city — a flight of the different draughts is well worth considering, as part of a meal, or on the way to another one. And the dining room, which looks out onto a quiet tree-lined block of East 73rd Street, is a comfortable, welcoming place to eat. Too bad, then, that the service cannot yet match the quality of the food, and that the food itself might be served at a dollhouse restaurant, or as passed appetizers at a consulate function. If there is a vision behind Hospoda, it is a clouded one. “Skill without imagination is craftsmanship and gives us many useful objects such as wickerwork picnic baskets,” Mr. Stoppard wrote in his 1972 play “Artist Descending a Staircase.” “Imagination without skill gives us modern art.” Hospoda is caught somewhere between the two. It is a state worth pondering over rye bread and beer, and perhaps two orders of the ham."
156,Parea,★★,20060705,Frank Bruni,Flatiron,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/05/dining/reviews/05rest.html,"FOR a while it seemed that most of the restaurants that promised updated, upscale takes on Greek food merely delivered the same old dishes  — grilled branzino, grilled octopus, stuffed grape leaves, moussaka  —  in fancier digs. Parea has the branzino (albeit roasted), the octopus (pickled) and the grape leaves (stuffed, as it happens, with lobster). But you won't find the moussaka. And once you've perused the menu and begun to sample its highlights, you'll know that you're indeed encountering something more than a taverna with a better tailor, something beyond Hellas in Hermès. Not that Parea doesn't have stylish threads. It beckons the downtown cocktail crowd with a sleek, sexy room that devotes more space than usual to the lounge and bar areas and catches the eye with well-chosen flourishes. A few cunningly shaped brick columns mimic the bones of an ancient temple, while orange light fills a cavity in the ceiling and flickers through a sculptured canopy of what look like leaves. It's sunrise at the Parthenon, or maybe sunset at Delphi. But above all else, it's a fittingly arresting showcase for a sophisticated chef's efforts to recast Greek cuisine by approaching it with atypically high standards, unearthing neglected traditions and finding novel assignments for commonly used ingredients. The chef's name is Michael Symon, and the tack he's taking isn't unique to him or Parea. It has begun to pop up around Manhattan, most recently at Dona on the East Side, where Michael Psilakis, another chef determined to tweak Greek, is building on his work at Onera on the Upper West Side. Parea builds on work from a more distant and even less glamorous place: Cleveland. That's where Mr. Symon, 37, lives, and it's where he opened the restaurant Lola nine years ago. Lola brought him national culinary acclaim and its contemporary byproduct, Food Network appearances. He did a cooking show, ""The Melting Pot,"" which,  he joked, ""was very big in prisons and nursing homes."" He did a segment of ""Iron Chef."" And along the way he opened a second Cleveland restaurant, Lolita, the template for Parea and the training ground for its executive chef, Jonathon Sawyer, who stays put in New York while Mr. Symon toggles between cities. Much of Parea's menu is devoted to small plates, or mezedes, that cost $7 each. In place of Italy's crudo or South America's ceviche Mr. Symon presents ""spinialo,"" a term and concept he encountered while rummaging through old Greek recipe books. He said in a telephone interview that spinialo refers to the unsold, uncooked seafood that Greek fishermen would save and store in salty liquid, lightly curing or pickling it. His present-day riffs on this practice include tuna brined in olive juice and garnished with almond bits  and salmon marinated in vinegar and paired with pickled veal tongue. The latter dish appeared on Parea's evolving menu precisely when an appetizer of pickled lamb's tongue vanished, and Mr. Symon conceded it was an offal transplant of sorts, a slyer attempt to slip diners some tongue, which he needs to keep around for selfish reasons. It's his favorite lunchtime sandwich meat. Despite their intriguing  pedigree,   the spinialo dishes proved less memorable than another clever deployment of organ meat, an excellent mini-salad that mingled nuggets of lamb brain, which were crunchy on the outside but molten at the core, with fingerling potato and pickled onion. Zucchini keftedes, or fritters, achieved a similar textural dynamic  — a crisp surface giving way to a spongy center  —  with a less divisive ingredient. But cubes of cured pork belly, tossed with roasted beets and toasted pistachio nuts, were all crispness, all crunch. Neither of these starters should be missed. Parea's dishes varied widely in their degrees of obvious Greekness, though either yogurt or feta was never far from the picture, serving as the base of a dip or the creamy centerpiece of a sauce. Mr. Symon doesn't treat these mainstays as clichés to be spurned, the way a vainer chef might. He regards them as clutch players to be recruited for, and bent to, his own pleasurable purposes. Fig joined yogurt and tempered its sourness in a silken sauce for beautifully grilled loin of lamb, one of many strong main courses. A tzatziki   accompanied that branzino, which was also coddled by sweet onions. These accessories were a welcome departure from the usual capers, and the dish's gooey opulence defied the spare cleanness of many a branzino around town. Mr. Symon had wrapped the fish in grape leaves before roasting it, and the payoff was pudding-like flesh. A sauce with yogurt and veal stock enriched braised veal, which was rolled in a spiral around sausage made from ground veal and pork. And whipped feta skirted a boneless half-chicken that had been roasted to succulent perfection and cut into round wedges of ideal thickness. Was the feta too salty? Depending on the amount in a given bite, it could be, underscoring a tendency at Parea for some flavors to be too emphatic. The dish that combined lobster and grape leaves had an excessive tartness, and used an increasingly tired  trick,  adding a dissonant delicacy to something humdrum. An array of cured meats hewed to a Greek tradition of spicing  —  with nutmeg and  cinnamon,   for example  —  that Mr. Symon described as aggressive. I'd call it downright bellicose. The mezedes concept recurred with desserts, all portioned modestly. The pastry chef, Jodi Elliott, turned out a decadent rice pudding with a strong vanilla character, grapes and almonds. She displayed a deft touch with pastry in a glorious, custardy concoction called a phyllo milk pie.   ""Greek doughnut holes,"" on the other hand, were dreadful  —  chilly, chewy. But by the time several companions and I got to them, we had bigger troubles. Our voices were shot. Although the word Parea means ""group of friends,"" the restaurant retards their conversation, becoming so loud on crowded nights that it's necessary to bellow or even pantomime. Perhaps Parea should change its name. What's Greek for charades? And can you hear, through this din, what Mr. Symon has to say? Yes, because his food speaks clearly and persuasively, articulating a repositioning of Greek cuisine that's not just tongue  — er, lip  —  service.

163,Vandaag,★★,20100921,Sam Sifton,East Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/22/dining/reviews/22rest.html,"THIS is a city of beautiful restaurants. No one who has lunched at Le Bernardin, or wandered at twilight into the Harrison, or spent a Don Draper evening under the towering ceilings of Eleven Madison Park can deny it. These dining rooms are stages, for both chef and customer. They captivate. Design matters in restaurants as much as food. Sometimes more. A great dining room can enhance a so-so meal, as at the late Chumley’s or the current “21” Club, or it can serve as a minimalist frame for a brilliant one, as at Momofuku Ko or Sushi Yasuda. Add modest young Vandaag to the rolls of the attractive: a comfortable restaurant of vaguely Dutch inflection that Brendan Spiro opened in the East Village in late July, in a space by Eric Mailaender of Resistance Design. It is large and airy, high ceilinged, uncrowded and clean. (Most recently the address was Bounce Deuce, a barbecue place that became a noxious, shouty sports bar.) Vandaag (the name is Dutch for “today”) is the sort of dining room you could move into with a couple of tattered leather armchairs, and sit all day, bare feet on the polished concrete floor, reading novels. Detective-Sergeant Rinus de Gier, the occasionally Buddhist Amsterdam policeman in the novels of Janwillem van de Wetering, would be right at home there. Black banquettes and wooden chairs make up the seating, beneath simple wooden tables. Heavy Dansk silverware sits upon them, and sassy plates from the New English, a British design firm. These combine to offer a kind of casually luxe, Wallpaper-magazine feel to your meal. A few posters decorate the walls. Streetlight twinkles through the wide plate-glass window along Second Avenue, and through the smaller ones along East Sixth Street. A long zinc bar takes up part of the northern wall, neat as a gallery, with laboratory stools lined up before it. Vandaag is comfortable. Nothing is out of place. The bar is an excellent place to start a meal that walks in step with this design, that is both simplicity and elegance combined. Katie Stipe, the restaurant’s barkeep, has contributed to Vandaag a winning list of drinks, cocktails that make a strong case for themselves, rather than simply coasting on appletini fumes. Built of the ancient Dutch style of gin called genever — as well as of aquavit; beer from Holland, Belgium and Scandinavia; and wine from Germany and Austria — they combine in fascinating ways. A simple gin cocktail, for instance, brings a glass of icy Bols genever, mixed with a reduction of golden ale, bitters, the faint taste and color of kirschwasser and a hint of absinthe. A Bohemian spritz offers a mix of grüner veltliner and vermouth, a liqueur of elderflowers and another of pine cones, some sparkling wine and grapefruit zest. Both are delicious, refreshing and thought provoking: Who knew? And while improving on the martini ideal is impossible, Ms. Stipe’s Turf War, which combines aquavit, Lillet, maraschino juice, orange bitters and absinthe, with both an olive and a twist of lemon, comes close. James Van Der Bond would approve. Over at the tables, where a capable, handsome serving staff provides close and almost control-freaky service, the menu proves to be just as inventive, a version of Northern European cooking refracted through an East Village lens. The chef, Phillip Kirschen-Clark, is an alumnus of Corton and WD-50, the Pegu Club and Jimmy’s No. 43. He did not come to Vandaag to serve pea soup and rye bread. Instead there are fat, barely pickled Blue Point oysters that taste of the East Village’s once-vibrant appetizing stores, and pickled sausages that come straight from the neighborhood’s still-extant Ukrainian meat markets. Mr. Kirschen-Clark’s salad of red Russian kale arrives mixed with nutty green strawberries, sweet onions and caraway  —  the combination unfamiliar and close to transcendent. (His sea-urchin bisque with little buds of basil and a drizzle of chili oil, served one night as an amuse-bouche, another night as a full-order special, went the  distance.) Chilled cucumber soup comes tasting of ginger, mint and gin, with hints of pickled cantaloupe and smoked eel. Sounds awful? It is the opposite. It is best to start with a plate of the house-cured pickles, those sausages and an oyster per person, and consume these with your drinks. (Bread? Vandaag charges $6 for a basket, with a side of juniper-scented gin butter and some lentil spread. That may make business sense. But it comes off as churlish.) Follow with those soups, if available, and some nuggets of fried lamb sweetbreads, with a vinaigrette flavored with Maggi, the Swiss version of soy sauce, now produced in China. A gravlax made with sockeye salmon is also worth ordering, with watercress and shallots, dots of salmon roe and plenty of dill. Bitterballen, a kind of Dutch bar snack that is essentially a fried meatball, is here built from slow-braised oxtail meat, and comes with a biting mustard relish. There are missteps among the main courses. The lamb shoulder is fatty and the pork chop tough; the restaurant’s “ham” burger, a mixture of pork and beef cooked as a roulade, sliced and seared, simply cannot hold up to the preparation. But littleneck clams in a broth redolent of both aquavit and vanilla, with Aleppo peppers and a tangle of crisp parsnip fries, are excellent, and the hen for two, the breast roasted with lemon and bay laurel, and the leg confited, torn and served on toast, with fried potatoes and dandelion greens, is magnificent, the sort of bird to bring favor back to white meat. The breast is moist and lemony-fragrant beneath its crisp skin, and combined with a side order of spicy-sweet hete bliksem, or “hot lightning”  —  crisp fingerling potatoes combined with smoky bacon, slivers of apple and a velvet blanket of stroop, a Dutch caramel syrup  —  it makes for the sort of meal you can wake up thinking about a few mornings in a row. Mr. Kirschen-Clark provides Vandaag’s desserts as well as its savory dishes. Many of these are less sweet than the hete bliksem, though no less welcome for that. A stroopwafel is probably best, though, with a cup of coffee, the thin waffle warming in the steam. Eating it in this room is to be thrilled by the unfamiliar, and to experience what the art critic Robert Hughes called the shock of the new. That’s what good design is for, too.

166,Sette Enoteca e Cucina,One Star,20051005,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/05/dining/reviews/baby-steps-on-a-road-of-good-intentions.html,"THERE is much to learn from dining out in New York these days, and the latest lesson is a revised understanding of the proverb ""youth must be served."" You thought it was a commentary on the privileges and demands of being young, on the tyranny of youthful impulses? Think again. It's menu advice, cooking instructions. It must be, because chefs all around the city are treating it that way. They trot out not only veal and lamb but also poisson and baby squid. They advertise their visits to the Greenmarket as exercises in robbing the cradle: baby Romaine, baby beets, baby eggplant. The infantilization of vegetables is all the rage, and at Sette Enoteca e Cucina in Brooklyn it extended to two appetizers, the fresh mozzarella with grilled baby leeks and the baby artichokes alla Romana. A friend, ordering the latter, couldn't resist a bit of fun. ""Are the artichokes really, really young?"" he asked our server. The server didn't miss a beat. ""They're mewling,"" he said. The menu descriptions at Sette and the server's sense of humor about them captured the hybrid spirit of this new restaurant, its mix of motives and attributes. Sette aspires to sophistication and wants to telegraph that it's in touch with the latest trends and on the hunt for distinctive ingredients. The care with which its menu and best dishes are put together underscores the aim of an increasing number of restaurateurs in Park Slope, which seems to be especially fertile soil for Italian cooking. They shoot for more than just excellent neighborhood restaurants. They shoot for excellent restaurants, period. But Sette isn't too full of itself. It doesn't let its ambitions trump the relaxed atmosphere in its attractively dark, oppressively loud dining room. Nor does it let those ambitions distract it from trying to win diners' hearts in direct, unpretentious ways. In terms of the half-dozen pasta dishes on Sette's menu, the ratio of portion to price was generous and commendable. These dishes were easily large enough to be main courses, and only one of them, fresh pappardelle with oxtail and pecorino, cost more than $15. Tagliatelle with tomato, eggplant and ricotta salata was $13. Strozzapreti with roasted corn, red peppers and watercress was $12. In terms of wine, Sette means to live up to the promise of its translated name, ""wine bar and kitchen,"" by coaxing you to drink. Its persuasive tactic is a featured list of ""venti per venti,"" or 20 bottles for $20 each. Half are red. Half are white. All are Italian, and they range from Piedmont and the Veneto down to Sicily, stopping along the way in less celebrated regions like Lazio, Apulia and Calabria. But Sette's good, prudent intentions are not reliably matched by the appeal of what comes out of the kitchen, run by Amanda Freitag. She was the chef de cuisine at 'Cesca, the hugely successful Italian restaurant on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, from its opening in late 2003 until early this year. She is a talented cook, and some of what I had at Sette was terrific, a credit to her way of taking familiar dishes and administering subtle tweaks, tiny inventions (maybe baby revisions would be the most apt phrase). Take that mozzarella. It was fresh and lovely, but what made it sing was its pairing with those leeks, from which Ms. Freitag wrung a surprising sweetness, amplified by a drizzling of saba, which is cooked grape must. An appetizer of roasted asparagus was distinguished by the Parmesan fondue on which the spears rested. It was satisfyingly rich without being heavy, and scattered here and there were crisp bits of pancetta, needed and appreciated less for their salt than for their crunch. The contrasting texture lifted the dish a notch. In a city with no shortage of tuna, Sette's stood out. Served as a main course, it was rolled in ground fennel seeds before being seared and topped with olives and preserved lemons. Sette has a wood oven, and it produced a firm crust for small appetizer pizzas, with toppings that changed from visit to visit. It also produced a fantastic plum crostata -- the fruit also changed regularly -- with a crisp shell. Ms. Freitag's hand with desserts was especially strong. She often veered admirably from the easy path of sweetness, whether with the whipped cream that accompanied that crostata or the chocolate shortbread cookies brought to our table as a complimentary coda to a long meal. A particular standout: her lemon tart with a pistachio crust. But Sette had a few too many letdowns. Fritto misto was so emphatic with the fritto that the misto of ingredients encased by it was a matter of guesswork. Most of the pasta dishes lacked a spark of some kind. Some of them were overcooked. And some of them and some of the main courses needed salt. Those main courses were for the most part pleasant, and had pleasant dimensions: a pine nut relish with slices of duck breast, a thorough char on the hanger steak. But they weren't remarkable. The wedges of pizza bianca that Sette serves as its bread were stale one night. Servers could be counted on for a warm greeting at the start and a warm goodbye at the end, but they could not be counted on to circle back to the table regularly, a problem in particular on a night when my friends and I ate on the less noisy patio. Except for the feeling of being stranded, it was a lovely place to sit. As for the fixation with so-called baby vegetables, Sette merely mimics scores of other restaurants. These vegetables in many cases aren't really immature. They're smaller, different versions of their kin. But apparently the phrase pipsqueak vegetable has a less appetizing ring than the evocation of an adorable toddler. What would Jonathan Swift have made of that?

167,Persimmon,★,20080805,Frank Bruni,East Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/06/dining/reviews/06rest.html,"THE stages of grieving are largely mirrored in the stages of paying a Manhattan dinner check, which has a way of rising much higher and faster than expected, like the Dubai skyline or Miley Cyrus. Denial, depression, acceptance: they’re all there at the denouement of a meal, interlaced with, or followed by, such additional stages as bloating, loss of hearing (from the noise), loss of voice (from trying to be heard above said noise) and serious credit-card debt. But not at Persimmon. This new, tiny, relatively un-frenzied restaurant in the East Village flouts any number of conventions, chief among them an obvious, all-out effort to turn a handsome profit. When the check is delivered, the first stage you’ll experience is puzzlement, followed by relief, giving way to a grateful transportation epiphany: you may well be able to afford a taxi instead of the subway home. For a “neo-Korean” meal spanning four or five courses (depending on how you count), Persimmon charges all of $37 a person. And since it currently lacks not only a liquor license but also much of a beverage list, the check won’t swell in incremental, incidental ways. I doubt the price will stay at precisely this level for too long, and a liquor license is expected in four to five months. (In the meantime, you can bring your own booze.) But what’s already been established is that the restaurant’s chef and owner, Youngsun Lee, is interested first and foremost in making his cooking — which veers from daringly creative in one dish to steadfastly authentic in the next — as accessible as possible. He wants to ease you into a meal that won’t be all that familiar, even if you’re versed in Korean cuisine. His thinking is more artistic than commercial, a mindset evident in the way the deep, slender space Persimmon occupies has been divided. The whole back half of it has been reserved for the kitchen, which is about as large as the 24-seat dining room. That’s a kitchen-to-dining-room ratio more closely resembling Per Se’s than Prune’s. Persimmon could accurately advertise free-range cooks. The dining room itself is essentially one long communal table of polished wood with squat stools and some well-chosen grace notes — fabric placemats in light red, light green and yellow; gleaming metal chopsticks at each place setting — that give it exactly as much visual adornment as it needs. The wood, the stools: the Momofuku mini-empire will come to mind, but maybe that’s primarily because Mr. Lee worked at Momofuku Noodle Bar, an association noted in just about every initial news-media squib about his restaurant and responsible for its presence on many diners’ radar. But Persimmon Kimchi House (that’s its fuller, longer name) is more challenging and more particular than any Momofuku. It’s also more uneven: at least a third of the dishes I tried prompted yawns or head-scratching. But at least another third riveted me, and all in all I enjoyed what struck me as the polar opposite of a cookie-cutter, fashion-driven meal, the Momofuku invocations notwithstanding. Persimmon is an adventure, and the bumpiness of the trip — including spasmodic and sometimes confused service — is in large part redeemed by the price. The menu changes every two weeks, and gives you about three or four choices for each of three savory courses, followed by a pre-dessert soup of cold rice and tea, then a modest plate of Korean cookies. These last two courses are by far the least exciting; if you’re in a rush, you can skip them, and still feel that you’re getting more than your money’s worth. But they’re illuminating, especially the lulling rice-in-tea porridge, which underscores the wild swings in Korean cooking from pointedly spicy — as in kimchi itself, which is fermented cabbage or other vegetables — to subtle, even soporific. These swings are deliberate, a matter of rhythm and pacing. Mr. Lee takes the kimchi tradition in some surprising directions, for example making strawberry kimchi and using it, along with mint and carrot, to jazz up grilled scallops. There’s a sweet-tart interplay in the dish that’s transfixing. Another unconventional winner involves spectacularly juicy little rectangles of Asian eggplant stacked like Lincoln Logs and surrounded by a silky, milky dressing of soy sauce, tofu, black sesame and minuscule rice cakes with the texture of gumdrops. The eggplant dish survived several menu changes and seems to be a mainstay. So does a cold salad of gorgeous fluke sashimi that’s ablaze with Korean red pepper sauce, along with a “bo ssam” spread of braised pork belly, kimchi, Napa cabbage and an intense miso paste with fermented baby shrimp. It represents the menu’s utterly traditional vein. Tradition also governs the selection of soups and stews that arrive in heavy, steaming clay crocks for the third (and main) course. You choose one, and it comes with an array of condiments and sides, each in its own vessel: pickled garlic cloves; watermelon rind kimchi; dried baby anchovies; white rice, studded with cranberry beans and baby lima beans. The sense of bounty, diversity and discovery is exhilarating. Some of these main-course options are extraordinarily mild-flavored, at once slightly boring and deeply consoling, almost meditative in their effect. A clam soup with scallions fell into this category, as did a ginseng chicken soup that was more chicken than soup, a whole Cornish hen having been plunged into the broth. On account of this dish’s size, it entails  a $5 supplement. But there’s fire in the kimchi stew, which can be ordered with either strips of pork or assorted mushrooms. I had the pork, and found myself pushing the leathery, flavorless meat out of the way. It was the distraction to an otherwise tingling good time. On that night Persimmon was nearly full, and many diners had been seated all at once, a sudden crush that the cooks and the lone server were visibly struggling to manage. Persimmon isn’t a well-oiled machine. That’s part of its allure, and that’s factored into what it will cost you: a fraction of the tariff for many a less distinctive meal.

168,Back Forty,Fair,20120529,Pete Wells,East Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-back-forty-and-back-forty-west.html,"AS SoHo began to feel less like a New York neighborhood and more like a suburban shopping mall with two lanes of taxis running down the middle, there was Savoy, a sane oasis on the quiet corner of Prince and Crosby Streets. Even when years passed between visits, I felt better knowing Savoy was there. Then one day last June, it wasn’t there anymore after 21 years, and the city felt a little smaller. Some of the sting was taken out when Peter Hoffman, the chef and owner, promised to reincarnate the place in a new form along the lines of his other restaurant, Back Forty. Opened on Avenue B in 2007, Back Forty has become an East Village go-to place for grass-fed burgers, sustainably raised pork shanks and vegetables straight off the back of a farm truck. Back Forty West isn’t a total clone. It’s more like a fraternal twin, sharing the logo and the look of the first place, along with a few menu items and an overall philosophy. Mr. Hoffman’s move toward a casual format that can be easily replicated is, of course, one that makes sense to more and more restaurateurs. But this time around, the familiar story has a strange ending. Over the last month or so, I’ve had a string of extremely pleasant meals at second-generation Back Forty West, and a succession of sloppy, careless ones at the place it was modeled after. It’s as if Back Forty has gone into a long, jealous sulk, like a family cat that responds to the arrival of a new baby by hiding under the couch and scratching at anybody who gets too close. Unlike the original, Back Forty West is open all day, an agreeable corner cafe that pours coffee by 8 a.m. and fries chicken to serve over waffles at lunch. The neighborhood has embraced it, giving the place a confidence and sparkle that take it well beyond the routine farm-to-table tropes. A filling bowl of Brazilian fisherman’s stew loaded with squid and shellfish was bright green with cilantro and bracingly spicy. (Eat locally, cook globally.) Squid played to even better effect in another dish, this one inspired by Spain. Seared on a plancha until it was just done and not a moment longer, exactly the way squid has to be cooked, it was served with smashed fingerlings and with butter dyed rusty orange by pimentón. Butter, pepper, squid, potatoes: elemental and hard to argue with. Mr. Hoffman has installed a smoker on the second floor of Back Forty West, near where the small bar used to be, and the restaurant makes excellent, judicious use of it. A smoked chicken leg was so pink and juicy that a friend called it chicken ham; pork ribs in a Carolina-style vinegar sauce might have been a little more tender, but the low-key interplay of smoke and pig fat was just right. More than any one dish he created, an early and steadfast loyalty to Greenmarket produce defined Mr. Hoffman as a chef. So it’s the nicest kind of nonsurprise to find that Back Forty West handles vegetables with care and imagination. Dressing asparagus spears with rhubarb vinaigrette struck me at first as seasonal overkill, but it was in fact a lovely pairing. I also got a kick out of the restaurant’s tribute to the Caesar salad, with leaves of grilled kale, white anchovies and, in the role often played by stale croutons, some irresistible fried chickpeas. The menu at Back Forty West is organized in a way I’ve never seen before and hope not to see again: by eating utensil. If you have ever walked into a restaurant thinking, “Boy, I don’t know if I should be trusted with a knife tonight,” this is the place for you. Simply skip over the “Fork & Knife” section in favor of plain old “Fork,” or “Spoon & Ladle” or “Hands.” Unmasking the main courses in this jumble takes bit of sleuthing, but it’s obvious that the “Spoon” category is for desserts. A chocolate cake with hazelnuts was more gummy than chocolaty, but I’d order the cookie plate again (and then make sure I kept all the bacon-fat snickerdoodles for myself). And everyone seems to like the caramel pudding under an inch or two of marshmallow, too. The same dessert is served at Back Forty, yet it isn’t the same at all. In SoHo, the marshmallow is caramelized on top, giving it a tinge of bitterness that helps offset the sweetness, and the pudding is very slightly salty. In the East Village, nothing stands in the way of the sugar rush. One spoonful is more than enough. Direct comparisons between the two restaurants were nearly always punishing to the older sibling. The grass-fed burger at Back Forty West, on a soft potato roll, had plenty of character. The one at Back Forty, served on a crumbly sesame-seed bun, had almost none. Back Forty West had the bright idea to grill pea pods with olive oil and smoked sea salt and serve them whole; you pop the peas into your mouth like edamame. Back Forty had the less bright idea to grill whole fava pods; you pop out the beans, then have to separate them from their gray skins. Stranger still, the fava pods were plopped on top of some (quite good) hummus. It’s hard to imagine this ungainly dish on the menu at Back Forty West, and not just because you need your hands and a fork to eat it. This kind of inattention to detail was evident in every meal I had at Back Forty. Grilled whole onions and chard leaves with their stems intact were so undercooked, they were difficult to cut with a knife. Half the food, from French fries to a yogurt-dill sauce, seemed to have been tossed into an open barrel of salt before serving, and food that ought to have looked beautiful, like a beet salad, had been slammed carelessly down on the plate, as if to punish it. Some diners look at the vanishing numbers of places like Savoy and mourn the passing of the style of dining they represent. It’s no contradiction to share that sadness while celebrating the rise of places like Back Forty West, which make fine local products into everyday food. And Back Forty? At the moment, it is the cautionary tale, proving that simplicity isn’t so simple, and that everyday food needs to be handled with care, every day."
172,Eighty One,★★,20080514,Frank Bruni,Upper West Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/14/dining/reviews/14rest.html,"MAYBE it’s an inevitable consequence of so many restaurants vying to be noticed. Maybe it’s an attempt to justify entrees sailing far north of $35. Maybe it’s a reflection of chefs too neurotic or vain to commit to one strategy or to dwell on one note. Whatever the reason, the high-end New York dining scene is awash in troikas of pork, trilogies of tuna and the like. A meat that does a wholly satisfying turn as a chop, or a fish showcased adequately in a fillet, appears in many guises, as if it’s an actor doing one of those multi-part tours de force. The spectacle is impressive to a point, but exhausting, too. Or so I thought as I sifted through a very busy dish of very articulated veal at the new restaurant Eighty One, which presented veal cheek (braised), veal rack (roasted) and yet another hunk of veal rack (slow-poached in olive oil), not to mention some crispy Ibérico ham and something like a half-dozen vegetables. If ever a dish needed Ritalin, this was it. Lamb, too, was a dubious triumph of trifurcation: some rack, some loin and some shoulder, for $39, which was $1 less than the veal. I loved the rack, enough to want to spend quality time with it. But my attention was yanked in other directions. I felt like a captive on a cruise, being hustled too quickly to too many ports of call: Acapulco! Puerto Vallarta! Mazatlán! Couldn’t I linger for just a bit? I should stress that Eighty One is hardly the first guide to send me on such a dizzying tour, that neither of those dishes was actually unappealing, and that others — ones without attention deficits — were excellent. Ed Brown, the chef and principal owner, is an indisputably gifted cook, and he’s put together an indisputably serious restaurant. But it provides an especially clear example of a kind of culinary preening — call it ego food — that may speak less to the satisfaction of customers than to the self-regard of proprietors, who want you to marvel at the effort-per-bite ratio and the variety of techniques at play. Eighty One certainly preens. It goes so far as to title a section of the menu in which it lists spotlighted dishes the “tasting collection.” When you see something like that, you’re less inclined to overlook a restaurant’s shortcomings. In Eighty One’s case, they include a sprawling dining room with unflattering lighting and oversize red velvet booths that look as if they were carted in from a bordello on some planet where the prostitutes are 12 feet tall. Eighty One takes its name from its street and is opposite the American Museum of Natural History, off the lobby of the Excelsior Hotel. The walk up to it is pretty, and so is the walk in: there are inviting chairs and couches upfront, then a handsome black walnut bar with cushioned, swiveling white leather stools and lighting more subdued than the dining room’s. On my last visit I ate at the bar, and it was my favorite time at Eighty One. The food that night was a major reason. The menu had just been revised to reflect the advance of spring, and I had a green, green meal: a silky, bright-tasting soup of fava beans and early peas; an expertly prepared risotto with more peas, ramps and, like a bright white archipelago on an emerald sea, dabs of house-made ricotta. Spring didn’t get specific credit for what came next, a gorgeous, snow-colored piece of halibut in a green sauce of clam juice, vermouth and a generous measure of parsley. But the fish, bedecked with clams, spoke to the fine touch that Mr. Brown has with seafood. He cooked for years at the Sea Grill in Rockefeller Center. The best of the many distinctive and enjoyable dishes during my meals included a meaty wedge of cod showered in fried shallots — it was the ocean’s answer to one of those “cowboy rib-eyes” smothered in onion rings. The light tempura batter over soft-shell crab gave it crispness without greasiness, while the shallot, grapefruit and smoked paprika marmalade below it contributed bitter, sweet and spicy glimmers. The strips of skin with wild striped bass were so crunchy and rich they seemed to be emulating pork rinds, and superb yellowfin tuna, seared on a plancha, appeared in the decadent company of seared foie gras. There was more foie gras, along with scallops, in a dish of ravioli that struck me as overkill, and yet more foie gras in a terrine with chicken. Black truffle shavings made a big showing a few months back, right after Eighty One opened. This restaurant doesn’t mess around. It occasionally messes up. A fennel and parsley soup with fried frogs’ legs on the side tasted less of fennel and parsley than of salt and more salt. At least the frogs’ legs, encased in a thick but crisp batter, were a treat: chicken fingers for the Châteauneuf-du-Pape set. The desserts, on balance, were more showy than memorable. Cinnamon-dusted peanut fritters punched the beignet-bombolini ticket without improving on doughnuts less self-conscious. Get the banana bread pudding instead. I probably didn’t need to tell you that. Take a look at the wines by the glass: there are usually some interesting, unconventional choices. Eighty One cares about wine, and lets you know that by displaying thousands of bottles in temperature-controlled cases along one wall of the dining room. Like so many other restaurants, it’s a wine exhibitionist. It’s an exhibitionist pure and simple, prone to overworking dishes, but maybe not intractably bound to that approach. On one recent menu I noticed that the rack-cheek-rack of veal had been replaced for a period by a shank, and on another recent menu I saw “lamb two ways” instead of the previous “lamb three ways.” Works for me. I can stop shy of Mazatlán. Eighty One ** 45 West 81st Street; (212) 873-8181 or 81nyc.com.

174,Allen & Delancey,★★,20071212,Frank Bruni,Lower East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/dining/reviews/12rest.html,"SOMETIMES life happens in reverse. At least it did for Neil Ferguson, a chef whose move to his current restaurant from his previous one seems like some sort of cosmic snafu, like a perversion of the correct chronology. Where he’s cooking now is on the Lower East Side, in the kind of shadowy hideaway that usually represents a springboard, not a soft landing. Where he cooked just a year ago was in a gilded new Midtown hotel, the London NYC, which was designed to shine among New York’s brightest, starting with the restaurant on its ground floor. His boss there was that famously unexcitable introvert Gordon Ramsay, with whom he had crossed the Atlantic for their big stateside debut. And the boss was disappointed, you might say, by the way that debut played out. With Mr. Ferguson, a British veteran of many Michelin-starred kitchens in Europe, as its chef de cuisine, Gordon Ramsay at the London failed to wow most of the city’s prominent critics, including me. Mr. Ramsay quickly dismissed him. I imagine it as a tactful, poignant farewell: a 20-minute torrent of expletives, a few hurled knives, flesh wounds too superficial for paramedics to be summoned. What’s certain is that Mr. Ferguson survived. And what’s surprising is that instead of heading home  — or looking for a predictable theater for his Michelin-starry cooking  — he took his act to a neighborhood not known for such classically nurtured chefs and such classically prepared food. In its unusual marriage of setting and style, his new restaurant, Allen & Delancey, makes a striking bid for attention. But that’s not all it has going for it. It’s easily one of the prettiest, most comfortable places I’ve been introduced to in a while, a reminder of how crucial to an evening’s enjoyment the right visual trappings, the right amount of elbowroom and the ability to have a conversation without shouting can be. Its three dark, candlelit rooms  — they’re perhaps better called chambers  — feel like a scruffily elegant splice of antiques store, speakeasy and literary salon, what with all the frayed volumes on the shelves above the semicircular booths in the back, all the oil paintings and vintage photographs.  If Stevie Nicks were the host of a weekly book club, its meetings would happen someplace like this. And the food at Allen & Delancey is at once sophisticated and accessible, reliant on fail-safe luxuries deployed in a modestly creative and occasionally playful manner. It’s not entirely unlike what Mr. Ferguson was doing uptown, but context is everything. While his approach seemed too tame and uneventful in one milieu, at one price point, it plays differently in another. At Allen & Delancey the vibe is relaxed,  and all the entrees are under $30. You don’t typically get polish like this at prices like these. A flawlessly prepared appetizer of plump, succulent sea scallops with celery-root cream might seem de rigueur in a conventionally haute showcase. Here it’s an elegant surprise. The same goes for thin shavings of gorgeous raw hamachi, studded with glittering beads of  pink grapefruit. It’s a bracing dish whose sunniness  smacks of summer, but then the world of fashion has recently been toying with the seasons, realizing that weather isn’t what it used to be. Maybe the world of restaurants will follow suit. Mr. Ferguson strikes a fattier, messier note with an appetizer of marrow, but instead of asking you to scoop it from bones and sprinkle it with fleur de sel, he extracts, poaches and caramelizes  it. Then, to give it the salty complement it needs, he bejewels it with paddlefish caviar. It’s intense — too intense, in fact, but I salute its boldness. Foie gras is pressed into a terrine that also includes guinea hen and smoked ham knuckle, each player in this knockout triptych making its own distinct impression. There’s toast to spread it on, but I preferred it on its own. The menu presents just seven appetizers and seven entrees, eschewing snacks, sides and the like in favor of a straightforward traditionalism. Its concision permits the kitchen to concentrate meticulously on each dish: on the onion and marjoram stew and eggplant purée with a main course of daurade; on the crust of brioche crumbs, marrow and prosciutto that tops fluke; on the turnip confit, buttered radishes and foie gras with slices of duck breast; on the pickled pear and fenugreek syrup with pork belly. Not everything succeeds. In contrast to the tender fluke, the daurade was dry and even somewhat fishy. The foie gras with the duck provided a necessary boost for a bird less flavorful here than it can be. But the lamb  — divided into braised middle neck and meaty chop  — was  superb. And a dish humbly listed as “cabbage, beef and onion” turned out to be an inventive, intricate, memorable production: a cube of aged sirloin on a horseradish purée; cabbage stuffed with luscious braised beef; an onion stuffed with cabbage and truffle juice; a cube of potato gratin. Desserts aren’t a strong point, at least not yet. They’re apparently a work in progress, and where they should head is in a simpler direction, so that each plate doesn’t have so many tiny components, such an exhausting scattering of pleasures. But I hope the slow-roasted Gala apple with rich puff pastry and rum raisin ice cream sticks around or comes back next fall. It’s like an unraveled apple pie à la mode. The wine list follows the menu’s lead: urbane but approachable and relatively succinct. About half the whites are under $50 a bottle; nearly half the reds are under $75. That’s not how it is (or, to be clear, should be) in Mr. Ferguson’s former Manhattan haunt. He’s moved down but not out, settling for  — and in  — an irresistibly cozy refuge whose atmospheric charms paper over any unevenness in his labors. It’s no doubt a detour  from his originally planned route. But it’s not such an unhappy  destination. Allen & Delancey ** 115 Allen Street (Delancey Street), Lower East Side; (212) 253-5400.

188,Merkato 55,★,20080423,Frank Bruni,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/23/dining/23rest.html,"WITH the qualified exceptions of Morocco and Egypt, Africa hasn’t received much high-gloss treatment on the Manhattan restaurant scene. It has been denied the dubious courtesies extended to Europe, Asia, even Australia: the thumping music, the whimsically named special cocktails, the fashionably compartmentalized menus, the entrees in the $25 to $35 range. Merkato 55 fixes that, and how. With some 150 seats on two elaborately decorated levels in the overexposed, overwrought, when-will-it-be-over meatpacking district, it does more than give many African cuisines a degree of conventional polish they don’t usually get. It frames them as exotic pivots into a sexy evening for the Marc Jacobs set. It’s Spice Market on the Serengeti. That is not a bad concept, and Merkato 55, at its best, is a bold adventure, ranging across the entire African continent in search of dishes you don’t see often enough and dishes you haven’t seen before. Its chicken doro wat — served in a heavy cast-iron pot, the dark meat cresting the surface of a red sea — reveals the complexity of a superior curry. Its chickpea dumplings, which are like gnocchi that have undergone a spicy re-education, chart a propitious intersection of Italy and Ethiopia. But it’s not just geographically that Merkato 55 is all over the map. The menu mingles inspiration with too many hedges: the tuna tartar that astonishingly exists in every cuisine’s canon, at least once that canon has been translated for modern-day New York; a lobster salad with ambiguous sub- or supra-Saharan bearings; a thinly veiled steak frites; a rack of lamb — supposedly graced with an Ethiopian berbere spice mixture, including garlic, red pepper, cardamom and fenugreek — that could be any restaurant’s rack of lamb. My companions and I had lovely service and we had laughable service, usually on different nights but sometimes on the same one. In the worst case, the African breads we ordered never came. The pauses between courses stretched forever. And hours after we’d drained or abandoned several of the restaurant’s inventive rum-based drinks — the bitter-edged Kinka is tops — their vessels were still with us, cluttering the table. On a subsequent visit, a server accidentally poured water into my stemless glass of unfinished white wine. No biggie, except it took 15 minutes and repeated explanations before he registered what had happened, and it took another five minutes and the intervention of another server to correct it. These lapses undercut the restaurant’s significant promise and many New Yorkers’ rightly high hopes for it. The menu was put together by Marcus Samuelsson, a chef celebrated for his stewardship of the Scandinavian restaurant Aquavit, and Merkato 55 reflects his investigation into his own ancestry and identity. Although he grew up in an adoptive family in Sweden, he is Ethiopian by birth. Over recent years he traveled through Africa to research a cookbook, “The Soul of a New Cuisine: A Discovery of the Foods and Flavors of Africa.” It was published in 2006, and it informs Merkato 55. Mr. Samuelsson isn’t actually an owner of the restaurant, whose name refers to an enormous market in Addis Ababa and to the restaurant’s Gansevoort Street address, but the owners clearly have faith in him. The considerable money they’ve poured into the project is reflected in its striking décor. Lighting fixtures on the ground floor resemble upside-down Conga drums. The steps going upstairs wrap around a dangling contemporary chandelier and lead to circular booths, gleaming ebony tables and dazzling floral sprays. Merkato 55 is a looker. The first menu section is devoted to “kidogo,” defined as “small bites,” many of them spreads for the African breads, which I did ultimately get to try. I especially liked the benne, soft as focaccia and studded with sesame seeds, and the meali, a buttery cornbread that is even softer. The dips, chutneys and sambals that go with them include trusted friends like hummus and baba ghanouj and new ones like a cool, sharp mix of seedless cucumber, palm sugar, chili pepper, lime juice and olive oil. It’s the best of the bunch, though a blazing paste of dried shrimp, chili pepper and lemon grass comes close. The next menu section covers appetizers, some of which aren’t so much governed by Africa as gently exposed to it. Crisp-skinned, honey-glazed duck could sneak into just about any restaurant, though the plantain salad with it bespeaks a tropical inclination. Grilled shrimp piri-piri have an African pedigree but not, as it happens, enough peppery heat. You’re better off exploring a frisée salad that is a trove of crunchy smoked chickpeas, roasted hazelnuts and pickled eggplant. That Mr. Samuelsson and the executive chef, Andrea Bergquist, can run a kitchen is clear in unerring preparations of soft-shell crab, which has a spectacularly crunchy batter; black cod, almost creamy in texture; and tender guinea hen, which spends two days in a Senegalese marinade that includes palm oil, chili pepper and mustard. The marinade does its job without overstaying its welcome. But these chefs aren’t running this particular kitchen with enough consistency, and they haven’t turned a hard enough gaze on the menu’s weak spots. Under otherwise appealing merguez sausage lies corn pap, which is often likened to grits but in this iteration tastes like wet salt. Shrimp fritters taste nothing like shrimp, and balls of tuna coated with chopped peanuts taste only of peanuts. Wisely, the chefs have jettisoned a chicken soup with a wad of peanut butter that sinks to the bottom and resists any and all stirring, making its participation in the dish impossible and its purpose remote. But they still need to get rid of the granita on top of a raw oyster appetizer. The ingredients include honeydew melon and simple syrup, and it’s simply too sweet. So is the smoked tomato sauce over a cast-iron pot of lamb meatballs, but the meatballs themselves are plump and juicy, and who can quibble with the fried egg draped over them? This entree is a delight in the making, provided it gets some more tinkering and attention, and that is the story of Merkato 55 as well.

192,Empellón Cocina,★★,20120424,Pete Wells,East Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/dining/reviews/empellon-cocina-in-the-east-village.html,"THE danger in writing about the smart and often inspired cooking at Empellón Cocina, Alex Stupak’s free-associating mash note to the food of Mexico, is that other chefs might get the idea that anybody can do what he has done. Mr. Stupak first took up Mexican food last year, in a Greenwich Village restaurant he called Empellón. He added Taqueria to that first restaurant’s name when he opened Empellón Cocina in the East Village in February. In both cases, Empellón means a push or a shove, as in the push you’d give a child who isn’t sure he is ready to swim. Mr. Stupak is on both ends of that push. A 32-year-old former pastry chef, he has read the classic cookbooks and spent some time in Oaxaca and the Yucatán, but he hasn’t studied this intricate and endlessly complex cuisine with an anthropologist’s intensity, as Rick Bayless and Diana Kennedy have. If everybody with a similarly brief education opened a Mexican restaurant, the world would be full of foolish empanadas, pretentious moles and goofy adobos. But some beginning students of a language can wake up to discover they’ve been dreaming in it at night. At its best, Mr. Stupak’s cooking at Empellón Cocina resembles the food of Mexico the way a dream resembles life. Everything looks familiar, except that the light seems to be coming from a different direction, and did that river always run right through the bedroom? When you slice into a gordita, does it always gush with warm egg yolk? The one here does, the deep-fried flying saucer of masa giving way to the yellow yolk that curls around smoked plantains and a crumble of chorizo. Is the beef tendon in a bowl of menudo, the tripe stew, always as puffy and crisp as a snack chip? Here it is; you crunch it between mouthfuls of manila clams dunked in the spicy organ-rich menudo. Mr. Stupak achieves surprisingly few of his surreal effects through the tools he helped pioneer as a pastry chef at WD-50 and Alinea, where he laughed at the laws of physics. His wizard’s cap was packed with envelopes of agar-agar, carrageenan and other chemicals for building the suspensions known as hydrocolloids. Now he’s devoting himself, almost exclusively, to just one hydrocolloid, and it’s been around for ages: masa. In this kitchen, the ground corn is coaxed into marvelous shapes and textures. Just after you sit down in the fairly plain and unbuttoned dining room, somebody will ask if you want guacamole. The correct answer is yes, please, and not just because this rough mash of ripe avocados studded with pistachios is a fantastic riff on the theme, even a fairly faithful one. Say yes because with that guacamole comes a small box of hearty masa crisps, flat crackers that have a baked texture but a fried flavor. How the kitchen does it is not obvious. I know that straining is the secret of making the masa in a Yucatecan tamal colado so creamy and fluffy it is like a species of spongecake. But questions of technique weren’t on my mind very often, and neither were questions of authenticity. Very little on the menu pretends to be traditional. When I ate at Empellón Cocina, I concentrated on the flavors. I couldn’t quite believe how much a spackle of bittersweet mole poblano paste had to offer roasted carrots, or what a lovely job yogurt did of bringing them together. I admired the tense balance of chile heat in a tartare of Wagyu skirt steak that I spooned into a warm flour tortilla for a do-it-yourself taco. And I was thrilled to follow the smoky, throaty call of mezcal as it wove its way through cured ocean trout and through any number of cocktails, like one called the Darkest Corner of Oaxaca. (It’s not as menacing as all that, but it is worth keeping an eye on.) Watching Mr. Stupak try to pull all this off gives you the giddy feeling you get watching great actors improvise. The adrenaline charge of seeing pure inspiration powers you past the stammers and the stops. And there are a few stammers. After the sharp clarity of the guacamole, a salad of avocados buried under toasted grains feels unfocused and unrewarding. On the night I had it, a kind of queso fundido made with lobster and tetilla cheese was buttery and rich, but also so watery that eating it became a three-napkin job. In fact, the simple act of eating the food was often a source of frustration at Empellón Cocina. Mr. Stupak describes what he is up to here as “Mexican tapas,” and servers encourage you to share everything on what are essentially bread plates. With just one other person, this works out reasonably well. At a table for four, things can break down. An elegant and sinuous sea urchin mousse between two wavy walls of masa looked as if a grenade had landed on it once it had been carved into four portions. And I suspect that I missed the full impact of that menudo, or of the marine broth that came with poached oysters, when I was lapping them off elfin plates that held the remains of at least one previous course. Mr. Stupak is not the only chef who serves fastidiously prepared food and then encourages you to treat it as if it were a bowl of popcorn. It’s hard to believe these chefs ever sit down and eat the way they want us to do. If they did, they’d notice the way temperatures drop, flavors muddy, contrasts drift away. Sharing didn’t harm the desserts, the department of Lauren Resler, Mr. Stupak’s wife and his partner in the restaurant. In particular, the vanilla marquesote, a crunchy cake served with dehydrated oranges and café con leche ice cream, is the kind of sweet you need to keep close at hand if you are with fast eaters. But my misgivings about the so-called tapas format don’t change my feeling that Empellón Cocina is an exciting restaurant where even the dishes that don’t quite add up can be fun. Taste, admire, share if you must, argue if you like (one Mexican-food fan wishes Mr. Stupak would stop putting sugar in salsa), but please: Don’t try this at home."
202,Yumcha,One Star,20050608,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/08/dining/reviews/chinese-gets-dressed-up-for-a-change.html,"LIKE private school admissions, the Tony Awards and Judge Judy, the New York restaurant scene isn't entirely fair, and the first cuisine to tell you that would be Chinese. It rarely gets to wear the spiffiest outfits, lease the snazziest quarters or charge the highest prices, privileges lavished on French and Japanese. It seldom stops hustling, knowing that if it doesn't come on a bicycle to you, you may not find your way to it. And it usually pretzels itself into predetermined positions: steamed pork dumplings, General Tso's chicken, orange-flavored beef. You won't find any of those dishes at Yumcha, which takes on the challenge of casting Chinese in a softer, subtler, more elegant light. It goes further in this regard than 66, Jean-Georges Vongerichten's appealing foray into upscale Chinese, which is Yumcha's most obvious antecedent. While a large part of 66's approach is to upgrade the quality of ingredients in an otherwise recognizable lineup of appetizers and entrees, Yumcha presents a more original, albeit much shorter, menu. Its appetizers include shavings of peekytoe crab atop a cardamom custard and, separately, fried frog legs with a Thai chili mayonnaise. Its entrees include ginger-shellacked veal cheeks. Its desserts include a black sesame crème brûlée. If you sense in those descriptions a blurring of boundaries -- a sort of pan-Asian embrace coupled with a French kiss -- you understand Yumcha's wiles. It christens its come-on ""modern haute Chinese,"" the first and second words of which signal that this restaurant isn't exactly pledging greater ethnic authenticity than your corner supplier of salt-and-pepper prawns. Yumcha is doing what most ostensibly ethnic restaurants in the steeper price range do: wearing the tag it has chosen for itself loosely, as a declaration of inclination rather than a binding contract, and venturing into a wider world of ingredients and ideas. China is the compass, evident in almost every dish. Sichuan peppers dust beef tenderloin: steak au poivre on a jaunty trip to the Far East. Hunks of pork rib shimmer under a sesame glaze. Ginger and garlic romp proudly across the plates. But some dishes seem to steal glances toward Thailand or India, like fried rice with a curry and pineapple foam (mix the rice with the foam and you end up with an engrossing Asian risotto of sorts) or the cardamom-cushioned crab. Before Yumcha opened, its chef, Angelo Sosa, spent a month in Hong Kong, a city where the regional cuisines of China and the cooking of other Asian countries are well represented and sometimes mixed. Yumcha reflects that experience. Mr. Sosa has a background and biography suited to this polyglot, borderless culinary moment. His father is Dominican, his mother Italian. His jobs just before Yumcha were in the kitchens of Mr. Vongerichten, who has done as much as any other chef to bring the breadth and bounty of Asia into the glossier reaches of New York dining. Mr. Sosa worked at the restaurant Jean Georges and then at Spice Market. Among his talents is his thoughtful, careful cooking of flesh. Whether smoking, braising or baking it, he usually gets the succulent results he's after. This was certainly true of halibut with Chinese sausage and of yellowtail snapper with lily bulbs, soy, ginger and mustard, a terrific dish. This was especially true of the veal cheeks, layered with bean sprouts and apple strips. He injects fresh energy into what are often tired staples. His crunchy deep-fried spring rolls, which encased an amalgam of ground pork, shrimp, jicama, scallions and mushrooms, were excellent, as was the dipping sauce of crystallized ginger, plum wine and Chinese mustard with which it was served. An udon noodle salad with peanut dressing put a restrained, refined spin on cold noodles with sesame paste. But with other dishes, the calibration of seasonings was slightly off. Too much garlic weighed down the frog legs. The star anise infusion in a cold appetizer of tea-smoked chicken was too faint. The veal cheeks and the halibut had the excessive sweetness that frequently occurs when Asian food is adapted for American palates. Too many dishes were assembled in an overly busy fashion, often with a veritable thicket of greenery at their zeniths. Mr. Sosa leaves no little leaf unturned. There was baby basil, baby cilantro, shoots, sprouts or some combination thereof atop several of his constructions, including a throwaway appetizer of mussels. A few dishes have a vaporous quality, an evanescence that renders them quickly forgotten, their various bright parts adding up to a surprisingly dim sum. But the food at Yumcha is consistently intriguing, usually arresting and almost always quite pleasant. So is the space, which favors the colors black and red and has a lacquer-like sheen. Neither cutesy-small nor glitzy-big, Yumcha has 44 seats, 34 of them at decently spaced tables, the rest at a sushi-style counter and at a bar. If the restaurant is crowded, parties of two are sometimes nudged toward the counter or the bar. You might want to ascertain beforehand if that is your likely fate and decide if it fits your mood. You might also want to lower your expectations for desserts, which were largely disappointing and more ecumenical than the rest of the menu. The restaurant's distinctions include conscientious service and inventive lists of special cocktails -- a concoction of Champagne and rose-flavored iced tea is a summer must -- and special teas (the restaurant's name means ""drink tea""). All of these elements work, like much else about Yumcha, to make you feel relaxed, coddled, even amused. But you will less often be thrilled. At Yumcha, Chinese is relieved of its bicycle, put into a limo and squired to the prom, where it sashays onto the dance floor, giddy and resplendent, and cannot figure out precisely how to twirl.

208,Mas (la grillade),★★,20111227,Eric Asimov,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/28/dining/reviews/mas-la-grillade-nyc-restaurant-review.html,"WOOD, fire, smoke and flesh. It doesn’t get any simpler, more elemental or more prehistoric than this fundamental equation. Yet, simple is neither easy nor predictable. Simplicity in cooking requires skill, precision and taste. More than that, it demands discipline and courage to let great ingredients shine without imprinting them with ego. Imagination and a joyous sense of experimentation help, too, if one hopes to apply techniques as old as humanity in novel, intriguing ways. At his new restaurant in the West Village, Mas (la grillade), Galen Zamarra steps back from his more chefly pursuits at Mas (farmhouse), his first restaurant a few blocks away, to explore the possibilities of this more primitive method of cooking. Along with perhaps an annoying proclivity for parentheses, he brings to his mission the sophisticated sensibilities of a classically trained chef who cooked at the original Bouley as well as a series of Michelin three-star restaurants in France before opening the original Mas in 2004. The result is a restaurant of rare restraint and craft, where a chef who talks the talk of letting gorgeous ingredients speak for themselves actually follows through, doing little in the kitchen beyond enhancing the innately beautiful qualities of the food. This is far more difficult than it sounds. Cooking over wood with custom-designed grills, understanding the angles of heat, the qualities of various woods, the properties of coals and ashes, Mr. Zamarra manages to kiss food with smoke or flame, coaxing out delicate flavors and juicy textures that could be quashed by a more overbearing hand. And, I must say, it’s not entirely true that simplicity is all. Occasionally, more-composed dishes show up on the menu, which changes daily. His soups in particular are brilliant. One night it was a creamy, sumptuous pumpkin soup with bluefoot mushrooms and goat cheese croutons, tasting ever so slightly smoky, as if the pumpkin had been waved over the grill before liquefaction. Another night a soup captured the essence of pecans and cream, blending in tiny cubes of apple for sweetness and a touch of mint for a soothing coolness. The restaurant is in a sort of void between the hubbub of the central Village and the charm of the West Village, a block where pedestrian traffic dissipates as Seventh Avenue South flows into Varick Street. A dim glow through dark glass and faint, inviting smoke in the air are enough to draw one inside, where a small bar and a glassed-in wine room open into a split-level dining room that evokes not so much the eternal farmhouse (for which Mas is the Provençal word) as a plain split-level den in a newish subdivision. The downstairs room seems a bit claustrophobic, but upstairs a skylight and carefully placed mirrors create a more open feel. White tablecloths are a surprising gesture of luxury for a restaurant dedicated to simplicity, as are the carved slate silverware rests, a table-setting signature of Mr. Zamarra. The menu is largely à la carte, in the manner of Craft, though with far fewer sections and easier decision-making. A short list of nibbles is offered: shishito peppers, smoked peanuts with bacon and chili, a head of Rocambole garlic, roasted and smearable on toast. Nothing compelling, really, though pleasant enough with a glass of wine or cocktail. The wine list, by the way, is deep in Burgundies and southern French bottles, with some excellent German rieslings, too. While it’s not cheap, the inexpensive selections are excellent, and occasional values among older bottles pop up. Nothing can be done to improve upon the raw oyster, the ultimate simple food, but Mr. Zamarra makes a good case for an alternative, allowing a brief exposure to heat and wood smoke, plus some butter, lemon and thyme, to amplify the mollusk’s delicate, briny sweetness. He takes a firmer hand with rounds of squid, stuffing them with bay leaves, then grilling them. You must extract the bay leaf before eating, but the herb has left behind its savory essence, adding complexity to the subtly smoky, chewy squid. I loved an early fall special of duck breast with peaches and walnuts — an earthy, smoky, pure delight. None of Mr. Zamarra’s methods add much to grilled sardines, which stubbornly cling to the fishy attributes found at any tapas bar, nor to chunks of artichoke, although the accompanying grilled chanterelles are superb. But grilled romaine salad and croutons with blue cheese dressing and dense, rich, house-made lamb bacon is a fine, if unlikely, melding of smoke and lettuce. Enough with the preliminaries. Main course meats and fishes are the soul of the menu. Fishes radiate sweet, beautiful flavors, whether whole flukes or dorades, swordfish steaks or fillets of wild striped bass. They are salted and rubbed with herbs, dressed with lemon, butter or oil, except for bass, which might get a gremolata, which is really more of the same. A whole lobster is thoughtfully removed from its shell, leaving buttery meat barely imbued with a lip-brush of smoke. Likewise, spit-roasted squab exudes a pure, moist, almost livery flavor, while rack of lamb ranged on different nights from eight tender, lollipop-size bites to three ungainly rib chops, flavorful enough to gnaw to the bone. House-made lamb sausage tasted not just of smoked meat, but of complex spicing, while a grilled steak resounded with a beefy, funky tang. Occasional departures from the simple approach don’t always pay off. Grilled sweetbreads were delicate and tender, though covered in a maple glaze that was overly sweet. I loved the occasional specials, like grilled rabbit for two in which each part, from the delicate white meat to the gamier legs, offered its own particular flavor, or excellent pheasant in which smoky richness overcame the bird’s tendency toward dryness. Among side dishes, the most unadorned were best, like tiny beets cooked in coals until their sweet cores emerged, or charred spherical potatoes that tasted like creamy, salty platonic ideals. Desserts offer their own, more complicated rewards. Whether peanut-butter chocolate ganache on a whole wheat sable for contrasting crunch, or a pumpkin-chocolate tart with a layer of toasted marshmallow, or a maple-cheesecake brûlée, the flavors were nonetheless clear and deep. And if continued simplicity is required, cocoa-nib ice cream is about as pure an example of deliciousness as I can imagine. Mr. Zamarra’s journey backward so far is exhilarating, and I sense his exploration is just beginning. Greater mastery of technique may bring more imaginative expressions. In a city full of too much and too many, Mas (la grillade) is a fine example of the inspiring power of just enough.

211,Fung Tu,★★,20150512,Pete Wells,Lower East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/dining/restaurant-review-fung-tu-on-the-lower-east-side.html,"It can’t have been much fun for Jonathan Wu, the chef and an owner of Fung Tu, when Mission Chinese Food set up shop virtually around the corner in December. For his first year in business down in the headwaters of Orchard Street, just off East Broadway’s warren of Fujianese places, Mr. Wu was the only Asian-American chef plundering Chinese traditions to weave a modern cuisine of his own imagining. Then Danny Bowien showed up a couple of blocks away with his kung pao pastrami and his Mylar rainbow wall and his “Twin Peaks” hallway, and fanboys and fangirls turned cartwheels on the sidewalks. Sure, in theory, the more the merrier, a rising tide lifts all boats, and so on, but Fung Tu was now in the shadow of the only hipster-Chinese restaurant that anybody wanted to talk about. As a friend who likes both places put it, there must be moments when Mr. Wu feels like Donovan in “Don’t Look Back.”  Fung Tu didn’t help its own cause by getting off to a tentative start in 2013. A dinner about a month in held as many timid nonstarters (sunchokes and mushrooms uneventfully inhabiting a steamed bun) as eye-opening treats (the egg roll of pork belly and juicy olives stuffed into a delicately fried garlic-chive crepe). Some early reviews fell between nonplused and underwhelmed. Ligaya Mishan, in a Hungry City column, was more taken with the food than other critics were, but she thought some flavors never quite showed up. The sound of heads being scratched must have carried to the kitchen, because Mr. Wu has adjusted. Over three meals since the late winter, I rarely had any doubt what he was getting at. Mr. Wu is a two-year veteran of Per Se, and his cooking has always relied on nuance. It still does, but now the accents have been filled in. When something is supposed to be salty or spicy, it is. When salt and spice aren’t on the dance card, farmers’ market vegetables and other main ingredients step up. Dishes that were great from the start, like the duck-stuffed Medjool dates that drink up smoke until they taste like date bacon, are at least as good now. Some may be better. And many of the new dishes are a reason for anybody who wrote off Fung Tu after the early days to put a return visit at the top of the calendar. See, for instance, the China-quiles, which was devised for brunch but stays in its pajamas until dinner. The template is ma po tofu, but the bean curd has been replaced by a smoky egg custard so smooth and silky it almost parts itself when your spoon gets close. Over that goes a Sichuan pork sauce that makes your mouth hum and burn, studded with transparently thin yucca chips for crunch. On the opening menu, a similar but more fainthearted pork sauce was ladled over a white pile of doughy, bland dumpling knots. The sauce on the China-quiles is so much more delicious that you couldn’t call it an evolution; it’s more like an intervention. The Sichuan two-step occurs again in a vinaigrette that dresses cured Spanish mackerel, carved into elegant slices that almost look like small anchovies. With tart little buttons of pickled hon shimeji mushrooms, Mr. Wu shows that he can pluck the hot, sour and salty notes as cleanly and precisely as Jean-Georges Vongerichten. He can also bend classic European spring flavors in his direction, tossing asparagus, morels and peas with ricotta gnocchi that receive a whiff of Gorgonzola from doufu ru, fermented tofu.  Fried soft-shell clams appeared on the menu when spring got into gear. Their breading was a shade too thick, but Mr. Wu surrounded them with flavors that could make a clam rake taste good. First, he dusted them with dehydrated tomatoes, dried ginger and ground chiles, a blend that is a staple of Indian curries but becomes newly exciting in powdered form. Fermented black beans echoed the blend’s sour-salty theme. Fried clams want tartar sauce; Fung Tu’s is seasoned with star anise, charred ginger and other aromatics from a bowl of pho. The snack menu at Fung Tu does more than pad the check; it lets Mr. Wu come out and play. There are chips and dip, in the form of shrimp chips, shiny with hot oil, and a soft, rich, angry-red ’nduja. A sweet throat-burning mustard sauce was a little too intense for simple chicken wings, but the pairing of gently briny smoked mussels with scallion oil was so fresh and lively that I would like to take back what I said about smoked mussels at my parents’ cocktail parties. That doesn’t mean you’re in the clear yet, smoked oysters. Many wines would butt heads with such delicate, oblique cooking. Sommeliers overprescribe Gewürtztraminer for Chinese food, while laypeople tend to self-medicate with Tsingtao. Jason Wagner, Fung Tu’s drinks overlord and general manager, has better ideas. His very affordable list is packed with cryptic names like mondeuse and macabeu, which he will gladly decode. An enthusiastic partisan of sherry, he is worth listening to when he suggests a Gran Barquero amontillado that tastes like toasted hazelnuts dipped in caramel for the thin-cut fried pork chops with fermented mustard greens, a Chinatown classic here given a tangy, syrupy sherry-maple soy glaze.  The service in the beginning was a little tightly wound for a restaurant that sat between Success Hosiery and Yat Sing Trading Inc. Now the staff has relaxed into the setting, where handsome wood booths and straight-backed banquettes are illuminated by bare chrome-dipped bulbs caged in polyhedral glass webs made by Mr. Wu’s wife, the jewelry designer Jane D’Arensbourg. The bar up front provides an unhectic cove where you can decompress with cocktails that locate the middle ground between tradition and invention. Not usually the grandest of finales in Chinese restaurants, desserts, under Mr. Wu and his chef de cuisine, John Matthew Wells, are given a little more thought at Fung Tu, though they still seem like stepchildren to the rest of the menu. There are fried buns with fruit; a white chocolate mousse, not too sweet, with smooth, firm rhubarb slices; and peanut butter-chocolate truffles rolled in sesame seeds. When I first tasted one of those truffles, in 2013, it was chalk-dry and bitter, and went back to its plate after one small nibble. Like many things about Fung Tu, it turned out to be worth a second look."
218,WHEELCHAIR,ACCESS,20021113,Eric Asimov,,https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/13/dining/restaurants-from-italy-with-respect-for-tradition.html,"SOME restaurants never change. The character of a Peter Luger Steak House, for example, or an Il Mulino is so distinct and fully formed that you want to preserve it forever. Other restaurants, the great majority, must evolve or fade into sameness, their distinguishing features turning opaque and gray. It would be easy to imagine Le Madri in that whatever-happened-to category. Pino Luongo opened the restaurant in 1989 to a great deal of heat and fanfare and it quickly became the must-visit restaurant for what Bryan Miller, then the New York Times critic, called ''the hugs-and-kisses-I-love-your-hat-Ciao-baby crowd.'' Those stylish days are long gone. Situated in a neighborhood with a pulsating nightlife, Le Madri today posts a sign out front offering a free parking tie-in for the out-of-towners who make up much of the clientele. It hasn't heard a ''Ciao, baby'' in years. And yet, Le Madri has evolved rather than ossified, and the results are more than encouraging. Under a new chef, Pippa S. Calland, who took over the kitchen this year, the food is better than ever. It is no longer the rustic Tuscan fare prepared, according to Mr. Luongo's original conceit, by the nurturing hands of a rotating team of Italian mothers. Unburdened by that particular gimmick, Ms. Calland combines a respect for Italian traditions with an international sensibility that nonetheless never strays too far from Italy and is always anchored by good taste. Her evolved-Italian approach is typified by a surprising but excellent appetizer of tender pan-roasted clams, served with cubes of chorizo, cranberry beans and sawed-off tubetti pasta in a broth of tomatoes and chipotle chilies. The chorizo and chipotle add just the right smoky notes to this spicy, earthy dish. She serves rabbit confit in a crock with soft polenta, kale and melted taleggio, the fragrant, oozy mass adorned with toasted walnuts and pearl onions. It's the kind of dish that makes you wish for a cold rainy night and an old movie. So does bruschetta piled high with chicken livers, onions and pancetta, all imbued with the flavors of sage and balsamic vinegar. Coziness now rules in the dining room, too. Once, the pale walls and vaulted ceiling seemed fit for Florentine princes, though they made the room piercingly loud when full. Now the room has been softened by muted plaid wall coverings, echoed in the equally muted but different plaid that covers the chairs. It is quieter, but the room feels as if it is swathed in flannel pajamas, patterns that juxtapose oddly with the pseudo-grape vines twined around wires overhead. Waiters might as well be wearing footie pajamas, too, for all their puppylike eagerness to narrate the scripted extra details about the daily specials: for $87 you can taste the best white truffles that Croatia has to offer over risotto (superb, I must confess). A wood-burning oven on one side of the room remains a visual focus, perfuming the air with the scent of smoke, bread, oil and toasting herbs. From the oven come fine pizzas, light and crisp-crusted. It's fun to see what Ms. Calland does with seasonal ingredients. One night she made a wonderful soup of ground chestnuts and rice, lightly sweet yet made savory by pancetta. On another night the chestnuts were in the risotto, with fennel sausage under a blanket of cheese. On a third, they had been ground into a pasta dough, giving it a pronounced chestnut flavor, served with a bright sauce of sliced brussels sprouts and squash. Almost all Ms. Calland's pastas are distinct and lively, with clear, engaging flavors. Cappelletti are filled with sweet roasted butternut squash, delicious tossed with brown butter, sage and Parmesan. Housemade spaghetti has a lovely al dente texture and makes a good light dish with oil, garlic, cherry tomatoes and ricotta salata, all given unexpected punctuation by mint and hot red pepper. Tagliatelle in a veal and pork ragù is a fine rendition of the Bolognese classic. Nothing at the table is quite so impressive as prime rib of beef, served as a mound of wide slices surrounding a bare bone, with a pile of broccoli rabe and roasted potatoes underneath. The meat is tender and delicious, yet with real aged character. Following closely behind is outstanding grilled rack of lamb. By contrast, a grilled veal chop is almost wholly without character, while braised short ribs make more of an impact visually than in the mouth. For seafood, the simpler the better. Whole wild bass, roasted in the wood oven, showed off all its subtle nutlike flavor. It was superior to both lackluster sautéed cod and pan-roasted striped bass fillet. Desserts are not on a par with the rest of the meal. If you ever wondered how to make ice cream taste dry, try the gelato rolled in crushed almonds, served with a baba in amaretto. It's almost like eating sand. That is thankfully not the case with the top-notch tiramisù, though the field of dusted chocolate on top does trigger the cough mechanism. While Le Madri may never attract flashbulbs and paparazzi again, it is ripe for rediscovery. When it was hot, it promised more than it delivered. Now it's the other way around.

228,Elizabeth,★,20080902,Frank Bruni,Nolita,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/03/dining/reviews/03rest.html,"IF you’ve ever wondered what Barbie might binge on when Ken’s getting her down, the new restaurant Elizabeth has the answer. It’s called a cotton candy sundae, and it’s a strawberry jubilee: strawberry ice cream and macerated strawberries  topped with swirls of spun sugar colored pink and blue. It’s frosty and fruity and sweet and artificial: everything that’s good and important in life. I can think of only one grace note it lacks. Shouldn’t it be wearing a tiny rhinestone tiara? I’m at a loss for how to raise the ante on another extravaganza, “rice krispy treats.” As you might expect, this presents crunchy, sticky bricks of puffed rice, but here they function as shovels for an unexpected chocolate and peanut butter fondue with a hood of toasted marshmallow. It’s dessert as gooey spadework and dessert as regression therapy, taking you back to a childhood of Reese’s and s’mores. Are these concoctions serious and accomplished and bound to be the envy of pastry chefs from the East Village to the Upper West Side? No. But they’re undeniably amusing, and they go down pretty easily in the end. The same can be said of Elizabeth. It has its problems, annoyances and confusions. Just four months old, it has already changed plenty, and it still doesn’t seem entirely sure of what it wants to be. But it also has an adventurous, sometimes silly spirit that’s winning in its way. The front room has mesmerizing glass-tile mosaics on its walls, while the walls of a room behind it are covered in the kind of green felt you see on billiards and blackjack tables. My waitress’s outfit one night (scary knee-high boots with a skimpy black satin dress) made me wonder if she was poised to mete out cocktails or lashes. And the menu bops jauntily around the globe, sometimes in one dish. That probably means we’re supposed to think of the food at Elizabeth as New or Contemporary American. Contemporary Whimsical is more like it. While there are intricately composed dishes like a black sea bass ceviche with tropical fruit and Thai heat, and there are blasts of pure luxury like a Kobe beef tartare, there are also grilled cheese sliders. They sandwich aged Gruyère between miniature Frisbees of white bread, and they’re probably how Ken combats the midnight munchies. A burger is topped with fried instead of melted cheese, a Cheddar frico of sorts. In another playful flourish, a dish on the short vegetarian section of the menu encrusts tofu with caramel-sweetened nuts. It’s like a cloying breakfast cereal, unfit for dinner and none too appetizing at any time of day. Elizabeth is inconsistent, probably because of dynamics that plague too many New York restaurants. At the start, it had a consulting chef who brainstormed ideas, helped write the menu and then moved on, leaving the execution to lesser mortals. The Elizabethan muse was Doug Psaltis, who ran the kitchen at Country for Geoffrey Zakarian. What’s more, Elizabeth is already on its second executive chef, John Iconomou having relinquished control of savory and sweet dishes alike to Ryan Grant. That rapid turnover doesn’t encourage great faith or confidence, but these days it’s sadly common. Sheridan Square, in Greenwich Village, said goodbye to its first head chef at the two-month mark in June. Bobo, also in the Village, is already on its third head chef and isn’t yet a year old. To top it all off, Elizabeth sends out unsteady signals: is it for grazing while drinking — a last stop late at night — or a real meal? Oriented toward small plates or not? Servers volunteered different explanations of the portion sizes, and the menu doesn’t fully clarify matters. The servers aren’t exactly models of polished communication. When I asked the restaurant’s go-to wine consultant to describe a 2006 French Muscadet on the list, he said: “It’s good.” Followed by: “We sell a lot of it.” And that was that. But on all my visits to Elizabeth, I had some fun. The setting is sexy — a dashing redo of the Rialto, which Elizabeth replaced — and gives you comfortable seating options. You can unwind in one of the spacious circular booths, upholstered in tufted black leather, inside. Or you can relax in a garden with a retractable roof and trees overhead. And you can find dishes with personality and attitude. An appetizer called “pork l’orange” sounded French but tasted like Asian barbecue: an intriguing, zesty international alliance. In another flavor-packed appetizer, a poached farm egg was embellished with chorizo, smoked almonds and creamy summer corn. Italian dishes weren’t the kitchen’s strength: a sweet corn broth eclipsed the lobster ravioli it was supposed to sauce, and two kinds of risotto were overcooked and somewhat gummy. But the kitchen aced other dishes. Roasted garlic infused the broth below steamed clams with the right fragrant note. A tender fillet of black sea bass was seductively accessorized: apricot, elderflower, purple shiso and almonds. Busy? Sure. Boring? Not on your life. Also busy, but also worth it, was Elizabeth’s flirtation with northern Africa in the requisite chicken entree, poached white meat and pan-roasted dark meat over a curry-perfumed couscous studded with dark raisins, golden raisins, dried apricots and olives. All of this was packed in a black metal skillet that most definitely wasn’t a small plate. Dishes labeled entrees turn out to be precisely that, but other menu sections advertise dishes of ambiguous dimension. That’s no doubt reassuring to the generally young and clearly appearance-conscious patrons, who want something festive but not too filling. I bet they split those madcap desserts in three. Their appetites tend to be doll-size. Elizabeth * 265 Elizabeth Street (Houston Street); (212) 334-2426. elizabethny.com ATMOSPHERE Two sexy indoor rooms and an all-season garden out back.

241,Ago,Poor,20080611,Frank Bruni,TriBeCa,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/11/dining/reviews/11rest.html,"BECAUSE our 8:30 p.m. table at Ago wasn’t ready by 8:51, we were still at the bar when the great wave of white wine crashed over it. I’m talking about the “Poseidon Adventure” of wine spills. Shelley Winters could have done the backstroke in it. I’m not sure how the bartender set it in motion, and neither was he. He kept marveling at its fury and aftermath: my friend’s wine-splashed chin, her wine-soaked skirt, her wine-sopped entirety. He apologized perhaps 639 times, and I wouldn’t recount the incident if that were the whole of it. Spills happen. The following shouldn’t. At 8:56, when he asked my friend if he could help out in any way beyond free drinks, she wondered if he could maybe see about our table for four. He bolted away for a prolonged huddle with the hostesses, who had noticed (and seemed to giggle) over the sauvignon tsunami, and with a manager. He was visibly pleading with them. He returned at 9:02 with something less than disaster relief. Our table, he said, should be ready in 10 minutes. Never mind that we’d been told at 8:45 that we had five minutes to go. Never mind that Ago has some 110 seats, giving it more flexibility than many restaurants have. We waited. And waited. One of the hostesses finally fetched us at 9:22. I’ll do the math: that’s 52 minutes after our reservation. She led us to a round table little bigger than a bike wheel. When our four appetizers later arrived and claimed every square millimeter of it, the waiter audibly contemplated balancing a fifth, communal appetizer that we’d ordered on top of our wine glasses. The table was pressed so close to a column that I couldn’t lower my right arm all the way, and if my wine-drenched friend leaned back in her chair, the column obstructed her view of me and mine of her. For its soggiest customer, Ago had made available its sorriest real estate. This restaurant isn’t in the hospitality business. It’s in the attitude business, projecting an aloofness that permeated all of my meals there, nights of wine and poses for swingers on the make, cougars on the prowl and anyone else who values a sort of facile fabulousness over competent service or a breaded veal Milanese with any discernible meat. The one I had one night was pounded so thin that the breading on top met the breading on the bottom without pausing for much of anything in between. A vegan could have made peace with it. Some of the other food passed muster. The best of the pizzas from Ago’s wood-fired brick oven had blistered, smoky crusts and thin sheets of decent Parmesan. An appetizer of burrata was suitably creamy, and a juicy T-bone — cooked, like the pizzas, in the brick oven — satisfied the steak lover in me. But this restaurant in the new Greenwich Hotel in TriBeCa doesn’t concentrate its energies on quality or consistency. It’s content to be a deafening “hot spot,” which is how it’s identified in the headline atop its inaugural press release, and when you’ve got the heat and the crowd is standing-room-only, why sweat the raw artichoke salad? The paltry artichoke was hard to find among all the frisée, and Shelley could have done the freestyle in the dressing. Ago’s principal owners include the chef Agostino Sciandri — the restaurant, pronounced AH-go, is named after him — and the actor Robert DeNiro, who treated TriBeCa much better with Nobu. They teamed on an initial Ago in West Hollywood, another in South Beach and yet another in Las Vegas. New York is getting their sloppy fourths, emphasis on sloppy. They poured some money into the place, which occupies a corner space with grand windows. The reclaimed wood in the beams on the high ceiling is from the 1800’s. The mirrors are antique glass. With columns bedecked in marble and a floor of terra cotta from Tuscany, the trattoria wears Prada, or whatever the decorative equivalent is. The menu is divided into antipasti, pasta dishes (along with risotto and gnocchi), pizzas and main courses of fish and meat. It has stabs of ill-advised invention, like a starter of gummy juniper-smoked swordfish with misshapen, oddly frayed wedges of orange and other citrus. It has usual suspects, like spaghetti (overcooked) with clams (slightly gritty), or grilled branzino (moist, though bland) with sauteed spinach. Apart from gnocchi with a robust lamb ragu, most of the pasta dishes — much more expensive and less reliable than those at Morandi, say, or Gemma — were on the bland side. And no pig should perish for a pork chop as dry as one at Ago. Desserts were dead-on one night, dead ringers for Sara Lee another. Stick with the terrific gelato, made in-house. Brace yourself for confusion. I called in early May for a reservation in early June and was informed that everything between 6 and 10 p.m. was booked. I called a few days later to ask anew about the same dates and was informed that reservations weren’t yet being taken for that time period. A sommelier chided me for ordering wine bottle No. 199, saying the number didn’t exist. Wrong: it was there, but the restaurant had inexplicably put it after No. 200 on the expensive list. A food deliverer conflated veal and lamb into some hybrid beast, the juveniles of two species in one. This happened on a night when my companions and I waited 26 minutes past our reservation time. Our appetizers included a pasty tuna tartare. Then came an entree that perplexed us, a pale slab of meat with one long bone. “What is this?” asked one of my friends. “The special veal chop,” said the food deliverer. “But I ordered rack of lamb,” my friend said. I had heard him. “Yes,” said the deliverer. “That’s rack of lamb.” My friend pressed: which was it? “It’s the special rack-of-lamb veal chop,” the deliverer said, at which point we sought deliverance from him and searched for our frequently vanishing waiter, whom I had come to think of as the bucatini Houdini. When he reappeared, he identified the meat as veal. He insisted that rack of lamb couldn’t have been among the specials he’d recited because the restaurant wasn’t even serving it. My friend and I were apparently in the grip of the very same auditory hallucination. He offered to bring us something else, but we stuck with the veal. It wasn’t half bad. When we left we noticed him squabbling with nearby diners. They were telling him he’d mucked up their order, and they looked miserable. They had clearly gotten the hang of the place.

254,Kurve,Satisfactory,20081118,Frank Bruni,East Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/19/dining/reviews/19rest.html,"JUST when you think you’ve witnessed all the restaurant kraziness there can be, along comes a Kurve. It opened in July. And then in August. And then in September, at which point it finally broke its go-stop, yes-no pattern of losing its nerve, locking its glass doors, reshuffling the staff and reconsidering the galangal. Still, telephone issues lingered. For a spell last month, you got a “temporarily disconnected” recording when you called. Just last week, the recording was back. Rest assured, or maybe uneasy: Kurve was doing business, in its fashion. I know because I was there to hear the restaurant’s D.J. follow up a track from the Andrews Sisters with one from Michael Jackson, and to stare at the futuristic white furniture and all the glowing arches and washes of pink and purple light. Kurve looks like a nail salon on  Venus. It serves Thai food, for the most part. But also Chinese food. And also, naturally, spaghetti carbonara, which I recently spotted on the menu of a new French brasserie in TriBeCa as well. Is carbonara the next tuna tartare, presented by Manhattan restaurateurs as a legitimate player in every culinary tradition? Hope springs. Kurve struts. Until recently it outfitted its servers in proper hats, which prompted associations that changed depending on how far our meal had progressed, how thoroughly our patience had been taxed and how sinister our outlook on the restaurant had become. “A Tommy Tune musical,” a companion said merrily at the start. “That apple-for-a-face Magritte painting,” someone else said mischievously at the 25-minute mark. “Liza in ‘Cabaret,’ ” I snarled after another 20 minutes. “Malcolm in ‘A Clockwork Orange,’ ” someone else declaimed as we breached our second hour. Kurve does everything with a swerve. On the gleaming pink menu, which begins with a page of dim sum options and then a page of appetizers, the entrees are grouped under “legs” (meaning four of them, and signaling red meat), “wings” (meaning two, and crying fowl) and “gills, fins and shells” (guess). It could be argued that reviewing a restaurant this assertively kooky is shooting gills, fins and shells in a barrel, but Kurve is a riddle and lesson too ripe to ignore. How do restaurateurs pour this much money and this much vanity into a project and bungle it to the extent that the Kurve brigade does? Its eye-popping space-age look, courtesy of the designer Karim Rashid, suggests an investment of millions, and getting that sheen just right is an explanation offered for its failure to open any time near an initially projected date of September 2007. Its kitchen is run by Andy Yang, widely praised for his cooking at the less shiny, more matter-of-fact Thai restaurant Rhong-Tiam. And Mr. Yang, who is also one of the restaurant’s principal owners, has reached out to talented hands to supplement his own efforts. Sasha Petraske helped with the cocktail list, while Pichet Ong pitched in with desserts. Kurve, in short, has ambitions. Pleasures, too. Those cocktails, using a variety of fresh juices, rise above the hack work at many restaurants of this self-consciously glitzy ilk, and after a few of them Kurve’s walls, striped and swirled in the manner of a Maori tribesman’s face, seem less menacing than hypnotic. Much of the dim sum is terrific, a judgment that applies not only to such straightforward selections as juicy duck or delicate crab dumplings but also to less predictable ones: bacon-wrapped tiger shrimp with a beguilingly spicy sriracha mayonnaise; deep-fried croquettes of tiger shrimp and fresh mango. And the curry pastes  — rich with coconut milk, lively with kaffir lime and lemon grass  —   are sometimes excellent. The green one over king salmon has spinach in the mix, while the tawny one over dark-meat chicken has cashew nuts. But there are nearly as many causes for head-scratching, like a dish that molds salmon into a slender, slippery cuff around a stunningly salty heap of pulled and minced duck. Or like the “Thai style risotto,” a viscous gruel that’s served with a clump of pork belly and intended, perhaps, for the Siamese twin of Oliver Twist. Thanks to one of my first visits to Kurve, I’m aware of a maritime labor dispute never mentioned in the mainstream media. Rock shrimp went on strike in late October, or so I concluded from their failure to participate in the rock shrimp tempura, which tasted only of tempura, and a somewhat greasy tempura at that. Ong or no Ong, the desserts  — one parfaitlike creation after another, each served in what looks like a broad drinking glass  —  are entirely unremarkable. But the service is the biggest puzzle of all. Our waitress one night had apparently been told by management that the single thought to keep in mind  — the single syllable  —  was glum. I wasn’t sure whether to give her a tip or a Zoloft. When asked which of 23 dim sum options shouldn’t be missed, she said, “The dumplings,” thus narrowing those options to 15. When asked which wines Kurve served by the glass, she said, “Red and white.” Every time I went, Kurve didn’t have something  — usually, many things  — advertised on the menu. On two occasions I asked for the “veal chop” listed among the dim sum, intent on learning how something so typically hefty could be shrunken to the size of a canapé. I never got that education. On two occasions I asked for a dish of lobster with sea urchin. But Kurve wasn’t stocking that, either. Although I had the shrimp wrapped in bacon twice, I asked for it only once. The second time it came in lieu of the pork wrapped in bean curd. Although I indicated surprise, I never received an explanation. Maybe the bean curd had wandered off with  the  veal and the lobster.  Maybe Kurve considers any one wrapped entity interchangeable with any other. But I think the server —  entranced by Kurve’s music, distracted by Kurve’s lights and taking a kue from Kurve itself —  was simply konfused. Kurve Satisfactory (Zero stars) 87 Second Avenue (East Fifth Street); (212) 260-8018.

255,Japonais,One Star,20060906,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/06/dining/reviews/an-asian-fantasy-reproduced.html,"""HAVEN'T I been here before?"" a companion asked me one night as we entered Japonais and he took in the candy-colored drinks on the bar, the plush lounges nearby, the sushi bar against a far wall and the vast main dining room with its inevitable design centerpiece, a many-limbed sculpture that looks like the offspring of a supersize bonsai tree and a French poodle. It was a simple question with a complicated answer. No, he hadn't technically been here. And yes, of course, he had, at least if he'd managed over the last few years to drop by Megu or Morimoto, Ono or Nobu 57. The list goes on, and at a certain point the boundaries of these different restaurants blur. They're all invariably theatrical, obliquely Asian and ostentatiously huge, inhabiting a Manhattan genre that's gone in no time flat from plump to morbidly obese. Which doesn't mean they're not enjoyable. They've proliferated for good reasons. They provide food with visual appeal and a (quickly diminishing) touch of exoticism. They provide settings that stroke many senses at once. They're full-scale productions, serving not just a meal but a toro-gilded fantasy of what it means to have free time, extra money and an appetite for adventure in a great, sexy metropolis today. And, to be fair, they're not the only breed of restaurants to traffic in emulation. Brasseries, bistros and trattorias have long hewed to established models, following paces set forth by their forebears. But restaurants like Japonais rely more heavily on a kind of dazzle that has diminishing returns. Your enjoyment of them hinges largely on your degree of exposure. If you've been there and done that, you can't be as impressed as you were the first, second or eleventh time around. Your focus returns to what's on the plates, and at Japonais that was a mix of pleasing innovations, trustworthy staples, unimpressive curiosities and outright mistakes. Meals at Japonais were usually herky-jerky affairs, veering quickly from elation to exasperation and undercut by odd pacing and off-key service. ""Are you hungry tonight?"" a server asked my friends and me. ""You've come to the right place!"" That statement struck a clumsy note in a restaurant going for glossy enchantment and charging $58 for slices of smoked wagyu rib-eye. So did a comment by another server, who was steering us away from one of the desserts. ""I don't even know what a panna cotta is,"" he said. Several of the desserts he pointed us to, however, were great. They included apple toban yaki, which was like a deconstructed apple pie à la mode, and pumpkin cheesecake, which had a texture more akin to a soufflé's, along with pineapple foam and an almond cookie crust. It seemed neither Japanese nor French, which are the two principal cuisines being fused at Japonais, but then the rules for restaurants like these aren't firm. And the rules don't need to be when results work as well as those desserts or ""le quack Japonais,"" a riff on Peking duck that brings China into play. It presents fat slices of gorgeous duck breast smoked with maple leaves in place of thin, crunchy slivers that are mostly skin, and they are meant to be combined in wraps with not only cucumber, scallions and hoisin sauce but also a mango chutney. At Japonais you can seldom predict from menu descriptions or general instinct what's going to be a winner. One of the best appetizers -- crab cakes -- sounded like they belonged in a different place. They were pan-seared, lightly breaded with panko and served with a soy mustard sauce that managed to be creamy without being rich. Japonais is an offshoot of a restaurant of the same name that opened about three years ago in Chicago. A Las Vegas offshoot is due later this month. The hot dishes are under the supervision of the chef Gene Kato, while cold dishes, including sushi, fall under the purview of the chef Jun Ichikawa. Jeffrey Beers designed the space, creating a moody theater with undulating strips of wood on the ceiling, semicircular booths along one wall and shiny red chairs. A lovely veranda, which allows outdoor dining in warm months, is a special lure. The cocktails aren't. Most of the ones I tried were too generically sweet. Among the restaurant's selection of makimono were more that showcased vegetables, including yamagobo (burdock root) and kaiware (daikon sprouts), than you find elsewhere. The ""spicy mono"" roll, mingling tender octopus with tuna tartare and an eel sauce, balanced spicy and sweet elements in a delightful way, and the quality of the seafood in simpler sushi and sashimi selections was beyond reproach. But there was also plenty of nonsense in the multisegmented stretch of the menu leading up to entrees. Taking snow crab claws, encasing them in shrimp and crab mousse and then deep-frying them produced generically crunchy finger food with little crab flavor. Teriyaki-coated chicken drumettes with a roasted scallion dipping sauce had less appeal than your average Buffalo wings in your average sports bar. Unevenness was the norm. Out came a ceviche with terrific sweet shrimp, bathed in a ginger and yuzu marinade and paired with an enticing avocado mousse. Out came three unadorned colossal shrimp, chewy and tasteless. The meat in a wagyu beef toban yaki (the phrase refers to cooking on a ceramic surface) was too leathery to be redeemed by a wonderful fondue -- made with Kirin beer, shallots, ginger, cream and Brie -- that surrounded it. But the meat in that rib-eye, smoked with a mix of woods including hickory, was fantastic. So was a grilled filet mignon, served with an uni butter sauce that was like an Asian béarnaise. The rib-eye was in front of us one night when two of my friends, sinking into comfortable chairs and letting hypnotic music waft over them, volunteered that they really liked Japonais. Their reaction made sense. We had hit the best dishes. We hadn't drawn one of the goofy servers. And these friends hadn't been to many restaurants like this one. For them it had an intrigue that eclipsed its shortcomings. Japonais  * [Rating: One Star]  111 East 18th Street; (212) 260-2020.

256,Pulino’s Bar and Pizzeria,★,20100504,Sam Sifton,Nolita,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/05/dining/reviews/05rest.html,"FREUD said cultural achievement and sensual pleasure pull in opposite directions. He never met Keith McNally, who just introduced the insanely crowded Pulino’s Bar & Pizzeria on a formerly moribund corner of the Bowery and East Houston Street. Thirty years ago, Mr. McNally opened Odeon, in TriBeCa. It was hardly TriBeCa then. Mr. McNally made  the neighborhood seem like Paris, though the streets were deserted and rats ran in the gutters. It was the sort of restaurant where artists ate steak and all sorts of interesting things happened in the restrooms. It had a great country salad. A little while later but still a long time ago, he opened Cafe Luxembourg, uptown on the West Side: same restaurant, but totally different, filled with lawyers, poets and heiresses looking terrific under beautiful light. He did this again with Lucky Strike on Grand Street, with Nell’s on 14th Street. Like Danny Meyer, who has popularized a certain kind of experience in Union Square and the Flatiron district, Mr. McNally is an important figure in the recent social history of Manhattan. His restaurants have introduced or enhanced neighborhoods all over downtown: Pravda and Balthazar in SoHo, Pastis in the then-quiet meatpacking district, Schiller’s on the Lower East Side, Morandi and Minetta Tavern in the West Village. Now, there is Pulino’s. You can sit at the bar there, drink Campari and read the newspaper, as you can at any of Mr. McNally’s establishments, feeling grand under a ceiling that soars above a checkerboard floor, surrounded by distressed mirrors, chicken-wire glass, towering walls covered with liquor bottles. The room evokes Schiller’s and Pastis alike, and is as recognizably McNally as the man himself, standing rumpled as Eeyore by the pass to the kitchen. You can have pizza, too, sitting at a blue table built out of old police barricades: ovoid, thin crusted and just charred, not at all sweet and barely chewy, cut into squares in the manner of bar pie in St. Louis. Sweet rock shrimp and speck make one very good topping, in a garlicky, oregano-heavy tomato sauce the color of a gleaming fire truck. There is a fine “bianca tradizionale,” as well, with mozzarella, pecorino, black pepper and lashings of pork strutto, which is the Italian way of saying clarified pork fat. The meatball version is nice, as well, with pickled chilies. Despite this, though, and despite the rare McNally misstep of the blaring neon signs out front that say so, Pulino’s is not really a pizzeria, nor a bar. It is a restaurant, a good one. (It’s only a bar if you didn’t make a reservation and need to sit or stand until a table opens.) The chef is Nate Appleman, a young transplant from San Francisco. His cooking is simple and brash, as American as it is inflected with Italian flavors, rustic in the sense that it comes out of smoky, wood-assisted ovens, and urban for the very same reason. He makes menacing fingers of pork fat and skin into fancy chicharrones, with a sweet, acidic pear mostarda to cut into their salty, velvet crunch. He shaves bottarga into a dressing for smoked sablefish with celery, capers and dill, a nice nod to the neighbors at Russ & Daughters, champions of such flavors. Red cabbage comes in a tangle with roasted sunchokes that might be pancetta, and actual pancetta alongside that, with oranges scented with honey, all salted with pecorino. It is delicious. Mr. Appleman isn’t interested in beauty. Unsightly on its face is steak, which he serves with anchovy butter, potatoes, rosemary and Parmesan. It looks like the heel of a cabdriver’s shoe, with a pile of dodgy potatoes beside it that might be fries or some kind of baked error. But it makes for fantastic eating, with a sear on it perhaps an eighth of an inch thick, under which soft, rosy meat blooms to complement the starch. There is splendor beneath its surface. The fazzoletti isn’t much to look at either, crepe handkerchiefs folded under a thick run of lamb ragù heightened with pecorino. But it, too, is marvelous, one of the few lamb dishes in an upscale New York restaurant that tastes emphatically of lamb. The dish has a kind of funky, fantastic flavor that rebounds off the pancakes nicely. It sticks in the mind: the sort of dish you go to sleep thinking about, dreaming about, and wake up desiring. In such an environment, roasted scallops with grapefruit, olives, shallots, radicchio and a shower of herbs counts as health food — the dish is light and almost smoky. Order it with a crèma gelato sundae for dessert, with amarena cherries, chocolate cookies and salted pistachios, and life without meat seems livable. Too bad, though, that baked ricotta is dry and underflavored, and that the nduja, a house-made sausage paste, has none of the bang-pow flavor and fattiness that it calls for in its Calabrian ideal. (Both dishes are better ordered at A Voce.) Hen-of-the-woods mushrooms, at their best almost sausagelike in intensity and texture, need a little more butter or more time in the oven, or both. (Semolina gnocchi, in a Roman-style tomato sauce, with braised chicken, needs less.) And a section of pinwheel sausage reminiscent of the sort sold at Faicco’s on Bleecker Street will elicit shrugs from any New Yorker who has spent 45 minutes waiting for a table here, delicious as it is. Coulda made it at home. So, don’t order that. Look instead to nightly specials, where Mr. Appleman tacks away from Mr. McNally’s haute comfort-food groove and makes the food better than it needs to be. Goat meatballs to convert the squeamish, with a tang of yogurt: oh, man. Duck with charred dates, fennel, smoked olives: yes. Come late for the burgers that are served, hipsterishly, only after midnight. Come early for breakfast, where a roasted grapefruit benefits from its crust of muscovado sugar and scattered mint, and the pizza has sausage and bacon on it, with white Cheddar and a fried egg. (Good coffee, too.) Pulino’s can be punishingly loud, particularly when the walls on the east side of the room are open to blatting trucks on the Bowery and everyone’s shouting into the din. But it is beautiful, and the service has the practiced excellence of first-class air travel or Parisian bistros. The restaurant is a vision of Manhattan that, like all of Mr. McNally’s projects, is at once entirely fake and entirely accurate. Restaurant dressed as theater dressed as nostalgia, is how the novelist Richard Price put it, in “Lush Life.” That’s Pulino’s exactly.

257,Convivio,★★★,20080930,Frank Bruni,Midtown East,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/01/dining/reviews/01rest.html,"WHAT’S in a name change? In the case of Convivio, which used to be L’Impero, a whole lot more than a new alignment of vowels and consonants. There’s a new color scheme, with red supplanting blue, and a new mood, warmer and looser. There’s a new menu, which adds a category of uncomplicated snacks, and a new, lower price for a four-course prix fixe of appetizer, pasta, main course and dessert. All of that adds up to a shift away from any of the regal airs connoted by the word L’Impero, Italian for “empire,” and toward the more festive spirit telegraphed by the tag Convivio, which isn’t even a proper Italian term. And that shift, completed two and a half months ago, wisely bows to the times. Many New Yorkers can no longer afford to act like kings. For a while, at least, they’ll have to content themselves with less stilted postures and less gilded pleasures. But neither the moment nor the market has anything to do with the most important adjustment behind Convivio, which is this: The ratio of can’t-miss to not-quite dishes is more favorable than it was shortly after the chef Michael White took charge of the kitchen at L’Impero in mid-2007. (I gave L’Impero two stars that October.) In the segue from L’Impero to Convivio Mr. White did some serious thinking, tasting, tweaking and editing. And in the process Convivio emerged as a pasta lover’s dreamland. Its noodles — all house-made — have a more substantial texture and taste than those at most other Italian restaurants, except when they’re not meant to: when, say, they’re semolina dumplings mixed with buffalo milk ricotta, the delicate couriers of a bright, sweet tomato sauce for which they seem uniquely apt. The restaurant’s sauces are alternately classic and inventive, blunt and nuanced, gut-busting and gut-tickling. Mr. White can do it all. There’s a version of spaghetti alla carbonara — creamy with pecorino and egg, salty with pancetta, zippy with black pepper — that’s as satisfying as any carbonara you’re likely to encounter, in part because the strands of fresh pasta have such presence, giving their bold partners something real to hold on to, something sturdy to ride. At the other end of the spectrum there’s a dish you most likely haven’t encountered, a creative riff on Sardinian tradition that weds saffron-seasoned gnochetti, which are small dumplings, and a sauce of olive oil, fresh tomato and sea urchin. The sauce emulates the richness but not the heaviness of butter, and it marshals the haunting, peculiar brininess of urchin roe in a tantalizingly subtle way. There’s crab in the dish, too, its texture mimicking that of the dumplings, its taste providing another whisper of the sea. So, are these two pasta dishes the absolute musts? Yes, and no. Meatier, cheesier appetites are perhaps best served by hand-twisted fusilli with a pork shoulder ragù and a fonduta (or fondue) of melted caciocavallo, poured tableside. Or by the “tortelli di Amatrice,” ravioli with guanciale and buffalo milk ricotta on the inside and, beneath them, a cacio e pepe sauce of liquid pecorino that achieves some magical equilibrium between salty and peppery. You would need many visits to Convivio to try as many of the pasta dishes as you should, which is nearly all of them. Mr. White is doing even better work with pasta at Convivio than he has done at Alto, and that makes up for the fact that Convivio isn’t quite as complete or consistent a restaurant as Alto. Across my visits its appetizers and pasta dishes were appreciably stronger than its entrees, which included a few clunkers, and its desserts, which didn’t shine quite as brightly as they could have. Convivio is also a better value. For a restaurant that has held on to most of the trappings of conventional fine dining — in becoming less fussy, it hasn’t exactly become casual — it charges restrained prices. That prix fixe is $59, down from $64. At lunch it’s $49. Ordered à la carte, L’Impero’s pasta dishes were as high as $30. None of Convivio’s exceed $25. And yet there has been a rise in quality. Apart from pasta there were still plenty of big hits. Of the $4 to $6 snacks, I especially enjoyed the arancini, molten with cheese, and a duo of burrata and tomato sauce to be spread together on toasted bread: make-your-own mini-pizzas. They’re presented under the heading “sfizi,” a word that further expands the vocabularies of New Yorkers who’ve tried stuzzichini, piccolini and cicchetti elsewhere. When it comes to appetite-priming nibbles, Italian is a predictably nimble language. With the appetizers, Mr. White revealed more of his particular culinary personality, emphasizing offal. There were sweetbreads, chicken liver, tripe sausage, pigs’ feet, a pig’s-head terrine with the enticing inclusion of watermelon rind, and, best of all, thin slices of braised veal tongue with a salty, sharp salsa verde. Given Convivio’s focus on southern Italy, Mr. White puts a bevy of seafood on the menu, including a frittatta that harbored more mussels, clams, squid and shrimp than it should have been able to without falling apart, and terrific grilled mackerel over an even more terrific potato salad of sorts that was studded with spicy salame. Speaking of potatoes, a side of crunchy baked-then-fried potatoes, sprinkled with pecorino, was a knockout. But seafood  gave him some trouble, too. An entree of run-of-the-mill grilled shrimp was dully seasoned, while roll-ups of fried swordfish with a yogurt sauce tasted too much like some tarted-up refugee from Long John Silver’s. I spotted neither dish on recent menus, so maybe Mr. White has rotated them off — for good, I hope. But I hope he keeps his roasted squab, with a shiny, crunchy skin that any duck would envy. If Convivio is indeed still making refinements, it should pay some heed to acoustics. Convivio is much louder than L’Impero was, but several maddeningly soft-speaking servers apparently haven’t figured that out. Mr. White and Chris Cannon, the principal owners, should get them vocal lessons, or hire carnival barkers in their stead. Then these earnest, ambitious men can turn in good conscience to their coming project, a new Italian restaurant where San Domenico was. Sounds like something of a mini-empire. Let’s hope it’s built on cooking as soulful and unpretentious as Convivio’s."
258,The E.U.,★,20070411,Frank Bruni,East Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/11/dining/reviews/11rest.html,"AT some point I began to brace for a hailstorm, and to wonder if the locusts would sweep in after that. The E.U. was plagued, on a scale that was almost biblical. Where to begin? Maybe with the liquor license, by which I mean the restaurant’s unusually protracted struggle to get one. As the E.U. readied to open  — for the first time  — early last year, it confronted both an East Village community board in a killjoy mood and a State Liquor Authority in a withholding phase. So the restaurant tried to make a booze-less go of it, presenting its vision of an elevated gastropub with only two of those three syllables at its disposal. It closed less than two months later, having learned that   the last syllable was sort of crucial. By then the first chef associated with the restaurant had already left, and certain patterns had been established. Chefs would come; chefs would go. The E.U. would spring forward; the E.U. would fall back. This instability persisted even after it got a license for wine and beer last September. So did the setbacks, including a burst pipe in its building that flooded the place during dinner service on a weekend night. It toweled itself off. Picked itself up. Got yet another head chef, Akhtar Nawab, a Craftbar alumnus who began in late January. And then, at last, its fortunes changed. From the kitchen came a very fine appetizer of grilled octopus, served with chickpeas and preserved lemon, and an even better entree of baked monkfish, the mild, meaty fish less a cynosure than a backdrop for the cockles, mussels, tomato, green peppers and saucisson sec, a French salami, around it. In the door came the revelers, enough on many nights to fill all 110 seats and make this restaurant feel like one of the hottest tickets in town. And the E.U., such a tortured comer, showed signs of being a real keeper. It still has problems. E.U. stands for European Union, and the putatively pan-European menu that Mr. Nawab has put together is eclectic not only in terms of its national influences but also in the quality of different dishes. The desserts could stand some inspiration and improvement. And depending on where you sit and how crowded the E.U. is, its atmosphere can be infectiously lively or insufferably chaotic. In a way that perhaps befits the restaurant’s herky-jerky beginnings, you’re taking a chance every time you walk in. But there are reliable virtues, starting with the restaurant’s looks. Before the owners, Bob Giraldi and Jason Hennings, could have predicted their costly catalog of woes, they splurged on the design wizards at AvroKo  — a wise investment. Those conjurers of urban cool have used bricks that look centuries old, wood beams that don’t look much newer, exposed wine storage areas  and strategically placed rolls of butcher paper to give the E.U. a fashionably worn, disheveled look. They’ve carved a sizeable space into intimate neighborhoods: a raw bar up front, a main bar in back, some raised tables with high stools, other tables distributed throughout various passageways and nooks. And they’ve performed their usual magic with light, acing a dimness that never teeters into gloominess. The E.U. strikes a casual tone, evident in the form taken by its menu, which is made of butcher paper and doubles as your place mat. The various boxes and sections of type within this brown rectangle seem to advise a cobbled-together meal rather than a conventional progression of appetizer, entree and dessert, though that progression is an option as well. You can do oysters. Or cheeses, with varieties from Italy, France and Spain. Or a charcuterie plate, including prosciutto, which was terrific, and mortadella, disappointingly presented as thin slices rather than fat chunks. Or tapas: mushrooms, beets, olives and raw scallops with hearts of palm, olive oil, lemon and sea salt. Most of this fare is less labor-intensive than purchasing-intensive. The E.U. provides a case study of how a restaurant can stretch out its menu without taxing its kitchen. Not that the kitchen doesn’t make an effort, and an often impressive one at that. Like the monkfish, wild striped bass was impeccably cooked, and it came with an enticing pistachio vinaigrette that reflected Mr. Nawab’s frequently clever touches. By seasoning pork meatballs with cumin and fennel seed, frying them until their outsides are crunchy and saucing them with yogurt, he comes up with an appetizer plate that could almost be mistaken for unusually substantial, oddly juicy falafel. And seems, in the process, to look beyond Europe’s boundaries. He also taps into America, bringing it and Europe together in a plump but otherwise unremarkable burger, which you can order in a style identified as Italian (pecorino on top) or English (Cheddar). Following the leads of such recent restaurants as Sascha (now closed) and the Waverly Inn (not yet, um,  open), he concocts a chicken pot pie, which in this case is really a mash of chicken, root vegetables and béchamel under a clumsy, fragile multi-tiered lid of puff pastry that shatters and scatters at the touch of a fork. He’s doing the in-vogue  comfort foods of the urban gourmand: braised veal cheeks with a horseradish-spiked crème fraîche; roasted chicken and “dumplings,” which turn out to be ricotta and spinach malfatti good enough to be stars of their own; a big fat sweetbread with a Marsala sauce and, for a pubby touch, a bruschetta-style piece of toast below it. These dishes worked in solid, unspectacular fashions, but others proved disappointing. While I was delighted by bright green fava beans with lamb loin and shoulder, I would have sacrificed them for more tender meat. A sirloin special one night and a pork special on another were also unusually tough. A version of a linzer torte was drier than it should have been, and an inevitable clutch of beignets had a somewhat deflated look and taste. You’d be better off skipping sweets and sipping more wine, from a smart list that touches down in all the major winemaking countries of Europe, does a quick survey of regions and grapes and keeps the trip relatively affordable. There’s not a bottle over $70. Most are under $50. And Italy, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Ireland, Denmark and Sweden all contribute to an impressive range of beers. As a watering hole, the E.U. actually feels charmed, though I articulate that with my fingers crossed (a tough trick when you’re typing), and in spite of my parting glance at the restaurant around midnight one busy, noisy night. I walked out as three grim-faced police officers walked in. Uh-oh."
260,Tocqueville,Two Stars,20061206,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/06/dining/arts/restaurants-stepping-up-from-their-starter-homes.html,"MOST restaurants intent on improvement make do with makeovers, repainting walls, rethinking menus and, by the current fiats of fine dining, unveiling arrays of small plates. They seldom relocate, at least not unless there's a feud with landlords or a plumbing crisis on a par with ""The Poseidon Adventure."" A change of address is too potentially unsettling to regulars, too potentially ruinous to the delicate chemistry that makes a place work. Tocqueville and the Tasting Room, two downtown favorites with devoted followings and menus that emphasize the Greenmarket, took the risk anyway. Like lawyers who have just made partner or winners on ""America's Next Top Pharmaceutical Researcher,"" they converted good fortune into roomier real estate. And they wagered that whatever part of their charm they owed to their intimate settings paled beside virtues that would be served by -- or at least survive -- newer, bigger stages. They weren't wrong. Then again, they weren't entirely right. Tocqueville didn't go far -- from one end of the block of 15th Street east of Fifth Avenue to the other. The short distance, however, belies the extent of the effect. In its original location, Tocqueville's artfully composed dishes came as impressive surprises given the cramped, trapezoid-shape room, whose big windows gave it the slightest inflection of a sidewalk cafe. Tocqueville now has a proper vestibule, beyond which lies a proper lounge area, beyond which lies a proper dining room with yards of wavy silk hanging dramatically, like stage curtains, over a passageway to the kitchen. In other words, Tocqueville screams ""serious restaurant"" where it once only whispered those words. The adjustment of volume leads to a readjustment of expectations, and the pricey food seems only as good as it should be, given the refinement of the air around it. The uneven caliber of servers stands out. Some of them struggle through recitations of a dish's ingredients or, when pouring sauce at the table, dribble it over the edge of a plate. Why attempt such fussiness if you can't ace it? Tocqueville, which received two stars from William Grimes in The New York Times shortly after it opened in 2000, remains a haven of considerable pleasures, thanks to the high standards and palpably committed efforts of its chef, Marco Moreira, who owns the restaurant with his wife, Jo-Ann Makovitzky. Whether the dish is wild salmon wrapped in Savoy cabbage, lobster with spaghetti squash and a saffron emulsion, or roasted chicken with morels and a parsnip purée, Mr. Moreira's kitchen can be counted on to make the meat or seafood as tender as can be and to give it lively company. In a city too enamored of pork three ways or multiple meditations upon lamb, Tocqueville's beef twofer nonetheless proved delightful. Poetic in name and approach, it comprised a small ""60-second sirloin"" -- seared on one side, nearly bloody on the other -- and a ""24-hour rib pot roast"" with a contrasting, decadently spongy texture. The sauce on the rib meat had a hint of bitter chocolate, while parsnips on the plate carried currents of vanilla. Tocqueville's Eurocentric wine list has interesting selections. Its desserts, though, can be precious; a toasted sesame pudding with an elderflower and shiso consommé comes to mind. And it didn't have its act together at lunch, when the front door went unattended, cod was mushy and an ostensibly truffle-bedecked risotto lacked flavor. In terms of service, the relocated version of the Tasting Room, which more than tripled in size by moving from its 25-seat East Village nook to a hodgepodge of casual rooms in NoLIta, almost never had its act together during recent visits. There was waiting and more waiting: for bottles of white wine to be chilled on the spot; for dishes to be cleared; for more food to arrive. Maybe the restaurant wasn't ready to grow this much larger. The new space is a drag, but lost coziness isn't the culprit. Found ugliness is. In the rear room, the whiteness of the walls and shape of the ceiling suggest a hastily erected tent, and the clunky artwork could easily be on loan from an elementary school. When crowded, the room is noisy to boot. And it's frequently crowded, because many New Yorkers rightly appreciate that no restaurant burrows more joyously into the earth or delves more deeply into the forest than the Tasting Room, which received one star from Mr. Grimes in 2001. Its mushroom mania and exaltation of esoteric, exactly identified plants are arguably unrivaled. Ovoli mushrooms, mousseron mushrooms, tepary beans, tatsoi -- they were all here and all handled with utmost care, emerging as the most generous and best parts of appetizers and entrees, which can be ordered in small tasting portions or larger sizes. But whatever they burnished -- Montauk blackfish in one dish, Montauk tilefish in another -- often had the feel and appeal of afterthoughts. The Tasting Room is like a vegetarian restaurant that won't come out of the closet. Responding to what's available from local producers and to his own formidable energy, the chef and co-owner Colin Alevras changes the menu constantly, hitting highs and lows. His crunchy, salty conch fritters were kookily good: the Tater Tots of the sea. His heirloom pear and whey soup was Gerber's by a different name. The star dessert was a kabocha squash cheesecake. While the wine list, once exclusively American, now has some European selections, its laudable focus is still on unusual grapes and blends from enterprising producers. So drink up. It's a way to fill the long pauses between courses. Tocqueville  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  1 East 15th Street; (212) 647-1515; tocquevillerestaurant.com.

263,Meat Hook Sandwich,★,20150414,Pete Wells,Williamsburg,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/dining/restaurant-review-meat-hook-sandwich-in-williamsburg-brooklyn.html,"A normal sandwich was what I had in mind one day in January. Normal is not what Meat Hook Sandwich does, though, so I ended up eating something that I would call the greatest cheeseburger I’ve ever tasted if not for the inconvenient fact that it wasn’t a cheeseburger. What I ate was a chopped cheese sandwich, also known — in the very small patch of the United States where it is known at all — as chop cheese. This sandwich rarely strays from its natural habitat, the bodegas of Harlem and the Bronx. Filled with griddled ground beef in a cloak of melted American cheese, it is a distant relative of the Philadelphia cheesesteak and of the tavern sandwich, an Iowa standby that also goes by the irresistible name “loose meat.” In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Meat Hook Sandwich stirs in some pickle relish and piles the meat-cheese-relish amalgam onto a sesame-seed semolina roll. The relish makes every bite spicy and sweet, while the cheese makes the meat, already potent and rich, extra hot and slick. The architecture of the chopped cheese avoids a common if generally overlooked flaw of many cheeseburgers: the tendency of the cheese to drift upward from the patty and incorporate itself into the upper bun.  Discovering this rearranged cheeseburger at the sandwich shop should not have been a shock. The place opened last year as a satellite of the Meat Hook, a butcher store a few blocks away whose bacon-cheeseburger sausage has made numerous and rewarding (for me) trips from the display case to my grill. Behind the counter, brawny women and men are always breaking down entire hogs and sides of beef from livestock raised on virtuous nearby farms. The economics of whole-animal butchery demand ingenuity in selling off the less-popular cuts and scraps. House-made cold cuts were an obvious sideline. As mortadella, ham and pâté amassed, the omens began to gesture toward sandwiches.  The Meat Hook’s restaurant, on Lorimer Street, does not look expensively decorated; the neon sign spelling “sandwich” in big white block capitals was a hand-me-down from another sandwich business. This hangs on one of two brick walls painted white. Fourteen backless metal stools surround exactly three tables. Sandwiches are ordered at a counter and delivered to the table in red plastic baskets. This is the extent of what you would call “service,” except on Wednesday nights, when $25 buys a Meat Hook steak, an accompaniment (sometimes a salad) and as many bottles of cheap beer as you can drink without calling attention to yourself. The beers, Miller High Life or Pacifico, are carried to the dining room by a butcher moonlighting as a cook doubling as a waiter. The sandwich concern was founded by three pillars of the butcher shop: Brent Young, a Pittsburgh native with a lifelong hoagie fixation; Ben Turley, a rehabilitated restaurant cook; and Tom Mylan, who recently wriggled off the Meat Hook. They put a veteran Brooklyn chef named Gil Calderon in charge of the kitchen. Try to picture the lunch a hungry young butcher would dream about after spending the morning hunched over a large animal with a hacksaw, and you have a good idea what you are in for. There are no elegant tricorner panini, and nothing you can eat with one hand while holding a pinot grigio in the other. The cooks listen to their lizard brains. Simultaneously, a higher sandwich intelligence is at work, one that understands the crucial role of contrast and the life-giving spark of condiments. Or, as Mr. Turley and Mr. Calderon recently put it, “Don’t think of your sandwich as a Beyoncé, think of it as a Destiny’s Child.” The kitchen knows that even great roast beef, which the Meat Hook’s is, needs backup. It needs a tangy, salty slice of Cheddar and horseradish sauce. Shredded lettuce for its juicy crispness and then, for a savory crackle, papery wheels of fried red onions. Finally, the bootylicious ingredient: a scattering of potato that seems to have been scraped off the bottom of a pan of hash browns.  One sandwich is based on a hunch that roasted pork would benefit greatly from a creamy tuna sauce, vitello tonnato-style. (It does, and if the sauce is applied too lightly, the sandwich can be a little dry.)  Another is a fairly straight-up Italian hero that, for once, starts with first-rate cold cuts (mortadella, pepperoni, soppressata, all from the Meat Hook), then hits them with caponata, raw onions, some unusually good pickled peppers and lardo whipped with roasted garlic. Would the flavors of the meats come through more clearly if they were folded and tucked to give them room to breathe, rather than being stacked up like plywood? Or is that a question that only a nonbutcher would ask? The Vegetarian Option is essentially a semolina roll heaped with all the garnishes from the other sandwiches. No meat intrudes on the fun, although the kitchen bends the rules slightly and slides in a purpose-made beet-parsnip-carrot hummus, without which the sandwich would probably taste like a heap of garnishes. In an expert piece of expectations-setting, Meat Hook Sandwich advertises that the Vegetarian Option is “better than you’d expect.” This was absolutely correct; the sandwich is impressively complex and still satisfying. If I have to choose between that and the hot chicken sandwich, though, vegetarianism is going to get a quick shove into moving traffic. An ode to the Nashville specialty known for producing copious tears of pain and ecstatic, speechless reveries, the hot chicken at Meat Hook Sandwich is made from hot-sauce-brined thigh meat with the deep flavor of a barnyard bird. Fried chicken sandwiches are usually made with pallid cutlets, so the intensity is startling. On top of that, there is sweet pickled celery and dried-chile schmaltz. This is chicken that can bring your whole day to a dead stop for a few minutes.  Next to the order counter is a small blackboard that is always worth scanning. This is where specials like the chopped cheese appear. Around St. Patrick’s Day, there was tender corned beef on seeded pumpernickel with a devastatingly rich coating of Welsh rarebit sauce. Recently, I’ve found a fine chipotle-fueled sloppy Joe.  I wish I could tell you more about the steak and beer special, but when I tried to get it on the first day of this month, I was met instead by another rearranged cheeseburger. “April Fools,” Mr. Young said. Two all-beef patties had been nacho-fied with Tex-Mex-style queso sauce, pickled jalapeños and crushed tortilla chips. If this is what butchers daydream about, I need a cleaver."
264,Sapa,One Star,20050126,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/26/dining/so-many-dishes-a-little-help-please.html,"DURING a recent dinner at Sapa, a new Vietnamese-tinged restaurant along the northern border of Chelsea, it struck me that the guidance this city's diners really need isn't Tim and Nina Zagat's. It's Evelyn Wood's. For anyone too young to remember the ineluctable television commercials that trumpeted her techniques, she was the doyenne of speed reading, and that skill turns out to be no handier for Russian literature or the federal tax code than for New York menus in this nascent millennium. They have morphed into unwieldy epics with as many categories as an entire game of ""Jeopardy."" Answer: Nostalgia for the places and days when a list of every dish fitted on a medium-size chalkboard. Question: What do the lavishly mapped documents at restaurants like Megu, Lure Fishbar and Ono make you feel? Sapa's menu is by no means the most expansive of the lot. But it rambles across just enough matte, neutral-toned sheets of paper that one of my companions said he felt as if he were evaluating a Kinko's sampler of available stock for résumés. Within a clunky binder, there's a tabbed page for appetizers, which are not to be confused with dishes for sharing (another tabbed page) or Vietnamese-style rolls (the tabbed page after that). Even when you get to main courses, you're not finished. A half-dozen sides are on a subsequent page. I suppose all this is meant to fill you with a sense of limitless bounty, of infinite choice. But it just as easily triggers confusion about how much to order and in what combination. It should also provoke concern. To judge by my experiences in this city's newest and most assiduously trendy restaurants, the longer the menu, the less consistent the quality of the food. There are boundaries to most chefs' imaginations and most kitchens' flexibility. Sapa offered plenty of dishes that I found enormously appealing and plenty that seemed to be throwaways, inoffensive but unmemorable. There was a hefty rib-eye among the entrees, but why? It contributed nothing new or interesting to the annals of oversize steaks (though I did appreciate the cylindrical tower of flavorful onion rings beside it), and it distracted attention from the terrific cod, roasted in parchment and paired with a lovely porcini sherry sauce. There were spare ribs with a cocoa and peanut glaze among the dishes to be shared, but to what end? Spare ribs have sported similar flavors before and have boasted a moistness and generosity of flesh that Sapa's lacked. Delete them from the menu and a diner is statistically more likely to select the chilled salad of poached lobster, consecrated with avocado, a bit of caviar and a chive crème fraîche that was like an exalted tartar sauce. It's an issue of editing, an issue I raise in Sapa's case because there's an excellent restaurant within the clutter. That's no surprise: the chef, Patricia Yeo, has done her time and earned her stripes. After years of apprenticeship under Bobby Flay, she ran her own shows at the Asian fusion restaurant AZ and at Pazo, which explored the Mediterranean. She's a genuine globalist, and the cuisine at Sapa, alternately advertised as French-Vietnamese and French-Southeast Asian, reflects that. It ultimately defies either label or any pigeonholing. It also benefits from an enchanting showcase courtesy of the design firm AvroKO. The ceiling is high, the low-hanging light fixtures are encased in gauzy white netting and the visual flourishes abundant but not too flamboyant, from a row of topiarylike Asian evergreens near the entrance to a wall of paneled glass in front of the kitchen. Be sure to head downstairs to the bathrooms, even if nature doesn't call. They are in individual rooms off a dimly lighted common area with a gurgling cast-concrete pool. In a moody theater like Sapa, you should probably partake of cocktails, and this restaurant has the requisite selection of signature drinks, including a terrific spiked lemonade with vodka and mint leaves that caresses the line between bitter and sweet. Pay the first page of the menu more heed than the next two, because that's where you'll find a delightful salad of pickled Spanish mackerel, bathed in a lemon and chili pepper vinaigrette, that plays like a creative nod to the crudo craze. That's also where you'll find a luscious sweet potato and pumpkin soup studded with toasted pumpkin seeds and laced with potent currents of lemon grass. The rolls on the third page plead for attention, especially because they are assembled at a white onyx bar in the center of the restaurant, but they do not warrant that much of it and can be skipped. Their various ingredients -- eel, pineapple and sprouts in one; beef, scallions and watercress in another -- somehow added up to less flavor than they promised. Besides, one starter is an ample prelude to the entrees, several of which are worth saving room for. A satisfying ""trio of pork"" presented a hunk of braised shoulder meat, squares of thick bacon and strips of grilled loin: a cholesterol nightmare that amounted to a swine lover's dream. Better yet were slices of duck breast with a gentle red curry sauce. Better still were rectangles of rare ahi tuna, crusted with ginger and arranged like the spokes of a wheel around a succulent mound of braised oxtail and sprightly arugula that rescued the fish from its current overexposure. Among many worthy desserts, the standouts were a pistachio crème brûlée with a hard shell over what was really more of a dense mousse than a springy custard, and a crisp pear tart with a shot glass of ginger panna cotta on the side. The servers who transported these dishes liked to talk, and their banter could be inane or intrusive. One of them advised my friends and me to study the menu before he returned for ""a little chitchat."" Another subjected a different group of friends and me to a soliloquy about the menu's highlights that was uninvited and interminable but, in the end, understandable. He was doing what the kitchen hadn't: winnowing its options. Focusing its endeavors. Providing a fleet shortcut, which is just what Evelyn always advised.

267,Bar Q (CLOSED),★★,20080618,Frank Bruni,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/dining/reviews/18rest.html,"A RESTAURANT critic’s most practiced companions know that the questions to be asked in advance of a meal go beyond the address, the hour and the (fake) reservation name. More important bits of information: is the visit to the restaurant a first one or a follow-up? And if it’s a follow-up, what are they in for? Is the critic doing them a favor, or are they doing him one? As I ushered several of my most loyal and keenly inquisitive sidekicks into Bar Q for Visit 2, I tiptoed around the answers. I stressed that I was paying the check: drink up! I emphasized that Bar Q belonged to Anita Lo, whose cooking at Annisa can be sublime. And then, as I wrapped up a poignant little soliloquy about the unassailable felicity of friends gathered at a table to dine, I confessed that they should keep their hopes in check for much beyond that felicity. There’d been some grumbling from their predecessors, the canaries I brought along on Visit 1. To quiet it and to unruffle their feathers, I’d had to be especially profligate with the wine, a sauvignon-semillon blend from Washington that made the disappointing baby back ribs go down much easier. During this second meal, though, I got by with a single bottle of Slovenian ribolla. The food carried the night. There were faintly sweet, soft-centered fritters made with scallion and barbecued eel. There were steamed buns ready to be stuffed with spit-roasted pork belly, which perhaps lacked a Momofuku magnitude of tenderness but made up for that with the crackling skin attached to it, and with kimchi as its tangy, spicy condiment. The steamed lobster scattered in generous chunks atop an appetizer of spring rolls was gorgeous. And an entree of eggplant: wow. Those are three syllables  — egg and plant and wow  — that I’ve never nudged so close to one another, but Ms. Lo made me do it. She grills slices of eggplant that have been glazed with a sweet miso, and winds up with something not entirely unlike an eggplant brûlée. In terms of its variability from one stretch of the menu to another, Bar Q is a riddle, but it’s a riddle with a solution: don’t pay too much attention to the restaurant’s name, which alludes to barbecue, or to the culinary direction in which that name points you. With the exception of pork-stuffed spare ribs, richer than a Russian plutocrat and sauced with an elementary school’s worth of peanut butter, the dishes that veer the closest to conventional barbecue or that give you bones to grab and gnaw on are among the least enjoyable and impressive. The sauce on those baby backs was cloying and gummy, and the rib meat was tough. The yuzu and green chili used in a rub for “tuna ribs” produced an effect too hot and tart, and the fish was meager in portion, mealy in texture and ugly to boot. The color gray doesn’t exactly prime the appetite. But Bar Q is more than flesh and bones, and only obliquely related to the explosion of barbecue joints around the city. It’s a laboratory in which Ms. Lo can root around, paying special heed to grilling and smoking and occasionally exploring the similarities of hoisin and Western barbecue sauces. In the end her triumphs, more than her wobbles, stayed with me. Make no mistake: A few of Bar Q’s wobbles are doozies, including a dessert of warm walnut soup that tasted like a mishap involving cookie dough and dishwater. I’d kill to listen to a panel of “Top Chef” judges make sense of this sludge. But most wobbles are merely that, wobbles. One is a dish, sized as either an appetizer or an entrée, whose mention on the menu reads like an assertion that pigs really do fly. It’s called “pork wings,” which turn out to be cuts from the shank with a wing-like shape. Both times I had them, their nomenclature was their strongest suit, because the meat wasn’t nearly as succulent as it might have been and the sauce tasted too one-dimensionally of the ketchup in it. Ms. Lo had her best moments when she stepped away from the sticky red glosses. She’s apparently mastered the art of tea smoking, because both the cured salmon and the duck that had received that treatment harbored the delicate, enticing nuances it bequeaths. The duck had the bonus of a sesame noodle salad more spicy than gloppy, while very fine grilled lamb loin — marinated first in lime, Korean ground chili and garlic  — came with an even better surprise: garlic fried milk. Yes, fried milk. It takes the form of golden-enveloped rectangles that aren’t quite cheese and aren’t quite custard but are definitely and intensely infused with garlic. Get an extra side order to supplement the portion with the lamb. You’ll want it. Time and again such inspirations caught my fancy, eclipsing my frustrations and lifting Bar Q well above its unevenness. The substitution of shiso for mint in a julep proved insanely refreshing, and that julep was just one of several special house cocktails that worked beautifully. The ablutions that accompanied the concise lineup of sashimi and raw-bar selections included a spicy cod roe mayonnaise that’s ripe for induction into the Condiment Hall of Fame, and both a cool, minty coconut soup and a carrot cake with ginger and macadamia nuts were terrific. And while the restaurant’s washed-out palette  — blond, white, pale gray  — and dearth of adornment may strike some diners as borderline monastic, at least Bar Q has considerable space. Spreading through two rooms and a glass-enclosed patio, it doesn’t squish diners as aggressively as other restaurants in Greenwich Village, which is all of a sudden Gastronomy Central. And it’s not annoyingly loud. I found it pleasant even when it perplexed me, and after Visit 2 I just declined to offer my companions a forecast of how the meal would go. Wisdom comes late to some of us, and across-the-board excellence comes hard even to many restaurants with plenty of merit.

268,Craftsteak,★★,20070509,Frank Bruni,Chelsea,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/09/dining/reviews/09rest.html,"HE’S a showboat, that’s for sure. You don’t sign up for three  seasons of the reality TV show “Top Chef” unless you relish the glow of the spotlight. And on some points he’s dogmatic. You don’t insist on roasting your steaks when everybody else is grilling or broiling theirs unless you’re convinced you’ve found the one true path. But never let it be said that the chef Tom Colicchio is complacent. He’ll take a successful formula and tinker with it; he’ll take an unsuccessful formula and do much more than tinker. That restlessness  is evident at Craftsteak and Craftbar, though these two Craft descendants haven’t benefited equally from it. Let’s start with the younger — and luckier — of the two. Just a year old, Craftsteak has undergone so many targeted and consequential changes that I feel compelled to update my initial review, which awarded it one star. It’s now much better. More important, it’s proof that a chef can disperse his energies across various projects, as Mr. Colicchio has, and still attend sufficiently to one of his neediest cases. He just has to be alert to problems, willing to acknowledge them and ready to take action. At Craftsteak Mr. Colicchio changed the chef de cuisine, putting Shane McBride in Chris Albrecht’s place. He changed meat suppliers. And he changed the way steaks were being cooked. In the beginning, the restaurant used a griddle to try to sear steaks, then put them in copper pans in the oven. But the sear wasn’t taking: The steaks weren’t any crisper on the outside than on the inside. They weren’t especially juicy, either. The raison d’être of the restaurant, they were actually its most glaring flaw. Craftsteak continues to roast them — Mr. Colicchio believes it prevents dryness  —  but before they go into the oven they spend time on top of it in their copper pans, on high heat, which is accomplishing what the griddle didn’t. The steaks now have a sear. I’d still prefer an actual char, but I can’t quibble with the degree of flavor coaxed from a strip steak of grass-fed Montana beef. The different nuances of grass-fed versus corn-fed beef — Craftsteak’s conceit remains the presentation of both kinds, along with wagyu beef and beef aged a little or a lot — came through much more clearly during recent visits than before. The strip had a pointed, appealing gaminess distinct from the round, rich taste of a porterhouse of corn-fed Nebraska beef that I tried on the same night. And all the meat is more tender and moist at the core. The improvement in the steaks has made it easier to appreciate the restaurant’s other virtues: the spaciousness and comfort of its handsome, dramatically scaled dining room; the unassailable quality of its raw bar selections; its gigantic, crunchy onion rings, some of the best in the city; its fried bone marrow appetizer, a decadence-squared dream. Drawbacks remain. If a strip steak that had supposedly been dry-aged for 56 days was any indication, the aging process at Craftsteak isn’t yielding ideally tangy results. The menu is sprawling to the point of self-parody: the side dishes alone number more than 40. It encourages over-ordering and sets up the possibility of a stratospheric bill. The cheapest steaks are $32, and that gets you only six ounces of filet. Craftbar, which opened in early 2002, has moved even further from its origins than Craftsteak, having traded its nest alongside Craft for greater independence a few blocks away. The relocation in mid-2005  gave Craftbar more room: about 175 seats, including those in a private dining room, versus just 70 or so before. But it took away some of the restaurant’s soul. The stark space it now inhabits has a grim industrial feel that works against the intended coziness of the predominantly Mediterranean cuisine: fried oysters with a celery root rémoulade; sweetbreads in a lemon and tuna sauce; bruschetta with fontina and hon shimeji mushrooms; bucatini with pancetta and an oozing egg; hanger steak with buttery puréed potatoes. And the restaurant’s greater chaos seems to be undercutting the service, which has a lurching quality, with bursts of attentiveness segueing into stretches of neglect. While the lower prices of a restaurant like Craftbar presage less coddling, the duck confit here would have to be $1.90 instead of $19 to justify the frowning grumpiness of the waiter who deigned to attend to us one night. Mr. Colicchio began Craftbar as a more affordable, easygoing alternative to Craft, a place where his belief in relatively straightforward preparations of carefully chosen ingredients could be expressed through snacks, sandwiches and salads of superior provenance. After some detours and several personnel changes — Philippe Besson  is now the chef de cuisine — Mr. Colicchio has put Craftbar more or less back on that track. You can nibble your way through a casual, unstructured  meal without breaking the bank or being stuck with humdrum wines. The selections by the glass here are varied and intriguing. And among the conventional entrees are some winners. My baby chicken had crisp skin, succulent meat and a colorful aureole of fresh vegetables, including fiddleheads, baby carrots and asparagus. Glistening rectangles of pork belly — again with fiddleheads, in addition to rhubarb — packed the fatty wallop they were meant to. And at $19, they were just $2 more than a pork belly entree on the menu five years ago. That’s commendable. But much of the food lacked personality. Garganelli with wild mushrooms and orecchiette with fennel sausage promised flavors they didn’t deliver and cried out for more seasoning. A sautéed calamari appetizer was limp and tasteless. And steamed bouchot mussels were borderline frightening. Freakishly large, eerily pale and an utter blank on the palate, they could have been ill-advised laboratory mutations: Frankenmussels. The menu said they’d been seasoned with doppelbock and fennel. I barely detected either. My advice for the Craftbar-bound: play things safe by sticking with cheeses,  charcuterie, salads and finger-friendly snacks (except for the generic risotto balls) while you wait for Mr. Colicchio to patch some of the holes. If his repair work on Craftsteak is any indication, he will. Craftsteak ** 85 Tenth Avenue (15th Street), Chelsea; (212) 400-6699 ATMOSPHERE An airy, spacious, dramatic contemporary dining room.

272,Chin Chin,★,20100323,Sam Sifton,Midtown East,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html,"IT’S getting intense, this business of walking into restaurants. The theater of the front door is in the midst of a busy third act. There are hosts and managers up there, and assistants to each, everyone peering into computers, stabbing at screens, juggling menus, telling you to wait. Jimmy Chin stands at the front of Chin Chin on East 49th Street in his suit, telling you, no problem, walk this way. He’s done so since 1987, when he opened the restaurant with his brother, Wally, after years spent running the show at Auntie Yuan, on First Avenue in the heart of the Upper East Side. Chin Chin has regulars, of course  —  plenty of them, a good part of its clientele  —  but Mr. Chin greets most every Larry or Moe who walks through the door, every Alice or Rhoda or Kim, with a similar nod and welcome, and the same escorted trip into the dining room. In New York City, his shrug seems to say, you never know. Mr. Chin’s is one of the most inclusive dining rooms in town. There was a time in New York when the fundamental distinction in Chinese restaurants was not among regional cuisines, but among Manhattan neighborhoods. There was Chinatown Chinese, of course: voir-dire lunches, chop-suey perfection, the mystery and excitement of dim sum served over sticky floors. And there was uptown Chinese: cocktails and Peking duck served on starched white tablecloths, with prices to match. This, too, had its charms. Chin Chin belongs to the latter camp. The restaurant is not particularly Cantonese, as was true of many of the early upscale Chinese restaurants in Manhattan. It is not Sichuan, either, nor tied in fact to any particular Chinese cuisine. It is what Mr. Chin calls a “restaurant chinois.” But never mind that French talk. Order a dry martini and allow the pressures of the city to recede in its glow. Chin Chin is as American as pork dumplings and sticky spareribs, cold noodles with sesame sauce, three-glass chicken and fried rice. All of these are prepared well:  deeply flavored, toothsome, neither too spicy nor too bland. As Bryan Miller of The New York Times wrote in a review of the restaurant 23 years ago, “Chin Chin’s food is scintillating but never startling. (If you have a hankering for braised cod tongue or crunchy duck feet, hop the downtown IRT.)” Mr. Miller awarded the restaurant two stars. It isn’t that any longer. A certain roughness to the plating of the food  makes the place a little more casual than perhaps was the idea in the original business plan. The walls behind the sepia-tone photographs of Mr. Chin’s family in the dining room have acquired something of a sepia tone of their own, and the rest of the restaurant has aged along with them. It’s a dowager now. But don’t let this stop you, or anyone else, from going. Two stars is not the point of a restaurant like Chin Chin, nearly a quarter-century into its run. The point is garlicky minced squab in a lettuce pocket, the sweet of the green neatly extinguishing the barest hint of fire in the fowl. The point is fat pork dumplings fried golden on one side, and a tangle of noodles doused in sesame sauce that is both sweet and salty, fiery and rich. And the point is how waiters serve it all. At Chin Chin, family style food doesn’t mean the dishes sit in the middle of the table for all to enjoy. It means the servers give everyone a little bit of something, like servants  in a Beacon Hill town house before Mother says grace. Chin Chin is rep-tie Chinese. It’s quiet and polite, a wonderful place to eat. There are lovely scallion pancakes to start, only greasy insofar as this is a desirable trait in a scallion pancake. They are a pleasant accomplice to meaty spareribs that a child might gnaw for a quarter-hour. Slick, spicy wontons nod at the modern age of deep heat and the numbing effects of Sichuan peppercorns, while salt and pepper scallops, sweet beneath their light and pungent batter, go in the opposite direction. (In that vein, you might try crisp-fried squid that is a rejoinder to the lame fried calamari served in Italian restaurants from here to Bozeman.) Cold shredded jellyfish is just a delivery system for the salty vinegar of its sauce, but it is terrific for that, and a marvelous pairing for the restaurant’s clam-and-ginger soup, cilantro-laced, packed with flavor and fat clams. There is even a credible fake Peking duck number called vegetable duck pie, in which mock skin is made from rice flour and black mushrooms, then served with scallions inside a pancake, with a bowl of hoisin sauce. Drink a Tab with that, you’d be ready to watch “Night Court” on NBC again. Better is Chin Chin’s actual Peking duck, which should be ordered “two ways,” as Mr. Chin advises: first as skin, wrapped in a pancake with scallion and hoisin sauce, then in a kind of shredded-meat stir fry. It is not the best in town (that distinction may still belong, amazingly, to Peking Duck House on Mott Street), but it is surely the only one regularly served alongside glasses of iced vodka, a superb combination. Other larger plates worth ordering include a crisp orange beef, and a delicate lemon chicken that was a particular favorite of the Italian cooking deity Marcella Hazan, who once lived nearby. A whole sea bass, fried crisp and served under brown sauce, offers soft, silky meat and sweet flavor, while shredded beef with chilies and black bean sauce goes deep into the opposing territory, bright with heat and salt. And if sweet and sour pork runs a little too purposefully toward sweet, there is always Grand Marnier shrimp, a fabulous concoction that tastes a little bit as if invented by George Plimpton for a stunt article about cooking Chinese food for money. It’s fried shrimp in spiked mayonnaise, essentially. It’s delicious beyond compare. Dessert is chocolate cake. After a meal like this, you’d want nothing less. It’s not bad, probably the best chocolate cake available at a Chinese restaurant in Midtown Manhattan. It’s another reason to love Chin Chin, to admire its place in the firmament of dining here. This is one incredible city. Chin Chin ★ 216 East 49th Street, Midtown; (212) 888-4555; chinchinny.com. ATMOSPHERE Rep-tie Chinese food in an elegant, if aging, dining room.

276,Craftsteak,One Star,20060712,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/12/dining/reviews/steaks-with-lots-of-asides.html,"THE line between freedom of choice and the tyranny of too many options isn't such a fine one. There were any number of moments when the chef Tom Colicchio and his collaborators on Craftsteak, yet another new mega-restaurant on the edge of the meatpacking district, should have realized they were crossing it. That moment might have come when they included, in a menu category for New York strip steaks, beef aged not only for 28 days and for 56 days but also for 35, 42 and 49 days. You look at the options, the prices of which escalate to $66 from $42 in accordance with the steak's seniority, and wonder if you're in a restaurant or a numerology class. Or that moment might have arrived when they put, in a separate category for Wagyu beef, particular classes of this already particular flesh: a Grade 6 ""flat-iron"" steak, a Grade 8 strip, a Grade 10 rib-eye. You scan the selections, which reach $20 per ounce as a steak's educational level rises, and wonder how much a postgraduate porterhouse would set you back. At Craftsteak you can have hanger or sirloin or T-bone steaks; corn-fed or grass-fed beef; beef from any of several breeds or farms or continents. The pedigrees and provenances are so specific (""Ridgefield Farm Corn-Fed Premium Hereford Beef"") that my companions and I found ourselves wondering if we could inquire after a steer's color (we'd always been partial to piebald) or sexual orientation (we figured gay cattle might be in especially good shape). Forget the omnivore's dilemma; this was more like the carnivore's discombobulation. And that would have been less irksome if it had been more delicious. But apart from the Wagyu beef, which was so pricey that being tasty was less an accomplishment than a contractual obligation, the steaks at Craftsteak proved disappointing. Is the restaurant really getting the best beef? Is its in-house aging program on track? Or is the main problem a dictatorship behind a Potemkin democracy? Perhaps self-defeatingly, the kitchen cooks each of these many kinds and cuts of steak one way only, and it's not grilling or broiling, which most steak lovers prefer. It's roasting. Mr. Colicchio said in a telephone interview that the steaks are seared briefly on a griddle, tucked into pans, then put in an oven, a method that he believes prevents them from drying out. But the steaks I tried weren't notably juicy. And many had a near sameness of texture and tinge from exterior to interior, matched by a flatness of flavor. The grass-fed beef had a more herbaceous, muscular flatness than the corn-bed beef, while the mild flavor of the more aged steaks lingered longer than the mild flavor of the less aged ones. But none had any sizzling char, any messy ooze. Despite their heft, they seemed sort of prim. If you delete the steaks, there's a great deal to like about Craftsteak, which then becomes a bloated version of Craft. Over the five years since Mr. Colicchio opened that seminal temple to superior ingredients, he has been on a heady, crafty roll: Craftbar; a growing network of 'Wichcrafts; and, in Las Vegas, the first Craftsteak. This second one is big and dramatic enough to be Vegas-worthy, though its uncluttered elegance and restrained palette are very New York. It has about 50 seats in a front lounge and about 150 in a dining room with blond leather banquettes and dark brown leather chairs, all remarkably comfortable. A spectacular glass display and storage area for wine is complemented by spectacularly broad, tall windows that take in the West Side Highway. The view could be better. The sense of airiness couldn't. Some of the food is also hard to beat. Like Craft, Craftsteak revels not in elaborate seasonings or intricate dressings but in the intensity of carefully sourced ingredients like pencil-thin wild asparagus, which kept company with a profusion of potatoes and mushrooms among roughly two dozen sides. It celebrates the intrinsic vibrancy of bouncy fava beans, sprinkled with hazelnuts, in one of many terrific salads. And it showcases the crazy succulence of exquisitely braised short ribs, one of about 10 main-course options above and beyond the steaks. Craftsteak preaches its minimalist religion by serving warm dishes, including those short ribs and enormous and tender sweetbreads, in cast-iron vessels. It pares down several cold tartares, like salmon belly and Wagyu beef, to their fleshy essences, diminishing the usual prominence of tangy, spicy and salty contributors. Those tartares were terrific, as were Fanny Bay oysters, marinated in a ramp vinaigrette and topped with trout roe. The oysters belonged to an array of raw-bar selections much more extensive than a traditional steakhouse's. All around the edges Craftsteak leaves the traditional steakhouse in the dust, presenting a wine list more varied and sophisticated, along with desserts that put the usual steroidal cheesecake to shame. A chocolate soufflé, served with ""creamsicle ice cream,"" and a salty chocolate tart were standouts. Then again, Craftsteak, which offers béarnaise and bordelaise but no conventional steak sauce, has only a slight tether to tradition. It joins the ranks of steakhouses that inhabit their genre with evident restlessness, like indie movie actors making salary-pumping appearances in summer blockbusters. Think V Steakhouse, which contorted itself into an early grave, or Quality Meats, still in its infancy and unproven. At Craftsteak the bonuses and fringe benefits go on and on, requiring many lines of dense type on a menu so unwieldy that one of my companions asked our server if it came with its own easel. How to make sense of it? The menu's central column, like the restaurant's name, points you toward the beef. But even if you head in that direction you encounter too many additional forks in the road. And you soon realize you got a bum steer. Craftsteak  * [Rating: One Star]  85 10th Avenue (15th Street), Chelsea; (212) 400-6699.

277,La Petite Maison,★,20110322,Sam Sifton,Midtown,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/23/dining/reviews/23rest.html,"LATE night in Midtown, and the tables were pressed close at La Petite Maison, newly installed in the basement of those beautiful old Rockefeller town houses across from the Museum of Modern Art. It might have been the opening shot in a new Whit Stillman film. Pitch it: “Metropolitan” meets “Barcelona,” but set in Las Vegas, Chevy Chase and Eva Mendes attached. Men with tanned faces in soft cashmere blazers and exquisitely shined shoes sat next to women with colorists and Madison Avenue frocks, as a kind of mariachi band made up of what appeared to be European prep-school boy-banders in business rig and velvet shoes began to play. These were the Gypsy Queens, former buskers out of Nice, their Web site now sponsored by Chopard. They kicked into a Rod Stewart cover, going heavy on the snare drum and hard-strummy acoustic guitars. Champagne cocktails abounded, as did bad French and good posture. Whole lemons were on each table, and wan tomatoes: set dressing meant to evoke the South of France. Art of the faux-Warhol variety completed the picture: rhinestoned Twiggy, very expensive. The band moved from one table to another, played again. Some women in hats stood to dance. A kir took a tumble. Things started to get nuts. La Petite Maison is an offshoot of a restaurant in Nice, owned by Nicole Rubi, where such scenes are apparently commonplace. There are some extremely beautiful staff members at this one in New York, so perfectly suited to the art of service that it can be a pleasure to be gamed by them. (“Get the bottle, monsieur! You must: It is so delicious! Oui, then? Oui? D’accord!”) This scene is not, obviously, for everyone. The restaurant has an aesthetic that the uncharitable might characterize as of the European carting-business style. The menu, while competently prepared and wildly expensive, is hardly adventurous. About the desserts, the less said the better. La Petite Maison demands a willing suspension of disbelief. But as such, if you are, for instance, gearing up to see the German expressionism show at MoMA when it opens on Sunday, La Petite Maison may serve as a perfect place to allow the mistral to push away the darkness, and to eat zucchini-flower beignets with a glass of rosé. This is a pleasant activity, actually, in this room. Count Rolexes or Herrera dresses as you wait for the food. Alain Allegretti is the handsome fellow Ms. Rubi has put into chef’s whites to supervise the kitchen and shake hands in the dining room as the restaurant’s consulting chef. He has brought to the restaurant a few of the flourishes of his old restaurant, Allegretti, which closed last year after a two-year run. The most important of these is a Provençal fish soup that spins off what he says is his grandmother’s recipe. It arrives on tables with all the flavors and fragrances of that region present and singing in tune: fantastic. Arno Busquet, a toque out of Cannes, is the restaurant’s chef de cuisine. He is charged with executing the standards from the mothership back in Nice. And he executes the classics classically. The niçoise salad is certainly worth a nod. Served in a deep glass bowl, as it ought to be, the tuna over the greens dressed for vigorous afternoon walking along the Promenade des Anglais, it serves as hope that this once mighty salad might rise again to relevance. So, too, are those zucchini flowers, perfectly fried, with a tomato sauce to recall endless summer. Pissaladière — a buttery onion tart often served as if it were a tiny pizza — here arrives in careful sections, as if created for passed hors d’oeuvres, tasting much better than it looks, a fine example of Marvin Hamlisch’s “Dance: Ten; Looks: Three.” Main courses offer standard expensive-restaurant riffs, food for magnates and heiresses: filet mignon with béarnaise sauce, with snow-white whipped potatoes (perfectly good); herb-crusted rack of lamb (likewise); veal chop (same). These do nothing to explain the restaurant’s charm. For that, diners must turn to at least one of two blow-out orders: either the Dover sole meunière, for $70, serving two, or the creamed macaroni with black truffles, $55, serving one. These are just kids’-menu bites for wealthy adults, as simple as fish sticks and mac and cheese. But they are made perfectly. The fish is crisp on its exterior, but softens in clarified butter and melts on the tongue, close to a perfect flavor, a bell tone of taste. The truffle imparts a rustic funkiness to the cream and cheese that surround and suffuse the pasta, and makes the eating of it exhilarating and comforting at once. Together they provide the gustatory equivalent of expensive sheets or cars with silent interiors, of private jet travel and handmade shoes. You take a single bite and think: Oh, yes, right. It would take approximately 10 seconds to get used to this as a way of life. Getting used to your new neighbors may take some time longer. La Petite Maison is not, as it happens, so petite. There is that crowded bar and its accompanying tables, right near the door. Downstairs and to the north is a large, luxurious atrium space where larger parties gather for events of more importance to them than you — and with the Gypsy Queens present, matters can get quite loud. (Absent a band, the restaurant’s soundtrack runs to Europop that recalls bad restaurant choices near the train station in Aix.) The whole place can be overwhelming and, indeed, absurd, a kind of pantomime vacation on the Riviera, here in Midtown. The waiters are hustling you to order Armagnacs to accompany frigid and tasteless chestnuts and cream, or leaden apple beignets. (Listen to them. You’ve spent this much!) Women dressed as Jennifer Lopez circa the Puffy gun trial bob heads to the music. There are many questions to be asked about plastic surgery and wealth management. It all proved too much for one couple last week, whose perfectly comfortable table became rather less so when waiters plopped down another one next to theirs, fairly pinning them to the wall. They hurried through the rest of their meal and made to leave, apologizing as they pushed between chairs to get to the exit. The woman caught a stranger’s eye. Speaking of her husband, she said, “He totally owes me another anniversary dinner.” La Petite Maison ★ 13-15 West 54th Street, Midtown; (212) 616-9931, lapetitemaisonnyc.com.

282,s Madison,One Star,20050720,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/20/dining/reviews/nourishing-egos-on-the-upper-east-side.html,"FIRST came the overnight bag, the kind with wheels and a retractable handle, the kind that told everybody its owner was moving too briskly through his important schedule to swing by the apartment between the airport and dinner. One of the restaurant's managers hustled it to the back, a vassal stowing his lord's battle armor. Then came the lord: maybe early 30's, open collar, long strides, perfect hair, cellphone on his ear. He looked like Michael Douglas in ""Wall Street"" crossed with Vince Vaughn in ""Swingers,"" an amalgam of cockiness and slickness. He was Frederick's Madison all the way. Frederick's seems to exist in very large measure for people who want to feel, and want restaurants to make them feel, that they have reached the very apex of privilege. In that pampering clime they find an Upper East Side neighborhood bistro recast as an unabashedly expensive validation of their social and economic stations. They find red velvet chairs, Lalique lighting fixtures, servers in ties and vests and a menu with a $26 appetizer of hot and cold foie gras, a $42 veal chop and truffles galore. If it's a weeknight and the Hamptons haven't diverted much of the restaurant's business, they find a cast of characters who nourish their vanities and fantasies: suave young men with self-conscious gaits; skinny young women whose most carefully chosen accessories are their world-weary gazes; older men in pastel sport shirts and pricey loafers; older women with very taut skin and very white teeth. And here's the lucky part: they find some accomplished, occasionally impressive food. What makes Frederick's interesting beyond the mirror it holds up to a gilded sliver of Manhattan life is how ably it feeds more than just its patrons' egos. To be clear, Frederick's neither composes an interesting enough menu nor performs consistently enough to lure many diners with no other business in the East 60's. It's not especially dashing, either. With about 65 seats in a boxy room, it has a clubby rather than theatrical scale and sensibility. But for people with deep pockets and a desire to eat on this patch of the Upper East Side, Frederick's delivers some definite pleasures. One is its best dessert, which goes by an overwrought name. It's called the ""passionatta,"" and a server erroneously introduced it to us as a kind of panna cotta. But it's denser and richer, essentially a passion fruit semifreddo, shaped into a disk and sandwiched between a bottom layer of hard white chocolate and a top layer of passion fruit gelée. Another of those pleasures is a relatively flat loaf of house-made bread, served as a complimentary starter. The kitchen slathers it with a mixture of olives, garlic confit and very fine Spanish olive oil, then tops it with overlapping rectangles of Manchego cheese. Yet another is a white seafood bouillabaisse appetizer with shrimp, clams and scallops adrift in a bracingly intense broth of white wine, garlic and clam juice. As may now be evident, the restaurant's chef, Vincent Chirico, doesn't traffic much in understatement and dainty effects. He surrounds his appealing rack of lamb with white beans and merguez sausages. He serves a less remarkable strip steak with a damn-the-torpedoes side of puréed potatoes, Vidalia onions and summer truffles. He goes overboard with the steak itself, subjecting it to a bullying sauce of veal stock, caramelized onions, mustard and more. A separate ""beef trio"" consists not only of sliced tenderloin and braised short rib but also of marrow, which has been removed from the bone, thickened with bread crumbs, garlic confit, eggs and various herbs, and then reinserted. Overkill has a new mascot, bad cholesterol a new cheerleader. A diner can of course eat lighter, and the Frederick's menu, like that of almost every restaurant, is as much a conformist reflection of popular tastes, an indulgence of unexciting expectations, as it is an expression of its chef's culinary imagination. And so the timid and the carbophobic can find appetizers of asparagus with shaved Parmesan and of crab and avocado. Yawn alert: entrees include grilled tuna, served rare and accompanied by a bevy of seasonal vegetables. Frederick's Madison is the creation of the French brothers Frederick and Laurent Lesort, who also own a lounge named Frederick's on West 58th Street and previously catered to night crawlers with Buddha Bar on Varick Street. They sell more than cocktails and steak tartare. They peddle an elite juju, a coddled vibe, and that objective is neatly captured by the way the publicity materials for Frederick's Madison characterize its combination of French, Italian and Spanish cooking. This cuisine isn't merely Mediterranean. It's ""Mediterranean-Riviera."" It is accompanied by a wine list with only one bottle of red under $50 and two bottles of white below that mark. The list is brief, so when servers announced that the restaurant was out of a Spanish red we had requested, they should have offered us a slightly more costly wine for the same price. They at least should have made a suggestion of some kind. They did neither. The restaurant should also make good on its promise of that $42 veal chop, which is like the yeti, rumored but undocumented. Frederick's didn't have it on two straight visits. Some of what it did have was disappointing, like an overdone roasted chicken. Some was extremely pleasant, like a lightly dressed salad of shaved fennel, caramelized pear, Spanish almonds and Gorgonzola. And some was even better than that. Mr. Chirico's ravioli, stuffed with a spring pea purée, ricotta and mascarpone and topped with browned butter, are terrific. His slow-baked cod has a lovely texture, and he lovingly surrounds it with a leek emulsion, which he thickens with whipped cream. At Frederick's, more is more and a meal is a metaphor for a certain kind of existence, seasoned and garnished with indulgence.

286,Locol,Satisfactory,20170103,Pete Wells,"Oakland, Calif.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/03/dining/locol-review-oakland-california-pete-wells.html,"OAKLAND, Calif. — The chefs Daniel Patterson and Roy Choi are trying to do so many things with their insurgent fast-food chain, Locol, that it almost has to fall short somewhere. What I didn’t expect before I ate at the branch here was that the big problem would turn out to be the food. Mr. Choi, who made his name selling Korean tacos from trucks that prowled Los Angeles, and Mr. Patterson, who has gently pushed California cuisine forward at his restaurant Coi in San Francisco, set themselves an ambitious project. To start, they intend to build a network of small restaurants that people in some of the country’s poorest, most neglected urban neighborhoods can afford. Beyond that, though, the chefs hope that their example of progressive labor practices, interior design attuned to the pulse of the city and cooking that shows responsibility for the health of both customers and the environment will spark a reformation of the fast-food industry. The first Locol was planted in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles early last year, on Martin Luther King’s Birthday. As Jonathan Gold reported on the front page of The Los Angeles Times, the mayor attended, the retired football star Jim Brown cut the ribbon, a disc jockey played King’s “I Have a Dream” speech and about 2,000 people waited in line for chili over rice, fried chicken on a bun and paper cups of braised greens. Watts had reason to celebrate. New restaurants don’t turn up every day, let alone ones whose owners promise to make the neighborhood a better place. Competition is stiffer along Broadway in the Uptown neighborhood of Oakland, where the second Locol arrived in May. While there are plenty of empty storefronts on the nearby blocks, there are also fresh contenders like Donut Savant, which sells pour-over coffee and scaled-down Cronut knockoffs. Locol sits on a small triangular plaza of tables and folding chairs. Seated at one of them, you can see a taqueria, a sandwich shop, a home-style Taiwanese place, a West African and Caribbean grill, a Mexican restaurant, a beer-conscious brasserie and a branch of Umami Burger. At lunchtime the week before Christmas, they were all busy. The partners have plans to bring Locol branches to sites in East and West Oakland that have far fewer restaurants around. Opening in this busy part of town raises a question: If you had other options, would you still eat at Locol? The menu is divided into $5 “burgs” and $7 “bowls.” One of the bowls is chili over rice with onion, cheese and crushed saltines. The chili is the bean-and-ground-beef kind, which for some Texans is a deal breaker. I was more bothered by how hard it was to detect any spices other than a shadow of hot sauce. This was less like chili than like a slightly spicier version of the meat sauce my corner pizzeria pours over penne. Supermarkets sell canned chilis that are seasoned more persuasively. I ran into trouble ordering one of the other bowls. “I’ll have the chicken noodle soup,” I said. “It’s actually chicken no-noodle soup,” the woman at the counter answered, as nicely as possible. “It’s got rice, not noodles.” It turned out there wasn’t any chicken in it, either. It wasn’t bad, this no-chicken, no-noodle soup. The chicken broth had a gingery, Asian lilt, and its roasted carrots had a concentrated sweetness. If I had ordered vegetable rice soup, I probably would have been happy. My favorite burg was an egg sandwich. The eggs were gently cooked, not dry or rubbery at all, and splashed with Green Goddess dressing and a fine hot sauce. If Locol had put that sauce on the counter, I might have been able to save the chili. The thing I liked best about this sandwich was the roll. Made from a recipe devised with the help of Chad Robertson, the bread wizard behind Tartine Bakery & Cafe in San Francisco, the roll was the farthest thing imaginable from the squishy insubstantiality of most fast-food buns. Said to be rich in nutrients, and undeniably excellent, the roll represents the potential upside of the Locol experiment. The fried chicken represents the downside. Like a McNugget, Locol’s chicken is an amalgam of chicken bits invisibly bound together. Inside a thin sheath of fried coating, this composite of ground meat is mysteriously bland and almost unimaginably dry. It can be had as a single patty between buns with coleslaw, as the Fried Chicken Burg, or in a paper cup, with barbecue sauce, as bite-size Chicken Nugs. But the best thing to do with it is pretend it doesn’t exist. The Cheeseburg is a little better than the Fried Chicken Burg. Melted cheese, iceberg lettuce, a crunchy pickle relish and a sauce in the Thousand Island dressing family all add moisture and flavor to a flat patty that needs all the help it can get. At about 70 percent beef, mixed with tofu and grains, it is richer in nutrients than an all-beef patty. I suspect, though, that it will give many people an instant sensory memory, and not the kind Proust wrote about. Dry burgers made with filler bring me, at least, right back to school lunch and Boy Scout camp. Locol has a vegetarian patty, too. It is more moist, but also a little gummy. Instead of soda, Locol has nice strawberry or pineapple agua frescas. The coffee, for $2, is excellent. For dessert, there is soft-serve ice cream. I bought a sundae. A few minutes later, the cashier gave me my money back and said that the ice cream machine was broken. The most successful thing about Locol is the feeling inside the restaurant. The first thing I saw when I walked in was a black-and-white photograph the size of a small movie screen of two men riding scraper bikes, the colorful, do-it-yourself modified bicycles born in East Oakland. Other walls were covered with goofy comic characters unique to Locol. Before noon on a weekday, you could hear Snoop Dogg advertising the health-giving properties of gin and juice. I don’t know of any other fast-food chain that has put street culture at the heart of its locations in this way. The closest most of them come to design that reflects the surroundings is a wall of bulletproof glass. They’re often the only gathering places for blocks around, but they’re alienating, in part because the employees often look miserable. The people working at Locol are engaged, and seem glad to be there. If Locol can create environments like this across the country, it would be a major achievement. But first Mr. Patterson and Mr. Choi have to figure out the menu. I understand why they want to take on fast food, but in the neighborhoods they hope to reach it’s one of the few kinds of food available. Why offer less satisfying versions of what’s already there, when they could be selling great versions of something new? The neighborhoods Locol is targeting have serious nutritional problems, from hunger to obesity, but the solution isn’t to charge people for stuff that tastes like hospital food. If Locol were a nonprofit, then institutional-quality cooking might be unavoidable. It is a restaurant, though, and it is run by two chefs who are famous for cooking food that people really, really want to eat. I had a hard time remembering that as I worked my way through Locol’s menu, where appeals to your appetite are about as scarce as chicken in the no-noodle soup. Mr. Patterson and Mr. Choi seem to have thought about the social dimensions of fast food so much that they now see their target audience as problems to be solved, not customers to be pleased. The most nutritious burger on earth won’t help you if you don’t want to eat it."
289,a,Two Stars,20060329,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/29/dining/reviews/looks-can-be-deceiving.html,"IT'S only a 0.58-mile drive from the new restaurant Ureña to a Home Depot. I know because I did a MapQuest search, which also provided the directions: east on 28th, south on Park, west on 23rd. I eagerly share these with Alex Ureña, the restaurant's chef and owner. And I urge him to commandeer a van and head over to the store, or somewhere similar, before it's too late. His shopping list should include sconces, because even the most generic ones have to be moodier than Ureña's, which look like bequests from a Sarasota retirement center. He should invest in dimmers, too, because most diners like their restaurants lighted more softly than a dentist's office. Even faux wood flooring would beat Ureña's carpeting, a dreary ripple of muddy stripes. And a screen or curtain might be a good idea for the broad portal to the cluttered kitchen, which is visible to about half the restaurant's tables and provides all the visual theater of a broom closet. Ureña fills me with apprehension -- and, obviously, decorating tips -- because it's the ugliest restaurant with great food that I know, a toad-faced prince, and I think it's paying a steep price for that. It was never full when I visited, but it should be, given the excellence of its nominally Spanish food. Mr. Ureña's salty rabbit confit appetizer -- for which unusually tender strands of leg meat are braided with slippery shiitake mushrooms, molded into a puck and then nestled beside a cauliflower purée -- dazzled me in a way that rabbit seldom does. An entree of flounder was almost as revelatory. Mr. Ureña coats the fish with paprika and flour, pan-sears it briefly and roasts it, lending it both presence and delicacy. Then he surrounds it with a beautifully orchestrated symphony of effects: glazed celery root, hon shimeji mushrooms, a Manchego and spinach mousse and a grapefruit and elderflower sauce. Different bites emphasized different notes, this one vaguely bitter, that one fleetingly earthy, none of them too insistent. But eating is not synonymous with dining, an experience that suffers from not only Ureña's sights, like the zestless color combination of dirt-brown banquettes against lemony walls, but also its sounds. Much of the cheesy recorded music, like the lighting, suited a bicuspid extraction. On the way to the Home Depot, drop the CD's or tapes in the trash. Mr. Ureña is working as his own boss for the first time, and it seems he made this move without the resources to make sure his superior cooking had a worthy showcase. It's not that he hasn't put in ample time under able supervisors. For many years he worked for David Bouley, with whom he shares an affinity for pliant textures and mousselike effects. A friend of mine once said, after a meal at Bouley, that she hadn't really needed teeth. There are dishes at Ureña, too, that don't require them. Perhaps the lighting and music are actually part of some clever overarching metaphor. Mr. Ureña's education also included a stint in Spain under Ferran Adrià, whose foamy lessons he learned well. A foie gras foam added enormous flavor and a sense of grandeur to a chicken entree called chicken in two textures, one of them being braised white meat, the other a confit of dark meat. The dish was rounded out by smoked chorizo, caramelized leeks and an artichoke purée, which was like a foam waiting to happen. A mousse or foam -- pick your word -- of chorizo and truffles had been folded into the center of a brick of short ribs, ratcheting up the richness to some place very nearly off the charts, which was an enchanted destination. One of the best appetizers was a salt cod mousse to which bits of grapefruit and yellow currants had been added. It spoke to Mr. Ureña's hugely appealing efforts, in many dishes, to hit contrasting notes of saltiness, tartness and sweetness. Is all of this Spanish? I suppose so, in the sense that it revels in the inventive juxtapositions and refined textures that Mr. Adrià and other members of Spain's new wave have celebrated. It also finds many uses for chorizo, Manchego, salt cod and other proud fixtures of the Iberian larder. But it feels French in its opulence. Braised pork belly was served with not only an apple purée but also a truffle sauce, and truffle oil inflected a Manchego risotto of sorts that accompanied poached shrimp. The most flamboyant appetizer presented three treatments of duck liver, or trois foie, to indulge in a rhyme. The first was a luscious yogurt, whose sourness proved to be a perfect foil for an unctuous foie gras mousse that had been folded, along with honey, grapefruit and yellow currants, into it. The second was a sautéed lobe of foie gras with kumquats, and the third a purée of foie gras and toasted almonds. That last treatment, a slightly bitter and unattractive puddle on the plate, marked an occasion when Mr. Ureña crossed the line between creative and just plain weird. The desserts, by Caryn Stabinsky, who worked at WD-50, sometimes crossed that line, too. If you've been secretly dipping or longing to dip Hershey's squares in Grey Poupon, you may enjoy the chocolate pudding with mustard foam that appeared on a tasting menu. I didn't. But in a city overpopulated with panna cotta, her beet-flavored version stood out and stood tall, the savory centerpiece of an intricate, studiously balanced composition that included shards of chocolate cookie, a streak of orange-flavored salt and some sour-cream ice cream. Just as colorful and pleasing was a ""citrus salad"" with a pink lemonade gelée, candied kumquats, a grapefruit custard and tapiocalike pearls made from blood orange. It tasted brighter than bright -- iridescent, really. The servers at Ureña aren't always up to the cuisine. One of them engaged in grating cheerleading for every dish he delivered, while another struggled slightly in describing the kitchen's handiwork. That the food transcended these false notes, as well as its surroundings, was the ultimate measure of its merit. A friend who accompanied me for one meal and then excitedly joined me for another compared Ureña to a ""boyfriend with a great personality but unfortunate looks."" After a bite of beautifully sautéed mahi-mahi with a portobello confit and a buttery ginger, soy and balsamic vinegar sauce, she said, ""I can overlook the hooked nose."" The short ribs persuaded her that she could also get past his ""bad dental work."" Me too. But a minor makeover would put me in a major swoon. And it would give me more confidence in the durability of this affair. Ureña  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  37 East 28th Street; (212) 213-2328. ATMOSPHERE -- A plain room with harsh lighting and brown banquettes against lemony walls doesn't do justice to thoughtful and often dynamite food.

291,Bar Blanc,★★,20080227,Frank Bruni,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html,"IN an era of casual dressing, piecemeal supping and food as the adjunct to wine, is a restaurant’s best bet to pretend it’s less than it is? Should it persuade diners that it doesn’t harbor big ambitions or demand close attention, even if the opposite is true? These are questions brought to mind by Bar Blanc, which belongs to a growing brood of establishments whose names suggest scruffier atmospheres and more modest menus than the places actually present. Among its semantic siblings is Bar Stuzzichini, a fairly full-fledged Italian restaurant that opened last year, and Bar Milano, an apparently full-fledged Italian restaurant scheduled to open next month. And then of course there’s Bar Boulud, a new French restaurant  — yes, restaurant  — that doesn’t even have a proper bar. Misleading  nomenclature comes naturally to the chef Daniel Boulud, whose Café Boulud bears no resemblance to a café and whose DB Bistro Moderne isn’t anything like a bistro. What’s next: Ramen Boulud, serving Spanish tapas? Bar  Blanc at least has a bar, long and  white, proving that there’s some truth in advertising. But if you’re expecting a collection of low-impact small plates that allow you to graze mindlessly while you tank up on cabernet franc, you haven’t been briefed on the place’s pedigree. It’s the work of several  migrants  from the restaurant Bouley, and in their journey north from TriBeCa to the West Village, they toted with them plenty of Bouley’s aspirations and sophistication  — and some of its preciousness, too. They’re most certainly not doing bar food, not with a menu on which the half dozen appetizers are easily outnumbered by the pasta dishes and main courses, not when the lasagna, made with braised lamb shoulder, is sculptured into a perfectly round and tidily layered cake that’s like a prim haircut you itch to muss. Lasagna should unfurl and unravel and ooze: that’s the whole point of being lasagna. Its self-possession here is emblematic of the chef César Ramirez’s contemplative and intermittently fussy approach to cooking, evident as well in an entree of “milk-fed porcelet” that divides the  young porker into discrete portions of belly, loin and head meat and, for good measure, throws in  puréed   chanterelles and diced Brussels sprouts.  It’s a tremendously busy plate. It’s also a tremendously flavorful one. The kitchen’s seriousness and skill ultimately win out over aspects of Bar Blanc, like its design, that can feel cold to the touch. The restaurant’s interior is something of an exercise in igloo chic: the white marble  bar up front; a wavy white wall to the left that runs the length of the deep, narrow space; white leather banquettes, which look dangerously vulnerable to wear and stain. Were they the reason I drank more white than red here? The menu may have had something to do with that. It includes a significant percentage of meatless or seafood dishes, two of which are best avoided. In one regrettable appetizer, Japanese red snapper carpaccio was obliterated by an anchovy dressing, and in another, the tuna confit with tuna sashimi came across as excessively oily mush. But the kitchen otherwise demonstrated impressive care  — and had terrific success  — with seafood, whether it was sweet, tender poached lobster in a foamy grapefruit sauce or seared black cod, making a rare miso-less appearance on a Manhattan menu. The black cod  got a saffron and mussel sauce that had some brine and some bite to it. I loved it. And the sorry red snapper starter was redeemed by an entree that surrounded a lovely fillet of this fish with lively Asian effects: shiso, dashi, ginger, hon shimeji mushrooms. There’s a calculated balance of the expected and unexpected on the menu, which bows to certain trends while also casting itself as more adventurous than your typical bar that’s not a bar. So an appetizer of dutifully floured and dutifully sautéed sweetbreads was rounded out by rabbit loin terrine. And the restaurant bolstered its rabbit bona fides by combining braised rabbit with fettuccine, olives and broccoli rabe in its heartiest dish, sauced with a potent measure of mustard that I found exhilarating one night but slightly overbearing another. Maybe this dish is mood-sensitive, or maybe the kitchen isn’t as consistent as it should be. The four-cheese ravioli, plump and firm on a first try, were limp and runny on another, unraveling and oozing when they weren’t supposed to. While many restaurants’ claims of proper aging and particular cooking of beef aren’t reflected in what winds up on your plate, Bar Blanc delivered. Its strip steak, grilled over Japanese charcoal, had real character, and it was splashed with a bone-marrow sauce to seal the deal. The dessert list is short but has what it needs: several winners that live up to the best of the rest of the menu. A sharply flavored bittersweet chocolate cake came with generously salted caramel ice cream, and a silky Meyer lemon soufflé (really more of a custard) found its tart-sweet target. The Euro-centric wine list is an interesting, solid one. But it’s not so remarkable that it explains the restaurant’s decision to lead with the bar, at least in terms of its come-on. Neither does the number of wines by the glass,  about a dozen on a given night. Plenty of other restaurants have as many. Bar Blanc’s name instead seems to acknowledge  — and adjust for  — the dispositions  of many diners, who know and want good food but are sometimes scared off  by suggestions that the rituals around it will be too elaborate, the time required   too long. It’s self-effacement as self-promotion, a way of easing people into an evening that goes down plenty easy in the end. Bar Blanc ** 142 West 10th Street, Greenwich Village; (212) 255-2330.

298,Kenmare,Fair,20100706,Sam Sifton,SoHo,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/07/dining/reviews/07rest.html,"PAY no attention to the vast basement lounge beneath the dining room at Kenmare, with its leather banquettes and cool, mottled plaster walls, its built-in D.J. booth and low lighting, its long hallway of mirror-lined restrooms quite the right size to fit a couple of consenting adults. That’s for later. That’s for special. Kenmare is a restaurant. The owners, Louis Ceruzzi, a developer; Paul Sevigny, of the notorious and now-shuttered Greenwich Village club Beatrice Inn; and Nur Khan, the night-life impresario behind the Rose Bar above the Gramercy Park Hotel, have been emphatic on this point. They say they have moved on from the business of banging tunes and D.J. sets. In Kenmare, a handsome rectangle behind wide bistro windows on a drab street running up to the Williamsburg Bridge, they have started to write the next act of their storied careers. “You don’t see a lot of 50-year-old nightclub owners, do you?” Mr. Sevigny said in an interview  a week after Kenmare opened in April. Perhaps not, though repeated visits to Kenmare over the course of the spring and early summer revealed no restaurateurs, either, of any age. Joey Campanaro, the man behind a vest-pocket Greenwich Village gem called the Little Owl, and a partner in that neighborhood’s well-received Market Table as well, wrote Kenmare’s menu. He is acclaimed in press reports as Kenmare’s chef. Here’s hoping he is well paid for that. Mr. Campanaro is a serious and excellent cook. Kenmare is unlikely to enhance his reputation. The dining room is pretty enough, dark and cool, with white marble tables and a vaguely Mediterranean feel enhanced by big sprays of flowers. It is crowded nightly, first with dinner parties that seem pulled from rejected  “Sex and the City” scripts and then with a late, late, late show of models and people with incredible collections of music and sneakers and phone numbers, accompanied by the people who went to college with them who now work on Wall Street. But the food is inconsequential. Mr. Campanaro’s meatball sliders are probably the best available option on any part of the menu. They are a Little Owl appetizer made available here for $5 a throw. (House-made pickles, at $4, provide the restaurant’s best value.) Made up of beef, pork, veal and the sharp taste of pecorino, with Sunday gravy to moisten the little bun, they are highbrow Italian-American mini-burgers, passed hors d’oeuvres at a spare-no-expense cocktail party. Even more appropriate to the crowd and the space, and what look like the restaurant’s best overall seller after the sliders, are French fries. They are served under a thick ooze of Cheddar and salty, wan giblet gravy. You can pick at these for a long time, drinking prosecco and doing red-carpet analysis of this one’s tight dress or that one’s unfortunate hair, laughing gaily until someone remembers how great it was to smoke, and the whole conversation goes nostalgic and sullen. More grown-up, though not all that magical in flavor or execution, is a slippery, glistening salad of artichoke and hearts of palm, with Bibb lettuce and lemon vinaigrette, as well as a version of tuna carpaccio in which the fish is wrapped around avocado almost in the style of those ’70s moms who made salami cigars with cream-cheese filling. Two of the appetizers on Mr. Campanaro’s menu are quite a bit heavier than the term usually implies: a bread-crumb-crusted asparagus gratin with endive and fontina that tasted like a woody version of macaroni and cheese; and a weirdly tasteless Midwestern-style broccoli-beer soup with cheese and bacon croutons. It is difficult to imagine denizens of any precinct of New York’s night-life world eating these, though it is perhaps less difficult than actually eating them: they were both punishingly salty, and rich to a degree far sharper than aggressive. Waiters,  meanwhile, dashed this way and that, many with little knowledge of the menu and a sizable number of them ineffectual. One night, two Alaskan Sour cocktails sat on a table untouched for 20 minutes. (And no wonder: they were an awful mixture of Hendrick’s gin, yellow Chartreuse and fresh lime juice.) The waiter failed to notice them even as he took the order for and delivered two glasses of wine for the people not drinking the vile concoction  growing warm before them. Eventually a busboy took pity. “You didn’t like them?” he asked, wondering if he should clear the glasses. Headshakes and laughter. “I am sorry,” he said, taking the full drinks off the table with care. That was $24 right there. Entrees continued the trend of mediocrity, time after time. A Milanese-style veal cutlet, essentially a breaded and fried laptop case, was served with lemon, arugula, ricotta salata and a garish, oily salsa verde. (Credit where it’s due: It came this way twice, a month apart.) Halibut arrived with a deep crust on one side, a muddy flavor beneath it, and some mashed potatoes overdressed with chives. Sea scallops were paired with an  ill-advised spinach and strawberry salad, with crisp potatoes. And recalling the television program “Jersey Shore,” there was a dish called The Chicken  —  a sautéed chicken breast served over escarole and butter beans, with a moist, acrid, smoked chicken-leg confit. Maintaining consistency, it was almost too salty to eat. Not that many people are actually eating, though. There are enough pretty young things and the people who chase them at Kenmare to recall Bret Easton Ellis novels, Scissor Sisters songs and the whole first season of HBO’s “How to Make it in America.” The incessant rumbling of the nearby Lexington Avenue subway vibrates up into a table-hoppy, air-kissing, haven’t-seen-you-since-Quogue bubble of nighttime excitement. No one pays attention to dinner. (Desserts get scarfed, of course: warm banana beignets once, a decent rhubarb crisp, some neighborhood-style cannoli, a tall and gelato-rich root beer float.) Kenmare is not a restaurant for tasting menus and hushed reverence for any kind of cuisine. It isn’t even really for dinner. It is a place to get fries and sliders, followed by a sugar rush, a place to drink vodka while waiting on a text. It’s like 11 p.m. You want to meet downstairs at Kenmare and do whatever?

302,Little Giant,One Star,20050119,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/19/dining/as-stomachs-wait-ears-are-sated.html,"TO the list of major restaurant developments over the course of history, something new must be added. It ranks well below the advent of modern refrigeration and the pan-ethnic popularization of the cappuccino machine, but I'd place it a few notches above the proliferation of the hand-held doodad for plowing crumbs off tablecloths. I sing of the iPod. And during my meals at the new restaurant Little Giant on the Lower East Side, I had to restrain myself from singing along with it. The owners of Little Giant, Julie Taras, 31, and Tasha Garcia, 33, have exploited humankind's liberation from the mix tape and the advantages of Internet downloading to create a soundtrack that plays like the best FM station I have never actually encountered. During a typical dinner I grabbed a slice of grilled peasant bread, slathered it with the restaurant's evanescently sweet chicken liver mousse, took a bite and smiled not just at what was happening in my mouth but at what was happening in my ears. Siouxsie and the Banshees? Circa the early 1980's? Didn't I own that album? I waded into a bowl of brussels sprouts, roasted with a maple syrup glaze, and as I marveled at how much I liked them, I marveled as well at the smoothness and logic of an aural segue from Squeeze to Wilco. I chewed and hummed, hummed and chewed. Little Giant is rigged to twin these activities, which yield a great deal of pleasure in tandem. I dwell on the music because it accounts for so much of Little Giant's easygoing atmosphere and because this restaurant is all about vibe. I don't mean to overlook or shortchange the food, which can be great when all the gears click in the restaurant's intermittently overtaxed kitchen. The duck confit ravioli, the salad of baby beets, the sticky toffee pudding with poached quince and that chicken liver mousse, which is seasoned with restrained measures of cinnamon, clove and allspice, are reason aplenty to wander in and reward enough for having done so. Their appeal is basic and its potency sneakily intense, affirming an oxymoron beyond this restaurant's name. Little Giant's dishes speak in a loud whisper. But the degree to which a diner will enjoy Little Giant ultimately hinges on his or her compatibility with its particular spirit. That spirit explores a territory between homey and hip that's likely to be appreciated most by people who flash on Winslet, not Hepburn, when they hear the name Kate and find merit in debating whether ""Desperate Housewives"" is a sort of sequel to ""Melrose Place."" These people will love the look of Little Giant, which occupies a corner space that's almost all glass on the outside and all blond wood and exposed brick on the inside. Ms. Taras, Ms. Garcia, their relatives and friends did the gut renovation themselves, turning a shoe store into a cozy 30-seat restaurant with upholstered banquettes along the windows and a dashing set of shelves along the wall behind the bar. The kitchen is wedged into a corner and open to the dining room. It consists of four electric burners and one electric combination oven. The dearth of counter space means that Ms. Taras, Ms. Garcia and their helpers cannot compose more than six plates at a time. Small wonder that the wait for food at Little Giant can be extremely long and the coordination of a table's order can be deeply flawed. During one of my visits, a companion's bavette of beef arrived stone cold. Although it's difficult to pigeonhole the restaurant's concise menu, two of its recurring themes are refined comfort food -- upscale riffs on downscale standards -- and plenty of seasonal produce. In terms of its motifs and target audience, Little Giant comes across as the whimsical love child of Prune and 71 Clinton Fresh Food. It is typographically fond of ampersands and semantically given to understatement. Among the appetizers is ""sausage & onions,"" with a terrific trio of sausages made from lamb, duck and pork. ""Ham & cheese"" deconstructs and exalts that classic sandwich, the result being a plate of grilled bread, speck and tête de moine. Deviled eggs are on hand and are worth trying, because they include sour cream and a dash of Aleppo pepper, which provides a zingy finish. That pepper is an example of the way Ms. Taras and Ms. Garcia get big effects from small touches. Hazelnuts represented a crucial addition to the browned butter around plump, beautifully cooked sea scallops. Applewood smoked bacon and red and beluga lentils lent a pivotal heartiness to wild striped bass. The dessert list is almost as long as the rest of the menu. It is divided into three sections -- ""fork,"" ""fingers"" and ""straw"" -- that denote the manner of utensil, broadly speaking, that the dish requires. ""Straw"" includes an egg cream and a vanilla float. ""Fingers"" has ""milk & cookies,"" which of course has a twist: the milk is steamed and spiked with chocolate liqueur. The smallness of the scale on which Ms. Taras and Ms. Garcia are working cannot be overemphasized. Their larder is limited and their wine list perfunctory. The compact physical dimensions of the restaurant leave diners without much overflow area if they are waiting for a table, and waits may become more common, because Little Giant just stopped taking reservations for groups smaller than six. But what Little Giant offers in place of high-volume polish is low-volume personality: the fun of hanging out in a crowd cheeky enough to play Journey and Cyndi Lauper along with the Scissor Sisters, John Hiatt and Beck. After 10:30 one night, several of the owners' friends dropped by; within minutes they were dancing. The song that triggered this, by the Basement Jaxx, was called ""Do Your Thing."" With panache and progressive music, Little Giant is heeding that instruction. Little Giant  * [Rating: One Star]  85 Orchard Street (Broome Street), Lower East Side; (212) 226-5047.

310,Perilla,★,20070725,Frank Bruni,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/25/dining/reviews/25rest.html,"THE first chef I spotted in the dining room at Perilla was Wesley Genovart, who plies his trade at a restaurant called Degustation. On a subsequent night I picked out Wylie Dufresne, the visionary who fries mayonnaise at WD-50, and Marco Canora, the benevolent ruler of Insieme and Hearth. On neither of those occasions did I lay eyes on Harold Dieterle, who was actually in charge of what everyone at Perilla’s handsome zebrawood tables was eating. And this dichotomy  — the conspicuous presence of his curious peers, the behind-the-curtain  invisibility of the man himself  — says a lot about Perilla’s odd genesis and how he has responded to it. Mr. Dieterle, 30, was the first winner of the hit cable television series “Top Chef,” now in its third season. He got $100,000 (before taxes) and, more important, a lot of attention, which guaranteed interest in any restaurant he put together, and made the opening of Perilla a major event. Fame on the small screen wasn’t a result of a packed restaurant; his packed restaurant is a result of his fame on the small screen. That’s reality television for you — it scrambles cause and effect, defying the laws of celebrity physics. But while show business gave Mr. Dieterle his big break, his handling of it   — including his reluctance to hold court in his restaurant, as other chefs do in theirs — makes clear that he doesn’t want to be a showman. Perilla’s television DNA defines it in the opposite way from what you might expect. With its tucked-away setting on a short West Village street, its understated décor and a cautious list of entrees (hanger steak, skate wing, roasted chicken) that could have evolved from some protein focus group, this restaurant amounts to a repudiation of flashy packaging and trumped-up drama. It’s earnest, endearing and just a bit of a snooze: a classy neighborhood place with more pull than Mr. Dieterle’s cooking —  accomplished but hardly riveting —  justifies. Perilla’s straightforwardness owes something to Mr. Dieterle’s experience before “Top Chef”  — he didn’t zoom straight from culinary school to the television studio, though I’m sure many students now  fantasize about such a trajectory  — and to the background of Alicia Nosenzo, his main partner in the restaurant. They worked together at the Harrison: he in the kitchen, she out front. And they are clearly graduates of what might be called Jimmy Bradley University, which seeds the city with professionals performing variations on the American bistro theme that Mr. Bradley and his former business partner, Danny Abrams, nailed at the Harrison and the Red Cat. With those restaurants Perilla shares a profoundly friendly service ethic, an atmosphere more cozy than glamorous and some effort to keep prices below the stratosphere. What distinguishes it is Mr. Dieterle’s fascination with Asian flavors, which pop up in many dishes. An appealing peekytoe crab salad among the appetizers has mango and ginger along with (predictably) avocado. In a better starter, gorgeous, thick slices of raw yellowtail are brightened by cilantro and yuzu. And irresistible little duck meatballs  — the best starter of all  — are made with panko and Thai basil and placed on a bed of gnocchi that are partly potato and partly Okinawa purple yam. The dumplings’ unconventional pedigree doesn’t have much payoff: they’re bland and superfluous. The meatballs get a more vital assist from a quail egg, whose yolk, once broken, gives them a rich, silken gloss. Meatballs, of course, are in vogue right now, and yellowtail is having a moment. So is pork belly, a brick of which Mr. Dieterle trots out in another appetizer, fringing it with trumpet mushrooms and a Banyuls-vanilla gastrique. And there’s no path safer than grilled hanger steak, though it doesn’t emerge from many kitchens more tender and nicely charred than it does from Perilla’s. Here it’s sliced and paired with a red shallot purée. Roasted duck also fares better at Perilla than at most other restaurants, arriving in two meaty, juicy wedges of breast festooned with huckleberries. Mr. Dieterle likes fresh produce and he likes to festoon, throwing wax beans and cashews at a nonetheless retiring entree of steamed red snapper; an apricot purée and hazelnuts at a puny portion of vapid roasted chicken; and cipollini onions and a parsley root mousseline at beautifully grilled lamb. But his mousselines and gastriques seem more like the dutiful flourishes of a studiously conscientious tradesman than the inspirations of an artist letting his imagination roam. There’s some primness in Perilla, which lacks the exuberance and sense of fun —  on and off the plate — that makes the Red Cat so fetching. And there are scattered errors of judgment, like an excessively sweet, gloppy entree of black cod with a black bean glaze and litchi. Almost none of the appetizers and entrees satisfied me quite as much as two of the sides: a gooey dish of farro made in the manner of risotto, thickened with Parmesan, butter and artichoke confit; and creamed corn with a generous dose of garlic chives. If loading up on starches means you can’t move on to sweets, so be it. The pastry chef, Seth Caro, does erratic work at Perilla, the best of it represented by cube-shaped doughnuts that are filled with lemon cream and made from a batter infused with fennel seed, which gives them an amusing kick. His enlistment of unexpected ingredients doesn’t always work out so well. A perfectly innocent coconut cake, minding its sticky business, gets mugged by a Shrek-green, grassy-tasting scoop of frozen yogurt flavored with perilla, the Asian herb, better known as shiso, that’s celebrated  by the restaurant’s name. The wine list is affordably priced, underscoring Perilla’s interest in being unassuming and undemanding enough to encourage repeat visits. And if what you seek is a soothing roster of agreeable dishes executed with an awareness of the season and ample finesse, Perilla will likely draw you back, especially if you nab one of the tall, semicircular booths that are as close as the slender dining room comes to a signature design element. You just may have to wait for the buzz to die down, for the visiting chefs to move on. And you definitely have to accept that Mr. Dieterle isn’t doing a star turn. Perilla ★ 9 Jones Street (West Fourth Street), Greenwich Village; (212) 929-6868. ATMOSPHERE A narrow, deep, understated room with a long bar in front and tall semicircular booths in back.

312,Cru,Three Stars,20041020,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/20/dining/reviews/where-old-ghosts-fight-for-a-table.html,"WE New Yorkers are not only a melodramatic lot. We are also a superstitious lot, especially when it comes to real estate, and before Cru opened in August, much of the chatter among the city's food mavens was that no new restaurant could possibly succeed in the spot where a series of previous ones, including Washington Park, had failed. This dining room, in Greenwich Village, was cast as doomed, damned, possessed: the Linda Blair of culinary environments. For my first visit to Cru, I wondered whether to take a credit card or an exorcist. I have now been there several times, and if Cru is the devil's playground, may I cast a write-in vote for Beelzebub on Election Day? He probably does not have an exit strategy for Iraq or a plan for universal health care. But he is . . . well, a demon in the kitchen, and he and Bacchus are clearly tight. Up until dessert, most of the dishes at Cru are splendid. Tilting heavily toward Italy, nodding slightly toward Spain, the restaurant's chef, Shea Gallante, produces what he calls modern European food and walks a pitch-perfect line between precious and creative, busy and resourceful. To read his menu is to feel an initial stab of alarm: do slivers of raw albacore tuna really stand to benefit from bits of caper and a sauce of black olive and espresso? Yes, it turns out, they do, because those flavors come and go: fully present one moment, less detectable the next. They give the tuna some salty, bracing character, but not too much. Mr. Gallante knows not to let the sidekicks steal the show. If he were not on top of his game, the rieslings and Riberas del Duero would usurp him. To some extent, Cru was born from, and built on, wine. The restaurant's owner, Roy Welland, has a private collection of about 65,000 bottles. About 3,200 are on the regular list, which appears in gorgeously leatherbound, beautifully organized books, and on any given night, more than 50 wines are served by the glass and half-glass. The wine director, Robert Bohr, makes that potentially intimidating bounty as accessible as possible. He walks -- no, bounds -- from table to table, talking tannins, mulling microclimates and smiling from ear to ear whenever he makes a successful match between a crisp northern Italian white and a dithering downtown Manhattan skeptic. He looks happier and more energized at the end of a long night than at the beginning. The man lives to decant. Cru has placed itself at the crossroads of several restaurant trends. The availability of so many wines in small measures is just one example. The raw tuna appears on a section of the menu that is devoted to crudo, or slightly seasoned raw fish, which is becoming as ubiquitous in Manhattan restaurants as Jude Law is in Hollywood movies. And the first three of the four savory courses on the menu -- crudo, appetizers and pastas -- tap into the small-plates craze, because the pastas can be ordered in half portions. A diner trying to graze rather than gorge could simply skip the fourth course, the entrees, a strategy that would also lower what can be a steep final bill. Then again, that diner would miss Cru's sublimely succulent lobster, slow-poached in butter and olive oil. That diner would also miss Cru's equally succulent veal, poached sous vide. The black truffle and anchovy mayonnaise with which it is served has a richness and kick that turn out to be precisely the spark the veal needs. When I had it, it was on the main menu, but it was later moved to a special tasting menu and denied, I know, to at least one disappointed customer who requested it à la carte. Cru should make it more available. Tender flesh, be it turbot, duck or lamb, turns out to be one of Mr. Gallante's strong suits. But his strongest suit is his instinct for flavor combinations, which turn tiny portions of crudo into big gustatory events. The Arctic char, with hints of smoked pepper and a dab of vanilla oil, made me sigh with pleasure. So did the langoustine, which lay on a bed of crème fraîche, gin and black truffle oil, under a gossamer duvet of grated black truffle, green papaya and basil. The bluefin toro, in a sparsely applied sauce that included yogurt, paprika, red chili and mustard oil, gave me a happy head rush. Among appetizers, the pignoli-dusted skate wing, tickled by a Parmesan foam, was especially delightful, as were the shrimp and the quail breast. Among pastas, two standouts were nonpasta interlopers: gnocchi with oxtail and risotto with sea urchin. Dessert almost spoils the party. The pastry chef, Will Goldfarb, has been known, in past jobs, to use tobacco and mentholated cough drops in his concoctions. While he restrains himself at Cru, I still sensed inclinations toward both rebelliousness (pools of chocolate from which most traces of sweetness had been banished) and self-conscious showmanship. A gooey, goofy dessert billed as ""interactive"" came with a chilled spray container of salted water, a transparent vial of golden liquid and another transparent vial of beige dust, all swaddled in a white towel. None of these were to be eaten. They were props meant to evoke the sea, sun and sand of a day at the beach. Why bother with such an allusion when a night at Cru is its own grand pleasure? If your curiosity is greater than your appetite, you can drop in for special wine-food pairings in a front room devoted to more casual sipping and supping. Cru accommodates a range of impulses and does so much so well that it can be forgiven its end-of-meal errors, overbright lighting and too-brown, too-dull color scheme. At least the tables are far apart, the chairs and banquettes are sumptuously comfortable and the servers strike a fetching balance between earnestness and levity. There is a populous army of them, and no wonder. With a reputedly potent hex to battle, Cru makes sure it has reinforcements on hand.

313,Sasabune,One Star,20061227,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/27/dining/reviews/tough-love-at-the-sushi-bar.html,"THERE are restaurants that accentuate the positive and want you to know they'll do anything, within the bounds of reason and the scope of what's in the kitchen, to accommodate your desires. Then there's Sasabune, which wants you to know that you're entering a world -- well, a white-walled nook with an almost severe lack of adornment -- in which the rules of engagement are established and mostly unwavering. Sasabune wants you to know this right off, so there's a sign outside the front door that unfurls a litany of negativity: children discouraged from sitting at sushi bar, no à-la-carte ordering for groups larger than four, and certainly none of those colorful sushi rolls that have migrated even into supermarket salad bars. A sign inside reiterates that last blast of nay-saying, admonishing diners: ""No California rolls. No spicy tuna rolls."" It might as well say, ""No sushi dilettantes,"" because that's part of the message here. But there's another part as well, communicated by yet another sign inside, this one with a gentler tone. It says: ""Today's special: trust me."" And it gets at the fuller picture, which is that Sasabune isn't simply trying to bend you to its will. It's trying to treat you to its vision, let you benefit from its judgment. In the world of omakase, sternness and kindness overlap, and a slap is in many senses a caress. Since its opening on the Upper East Side in early November, Sasabune has served only an omakase menu. That means its chef and owner, Kenji Takahashi, also known as the ""me"" you're supposed to ""trust,"" decides what you'll eat and the order in which you'll eat it, sending out slices of albacore sashimi in a tart version of a ponzu sauce, then pieces of toro sushi with no sauce or gloss at all. Intent on determining not only sequence but also seasoning, Mr. Takahashi lets you know precisely what he thinks you should and shouldn't do to the fish in front of you, or one of his servers does. ""No soy sauce!"" those servers bellow when they set down sushi for which it isn't advised. It's unclear whether the volume and urgency of the command reflect a carefully enunciated compensation for rocky English or an edict whose violation could prompt expulsion. Sasabune exemplifies a certain kind of sushi restaurant and experience: the tiny, simple, serene refuge that inspires a cult of devotees, who equate instruction with enlightenment, surrender with liberation. That cult is already forming: on the nights I visited the restaurant, many of the diners had been there before -- I could tell from overheard conversations -- and had already established a rapport with Mr. Takahashi, who smiled broadly when he handed them what he knew was their favorite fish. Sasabune is noteworthy for another reason as well. While the $60 or so per person it charges for its omakase menu isn't inexpensive, the amount and quality of the sushi that money buys represent a very fair deal in comparison with similar meals at like-minded restaurants. The kanpachi I had at Sasabune was as silky and buttery as the kanpachi I've had anywhere else; the toro was the fatty stuff of head rushes. Mr. Takahashi obviously takes pains to find top-tier ingredients, and he takes pains to mold nicely proportioned beds of rice, the warm temperature of which is what often distinguishes a serious sushi restaurant from an assembly line. There are tradeoffs. The pacing of a meal at Sasabune was often off-putting, perhaps because Mr. Takahashi was the only one molding the rice and cutting the fish. Usually in groups of two, pieces of sushi came flying at me so fast at times that the meal lasted just an hour. At other times, the rat-tat-tat rhythm gave way to awkwardly long lags. Despite their strictness, Mr. Takahashi and his assistants, who chip in by splashing sauces and scattering scallions on the fish, can actually be a bit sloppy. My piece of slightly cooked black cod, placed on a nori-wrapped puck of rice, was gently kissed by a sweetened sea eel reduction; a companion's piece was swimming in the dark, intense, mesmerizing liquid. And Mr. Takahashi's fondness for tartness, evident in the yuzu and lemon juices he brushes on hamachi, oysters and other fish, exceeded my own and many companions'. He honed his craft at -- and named his restaurant after -- a Sasabune in Los Angeles with the same ""trust me"" language and ethos. His Sasabune has just six seats at the sushi bar, another 14 or so at nearby tables and another dozen in a back room that wasn't usually in use. The sushi bar is the place to sit, allowing you to bask in the palpable joy he takes in his work. His approach to seasoning is less elaborate than Sushi of Gari's, more elaborate than Kuruma Zushi's. He seldom put more than a rumor of wasabi, if that, between the rice and the fish, and he did nothing more to sweet blue crab than pack it with warm rice into a cylindrical roll of crisply, beautifully toasted nori. That hefty, filling roll was the climactic moment of each of my meals, and it was a knockout. But fluke sushi received a colorful plume of pickled red radish, Japanese chili pepper and scallions. Gorgeous Scottish salmon was roofed with a thin tile of kelp, over which toasted sesame seeds were scattered, providing a nutty lift. There were more of those seeds on top of the cod. An omakase meal at Sasabune usually encompassed more than a dozen pieces of sushi or sashimi, including Spanish mackerel and sea scallop. After the crab roll, Mr. Takahashi would permit requests, adjusting the bill upward accordingly. I stretched my meal out with uni one night, with a second crab roll and some sea eel on another night. Not counting wine or sake from a limited selection, my bill never climbed above $80. Mr. Takahashi told me that as the restaurant evolves, he may allow à la carte ordering from the start of a meal. I doubt he's in any hurry to get to that point. He clearly prefers to call the shots. With fish this fine, he's earned that right.

314,Grayz,★,20071205,Frank Bruni,Midtown,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/05/dining/reviews/05rest.html,"AFTER one meal that culminated in dishes of braised short ribs and cavatelli and another that involved duckling and red snapper, I was under the impression that I’d been eating dinner at Grayz. Silly me. “We don’t serve dinner,” said a woman who answered the phone late one afternoon when I called to check if Grayz, a new venture from the justly acclaimed chef Gray Kunz, had its full menu in effect that night. It was Thanksgiving weekend, so I wanted to be sure. She said everything was business as usual, but she took pains to define Grayz as a cocktail lounge with some nibbles. That made me wonder if it had been radically altered since my previous visits, when I’d encountered nearly 10 small plates (many of them intricately wrought) and 3 larger dishes that bore a distinct resemblance to entrees, not to mention several desserts. Bar snacks these weren’t. And bar snacks didn’t await me when I showed up several hours later. In fact, my companion and I ordered a five-course tasting menu that began with quail, proceeded through venison and ended with a chocolate soufflé. It cost $85 per person. In my book that’s dinner. And Grayz’s reluctance to call it that — or to cast itself as a full-scale restaurant — opens a window into the befuddled and befuddling soul of the place. Grayz, named for its chef and for the light eating it sort of encourages and sort of doesn’t, exemplifies the increasing frequency with which ambitious and sometimes memorable food pops up in contexts that don’t conform to the rules, rhythms or contours of conventional dining. There are self-labeled wine bars with a whole lot more than cheese, a roving downtown DessertTruck with delicacies other than ice cream bars, East Village nooks whose backless stools belie the distinctive dishes placed on the counters in front of them. The lines blur. Is Tailor a place to drink with unusually creative food, or a place to eat with unusually creative drinks? Is P*ong a sweet retreat with savory benefits, or vice versa? And what’s to be made of Grayz, where one of the city’s most gifted chefs hands over the foreground to fancy-pants elixirs — tequila with elderflower syrup and agave, bourbon with maple syrup and roasted pineapple — less inspired than his cooking? Once the presiding deity at Lespinasse, Mr. Kunz went half a decade without a restaurant of his own, then re-emerged in 2004 at Café Gray, where meticulously prepared food competes with a glinting, jangling atmosphere. At Grayz he has taken over the elegant town house from which Aquavit moved, set aside its centerpiece dining room for private parties, and fashioned a setting that looks more like a rambling hotel lobby than a restaurant: tall tables here, short tables there, a long bar, a few sofas. It’s as if he refuses to give himself an appropriately flattering showcase or give you an easy path to his work. Maybe he has commitment issues. He certainly has a feng shui disorder. At Café Gray he put the open kitchen in front of the view, and the layout at Grayz is such that you’re too likely to end up in a spot with bad sight lines that feels too far from a too-elusive center of gravity. That might be fine if Grayz, which is trying to cash in on the current cocktail craze, were really and truly about the drinks. But a recent daytime menu included a $26 entree of grilled red snapper bathed in southern Mediterranean sunshine: pine nuts, raisins and a glittering saffron emulsion. A nighttime menu included a $22 appetizer of foie gras in a black-truffle-and-port-wine sauce with chanterelles. These dishes demand fuller attention than the setting allows, and the prices  — $39 for the short ribs — only make total sense if eating is the point of a visit. There’s an awkward mix of signals that distracts you from the kitchen’s efforts, which are noteworthy nonetheless. Mr. Kunz devises an entirely new, addictive treatment for fried calamari, the coating made with Cream of Wheat and graham-cracker crumbs and the dip a chutney of preserved lemon and honey. Squid: it’s what’s for breakfast, or maybe for dessert. Kimchi-brushed prawns, grilled and served with a kaffir lime rémoulade, were tart and altogether terrific. Branzino seldom swims in a sea as regal as the Champagne-caviar beurre blanc that surrounded a beautifully grilled fillet. The sauce had an ideal balance of richness and acidity, sweetness and saltiness. Weisswurst — a white sausage of veal and pork — was ethereal. Duckling was exalted by a syrupy reduction of pear and apple reminiscent of balsamic vinegar without as bitter an edge. It was applied tableside — you know, the usual bar-snack flourish. The branzino, duckling, prawns and sausages were all served in the evening. In the afternoon the menu was different, and it included an excellent lentil soup with tantalizing hints of smoky bacon and a judicious measure of cream, which rounded it out beautifully. Grayz’s cocktail-lounge feint notwithstanding, there’s an ample variety of food, and it reflects considerable energy, incorporating Mr. Kunz’s fascination with different cuisines: Asian, Bavarian, Scandinavian. It has shortcomings, but they’re a matter of execution, not limited ambition. The pomegranate sauce on the cavatelli was unappealingly sour, and there was too much of it. Venison loin got somewhat lost in a blizzard of effects including chestnuts and lingonberries. An apple crumble was excessively sugary. Better to go with the chocolate hazelnut tart. And best to know in advance that a disorienting tentativeness and uncertainty color Grayz, which opened in September but still seems to be fumbling toward self-definition. The volume of what sounds numbingly like Muzak is soft on one visit, loud the next. Hosts shepherd you to the most oddly situated tables when others are — and remain — available. A lunch menu is handed out at dinner, or whatever Grayz would like to dub that meal. And beyond the bounds of the not-so-small, not-so-incidental plates, this realm of haute finger food can be all thumbs. Grayz * 13-15 West 54th Street; (212) 262-4600; grayz.net.

317,Eleven Madison Park,★★★★,20090811,Frank Bruni,Midtown South,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/12/dining/reviews/12rest.html,"IT’S a common assumption that most ambitious restaurants improve with age, working out their kinks, controlling their jitters, tempering the vanity that breeds bad judgment. Common, but not really correct anymore. These days — when the ramp-up to a restaurant’s opening is endless, the storm of bloggers dissecting its baby steps is boundless and its frenzied first months can make or break it — it often shows the most discipline and highest standards at the start. After that, there is drift, to different degrees, at different velocities. What the restaurant gains in maturity it loses in pure drive. As for the elite club of truly extraordinary restaurants, they don’t so much raise the level of their games as maintain it (which is blessing and pleasure enough). Jean Georges and Per Se are magnificent now, but they were magnificent then, too. While there’s magic in a meal at either, there isn’t really any sense of revelation. That’s why my visits to Eleven Madison Park over the last five years have, in arc and aggregate, given me such particular joy. I watched a distinguished restaurant get better, even though it already seemed popular enough to survive just the way it was. Then I watched an improved, excellent restaurant, which I elevated to three stars from two in early 2007, make yet another unnecessary advance. I fell in love gradually, not all at once. The experience had a sweetness all its own. Eleven Madison Park, which opened in 1998, now ranks among the most alluring and impressive restaurants in New York. It has reached this pinnacle because its principal owner, the indefatigable Danny Meyer, made a key move in 2006, bringing aboard the chef Daniel Humm,  and because together they decided — out of pride, it seems to me, more than any commercial calculation — that this restaurant could and should shine as brightly as any other. It already had the setting: that theatrically tall, marble and  nickel-walled hall in the old Metropolitan Life Building, with grand windows onto the verdure of Madison Square Park. It already had a deep, broad wine list. It just needed a bit more polish in its service and a lot more sparkle in its food. Over the last three and a half years, it has received precisely that, in measures that increased steadily since the arrival of Mr. Humm (and, soon after him, a new general manager, Will Guidara, and a new wine director, John Ragan, who has wisely supplemented familiar treasures from France with less familiar ones from other countries). Mr. Humm’s French-grounded cooking, which bridges the classically saucy decadence of the past and the progressive derring-do of a new generation, drew notice from the get-go. He hadn’t been in place long before the city’s gluttons were atwitter (in the old-fashioned sense) about his way with suckling pig. He served it as a dense, tender brick of confit below the most crisply fatty sheet of crackling imaginable. But instead of resting on his suckling laurels, he took this wrinkle of his reputation and ran with it, developing a tasting menu with five consecutive courses of suckling pig, including belly cooked sous vide and a roasted rack of tiny, exquisite chops. I sampled this last month, and it was superb. The menu allows you to chart paths of varying lengths, from three standard courses, each of which you choose, to a “gourmand” experience of 11 unspecified courses that Mr. Humm selects for you. But even the briefest route includes numerous detours, because he has a particular enthusiasm for succinct, intense add-ons to be experienced before or between the principal dishes. For example, every dinner begins with a five-piece row of single-bite amuse bouches, one with foie gras, another with salmon and another with sweetbreads nestled in a crunchy cornet. Some of his best work comes in small packages, like a cup of “sea urchin cappuccino” that was presented as a little surprise during a meal whose climax would be a flawlessly cooked blue foot chicken for two with a brioche, foie gras and truffle butter stuffing under the glistening skin. The cappuccino’s inclusion of cauliflower mousse below a peekytoe crab salad, sea urchin roe and a sea urchin foam made with cream and Cognac seemed to allude to (and perhaps borrowed from) a famous Joël Robuchon dish of cauliflower cream, lobster and sea urchin. But Mr. Humm’s version was an altogether frothier and more indulgent affair, and whenever it threatened to become too much, a tart, astringent note flickered, reining everything in. The difference between good and great cooking of this kind is often knowing where the creamy, buttery, unctuous tipping point is — and stopping just shy of it. Mr. Humm does that expertly. Like so many practitioners of contemporary French cooking, he favors foams, bisques, gelées and such: in place of the sea urchin cappuccino one night was a smoked sturgeon sabayon, served in an eggshell. But Mr. Humm is mindful of the need for some textural contrast — some crunch. So a slow-poached egg with a brown butter hollandaise and a Parmesan foam boasted not only crisp, beautiful asparagus but also a Parmesan tuile. Its salty kick was another reason to have it around. Some chefs and restaurants do better with meat than with fish, or vice versa, but that’s not the case here. I’m crazy for the lavender honey-glazed duck for two, but I’m just as crazy for the restaurant’s changing lobster dishes — one of the best has curried granola — and for its reliably moist, snowy halibut. I’m crazier still for the Hawaiian prawn roulade, an appetizer that tastes like a repurposed California roll with all of the glory and none of the gunk. Poached prawns are dressed with crème fraîche, diced green apple and lime juice and then molded into a thin horizontal column surfaced with thinly sliced, vivid avocado. Mr. Humm’s judicious flirtations with molecular gastronomy have intensified over the years, to exciting effect. One tomato salad comprised liquid spheres — those quivering, explosive orbs made famous by the Spanish wizard Ferran Adrià — of white buffalo mozzarella and red tomato. Another floated a fleecy tomato “cloud” (tomato water whipped with gelatin) over a patchwork of red and yellow cherry tomatoes. Mr. Humm supervises the sweets in addition to what precedes them, and with most he finds the right middle ground between hyper-imaginative artistry and molten chocolate pandering. Accessorizing the gooey chocolate centerpiece of one dessert with both caramel popcorn and a popcorn-flavored ice cream did that trick nicely. The $88 price of three courses plus all the little extras makes Eleven Madison Park more affordable than, for example, Le Bernardin or Daniel, and is a major reason I send people there more often. But I also send them because the large scale and hubbub of the room, connected to a lively bar area whose merriment spills into it, makes it seem less of a rapt, cinching commitment. Eleven Madison Park provides much of the ceremony and pampering associated with fine dining at its most traditional in a way that’s louder, looser and more in sync with most diners’ temperaments. By design it’s not quite as approachable as Gramercy Tavern or Union Square Cafe, Mr. Meyer’s more widely beloved mainstays. But with Mr. Humm, 32, at the helm, young and hungry and undistracted by the kind of empire that such elders as Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Daniel Boulud have created, it shimmers in a way that none of Mr. Meyer’s many terrific restaurants ever have. That’s saying a great deal, but no less than Eleven Madison has earned.

321,Gray,Two Stars,20041215,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/15/dining/reviews/prime-location-obstructed-view.html,"IF you look toward the open kitchen at Café Gray -- and you will indeed do that, because the restaurant's exceedingly peculiar layout places the kitchen between you and the view of Central Park -- you will almost certainly notice a cherub-faced, gray-haired man with a palpable intensity that outstrips that of any of the other white-clad workers around him. He seems always to be giving orders. He darts from one burner or food preparation station to the next. He represents a study in constant, hurried motion, and no wonder. This man, Gray Kunz, from whom this restaurant takes its name and cues, is making up for lost time. More than six years ago Mr. Kunz left his post as the chef at Lespinasse and more or less vanished. (Lespinasse closed in 2003.) There were side projects, consulting work and meetings and rumors about his next big thing, which didn't materialize. As the years went by, Mr. Kunz, now 49, seemed poised to become the culinary world's Terrence Malick, his legend large, his output paltry. Café Gray, which opened at the Time Warner Center in early October, marks his full-scale return, and it's a genuinely welcome, mostly successful and profoundly curious comeback. It affirms and buttresses the legend: the best of the food here is fabulous, and the menu as a whole is a pleasure-packed testament to Mr. Kunz's nimbleness of imagination and execution. Producing an unclassifiable cuisine, he does sly, multifaceted dishes and straightforward uncomplicated ones. He nuzzles up to Italy and to France, flirting all the while with India and Thailand. His principal compass -- maybe his only one -- is the most valid and valuable of all: what tastes great. But there's something off-kilter about Café Gray, something disorienting, and that layout is a big part of it. I can't think of another restaurant in this city that so wantonly wastes such a potentially pleasant panorama. The open kitchen forms a broad, taunting moat between the dining room and the windows, one that brims with enough hardware and human activity to block specific portions of those windows and, at least at night, blot out any general sense of the cityscape beyond them. Café Gray has minted the passive-aggressive restaurant design. Because the kitchen is front and center, like a stage, you invariably notice and find yourself affected by its hustle and bustle; the dining room is rigged to make you feel jazzed, not soothed, in the manner of a deliberately boisterous brasserie. Mr. Kunz reportedly wanted the look and feel of a grand Viennese cafe, which apparently has more than a bit in common with a garden-variety corporate hotel, at least as Café Gray interprets it. The light from dozens of exposed bulbs glints off copious panels and bits of glass. Mirrored columns resemble nothing so much as overgrown, elongated disco balls. The ambience doesn't really suit the food, much of which is more ambitious and fussier than cafe or brasserie fare. It demands your undistracted attention, and very often deserves it. Sure, I had a relatively simple oxtail consommé that was fit for a teeming chow hall, albeit a tony one. (There were Lilliputian foie gras ravioli afloat in the sublime sherry-tinged broth.) Mr. Kunz's superb vitello tonnato could certainly be seen as a kind of comfort food, to be consumed absent-mindedly as the conversation churns. So could his braised short rib, as astonishingly tender a slab of beef as exists in this protein-rich metropolis. But I also had more subtle, intellectualized creations, including a pasta appetizer in which two broad, thin noodles lay under and over a much fatter tomato concassé, the ratio of starch to sauce turned on its head. I had an appetizer of cured yellowtail with a carefully considered geometry, the fish flattened into an enormous circle, Hackelback sturgeon caviar piled atop it and tiny green leaves of Red Russian kale arranged in a corona around it. Other dishes had bright halos or backdrops, like the carrot curry emulsion beneath a sautéed lamb chop, and elaborate architectures of their own, proving the obvious. You can take the chef out of the four-star restaurant, but you can't take the four-star restaurant out of the chef. Mr. Kunz has an undeniable genius for flavor combinations and, even more so, flavor calibrations. He knows how to steer clear of preciousness on the road to exquisite nuance. The interplay of buttery richness and verbena-touched tartness in the bouillon and the accompaniments for a steamed branzino that he was serving in October was a knockout. So was that carrot curry emulsion, infused with orange, lemon, cumin, cayenne and sugar, and the Meaux mustard sauce with the short rib. Mr. Kunz also has a flair for texture, and he lends snap and crackle to fluke by assigning it a puffed rice crust. He gives snapper an all-important edge by brushing it with eggs and flour and coating it with dried sweet corn. There were a few examples of more questionable judgment and less happy returns. The walnut vinaigrette for a roast organic duckling had too much punch, while a ""sour sweet lemon grass nage"" -- a complex broth bathing several succulent bay scallops and luscious bits of lobster -- had a slightly unpleasant astringency. Among desserts the chocolate, cranberry and oatmeal crumble is to be avoided, while the crème brûlée and the apple croustade, rendered distinct by the inclusion of huckleberries, are to be embraced. The appeal of a hazelnut soufflé depends entirely on your appetite for ultra-indulgence. If you skew gooey, rest assured that it does too. The list of wines by the glass skews brief and somewhat boring. The service skews unreliable. Except on my last visit, there were overlong stretches when the table went unattended, usually toward the start of a meal. Once I was seated 40 minutes after my reservation time, and the cocktails that I was told would be free -- a gesture of apology -- nonetheless appeared on my bill. The farther your gaze and focus drift from the center of your plate, the less accomplished and careful Café Gray seems. The less coherent too. It sends mixed signals -- polished and unpolished, finicky and free-wheeling -- that complicate your response to it. You cannot be anything but grateful that Mr. Kunz is back in business. You cannot help wondering if he chose the right trappings and tableau. Café Gray  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  Time Warner Center (third floor), Columbus Circle; (212) 823-6338.

325,Kao Soy,★,20150210,Pete Wells,Red Hook,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/11/dining/restaurant-review-kao-soy-in-red-hook-brooklyn.html,"Only half of the tables inside Kao Soy were taken, but the delivery guys were coming and going through the door on Van Brunt Street every few minutes. The December wind off the harbor that was shaking the little brick buildings in Red Hook, Brooklyn, was keeping everybody at home, ordering pad see ew and massaman curry from the new neighborhood Thai place. This turned out to be lucky for me. Five minutes later, I was facing down a platter of shrimp with skinny dried chiles over torn lobes of sweet pomelo that had a flaky coating of toasted coconut and crushed peanuts. Soon after that came a big bowl of rice noodles, shrimp and round Asian eggplants in a mild green curry that seemed to get more and more appealing. This arrived with a separate plate of dried anchovies, boiled eggs with almost-solid yolks and a fresh red chile sauce that had definite intent to harm. Then the kao soy turned up, the dish I’d come to try. This is a pale-yellow coconut milk curry from Chiang Mai with submerged noodles and a chicken leg, and, above the surface, fried egg noodles going off in all directions with strands of green-papaya fritters. There was another condiment plate for the kao soy, of course. I was eating all of this as fast as I could, and as the overall deliciousness began to sink in I started eating even faster. It wasn’t fast enough, though, and soon the plates covered every inch of available surface area and I needed to slide an empty table next to mine. In fact, I ran out of space every time I went to Kao Soy. Some blame must be given to the plates, which are vast white things with rims almost as wide as the sidewalks on Park Avenue. Some goes to Thailand, where a meal may start with half a dozen salads and sticky rice, and where even the condiments seem to have condiments. Some goes to the tables, which are not built for this kind of thing. Most, though, goes to Kao Soy’s menu for inducing me to order too much (except that it was never too much) by offering Thai dishes I rarely see around town, including a few from northern Thailand. Those of us who prowl restaurants whose owners come from countries known for delicious food harbor an irrational belief that one day, if we play it right, we may get the Other Menu. This is the one the owners save for their family and friends. It’s the one that lists all the foods they loved back home. It’s filled with the dishes everybody says Americans won’t like. Nobody I know has ever seen one of these documents. That hasn’t stopped me from raising my eyebrows and dropping key foreign phrases in the hopes that a server will say: “Oh, you want the Other Menu? Just a moment, sir.” At Kao Soy, the Other Menu is printed on the same green page that lists the dishes you know from your local Thai spot: the fried rice, the pad thai, the curry with choice of chicken, beef, pork or shrimp. Those items fill the shopping bags that go out the door every few minutes. They help keep the business floating. But the mission of Kao Soy is to sell New Yorkers on what Sirichai Sreparplarn, one of the restaurant’s two chefs, calls “the real food from the north.” Several New York neighborhoods have been wrapped in the fiery clutch of Thailand’s northeastern region, Isan. Dishes from the north, though, have been found almost exclusively in one place, Pok Pok Ny, just outside Red Hook. This puts two northern Thai kitchens less than a mile apart in a borough that is home to only about 12 percent of the city’s Thai population and virtually no other Thai restaurants worth knowing about. Kao Soy was opened last summer by Kanlaya Supachana, who has worked in several Thai restaurants around Brooklyn, answering phones and such. She and her co-chef, Mr. Sreparplarn, close friends for many years, had what he calls “the same passion for serving real flavor to New Yorkers,” but they failed to persuade any existing Thai restaurants to share their vision. Finally a local contractor, Carlos Padillo, agreed to sign on as Ms. Supachana’s business partner, and they took over a tiny space, filled it with a few tables, a tiny bar and an electric fireplace. The northern Thai dishes are scattered around the menu. Most obvious is the excellent kao soy, made in the style of Ms. Supachana’s father back in Chiang Mai. Beneath the heading Snack & Salad is a dish called nam prik ong. This is a platter of steamed cauliflower, long beans, strips of fried pork rinds curled like Fritos and long surfboards of romaine lettuce, all meant as garnishes for a dip that’s something like a spicy, slightly sweet pork ragù that went for a swim in the ocean. Or maybe the dip is the garnish; it was gone before I’d decided. A related dish, sai oua, is filed under Various. The dip here has been pounded from garlic, onions and fresh green chiles, hot ones. For dipping, you get steamed young mustard greens, cucumbers, freshly fried pork (not rinds but meat this time, and marinated in soy), along with a house-made pork sausage, the sai oua itself. Deeply perfumed with makrut lime leaves, coriander roots and lemongrass stalks, this sausage makes a more complete single-bite introduction to Thai flavors than any plate of pad thai. For the time being, we reach the end of the northern Thai menu with the banana blossom fritter and the kang hung le, a warmly spiced peanut curry cooked with pork belly and beef. A fried drumstick comes on the side, and you are meant to pull off some dark meat, pinch it with sticky rice and then scoop up some of the curry. I didn’t understand it, but I loved it anyway. But we have not reached the end of the Other Menu, because there are other less-familiar dishes under the Snack & Salad or Various headings. Few are dull, and some are very good, like the shredded mango salad with cashews and two kinds of dried fish, no longer than a toothpick. Kao Soy isn’t quite finished yet, Ms. Supachana will say. (When it is, I hope she gets her hands on more of the fresh herbs that add minty, bitter and even fishy notes to many of the salads at Pok Pok Ny; without them, some of Kao Soy’s cold dishes seem to stop short.) There are big plans for the little bar, including a full stash of liquor. Two weeks ago, the liquor license arrived, and already Kao Soy has some interesting ideas about what to drink with Thai food, like Farnum Hill cider from New Hampshire, a Belgian-style saison ale from Allagash in Maine, or a red grenache from Donkey & Goat in California. They’re going to need bigger tables."
326,Il Matto,★★,20100831,Sam Sifton,TriBeCa,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/01/dining/reviews/01rest.html,"“YOUR drinks,” the waitress said, smiling brightly. Her tray had a martini on it — vodka, the brand unnamed — and a jar of pale, porous Ligurian beach stones, the size of mice. These were immersed in liquid. She used a forceps to pick one up and plop it into the drink, a scary moment for all involved. It imparted a faint mineral tang, along with a slick of vermouth. Also on the tray was something resembling a round-toed Lucite slipper propped on a napkin and filled with reddish-brown fluid, ice and a few Manila clams, with a straw sticking out of it. The menu identified this as a cocktail, a Clamato Mary. It tasted of gin, vegetation and rust: a Long Island Sound iced tea. Crème brûlée arrived soon after, a savory appetizer, the custard infused with pecorino beneath its sugary crust, served with red-onion jam and deeply reduced balsamic vinegar. The combination was weird, fantastic, a fun-house treat. A bowl of buffalo mozzarella came as well, melted into heavy cream to create a soup, served with tomato ice and fried eggplant. It ripped familiar flavors from their moorings. It conjured something new. The eggplant returned again at the end of the meal, with white chocolate, for an extremist’s millefoglie. It reads horrid. It tasted divine. This is Il Matto, a spare and radical gallery of a dining room that opened on Church Street in TriBeCa in June, in the space that used to be Arqua. The chef and owner is Matteo Boglione, who used to cook rustically at Gradisca and now has embraced his eccentricity. (Il Matto is a play on Mr. Boglione’s given name, and translates from the Italian as “the Madman.”) If the restaurant has a business plan, it was written by an artist, not a businessman. There is no hamburger on the menu to please those for whom a hamburger now counts as high cuisine. You cannot order a plate of finishing-school fried chicken, nor a black-truffle pizza. There is no dish of foraged mushrooms sitting beneath a poached organic egg from a chicken with a yoga teacher and a place upstate. No Caesar salad. No peekytoe crab or paddlefish caviar. There is only Mr. Boglione’s vision: odd and filled with unfamiliar marvels. Il Matto is an outlier in what sometimes seems to be an increasingly codified Manhattan restaurant scene. The restaurant has an antic, do-it-yourself feel that recalls some of the far Off Off Broadway theaters and clubs that dotted the neighborhood in the years of Television and Talking Heads. It seats roughly 55 in a space that might accommodate more, at tables set well apart from one another. Four are enclosed within giant, brightly colored teacup banquettes, set on large rubber wheels. The walls under the towering ceiling are mostly bare, save for a huge portrait, by the 1970s subway graffiti artist Toxic, of Mr. Boglione, depicted as a mad black octopus. Speakers in the ceiling play an eclectic mix of reggae and rock. A tiny staff bustles back and forth, as twinkling lights in the dining room fall with the sun into New Jersey, then suddenly shoot back up again as if at a cocktail party where someone has leaned into the dimmer by the door to the kitchen. Someone dashes across the room to fix the level. It happens many times each night. Nothing about the restaurant is perfect. Those rolling banquettes seem designed for people of smaller size than the average American diner, and most resemble the sort of furniture Ty Pennington builds on “Extreme Makeover: Home Edition.”  They are cool, but not hugely comfortable. The cocktails, created by Christina Bini, a bartender who came to Il Matto from a deeply experimental lounge in Florence, Italy, called Fusion, are mostly silly. (The wine list, nicely put together by Antonio d’Ambrosio, the restaurant’s sommelier and manager, is not. It concentrates on affordable if unfamiliar varietals from across the Italian peninsula, with many excellent values in the $50 range.) But the service is exceptional and the food beautifully executed. And the trade-off is to the diner’s advantage. A little seating discomfort is nothing, against a braised pork belly, melting and rich, served atop a stroke of honey infused with black olives. The meat is served with head-on shrimp and a purée of chickpeas. The flavors combine into something that is almost surreal, and entirely natural. Also on the appetizer list, a massive length of steamed octopus, soft almost as poundcake, a perfect foil for the compote of mortadella and potatoes served alongside it, with lardo whipped into cream, and basil. And a salad of baby arugula, steamed cauliflower and grilled porcinis, smoky and dense, that comes with buffalo mozzarella and black-truffle vinaigrette. It tastes of spice and milk, salt and fire, a meal in itself. A pasta course might include pici, the eggless Tuscan pasta similar to spaghetti, paired with a celery purée, tomato concassé, clams and healthy shavings of salty bottarga. Mr. Boglione cooks the strands to a perfectly al dente texture. He does the same with a brilliant dish of saffron-hued pappardelle, with an osso buco ragout and a smear, across the bowl, of bone-marrow sabayon. This latter substance may hold psychedelic properties. A delicate and flavorful farro lasagna, with burrata, basil pesto and tomatoes, is also worth ordering. The entrees make up a brief list, the highlights of which include a fillet of pork, its crisp exterior giving way to succulence and served with a Parmesan fondue, with a luscious roast peach on the side and a flash of spinach salad. Chicken crusted in pine nuts, meanwhile, arrives on top of a buttery smooth celery-root purée, with crisp garlic chips to offset it. The chicken is moist and intense. A sliced filet mignon, generally a cow’s most tender and flavorless steak, is given all the help it needs, cooked to a perfect red and layered with rectangles of foie gras above a sticky reduction of veal stock, with grilled asparagus. And hunks of rich tuna steak are paired with cotechino sausage, with fried baby artichokes, an eggplant cream and black olives cooked into a caramelized murkiness that seems to unite the fish with its porky pal, traditionally served to celebrate the arrival of a new year. Here, it seems to celebrate a vision for what a restaurant in Manhattan can be — a reflection not of what we want, but what its owner desires. Il Matto’s is food to chuckle over and think about. It is a book of short stories, worth reading."
333,Semilla,★★,20150224,Pete Wells,Williamsburg,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/dining/restaurant-review-semilla-in-williamsburg-brooklyn.html,"I came up with my nature-preserve theory of tasting menus while eating a cabbage sandwich at Semilla, a new restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, across the street from Jack’s Cancellation Shoes and Rachel’s Corset Discount Center (“specializing in hard to fit sizes”). Semilla had taken two cabbage leaves, then flattened and dried them until they were as crisp as a cracker. This was the bread. In between were a bundle of unusually delicious coleslaw and some grains of buckwheat groats. It wasn’t the most securely buckled-down sandwich I’ve ever eaten; some of the buckwheat fell out on the horseshoe-shaped counter around which Semilla’s 18 seats are arranged. But I liked the way the buckwheat that stayed in the sandwich cracked between my teeth like Grape-Nuts. The flavors woke up old memories of the Polish and Ukrainian restaurants that are mostly gone from the East Village. And it was undeniably cool to have cabbage-leaf “bread” arrive at my place without warning. Diners at Semilla don’t see a list of the 10 or so courses for which they are being charged $75 until the next day, when an email arrives from the restaurant. The sandwich struck me as a dish that might not last long on an à la carte menu. How many New Yorkers would choose to spend their dinner money on pressed cabbage when they could have broiled oysters or beef ribs or kale salad? By cordoning it off within a meal that has to be taken as a package deal, Semilla had sheltered the cabbage sandwich from the roughshod forces of the marketplace, the way the government might protect nests built by the gentle piping plover by banning four-wheel drive vehicles from the beach. The market’s relentless pressures to turn tables, to goose the check and so on are clear to anyone who goes out to eat in New York. It’s less obvious how those pressures may influence menus until we stop to ask why so many are virtually identical, with the same salads and the same cuts of the same animals. If not for minor variations in sauces and side dishes, we’d all fall asleep after our first cocktail. Semilla’s chef, José Ramírez-Ruiz, and its pastry chef, Pamela Yung, are using the nature-preserve possibilities of the tasting menu so their customers can taste dishes that weren’t concocted to please the marketplace. This is a familiar concept in music, film and art. It has come to New York dining only recently as multicourse, limited-choice menus have spread from the empyrean realms of Per Se and Atera to more affordable, less formal precincts like Contra and Semilla. Understand, as you enter this nature preserve, that you will be browsing extensively upon stems, tubers, rhizomes, seeds and other plant parts. Semilla tends to save fish and meat for moments when extra depth or intensity are needed. For instance, a paste of salt cod that covered the bottom of a plate in a thin layer, like gesso on raw canvas, acted like a dip for charred cups of cipollini onion and circles of rutabaga. It’s a dish that draws you in, as much for the rutabaga, which showed off its little-known talent for tasting like three or four vegetables at once, as for the salt cod, distilled to a potent cream so good I ran my fork around the plate twice to make sure I hadn’t left any. At Semilla (Spanish for seed), the term for this style of cooking is “vegetable forward.” This both warns vegetarians and vegans that they will need to ask in advance for substitutions, and reassures those for whom the term vegetarian cooking still evokes tie-dyed flashbacks of carrot-lentil loaf. Mr. Ramírez-Ruiz, the chief vegetable manipulator, owes almost nothing to that branch of the vegetarian family tree. It’s easier to see the imprint of Per Se, the Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare and Isa, all former employers, in the way he elegantly props one flavor against the next. He makes a frothy soup of beer and grilled celery root, then pours it over “noodles” shaved from a celery root; whipped Cheddar adds tang as it melts into the soup, and puffed quinoa gives it a breakfast-cereal snap, crackle and pop. Ms. Yung, another Isa veteran, who has been teaching sugar and flour new tricks since her days behind the counter at Room 4 Dessert, contributes two sweet courses at the meal’s end. (An inspired one brought black-truffle ice cream together with an electrifyingly tart Seville orange sauce.) She is also responsible for the hot sourdough bread that shows up at about halftime and often incorporates whole grains, such as farro and einkorn, that she grinds in a countertop mill stored on a shelf above the kitchen pass. (Most of the kitchen is visible from the seats and the rest can be seen through one-way glass slots in the restroom wall. At least, I think it’s one-way glass.) One night she had filled out the dough with cooked oatmeal, and the bread was pleasantly sticky under its thick crust. On all nights the bread arrives with a swirl of creamy butter and a trickle of buttermilk. There are aspects of Semilla over which reasonable people can disagree, but Ms. Yung’s bread isn’t one of them. I could argue, though, that the $75 price will keep out some of the young, creative-underclass types who may appreciate what the chefs are up to. I’d also say that Semilla’s servers should stop assuming that everybody has been initiated into the cult of natural wines; a guest of mine found the two samples she was poured too eccentric, and decided to drink nothing — a lost opportunity on each side of the bar. Inevitably, I wished a few dishes at Semilla had been swatted to the floor by the market’s invisible hand. One was a plate that I’ve come to call “too much cabbage with too many soybeans.” Another was an ice cream Ms. Yung made out of colza oil. Colza oil is a close cousin of canola oil; frozen, it tastes like cold lubricant. There is risk in this kind of cooking. There is reward, too, and the chance to find out how good a rutabaga spring roll can be when you dip it in bittersweet orange juice reduction. Whenever I glanced at the other people huddled around the ash countertop, I saw far more appreciative nods than puzzled grimaces. The crowd reminded me of the audiences, small but intense, who showed up to hear underground bands in the ’80s and ’90s, when that was one of the few ways to hear music that didn’t get played on the radio."
339,P*ong,★,20070718,Frank Bruni,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/18/dining/reviews/18rest.html,"SHOULD we really leave room for desserts? By the time they straggle along in a meal, the imperatives of nutrition have usually been met and our rightful allotment of calories exceeded, by which I mean doubled, and in my case that’s a day of quasi-heroic restraint. They’re like drugs, ruinous in the wrong hands, such as those of small children, and adults wearing pants with elastic waists. Were we a less addicted, less forgiving society, peddlers like Ben and Jerry would be chubby hubbies in the Vermont state penitentiary. But we crave our sweets. More and more we revere our sweets. And the evidence isn’t just the $4.75 for a cup of Grom gelato, the 20 minutes we’ll wait in line to pay that, the Pinkberrys and that bald guy  — what’s his name? Max something. Dabbles in chocolate. The evidence is the recent elevation of dessert artisans to celebrity status. It’s the dawn of restaurants at which desserts are the primary  — and sometimes solitary  — lure. It’s a curiously punctuated cubbyhole in the West Village called P*ong. Let’s dispense with the asterisk. It’s a sign of verbal high jinks, in this case an artfully monosyllabic smooshing of the name of the restaurant’s owner, Pichet Ong. He worked for many years under Jean-Georges Vongerichten. But like Iacopo Falai, Will Goldfarb and others in a newly assertive band of acclaimed New York pastry chefs, he yearned to call the shots himself. P*ong is the often tantalizing, often irritating product of that desire, a restaurant in which the number of desserts roughly equals the number of savory dishes and the line between the two blurs. P*ong sneaks sweet elements into dishes that wouldn’t normally incorporate them so prominently and savory elements into dishes that might not have them at all. It challenges your notions of what makes sense, nourishing your brain along with your gut. It also permits the childhood fantasy of an all-dessert meal, courtesy of three-course or five-course dessert tasting menus. The latter would probably fill many people up. And it might be the way to go, because desserts, predictably, are the restaurant’s strength and because staying for a longer meal  — say, the 10-course tasting menu ($59)  — requires too much time in a restaurant with too little elbow room. P*ong is seriously cramped: just 34 seats over less than 700 square feet, 14 of them at a bar around a kitchen that takes up a chunk of that space. The décor is hyper-contemporary, emphasizing pale wood and white surfaces, the bursts of color scattered enough not to compete visually with the brightly tinged drinks and food. While it’s easy to be cynical about the special cocktails crowding menus around town, it would be wrong to cop that attitude about P*ong’s. The golden-hued “Bangkok margarita” neatly balances pineapple with ginger and Aleppo pepper. Cucumber lends a surprising nuance to a ruby-red drink of cachaça, strawberry and lime. In terms of food, the savory stretch of the menu encompasses about a dozen dishes, wildly uneven in appeal. All are priced and portioned as large appetizers, and many are served cold, reflecting the limitations of a kitchen with no gas. As a general rule for choosing among them, green is good: a salad of escarole enlivened by avocado and anchovy; a medley of fava beans and sugar snap peas paired cleverly with an almond purée; a tangle of sharp-tasting arugula over carpaccio of American wagyu beef. Shards of Maine crab get a blast of sweetness from green apple mousse, while a frozen mango purée makes that contribution to a shrimp ceviche with the contrasting presence of Thai chili. In both instances, unfortunately, the supporting players steal the show from the seafood supposedly starring in it. The frozen mango shows the way P*ong uses temperature and texture  — in addition to heightened sweetness  — to toy with expectations for a savory dish. It puts cold, slushy elements where they’re not usually found. Frozen roasted tomato goes into a bowl of burrata, though I can’t say it amplifies the pleasures of the creamy cheese. A marriage of Meyer lemon ice and mascarpone works better  — the cheese is sweeter, and it plays a lesser role. The latter dish appears in a brief “sweet and savory” section of the menu that bridges the appetizer-style dishes and the desserts, most of which are resounding successes. I loved the tartness and tropical flavors of a Kaffir lime meringue with lemon grass, Greek yogurt, a rhubarb granita and bouncy cubes of coconut water. Like many of Mr. Ong’s desserts, it doesn’t lean on sugar for its charms, instead exploring other effects or less cloying agents. A vanilla-flavored agave syrup gently sweetens a mix of California peaches, ricotta and candied aloe vera, the kind of wild card that tends to pop up at P*Ong. For example crystallized nuggets of wasabi glitter on strawberries in a memorable dessert whose centerpiece is a cake layered with a miso semifreddo and seasoned generously with sea salt, a crucial arrow in Mr. Ong’s quiver. The wicked flavor choice for the ice cream with a chocolate bavarian is that of the breakfast drink Ovaltine. And cheesecake gets a fresh, irresistible spin by being sculptured into a croquette. Mr. Ong is an enterprising cook, but he doesn’t seem to be a seasoned restaurateur, and P*ong points out the difference. Service can be extremely sloppy. One evening a waiter asked a friend and me if we were ready to order. We said we hadn’t received dinner menus. He wordlessly pointed to a document in the middle of the table, a schoolmarm harrumphing at her hopeless pupils’ errors. The document was the wine list. Another evening a friend with an allergy asked if the shellfish dishes on a tasting menu could be replaced with something else. Absolutely, we were told, just minutes before the shellfish arrived anyway. To call the restaurant most days is to get a recording, which would be fine if the messages that it accepts were returned. Mine wasn’t. And along with so many other odd lapses, it made me wonder if Mr. Ong, who just released a cookbook called “The Sweet Spot” and plans a retail bakery beside P*ong, is quite as ready to claim center stage as desserts  — others’ as well as his  — are.

340,Porter House New York,One Star,20061122,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/22/dining/reviews/two-steakhouses-two-visions.html,"ON our way out of Porter House New York one night, as a friend and I retrieved our coats, a television set above the bar caught our attention. Although plenty expensive, Porter House is populist enough to give customers the chance to keep tabs on sporting events and news, but what we saw on the screen were pictures of meaty chops and starchy sides, arrayed in ways that looked familiar. We remarked on the oddity of the restaurant's playing what seemed to be a commercial for itself. Then came the tag line: Outback Steakhouse. We'd been wrong, but not by much. Situated in the Time Warner Center, a few floors above the Hugo Boss and Pink stores, Porter House amounts to a generically sophisticated upgrade of the kind of chain establishment found in lesser malls. It's like an M.B.A. program for beef eaters who did undergraduate work at Outback. STK is something else entirely. Like Porter House, it opened in September and it's big, proving that a city already engorged with steakhouses can stuff in a few more. But while Porter House has a pleasant amber glow, STK is so dark in spots that the candles on tables have to double as flashlights, without which the menu is almost illegible. Servers are almost inaudible, at least on busy nights when the throbbing music is joined by the raised voices of a well-lubricated crowd. Is this a restaurant or a nightclub? In the meatpacking district, where STK fittingly makes its home, that's often a distinction without much of a difference. STK attempts to do for filets and T-bones what some of the city's Asian funhouses have done for sushi and spring rolls: turn them into edible accessories for a naughty expedition to the other side of midnight. It's two kinds of meat market in one. Porter House takes a more earnest approach. It marks the reemergence of Michael Lomonaco, the executive chef at Windows on the World until 9/11, and it inherits the space once inhabited by Jean-Georges Vongerichten's V Steakhouse. What's been done to that space is less a makeover than an exorcism. The designer Jeffrey Beers has cast out Mr. Vongerichten's bordello-chic décor in favor of warm woods, filament bulbs and cozy booths against the windows that face Central Park. While Mr. Vongerichten trotted out steak tartare brulée, Mr. Lomonaco keeps his raw hand-chopped beef torch-free. Of course most of the city's new steakhouses come with at least some kind of conceit, and Porter House follows suit, making good on its name by presenting what it liberally calls porterhouse cuts of not only beef but also veal, pork, lamb and monkfish, which is served on the bone and wrapped in pancetta. In all of these instances, the kitchen turned out well-sourced, well-prepared flesh, as it also did with a strip and a chili-rubbed rib-eye. They didn't argue for a special trip to Columbus Circle, but they made a strong bid for the attention of anybody working or playing in the area. With other dishes, Porter House ran into trouble. Rainbow trout, one of more than half a dozen seafood entrees, was overcooked and over-buttery. The wild berry glaze on slices of duck breast was much too sweet. And not many appetizers impressed me. A smoked beef-tongue salad was nervy and flavorful, but I've seldom had crab legs as mushy and flat-tasting as the ones here. The lobster in a bisque receded into the background, demonstrating the same timidity as the lobster in an over-dressed salad. Porter House goes proudly retro with desserts, including pineapple upside-down cake and, best of all, apple brown betty. Its wine list has a few nice surprises, like a lagrein from California that the restaurant's charming sommelier, Beth von Benz, described as ""purple-y"" in taste. She had that just right. STK's servers are actually a more impressive lot, in that they manage to remain upbeat and upright while transporting food through a maelstrom of bodies in the front dining area. They're luckier if they're working in the slightly calmer, less populous back, where circular white leather booths are set much too slickly into shiny black frames. I've never taken a spin inside a pimp's stretch limo, and now I don't need to. STK has more than a conceit. It has a signature image, emblazoned on glossy cards, and a motto. The image shows a vixen in a scarlet negligee. In one hand she clutches a hook with a raw chop; in the other, a gleaming cleaver. It's unclear whether she's emerged from the boudoir or the abattoir, but her idea of fun obviously involves meat. The motto, ""not your daddy's steakhouse,"" underscores an agenda at odds with that image: to feminize a macho tradition. (STK's idea of a feminist must be Pamela Anderson.) The restaurant lists steaks by size -- small, medium and large -- to accommodate restrained appetites. Restrained budgets don't receive as much consideration. Only one of the small steaks, a six-ounce skirt, is under $20. Almost every steak was crowned with half a cherry tomato, which evoked the cherry on a sundae, and some steaks were pretty good. Others strayed far from requested cooking temperatures -- just one sign of a kitchen prone to sloppiness. Had the peas in an appetizer of scallops been frozen, and had they not yet fully thawed? Had someone spilled lemon juice over the iceberg with blue cheese, which had an overbearing tartness? There was harmless foolishness (foie gras French toast, anyone?) and there were missed opportunities, like a cold seafood platter on which nothing -- not clams, not shrimp -- rose above the ordinary. But the restaurant redeemed itself somewhat with a thick-cut, juicy rack of lamb, and the shallots and ginger that snuggled up to duck breast were a shrewd departure from fruity sidekicks. The desserts, in particular an elegant riff on a classic s'more, lifted my spirits. By that point, though, my ears were ringing and my voice was hoarse. STK might want to think about buying some soundproofing, along with a vowel.

343,Jean Georges,Four Stars,20060419,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/19/dining/reviews/the-steady-center-of-an-expanding-universe.html,"WHEN Jean Georges opened along the northern curve of Columbus Circle in 1997, Jean-Georges Vongerichten had only three other full-fledged restaurants, two in New York and one in London. It wasn't exactly a modest portfolio, but it was certainly a manageable one. And as admirers applauded Mr. Vongerichten's new establishment -- intended, and embraced, as his most serious culinary showcase -- they felt no need to qualify their ardor with concern that he was spreading himself thin. Fast-forward nine years. His reach extends west to Las Vegas, south to the Bahamas, east to Shanghai. It encompasses 16 restaurants, and the count would be higher if one of the three places he opened in 2004 alone hadn't been such a patently foolish miscreant. V Steakhouse disappeared quickly from the Time Warner Center, its rightful death attended by few tears but many troubling thoughts. Was Mr. Vongerichten trading exacting standards for easy money? Was fame getting the best of him, and leaving the worst for us? Can an artist morph into an industry and hold on to the magic that made it all happen? These questions inform any visit to Jean Georges, and they have relevance beyond this one great restaurant and this one great chef, because his trajectory parallels those of so many culinary titans. Dividing the attention he once reserved for the French Laundry in California, Thomas Keller peddles haute tuna sandwiches under a Samsung sign in the Time Warner Center. Wandering far from Babbo, Mario Batali travels the country to hawk cookware and hang with Nascar drivers. Mr. Vongerichten's frequent flier account no doubt puts each of theirs to shame. So if the restaurant Jean Georges holds up, there's hope for all the others, and we needn't reflexively despair whenever we watch our favorite chefs speed from their kitchens to the studios of the Food Network. I made my recent visits to Jean Georges with some trepidation, instilled by disappointing experiences at Jo Jo, Vong and other restaurants in Mr. Vongerichten's sprawling empire. That fear was tempered by happier times at Perry St., which he opened in the West Village last year. And it began to vanish as soon as the amuse-bouches appeared. A crab beignet was a cascade of sensations. First came the coolness and gentle sweetness of strands of peekytoe crab, bound with béchamel, coated with panko, and fried. Then came a sliver of pineapple's more pointed sweetness and slight acidity. And then, fast on their heels, the heat of pink peppercorn, but only for an instant. Mr. Vongerichten loves this sort of dance, in which one effect often defers so quickly to another that it seems like a memory almost as soon as it's experienced. He isn't seeking a seamless blend; he wants each sensation to have its say without overstating its case -- to frame, tame and joust with the other players. A parsnip soup that was served as another amuse on another night was laced with chipotle, the heat of which slowly intensified in my mouth but then receded as I caught the tartness of Meyer lemon juice. There was brilliant choreography behind a dish of Japanese snapper sashimi. The lusciousness of the fish was brightened by the sweetness of sliced muscat grapes, which was in turn offset by a buttermilk vinaigrette's faintly sour notes. Mixed into the dressing or sprinkled onto the fish was a bevy of herbs and spices, including mint, tarragon, basil and Thai chili, each of which registered a fleeting, teasing impression. The proportions were precise. The results were dazzling. In a fantastically nuanced dish of crisp-skinned Arctic char, different dimensions held sway at different moments, the lemon syrup beneath the fish briefly taking control, the caramelized jalapeño in a wash of olive oil around the fish insisting on a turn, the caramelized porcini mushrooms and garlic in the oil ready to fill in any gaps. Many of Mr. Vongerichten's most distinctive dishes trade the richness of traditional French cooking for a different kind of intensity -- for example, the earthy fragrance of chanterelles and shitakes that filled the air when a server poured a ""wild mushroom tea"" tableside. The flavors of this broth were as potent as its aroma, and it harbored unexpected currents: the saltiness of grated Parmesan, the tartness of lime zest. He jettisons thick sauces and embraces oils and broths, preferring them for their lightness and for the way they release their scents, like the perfume of lemon grass that rose from a bath of Asian herbs and seeds around a delicately baked lobster tartine. It's a dish he has been doing for quite some time, and Jean George's detractors complain that the restaurant is bereft of fresh ideas. They say that nothing happening here today -- not the studied deployment of a world's worth of spices; not the focus on smell; not the calibration of sweetness, tartness and heat -- represents a significant advancement of what was happening at the start, when the restaurant received four stars from Ruth Reichl in The New York Times. True enough. But while the food at Jean Georges may no longer be novel, it still thrills, and this restaurant still presents an experience unlike others around town. Mr. Vongerichten may not be spending as many hours in its kitchen as he once did, but the team he has put in place -- led by Mark Lapico, the chef de cuisine -- masterfully executes timeless recipes that have little margin for error. There was a riveting precariousness to the equilibrium of some dishes. An initial bite of caramelized sweetbreads with a chestnut glaze and shavings of black truffle was slightly cloying. But a subsequent bite, with more truffle, was exquisite. From then on I took greater care with each forkful, determined to make it count. A goat cheese royale commanded similar focus. It was layered horizontally with a beet marmalade and a band of roasted Sicilian pistachios: white, red and green. Too much of any one stripe meant a richness or a nuttiness out of whack. So I made sure the colors mingled thoroughly, and the effort paid off. Eating is seldom this absorbing, this bracing. To lend needed excitement to beef tenderloin, some foie gras had been placed on top. But the crucial, less predictable flourish was a rhubarb foam on top of that. It cut the fattiness of the liver. It snapped the palate to attention. So did a wedge of cured lemon that was strategically placed alongside broiled squab and foie gras in another dish. Sometimes Mr. Vongerichten's tendency to issue tart wake-up calls went too far. The dressing for a dish of raw bluefin tuna, avocado and radishes tasted too strongly of vinegar. Sometimes he erred on the side of sweetness. He let mango run roughshod over butter-poached lobster, the flesh of which was sweet enough. But those are minor quibbles, and so is this: The presentation of dessert at Jean Georges feels gimmicky. A diner chooses a theme (chocolate, for example, or citrus or honey-nut) and out comes a square plate with four chambers containing four meditations on the theme. Each of these desserts-within-dessert is plenty complicated on its own, a testament to the ambition and creativity of the pastry chef, Johnny Iuzzini. Taken together, they're overkill. But they signal a playfulness and a give-good-value populism that are central to Jean George's special niche. After all these years, it remains the most relaxed of New York's premier French restaurants, providing the requisite petits fours without the usual pompousness, the epic wine list without the oppressive décor. The service carts are so small and simple they're barely noticeable. Servers have subdued demeanors that tilt more often toward aloofness (something Mr. Vongerichten needs to monitor) than toward obsequiousness. The dining room's big windows, Central Park glimpses and unobtrusive palette of beiges and grays give it an airiness that other fancy restaurants don't have. That ambience complements the cleanness of much of the cooking. It suits and serves the goal of accessible elegance, of classic French indulgence with a contemporary flair. Jean Georges was built on a coherent vision, smart decisions and earnest execution. Those qualities may be missing elsewhere in the Vongerichten empire, but they're still here.

351,Da Silvano,One Star,20060927,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/27/dining/reviews/to-be-seen-and-perhaps-to-eat.html,"I HAVE a bone to pick with Madonna. With Tom Hanks and Danny DeVito as well. All three have vouched unreservedly for the restaurant Da Silvano, filling its guest book with pithy testimonials, which also made their way into a Da Silvano cookbook. ""Bravo!"" proclaimed Mr. Hanks. (His exclamation point, not mine.) ""Bellissimo!"" raved Mr. DeVito. (Again, his exclamation point.) Madonna, in a less exclamatory mood, said, ""Yummy yummy."" She's always been such an eloquent lyricist. Celebrities love Da Silvano. Many regular folks love Da Silvano. Even some self-regarding gastronomes whose opinions I respect love Da Silvano, and I have to wonder if any of them has had anything like the chicken liver crostini I sampled on the first of several recent visits. They tasted like pet food -- or, rather, how I imagine it would taste. On that same night I was assaulted by the osso buco, at once overcooked and over-flabby, with nightmarishly liquefied marrow. While the excavation of marrow always calls for a narrow instrument, that instrument shouldn't have to be a straw. What were Tom, Danny and Madge thinking, or eating? And why was this restaurant so packed? Those questions tugged me back to Da Silvano, and my return visits did indeed yield answers, by which I mean dishes that crossed the yummy threshold and even, in some cases, made me want to exclaim. ""A revelation!"" That's an honest description of the plump rabbit, uncommonly tender and perfumed with rosemary, that I had there. ""Just like in Italy!"" That's a fair tribute to the buffalo milk mozzarella, among the best in the city. It had a dead-on degree of the oxymoronic sweet sourness that this cheese is all about. It was texturally weepy in the right way -- a little, not a lot. And if you order it with Da Silvano's exemplary prosciutto and make bites that combine a bit of each, you yourself might be moved to tears. Perhaps more than any New York restaurant I know, Da Silvano illustrates the occasional futility of summary judgments, the mind-boggling inconsistency that can exist across the breadth of a menu and a series of visits. Although those of us in the criticism business like to talk in sweeping, definitive terms, many establishments resist such reduction. In particular, many establishments like Da Silvano do. The context of my visits was a mini-survey of Italian restaurants that are neither proudly hokey red-sauce joints nor stylized, self-conscious destinations. I was curious about long-running restaurants that combined classicism or rusticity with lofty prices and currency on Page Six. I went to Il Mulino, where half the food was fantastic, half not. To Il Cantinori -- so pleasant in some ways, so forgettable in others. Da Silvano had the craziest full-throttle energy (just try to have a whispery conversation there) and the oddest service, which could truly be called familial, inasmuch as it was equal parts loving and forgetful, teasing and chiding. ""This is disgusting,"" said a server one night as he swooped in to sweep away all the crumbs I'd created by going bonkers with the nicely salty and crunchy foccacia. I apologized for being and leaving such a mess. ""It's not your fault,"" he said. ""It's the bread's."" Da Silvano, which received two stars in The New York Times from Ruth Reichl in 1998, has been around for more than three decades. Over that time it has evolved from a trailblazing showcase for unadorned Tuscan cooking to something of a downtown Elaine's, with a proprietor, Silvano Marchetto, practiced at coddling stars and manufacturing his own luster. A cartoon illustration of his face is stamped on the restaurant's water bottles and pepper grinders. The look of the restaurant never changes all that much. With the rough-surfaced yellow walls in some rooms, the exposed brick in others and the romantic lighting, you can easily imagine yourself in some far-away trattoria. Of course, you're on a busy stretch of lower Sixth Avenue, but the sidewalk outside Da Silvano is broad enough to permit many appealing outdoor tables that aren't awash in exhaust fumes. And to my surprise, the servers seemed relatively egalitarian in distributing those tables. The menu never changes much, either. Pasta dishes include such stalwarts as tagliatelle alla Bolognese (the sauce tasted suspiciously off), spaghettini puttanesca (respectable) and penne arrabbiata (ditto). My favorite was taglierini contadina: narrow, flat noodles with crumbled sausage, peas, cream and tomato, coexisting in blissful harmony. Entrees include roasted pork shoulder (flavorful enough to rise above a surfeit of salt), vitello tonnato (hugely flavorful despite leathery meat), a breaded veal chop (too oily), and a variety of seafood (surprisingly good, given fish's delicacy and the kitchen's proneness to error). On the strength of the panzanella (a cold bread salad with tomatoes and roasted peppers), the eggplant parmigiana and an antipasti spread of eggplant, asparagus, peppers and the like, I'm tempted to say that Da Silvano offers safe passage to anyone who maintains vegetal bearings. But I can't forget the bitterness of fava beans, served with pecorino, or the rubbery disgrace of the overcooked broccoli put before a friend who had in fact ordered cauliflower. So just what is Da Silvano? A serious restaurant of simple pleasures, or an atmospheric, adrenaline-charged mill for expensive bistecca alla Fiorentina, which was sadly ordinary? How can the stars gush so unequivocally about it? I reached out. Madonna was working in Japan and unavailable for comment, her publicist said. But Sarah Jessica Parker, who once scribbled her ""love"" of the food, stood by that statement, saying in an e-mail message that she used to go there weekly and order artichokes, linguine with clams (""never grew bored"" of it, she said) and whatever pasta was being served with seasonal truffles. As it happens, the linguine with clams and bottarga that I had at Da Silvano was lovely. The same went for taglierini with cream and summer truffles. So maybe I really don't have any quibble with the celebs. Maybe they just don't wander as blindly through as much of the menu as some of the rest of us do. Da Silvano  * [Rating: One Star]  260 Avenue of the Americas (Houston Street), Greenwich Village; (212) 982-2343. ATMOSPHERE -- A rambling series of rustic rooms with brick and rough-surfaced yellow walls, along with a sprawling sidewalk cafe.  SOUND LEVEL -- Out of control.  RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Panzanella salad; broccoli rabe with grilled sausage; buffalo milk mozzarella with prosciutto; house antipasti mix; taglierini contadina; linguine with clams and bottarga; rabbit; ""bongo bongo"" dessert puffs with chocolate sauce.

355,Peels,★,20101102,Sam Sifton,East Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/03/dining/reviews/03rest.html,"PEELS is a new venture from the alley-cat downtown scene makers behind Freemans on the Lower East Side, Taavo Somer and William Tigertt. It sits glossy and white behind thickets of potted green plants on the corner of the Bowery and East Second Street, a two-story restaurant located at the axis of punk and prep, a Vampire Weekend house. The menu at Peels is vaguely Southern — fried chicken appears, along with shrimp and grits — but the South the restaurant invokes is really the one below Route 27 in Suffolk County, where identity is a matter of bank balance and there is no effective difference between artifice and fact. If you happen to be looking for somewhere to sit beside sleepy-eyed models not eating their oatmeal, or to talk over hamburgers and bourbon about how, if these wave reports are correct, you are definitely going to surf Montauk tomorrow, Peels is your restaurant. Just chain your Dutch bike to a streetlamp outside and stride on in for breakfast, lunch or dinner. The restaurant can even be enjoyable to the rest of us, though you may need to wait awhile for a table. Reservations are accepted only for parties of six or more. (Sleepy-eyed models don’t wait.) Peels was certainly excellent in the earliest days of fall, up there in the crowded second-floor dining room with its farm tables and distressed wood floors, its bare  white mansion  walls with flowers blooming here and there and the air outside on the Bowery pungent and heavy with exhaust. There was on the menu at the time one of the season’s best appetizers, a Baja salad of cut heirloom tomatoes, avocado and cotija cheese in a mild jalapeño vinaigrette. It was like a kiss that ends in a playful bite. Eaten with a plate of seared Montauk squid rings with Padrón peppers and cilantro beneath a bright run of lime, some hamburgers and a bottle of extremely pricey, extremely good St. Julien (all still available), it made for a delightful restaurant meal, the sort of night that makes New York better than anywhere. But to stray from those simple parameters is to court trouble. The magic is fleeting. The menu at Peels is not so stacked with excellence that it can withstand the loss of that salad. And anyway, expensive Bordeaux is  a game to play only with friends who have made partner, who offer to treat. You need to be careful at Peels. It’s a dance with Daisy Buchanan, there. At dinner, appetizers offer  the best eating. Andouille corn dogs in a sweet corn batter are a delight, happily greasy beneath a dab of Dijon mustard sauce. (This is restaurant food now?) A salty, rich trout spread is even better, though there aren’t many “market vegetables” to go along with it on the appetizer plate, and the deficit can leave a diner feeling as if he is at a poorly planned housewarming party. A platter of ham from  Burgers’ Smokehouse in Missouri provides a different reaction: a lover’s postcard, sent from the Ozarks. (The Romaine Holiday salad, with buttermilk dressing and bacon, meanwhile, reads more like Dear John.) The entrees, however, are a mess, and have been cycling in and out of favor, most egregiously as a “crispy pulled pork” dish, gone now, that put the lie to both adjectives. There is that hamburger, served in a good, cheap, spongy bun with a cap of cave-aged cheddar, pickles and thick, excellent French fries. But fried chicken has a dull, monochromatic taste, a crispness free of salt, an interior free of sweet. (“It’s fresh-killed,” reported a waitress, as if to explain.) It comes with boiled corn reminiscent of the Coney Island boardwalk, and a whopping big slice of watermelon that tastes, in contrast, as if fashioned by magic. Braised lamb shank with mescal and mole, meanwhile, offers slow-cooker shank meat in a tame mole sauce that works best as a bath for its accompanying beans. The mescal may be in there somewhere, a hint of funk, but what is present collapses beneath the weight of the meat, and in the dry chalkiness of some charred onions strewn across the top of the dish. The restaurant’s steaks are taken off grass-fed cattle, and butchered to the thickness of a Frisbee. This is a grim combination, leading to giant flaps of crust-free, overly chewy meat the flavor of nickels. Most people cut bits off, then push the rest around the plate as if it were a pile of napkins. At $45 for a rib-eye, this is a nasty business. Breakfast, though, can offer some satisfaction, especially for those who avail themselves of the build-a-biscuit menu option, in which you can layer proteins and fats above the starch: scrambled eggs with sausage and pepper-jack cheese, for instance, tastes on its airy, salty host as if it had risen in a Mississippi dawn. It makes you want to hunt ducks. Waffles are cloying, too soda-rich to be anything more than a nod to childhood appetites. (Good luck getting an actual child to eat one, even after a good long pour from the beautiful glass log cabin bottles the restaurant uses for maple syrup.) But the oatmeal is tiptop and nutty, and the grits and shrimp, with bits of bacon and a soft, luscious egg, are a treat. (This dish is also available at lunch and dinner.) So, too, is a selection of pastries, sweet breads and muffins. Best of all, perhaps, is a simple glass jar of thick Greek yogurt and tarry granola, with fruit compote. In stark and welcome contrast to most New York restaurants, Peels serves complimentary sparkling water instead of $12 bottles of the stuff. It is simply gassed-up filtered New York tap water, and in a just world that would explode as a trend. Regardless, it is an ideal accompaniment to that yogurt, at least when alternated with hits of Stumptown coffee at one of the comfortable diner stools on the restaurant’s first floor. It is something to sit down there reading the paper in the damp musk of an East Village morning as reggae plays and a waitress with chipped nail polish and the effortless beauty of a young woman in a Heaney poem glides around pouring refills. The aesthetic of the room is warm and welcoming, a diner put into a home, perhaps the kitchen at Hyannis Port. It is for this feeling that we go to restaurants.

357,Crown,★,20120131,Pete Wells,Upper East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/01/dining/crown-nyc-restaurant-review.html,"IT looked as if fireflies had been released into the dining room. Pale yellow flames swayed from squat white candles on white linen. Taller tabletop oil lamps flickered behind black shades, and more black shades hid the low bulbs of wall sconces. Other candles, as fat as oak branches, guttered from the carved limestone fireplace. All around, displayed like portraits against the wood paneling, were the residents of the East 80s, confident that for as long as their dinner at Crown lasted, the tiny flames and gentle wattage and dark lampshades would conspire to cast them and their jewelry in the kindest possible light. Then a firefly would flash in a corner of the room and the portraits would be thrown into relief: a row of identical teeth, hair with an amethyst tint, an unyielding tightness in the flesh around the eyes. A pity, that light, but to order one must at least glance at the menu, and at Crown the caviar and oysters and foie gras and dry-aged sirloin are all written in a spindly font that is not easy to make out, particularly by people whose 40th birthday was celebrated in a previous century. And so, whenever a table contemplated dinner, phones would come out, their flashlight apps trained on the italic type. Happily, these bouts of illumination rarely lasted more than a minute or two. The menu, while generous, did not demand prolonged study. One did not need to get bogged down in the fine print and wonder what Calabrian chile, acetorium Barolo vinegar or horseradish lardo might be. One could simply select a protein, and trust the restaurant not to pull any tricky stuff. This was a safe strategy, because the kitchen, in the steady hands of John DeLucie, Jason Hall and Ted Rozzi, has no intention of frightening anyone. Mr. DeLucie, the chef and proprietor, has cheerfully called his cooking here “comfort food for millionaires.” (And for their pets; the kitchen once prepared a côte de boeuf for a regular’s dog.) For that job, few are more qualified than Mr. DeLucie, whose contributions to gastronomy include a $55 truffled macaroni and cheese he made when he was the chef at the Waverly Inn. Before it was reduced to handing out reservations on OpenTable, that restaurant operated as something close to a private club. Crown is more like a public dining room for locals who’ve given the cook the night off. Before 8 p.m., families eat wordlessly, girls ballerina-straight, boys slumped in their blazers, parents plodding their way through a cozy Burgundy. Crown opened just after Labor Day, and already everyone looks as if they have been coming here forever. Whether you should join them is a question of what you expect when dinner for two runs about $200 before the first drop of wine is poured. You will not get your first taste of sea buckthorn airlifted from Denmark, nor a plate of prosciutto from a boar the chef tracked and killed with a homemade crossbow. Like the work of the best Upper East Side caterers, most of the cooking at Crown is agreeably dull, with occasional pockets of excellence amid some patches of unalloyed boredom. The menu can deflect attention at times, particularly in the appetizer department, where in January every offering except a squash soup was meant to be served cold. Would you like to begin with a wild mushroom salad, a shellfish salad or a regular green salad? In the end, there are really only two kinds of things to eat at Crown, concessions for dieters and rewards for carnivores. In fact the menu could have been printed in two shades of ink: Valentino red for the tuna niçoise and organic chicken; Brooks Brothers blue for the rack of lamb and dry-aged Delmonico sirloin. The carnivores walk away happier, naturally. They may have begun with a disk of chopped raw dry-aged beef, wonderful to chew on as it offers up its secrets: now a crackle of sea salt, now a rustle of black truffle. Or better yet, a plate of hand-cut pasta squares in a suave white Bolognese perked up by dried chile and crunchy toasted hazelnuts. In another neighborhood, these would be known as pasta handkerchiefs. But here, a block east of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, they are silk handkerchiefs. Beef tortellini, though, were virtually uncooked one night. From here the carnivore could proceed to a highly satisfying rack of lamb, with two massive ribs over braised shoulder of lamb, or to a reasonably good, if expensive, steak. For those who do not want to wield a steak knife, there are sheep-milk ricotta gnudi as weightless as if the dough had been whipped with helium. An eye-catching tartare of pink Tasmanian trout is seasoned so well it could stand up to that beef crudo. But life on the lighter side does not always end so well. Roast chicken with bacon and warm cabbage seems to be intended not for people who like the flavor of chicken but for those who aren’t aware it is supposed to have any flavor at all. The salad of ruby-red shrimp, razor clams, baby octopus and scallops is expertly cooked but gets little support from its lemony dressing and none at all from that Calabrian chili, which might as well have stayed in Calabria. Even carnivores can come in for trouble with, say, the tough, stringy roast duck, which feeds two grumbling people for $97. If details like that keep you away from Crown, though, there is much you would miss. You wouldn’t get to ask Jordan Salcito, the sommelier, what to drink, and watch her decide if you are looking for a genteel tour of the Côte de Beaune or an off-road adventure in Corsica or Lombardy. You’d never taste Heather Bertinetti’s desserts, especially her milk chocolate soufflé, and that would be a shame. You’d miss out, too, on a dirty Gibson shaken, not stirred, by a bartender more interested in remembering customers’ faces than in finding the latest root-vegetable bitters. You wouldn’t get to see a server in black evanesce at your side, Jeeves-like, leaning forward from the waist to hear your order, asking “May I clear that, miss?” and not, “Still working on that?” Most of all, you’d be missing a chance to listen to that quiet purr that you hear only when a restaurant and its audience understand each other perfectly."
359,Lowlife,★,20160322,Pete Wells,Lower East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/dining/lowlife-restaurant-review.html,"What a gnarled knot of warring impulses I feel about Lowlife. One minute, I want to stand on Stanton Street holding the door open while I give tips to diners on their way in: order the guinea-hen sausage, don’t miss the lamb tartare, above all eat the yakitori chicken. The next, I want to form a one-man human chain across the entrance and warn hungry people to go somewhere else. When I think about the best parts of this restaurant opened in November by Alex Leonard, the very talented chef, and Hugh Crickmore, the owner, I want to shake their hands. When I remember how much money I’ve spent there and how bizarrely pretentious the service can be, not just for the Lower East Side but for any neighborhood, I want to shake them by the shoulders until they come to their senses. Like many relationships that end in conflict, mine with Lowlife started in a happy rush of discovery. There was the smell of raw pine walls as soon as I walked in: invigorating. The wood gives the dining room the look of a sauna where people don’t sweat and keep their clothes on. I loved the sense of open space, too. Mr. Crickmore fought the urge to cover every inch of floor with seats. I could have stretched out my arms as I walked past a table of big men in black cowboy hats (how did they get here?) and along a long brown row of soft leather banquettes, beyond a bar and a framed cluster of birch trunks, to my seat at a kitchen counter. Just beyond was another cluster of tables, also spacious, also flanked by leather benches. The design is semi-Scandinavian, in the way of so many New York dining rooms lately, but it is not all frigid slanting-winter-light pallor. There’s some warmth. Then I sat facing the grill, and the scent of beef fat falling with a hiss on hardwood coals made some buried animal nerve in my skull hum to life. Mr. Leonard used to be the chef de cuisine at Blanca, the high-end tasting counter in Brooklyn where dry-aged meat is also cooked over white-oak charcoal from Japan. His menu bears other minimalist Blanca imprints. There are few empty gestures in his cooking; almost everything on the plate is there for a reason. First, I tried salty hackleback caviar and raw ribbons of fluke, flavored by the day or so it had cured between sheets of kelp; sitting in a coriander-seasoned broth, they made a delicious pair. I ate slowly, to stretch the time. I had ordered guinea hen, too, and was surprised to get a smooth, pale sausage wrapped in the hen’s browned skin to make a kind of weisswurst. Next to it were two sauces, one tan and yeasty, made with sourdough; the other dark and smoky, made from eggplant. This was some wonderful, subtle cooking. A rib-eye cap, fresh from the charcoal and running with juices, had so much flavor it didn’t really need the anchovy-and-garlic emulsion or the nettle sauce served alongside it. As I chewed, I watched a succession of even bigger hunks of rib-eye, bone and all, leave the grill for the front of the restaurant. Finally it dawned on me: The men in black hats must have heard that Lowlife serves excellent steak. What it does best of all is yakitori chicken. Cut up and blackened over charcoal, the bird has deep natural flavor and is brushed with a citrus-tinged glaze that is, by several miles, the best teriyaki sauce I have ever tasted. The squirt of green scallion sauce on the plate has nothing to do there and seems to know it. The crisp and smoky leaves of lightly charred cabbage are vital, though. As I said, it all started well. But on return visits, I noticed a leaden self-importance that began to feel stifling. I have never seen a restaurant clear dirty dishes the way Lowlife does. Two servers would flank the table. Each would reach in and remove a single knife at the same moment. Then one spoon each, again in synchrony. Then two forks would rise and disappear. Finally, two plates, now free of silverware, would be taken away, solemnly and ceremoniously, as if they had died fighting for their country. A bugler should have stood by, softly playing taps. Servers often talked with an affected tone that undermined the friendliness their smiles projected. One spoke about the coming meal as “the experience.” Dishes were “introduced,” as in, “Now I’d like to introduce you to your third course of the evening, our chicken.” Pleased to meet you, chicken. What do you say we make a run for the door? Fussiness this extreme would be out of place at Le Bernardin. At a Lower East Side restaurant where you listen to Kendrick Lamar, Stereolab and Ryan Adams while eating teriyaki chicken, it’s lunacy. The cost of a meal, while not quite insane, does suggest that Lowlife’s personality is not fully integrated. Servers will suggest three courses “if you are dinner-hungry,” as one put it. If I had ordered poached lobster and guinea-hen sausage, the two most expensive appetizers, and followed them with the rib-eye cap, I would have spent $94 before tax, tip and drinks. This doesn’t include dessert, either, although if I had attempted dessert after that meal, they would still be peeling my exploded carcass from the pine walls. Not that you would recognize the appetizers from looking at the menu, an uncategorized list. Servers have to explain that it is in ascending order of size. The smallest appetizer, a very good assemblage of trout roe, thick clotted cream and puréed beets, isn’t filling at all; the largest, the guinea hen, could make a light main course. Individually, the prices aren’t out of line compared with, say, Le Turtle, a nearby restaurant whose chef also cooked at Blanca. But add them up and they can cause squirming, especially on a night when the $120 bone-in rib-eye is lukewarm, or when the lag between courses is so long you could have eaten a whole meal somewhere down the street. If I did duck out, I would still try to make it back in time to finish with the almost-classical French apple tart painted with orange marmalade, or the unusual and appealing eucalyptus panna cotta, whipped into a froth. Warring impulses again, but then Lowlife suffers from them, too. The place wants to be cool; you can tell from the walls of one bathroom, where Allen Ginsberg’s inscribed photograph of Neal Cassady and Timothy Leary hangs across from a signed Joseph Beuys poster. But it’s hard to be cool when you’re trying to act important."
364,Xiao Ye,Fair,20101012,Sam Sifton,Lower East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/13/dining/13rest.html,"EIGHT in the evening at Xiao Ye, Eddie Huang’s new restaurant on Orchard Street on the Lower East Side, and hip-hop was bouncing off the black-painted walls of the long, narrow dining room. Young men and women ate dumplings and slurped noodles, drank Taiwanese beer. They talked smack about football and architecture, smartphones and music. Mr. Huang was one of them. He had strutted into the restaurant with a crew of friends and taken a table in the middle of the room, then pulled out his mobile device and started to text. There were employees cooking, and someone signaled to them. Soon they brought food. Mr. Huang alternated between eating it and stabbing at his phone. “I’m interested in the culture of eating,” he would write later on his blog. “I am not a chef.” Which sounds about right and is really too bad. Because if Mr. Huang spent even a third of the time cooking that he does writing funny blog posts and wry Twitter updates, posting hip-hop videos and responding to Internet friends, rivals, critics and customers, Xiao Ye might be one of the more interesting restaurants to open in New York City in the last few months. As it stands, though, Xiao Ye is an artful misfire: the sort of place that, as Mr. Huang sadly appears to desire it to be, is really only best when the customers are a little drunk, a little high, maybe both and in any event extremely hungry. His intentions are good. Xiao Ye translates from the Taiwanese as “midnight snack.” And the restaurant almost excels at serving those, fresh and well made, free of the taint of fast-food culture. Xiao Ye could almost be the right place to eat right now. You can get a bowl of Taiwanese pork on rice, the meat  —  luscious Duroc-breed pork  —  ground into an intensely flavored, almost mouth-numbing stew with soy sauce and five-spice powder, and realize that the notion of making classic late-night Asian snack food with good ingredients, without MSG, is a terrific one. Add a soundtrack of Danger Mouse and Jemini, a glass of bubble tea with Johnnie Black and it becomes a dish for repeating a few times a month, the sort of food that leads to later nights than you intended, long walks home. Xiao Ye serves top-drawer dumplings, open-ended and sweetly moist within, more of that ground Duroc pork combining with Napa cabbage to elevate the flavor exactly to its $8 cost. There are sometimes very good noodles  —  northern-Chinese-style zha jiang mien with yet more ground pork in  a perfect bean-paste sauce  —  though it is a dice-throw each time whether these will be mostly hot or kind of cold. There is an outstanding dish of General Tso-style prawns, with a sweet-fiery sauce that melds with rice into something approaching a new paradigm: a Chinese dish reinvented, then reinvented again. And the Hainan chicken with rice is beautifully flavored, tender and sweet. In Singapore, where “HCR” is close to a national dish, the debate over its makers often concerns the quality of the chili sauce that accompanies the dish and acts as paint for the chicken’s canvas. At Xiao Ye, the poles are reversed, and the chicken is the dominant taste. It’s remarkable. Xiao Ye should be the sort of restaurant to flock to after rock shows or on the way to them, a room sitting near the epicenter of Lower East Side culture. It should, as Mr. Huang has written, invoke St. Marks Place without the tourists. It should have that energy, that youth, that drive. And yet. Despite a capable and attractive floor staff of neighborhood waiters and fast-hands bartenders, and a clientele that seems willing and able to return to its doors, Xiao Ye does not always rise to meet our needs. It’s not just that the restaurant’s chef and owner is sitting in the middle of the room eating dinner alongside his customers. Cabbage said to have been steamed with garlic and chilies, then drizzled with lardo, tastes of cardboard and water, a school-lunch nightmare that is hard to shake. There are punishingly salty, barely pickled cucumbers. A beef rib braised into pale, flabby submission in a mixture of ginger beer, chilies and tomatoes might have been made by your college roommate in a borrowed Crock-Pot one night over winter break, then discarded in favor of Greek pizza from that place out by the discount liquor store. Speaking of: Xiao Ye’s melted mozzarella sandwich on grilled Pullman bread with ham, caramelized scallions and a thick swipe of gochujang, a fiery soy-based hot paste, might have been your college roommate’s idea as well, made in the toaster oven, then abandoned in favor of chicken wings from that other place out by the discount liquor store. A moist, fairly bland Cheeto-fried chicken (you read that correctly) arrives as sliced breast meat, white beneath its orange coat, with a marmalade dipping sauce that’s been hit with chilies, but not very hard: tiger-hued stunt food for the Princeton homecoming, perhaps. It’s amusing, but perhaps best ordered only by the visibly intoxicated. Mr. Huang has called some of these dishes “American-born Chinese diner food.” Perhaps. They are certainly not the Taiwanese snack food that he learned from his mother as a kid in Orlando, Fla., and then in part perfected at Baohaus, the excellent little sandwich shop he opened on Rivington Street in December 2009, where his gua bao, or steamed-bun sandwiches, crush comers from all directions in matters of flavor and value. These dishes come from an entirely different place from those sandwiches, and from a different place from a great deal of the Xiao Ye menu as well. They are more calculated, more desperate and far less interesting. More than this: they are a little dishonest. They aren’t diner food so much as what a talented Asian guy rooting around in the refrigerator for something funny to eat (or serve in his restaurant)  might call diner food. There’s gochujang on the grilled cheese. Instead of ketchup! Get it? These dishes have to go. The entire business plan for Xiao Ye boils down to a painted sign above the open door to the kitchen. It declares Mr. Huang’s intentions in the lingua franca of his age and upbringing. The sign makes fun of his background and forebears even as its creator celebrates both. “Dericious,” reads the script, a pidgin nod to what Mr. Huang wants his Xiao Ye to be. Those soft and ethereal dumplings qualify; so, too, the pork on rice and the Hainan chicken. There is some good fried tofu as well, and a marvelous shaved-ice dessert roughly the size of a breadbox. But if Mr. Huang really wants to stand for delicious, he is going to need to work harder. Because in the meantime?

365,Dovetail,★★★,20080220,Frank Bruni,Upper West Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/20/dining/reviews/20rest.html,"A WINTER that hadn’t slapped us around too much was suddenly in a hostile mood, gusting with snow as I trudged  —  skidded, really — five blocks from the subway to Dovetail, where hunched employees shoveled and shoveled some more in a doomed effort to keep the entrance clear. I expected an empty restaurant. That’s what happens when the going gets wet: diners trash their reservations, take out their delivery menus and hunker down for the duration with General Tso’s chicken. It’s the only practical response. But Dovetail isn’t about practicality, not with its rotating sherry list, its lamb’s tongue and its beef-cheek lasagne bedecked with king trumpet mushrooms. No, this restaurant is a bold wager that a patch of the Upper West Side with an unreliable  appetite for adventurous — even somewhat fussy — dining will embrace it, at least if it’s executed with skill and panache. And the bet seems to be paying off, because on that blustery night I encountered a dining room with  just about all of the 80 seats filled by 8:30. What a warm surprise. And what a testament to the intriguing, compelling work that John Fraser, Dovetail’s chef and principal owner, is doing here. Both he and his pastry chef, Vera Tong, come at their cooking with intellect and wit, but they seldom get too cerebral, too cute.  Leaving  quotation marks out of the titles of dishes, they leave it to you to make certain connections. There’s an appetizer that combines two of the most fashionable ingredients in upscale restaurants these days, seared pork belly and a slowly poached egg, and as soon as you taste them together, you smile at what’s afoot. It’s breakfast for dinner, only at breakfast the belly is smoked and called bacon. In one of the entrees, curls and chunks of lobster are scattered around monkfish, reminding you that this fish has often been cast as the poor man’s lobster, vaguely similar in texture but not nearly as sweet. So you find yourself not only enjoying but also comparing the two kinds of seafood. Then you notice some seared foie gras, which may or may not be another inspired bit of culinary free-association, inasmuch as monkfish liver has been presented as the foie gras of the sea. Is that the idea? Does it matter? Not really, because the dish works, its less and more opulent players establishing something along the lines of a  rhythm. And the real point is that such crafty plotting of a  composition seems entirely plausible, given the amount of energy Mr. Fraser lavishes on his dishes. The lamb’s tongue — breaded, fried and straight out of Mario Batali’s offal dreams — is part of a deconstructed muffuletta sandwich that includes olives, pimentos, a caper mayonnaise and a visually arresting spiral of salami, provolone cheese and more. That’s just an appetizer. The beef-cheek lasagne is among the entrees, but it’s essentially a side to unerringly salted slices of sirloin steak. Many chefs would be content to throw a potato gratin at the beef. For her part, Ms. Tong fashions  a nifty brioche bread pudding studded with a brittle made of bacon. It’s breakfast for dessert, only at breakfast the bread pudding takes the form of French toast. Mr. Fraser and Ms. Tong worked together at Compass, a restaurant that went through a changing cast of chefs, all saddled with its large scale and peculiar atmospherics. Dovetail, which opened in December, is a better fit for them, the simplicity of its brown palette, bare wood tables and exposed brick at once balancing out, and allowing you to focus on, the ambition of their food. The inconspicuousness of the restaurant’s entrance may be bonkers or in fact brilliant, a subtle signal of Dovetail’s confidence in its inner strength. The carpeting and padded walls in the back definitely make sense. They keep noise in check. Depending on where you sit, the restaurant can feel too plain for entrees that average above $30. The wines by the glass could be more exciting, and a few dishes don’t succeed, like an appetizer marriage of skate and chicken wings that’s inspired by semantics more than anything else. All of that  gives me concern about the possibility of a slightly disappointing dinner here. But most  of my experiences were hugely positive. Dovetail further strengthens its case with a nightly five-course tasting menu that’s kindly priced at $65. The Sunday prix fixe — three courses for $38 — is quite simply one of the best deals in town. And when I had it the options weren’t dreary second stringers. They included the restaurant’s gnocchi, flavor-bombed with veal short rib and foie gras butter, and a shrimp dish that resurrects hollandaise and makes you wonder why it fell out of vogue. At Dovetail it avoids its potentially gluey fate, and it’s offset by the sweetness and tartness of grapefruit segments. The shrimp are upgraded to scallops for the version of the dish on the à la carte menu on other nights. For the tasting menu on those nights, Mr. Fraser mixes things up anew, choosing ham, endive and kumquats as the scallops’ supporting cast. When I had that dish, the seafood was beautifully cooked, as was a yogurt-lapped lamb duo (leg and rack) and an autumnal treatment of tender venison with chestnut and yam. Did Mr. Fraser need both of those sidekicks for the venison? Sometimes he seems too eager to please, overworking dishes. But he’ll also pull back and trust in the basic, homespun pleasures of something like the buttery white Cheddar corn bread at the start of every meal. It’s the epitome of comfort, and a potent antidote to the coldest of winter nights."
368,DBGB Kitchen and Bar,★★,20091013,Sam Sifton,East Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/dining/reviews/14rest.html,"HEY, ho, let’s go! Daniel Boulud, one of our more gregarious and intelligent restaurateurs, a four-star chef for his Daniel on East 65th Street, owner of three other restaurants in Manhattan, two more in Vancouver, and one each in Las Vegas, Palm Beach and Beijing, has opened a sausage joint near the corner of the Bowery and Houston Street. It’s a mosh pit’s distance from the birthplace of American punk rock. He’s called it DBGB, a play on CBGB, the club at 315 Bowery that first brought the neighborhood underage kids with shaved heads  — and later its cachet. Once, this kind of nerve might have gotten his plate-glass windows smashed. (We ain’t got time for that now.) These days it brings middle-aged Bouluddites in town cars and sportswear to eat and drink beer, to talk gaily of the market, the Galliano show in Paris, the Astor verdict, Letterman. A cynic would call this fashion and scoff. But one bite of the crispy lamb ribs that were served in the bar area when the place first opened  — sweetly glazed, grassy meat, with a dab of creamy mint-flecked yogurt sauce  — ended all snark: Mr. Boulud has opened a very good restaurant. The lamb was sublime, earthy and spicy and rich, evidence of superb technique, the sort of snack that separates his empire from others in the celebrity firmament. Recent visits to all five of Mr. Boulud’s New York restaurants suggest: his kitchens put out perfectly cooked food. Diners may quibble here and there (with the sweetened cucumber juice in the Hendrick’s gin cocktail at Daniel, for instance), but rare is the complaint about technique. Jim Leiken, DBGB’s executive chef, a young veteran of Daniel and DB Bistro Moderne, is no exception. His food game, as they say in rap precincts, is tight. DBGB is not precisely a beautiful restaurant, though it bears masculine charms atop its cool concrete floors. There is that wide and open bar area, where the unreserved may sit and eat a slimmed-down version of the main room’s menu: a rich and beefy DBGB hot dog, for instance, and a beer. There are glass panels and mirrors everywhere, many printed with quotations of people whose culinary wisdom Mr. Boulud admires (Hemingway, Homer Simpson). Date-night couples and Wall Street irregulars abound. Beyond the bar, surrounded by industrial racks meant to evoke the Bowery’s other past as a restaurant supply district, is the dining room: tables and cocoa-brown booths running down a long rectangle in the manner of a train car parked in a station. And there are in fact restaurant supplies on display: bottles of wine, towers of glassware, boxes of spices and, along the partly open kitchen, stacks and stacks of gleaming white china. Above them is a burnished halo of worn copper kitchen pots and pans collected from chefs around the world and displayed as one might the gloves of great infielders. There is a chef’s table hidden behind the pastry station, where private parties are meant to observe the kitchen’s choreography as if they were dining backstage at New York City Ballet. They’re working as hard as dancers, in this kitchen. There are 18 appetizers on the menu and 13 sausages that play double duty as appetizers and mains. There are four entries listed under “têtes aux pieds” (excellent sticky bits from the head down to the feet: veal tongue, crispy tripe, bone marrow, pig’s trotter). A dozen more entrees and half as many side dishes, each done up as for a fancy-dress ball, round out the savory portion of the evening’s choices. An investigation of the entirety reveals it’s all pretty good. You might start with some of the items your men with the BlackBerrys order: an iceberg salad with heady blue cheese dressing, bacon and walnuts; or tuna tartare dressed in harissa-sesame sauce. Perhaps you’d like Mr. Leiken’s take on matzo-ball soup, an eccentricity on the menu that is nonetheless deeply satisfying. These are elegant enough for those interested in finishing with a modestly sized burger. Many are, their tastes already shaped by Mr. Boulud’s original 2001 foray into the burger wars, the extravagant sirloin burger at DB Bistro Moderne, stuffed then and now with braised short ribs, foie gras and truffles. Here the burger comes plain if you like, or topped with pork. The best option is the coarsely named Frenchie, which arrives as if a passenger on an old Cunard ship, with confitted pork belly, arugula, tomato-onion compote and a slab of Morbier, riding a peppered brioche bun with cornichons and mustard on the side. More food-obsessed mouths, however, will desire sausages. The boudin Basque, for instance, a disc of spicy blood and pig’s-head sausage served on top of a small pool of scallion-mashed potatoes, is a wonder, the sort of dish to convert those who quail at the thought of eating offal. The Vermont, meanwhile, a smoked pork link studded with Cheddar and served with hash browns and a red-onion crème fraîche, instantly legitimizes almost any combination of cheese and cased meat. It demands a subsequent order of the Viennoise, another pork link, this time cut with Emmenthaler and served aside housemade sauerkraut. The Toulouse? It’s stuffed with ground duck gizzards and garlic as well as the pork, on top of soft, perfect cassoulet beans. The chorizo Espagnole comes with a pipérade and basil oil; the Thai with green papaya, some basil fried rice, a tiny fried quail egg and a faint squirt of sriracha sauce. You may order two at a time as an entree, which can lead to unfortunate pairings. An excellent pan-roasted Italian sausage with slow-cooked fennel and tomato, for instance, went lame in the presence of fiery mint-cut Moroccan merguez. Really, you don’t need more than these. The entrees list  — “To Carry On,” in the menu’s parlance  — offers serious, Bouludish dishes that are almost too grown-up for the setting. DBGB’s excellent sweet-flavored pan-roasted Arctic char, for instance, would not be out of place on the menu at the recently renovated Café Boulud. Likewise a duo of lamb that sees a bit of roasted leg paired with elegantly braised shoulder and a musky garlic confit. A side dish of Vichy carrots, elegantly turned, would do well at the flagship shop. (Going the other way, it’d be nice to see the smoked cumin-spiced sausage on lentil stew that’s served at Bar Boulud available at, frankly, every Boulud restaurant on the planet.) Desserts take the diner to the silly, and to the sublime. Myriam Eberhardt, the pastry chef, supplies ice cream sundaes and smart takes on old favorites, as in her pear ice-cream sandwich, made with lemon ice cream (the pear’s in there, too, but as a sorbet) sandwiched between slices of rich, buttery shortbread and caramel sauce. If you’ve come to play hard, though, the best response is baked Alaska: vanilla, raspberry and verbena ice cream and a fresh meringue, set afire with Chartreuse. It tastes of France and America twinned. Back in 2002, with just (just!) three restaurants to his name, Mr. Boulud published a cookbook, written with Peter Kaminsky, “Cooking in New York City.” On the cover, Mr. Boulud stands in the middle of Park Avenue in his chef’s uniform, holding a loaded hot dog before him with what appears to be genuine pleasure. The photograph suggests what DBGB makes plain: Mr. Boulud’s great genius is to be absolutely true both to the training and the underlying flavors of his French childhood and to the joys and pressures of being a New York businessman, always on the run. He has made being French the most American thing about him. This makes for good restaurants. DBGB Kitchen and Bar ★★ 299 Bowery (Houston Street), East Village; (212) 933-5300.

370,Fiamma,★★★,20071128,Frank Bruni,SoHo,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/28/dining/reviews/28rest.html,"MORE than a few chefs have spent more than a little time trying to turn carpaccio into an intricate production that reflects and trumpets their ingenuity. At the restyled Fiamma in SoHo, Fabio Trabocchi joins the challenge in an original fashion. He wraps thinly sliced Australian wagyu beef around columns of tofu, which support a crunchy Parmesan tuile and, over that, a teetering quail egg. On a long, thin rectangular plate he lines up three of these delicate towers, interspersed with ovals of wagyu tartare that wear caps of chopped mushrooms and Parmesan. Is it carpaccio? Sort of. But not really. And so what? It’s crazily enjoyable, and that’s what counts. Mr. Trabocchi relishes the finer fowls and isn’t inclined to let them be, so both roasted poussin and roasted wild Scottish pheasant come with fatty lobes of foie gras. The dark sauces pooling beneath the meat have an almost staggering richness. Would you find these entrees in Italy, even up north? Maybe, in a very fussy restaurant. In most others, no. And who cares? They’re prepared with finesse and they’re the definition of luxury, no matter the geography, no matter the language. Since Mr. Trabocchi took over the kitchen at Fiamma in September, much of the response to his cooking has been perplexed, centering on questions of nomenclature and ethnic fidelity. Can a lasagna with as little sunshine and as much stormy intensity as Mr. Trabocchi’s justly call itself lasagna? And can a restaurant with food as ornate, saucy and creamy as Fiamma’s rightly call itself Italian? That’s a chewy topic for debate, and I cast my vote this way: Fiamma is about as Italian as a poodle in a Prada scarf. It owes its accessories — the olive oil, the balsamic vinegar, many of the cheeses (fontina, burrata, ricotta salata) — to Italy. It owes its classically indulgent soul to France. It owes apologies and explanations to no one. When a restaurant turns out this many dishes that make you stop mid-chew, nudge a companion and nod your head vigorously — because you’re excited; because you need to start working off the calories any way you can — it needn’t worry about fitting into a tidy box. Fiamma has been around since 2002, when William Grimes gave it three stars in The Times, solidifying its reputation as the lone thoroughbred among the many New York workhorses that belong to the restaurateur Stephen Hanson. He also owns multiple branches of Ruby Foo’s and Dos Caminos. But in a shakeup this year that has turned out well for the city’s gastronomes, Fiamma’s chef, Michael White, decamped to the restaurants Alto and L’Impero, both of which are turning out distinguished food. And Mr. Hanson lured Mr. Trabocchi from Maestro, a restaurant near Washington, D.C., where he had established himself as one of the most dazzling chefs around the nation’s capital. Mr. Hanson also spruced up the SoHo town house the restaurant inhabits, giving it not so much a new look as a fresh glow. The main, second-floor dining room, with its warm colors of orange and red, nimbly splits the difference between elegance and unceremonious comfort. Elegance is getting extra attention these days. Previously called Fiamma Osteria, the restaurant has lost the second word, which evoked informality. (The remaining word is Italian for flame.) And there’s a fanciful array of new plates and cutlery, meant to cast the food they showcase in an artistic light. That food is indeed artistic but seldom precious, the key to its success. Mr. Trabocchi delivers bold, resonant flavors; if anything he goes overboard with them, making you wish there were a more varied rhythm to his meals. He comes out swinging and goes constantly for the knockout punch. An appetizer of various cuts of rabbit includes leg meat stuffed with prosciutto. The Romanesco broccoli around it is sautéed with guanciale. And the broccoli purée beneath everything includes a generous dose of rabbit jus. Take a deep breath. You’ve got at least two courses —and maybe more — to go. Although Mr. Trabocchi produces terrific gnocchi in way that uses less flour, he offsets their lightness with a goat ragù that, like so many of his sauces, has the kind of haunting intensity a laboriously made reduction does. He takes flour, too, out of what might otherwise be a béchamel for the lasagna. What does he leave in? Well, a reduction of chicken stock and cream, which is layered with noodles and with a ragù of veal sweetbreads, chicken livers, chicken gizzards, prosciutto and more. Around the lasagna goes veal jus. And chanterelle mushrooms, for some additional dark magic. For Mr. Trabocchi, more is more. He puts poached bone marrow on a saffron-flavored risotto. He puts fried bread crumbs on a whole lot, including monkfish liver and, separately, thick-cut, gorgeous Dover sole. He puts crushed Alba hazelnuts, sautéed in butter, on top of braised veal cheeks, which accompany a hunk of roasted veal rib-eye. There’s nuance in the mix, the tofu in the newfangled carpaccio providing one example. It lends volume, shape and a chewy element to the silky beef without muffling its flavor. And what you find on impeccably roasted rack of lamb isn’t rosemary but nepitella, an Italian herb that does the work of mint in a less assertive manner. Mr. Trabocchi scatters such surprises throughout a meal, and he scatters luxuries, too: black and white truffles; porcini mushrooms; sea urchin (in a dish of spaghetti); langoustine (as an amuse-bouche). In the context of that, and of Fiamma’s lofty prices, it’s a happy shock to find a wine list with dozens of bottles under $50 and scores under $75. And they’re interesting wines, from more countries than Fiamma’s list previously represented. The desserts by Thomas Wellings, the pastry chef, tend to be fastidiously composed. My favorite was a so-called salad of roasted pears and pine nuts, accompanied by ice cream flavored with Corbezzolo honey, from the nectar of a shrub found in northern Italy. The shrub’s provenance, I suppose, makes the dessert Italian. I’ll certainly go along with that, provided I get a second serving. Fiamma *** 206 Spring Street (Sullivan Street), SoHo; (212) 653-0100.

372,A Voce,Three Stars,20060510,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/10/dining/reviews/popular-act-now-solo-sings-italian.html,"DURING his six years at Café Boulud, the chef Andrew Carmellini achieved something remarkable. Although the restaurant bore the last name of one of New York's most celebrated culinary figures, Daniel Boulud, and Mr. Carmellini was technically his on-site surrogate, its many fans came to see it as Mr. Carmellini's place. They gave him the credit, along with their trust. It was just a matter of time before the right financial backers beckoned and Mr. Carmellini struck out on his own. The only real question was what shape that venture would take. Would it be French and somewhat fussy? Mr. Carmellini had as much of that as of anything else in his background. Before Café Boulud, he worked at Lespinasse and Le Cirque. Would it strain for invention and strut for attention? Still in his early 30's, Mr. Carmellini was young enough to dream showy dreams and old enough, in the context of the restaurant business, to want to make his boldest mark sooner rather than later. But his solo debut, A Voce, which means ""word of mouth"" and is generating plenty of it, doesn't fit either of those descriptions. It's Italian, a nod to Mr. Carmellini's ancestry. Many of its dishes have a rustic bent -- they're as likely to arrive in terra cotta bowls or copper pots as on preciously shaped plates. And most of them are intended above all else to make you happy, which they do -- very happy. Mr. Carmellini cares more about robust flavors than about clever conceits. In that way A Voce really isn't such a departure from Café Boulud. The idiom has changed, but not the sensibility, not the premium on sating diners as opposed to wowing them. Not the fondness for duck, either. Duck doesn't get as much play in Italian cooking as in French, but Mr. Carmellini isn't about to let a good bird go unplucked, and so he finds several terrific uses for it. In addition to glazing duck meat for a relatively conventional entree, he grinds it and mixes it with foie gras and pork to make unforgettable meatballs, which are listed at the bottom of the appetizers but rank at the very top. He turns again to duck for his richest pasta dish, an absolute knockout. He braises the leg meat and then folds it, along with some egg and Parmesan, into the center of agnolotti. He covers the agnolotti with a creamy foie gras sauce and then, over that, in dozens of impossibly narrow stripes, layers a glaze made with vin cotto and balsamic and red wine vinegars. The sweetness and slight acidity of the glaze are classic foils for the liver, and they work precisely the magic they're meant to. Mr. Carmellini and A Voce are just as deft at, and put even more stock in, less traditionally luxurious, simpler pleasures. Apart from the duck meatballs, the appetizers I sampled were more or less plainspoken affairs: salads that underscored the season; thinly sliced wisps of prosciutto with pickled vegetables; gorgeous asparagus decorated with first-rate Parmesan, bits of truffle and a fried egg; imported sheep's milk ricotta whipped into a state of sublime creaminess and seasoned with nothing more than salt, pepper, thyme and olive oil. Beyond the duck agnolotti, most of the pasta dishes didn't boast unusually fancy pedigrees. The glories of house-made pappardelle were the impeccable consistency of the lamb Bolognese, neither clumpy nor runny, that topped the noodles and the deployment of that terrific ricotta in the right measure, so that it asserted itself without taking command. Mr. Carmellini's appetite for heartiness is hitched to an almost unerring sense of proportion. A spaghetti dish advertised with deceptive succinctness -- the menu said only ""local ramps, American speck, Parmesan"" -- turned out to be a vaguely creamy, slightly eggy riff on a carbonara. But it was a relatively guiltless carbonara at that, a light shawl, not a leaden cloak. The ramps further cut its richness, and their presence reflected a commitment to seasonal ingredients that defines the entire menu. The selection of entrees -- or more precisely, their prices -- contained a few puzzling surprises. I'd argue that a restaurant serving chicken cacciatore for $23 and putting it in one of those clay bowls shouldn't be doing a $110 rack of veal for two. On the menu I saw a figure of $55, didn't examine it closely and, until the bill arrived, didn't realize it was per person. All in all, the pricing of dishes -- some strikingly reasonable, some much less so -- didn't add up. And the setting doesn't really go with the food. Mr. Carmellini and his partners made a laudable decision not do the obvious and indulge in rustic shtick. But when you look at A Voce's green leather tabletops, swiveling Eames chairs and cold contemporary art, including towers of what look like Lincoln logs bathed in orange light, you may well conclude they traveled much too far in the opposite direction. The comfort of those broad, deep chairs is potent consolation. An expansive covered patio, expected to open soon, will provide a less stylized -- and, crucially, less noisy -- option for seating. And then, of course, there's Mr. Carmellini's cooking. If April Robinson's fittingly straightforward desserts (bombolini, chocolate amaretti cake) are a bit of a letdown, it's because she has such a tough act to follow. It's because of his fantastic gnocchi, the size and texture of miniature marshmallows, in a sauce of spring peas with crunchy bits of pancetta. It's because of his rigatoni, tossed not just with broccoli rabe and pecorino but also with pale, tender balls of ground pork loin, shoulder and pancetta. It's because of his beautifully steamed black bass, surrounded in its copper pot by fava beans, English peas and Manila clams, their open shells containing an additional treat: meatballs made with shrimp. For his inevitable next venture, maybe Mr. Carmellini, now 35, should consider an all-meatball restaurant. I wouldn't put it past him. And I wouldn't want to miss it. A Voce  *** [Rating: Three Stars]  41 Madison Avenue (entrance on 26th Street); (212) 545-8555. ATMOSPHERE -- A stylized contemporary dining room with leather tabletops and swivel chairs contradicts often simple, hearty Italian cooking. Expansive outdoor seating to come soon.

376,Casa Enrique,★★,20190129,Pete Wells,Long Island City,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/dining/casa-enrique-review.html,"New York used to be a one-mole town, and that was mole poblano. A chocolate-colored, bittersweet agglomeration of two dozen or so ingredients, it comes, like most of the city’s Mexican immigrants, from the state of Puebla. Typically simmered with chicken, mole poblano was a staple of takeout joints and lunch counters and restaurants before anyone took Mexican food in New York seriously. All the other moles — Oaxaca’s mole verde, say, which gets its green color from pumpkin seeds, tomatillos and fresh herbs — were about as rare as a mandarin duck in Central Park. In recent years, as these once-exotic species have become regular features of the menus at Cosme, Empellón, Claro and other restaurants, mole poblano has become something like the pigeon of Mexican sauces, too common and familiar to be worth noticing. If you share this low view of mole poblano, you owe it to yourself to have the one at Casa Enrique. The chef, Cosme Aguilar, calls it mole de Piaxtla, after the Pueblan town where his father grew up, and as a reminder that there is not just one mole poblano but many. Some have apple in addition to raisins. Some are thickened with animal crackers. Mr. Aguilar remembers that in his childhood home, plantains were allowed to hang until they were black before they could be pounded into mole. Maybe this explains the particular sweetness of Casa Enrique’s version, which is not the candy-bar sweetness of some. It’s deep and complicated. The character of this mole de Piaxtla unfurls as you eat, whether the sauce has been soaked into enchiladas filled with chicken or simply pooled on a plate over and under a quartered chicken and yellow rice cooked with peas. Mr. Aguilar has been frying, blending and stirring mole de Piaxtla since Casa Enrique opened in 2012, just off Vernon Boulevard, in Long Island City, Queens. In fact, he has barely changed his menu since our Hungry City critic, Ligaya Mishan, reviewed it the next year. Mr. Aguilar says he is emulating the restaurants he likes best in Mexico, ones whose kitchens make the same dishes year in and year out. Whether despite this or because of it, the restaurant seems to have improved in subtle ways. Acoustic panels tacked to the ceiling make conversation easier. Servers, always welcoming, have become experts at anticipating the meal’s ebb and flow. They’ll step in just when you’re ready for a fresh drink, maybe a margarita with some tamarind this time to offset the raw-sugar syrup. They’ll gauge the precise moment when you’re ready to have dinner plates cleared to make room for dessert. Or they’ll break away from your table just long enough to join in a full-throated singing of “Happy Birthday” around a slice of tres leches cake with a candle stuck in it on the other side of the room. This may happen three or four times a night, probably not because Casa Enrique looks particularly festive — from floor to ceiling, it’s done almost entirely in white — but, I’d guess, because regulars know it regularly outperforms any number of other restaurants that might seem to be more special on the surface but aren’t, really. Also, the tres leches cake, if not as soggy with condensed milk as it could be, is still pretty good, though I think the flan is almost mandatory, and it, too, is a perfectly credible birthday-candle holder. Although the guacamole is freshly mashed and pleasingly minimalist, I tend to skip it as long as the people I’m with don’t mind. Instead I’ll head straight for the two-bite sopecitos topped with refried beans and loose chorizo, or the albondigas in cumin-laced chipotle sauce, each of the three meatballs stuffed with hard-cooked eggs. The best Mexican seafood dishes often come from restaurants that specialize in them. Mr. Aguilar, though, seems equally at home with fish and meat. The market fish offered as a main course — lately a black sea bass — has always been seared to a crisp on the skin side. Still, in all these years I’ve never been convinced that the corn under it compares to the best street-corner esquites, or that it and the fish really add up to a whole dish. The seafood appetizers, on the other hand, are some of my favorite things at Casa Enrique: the delicately fried oysters sitting in a mayonnaise that gets its tangerine color from ground chiles; the ceviche, freshly tossed with lime and herbs; the crab tostadas, loaded with a thin slice or two of Serrano chile, chopped tomato, leaves of cilantro, smooth avocado salsa and a spoonful of crab meat, pure and clean; and the shrimp cocktail, which gets its roundness and slight richness, I think, from orange soda, just the way you’d hope. Mr. Aguilar is not one of those chefs who set up masa factories in their basements. Casa Enrique’s corn tortillas do not have the pretty floral aromas of Cosme’s, or the sweet, focused corn flavor you taste in Claro’s. But they are better than you’d find almost anywhere else in New York. They give a boost to the tacos, made with braised tongue or brisket; crumbled chorizo; or fried, battered fish, and they are especially delicious soaked in salsa verde and wrapped around roasted poblanos in cream to make enchiladas Doña Blanca. And while Cosme’s more modern approach has soaked up more media attention, I’ve encountered more bloops and wobbles eating there than I have exploring the far more traditional menu at Casa Enrique. It isn’t necessarily the more interesting restaurant, but it’s the one where I’m more confident that if I went there tonight, everything would taste exactly the way it was supposed to. The pozole will be dark and intense, though not especially spicy, with tender strands of pork in the broth and all the usual mix-ins waiting on the side. The pork ribs will be slowly braised, in the style of Chiapas, in a thick cooked salsa built on a foundation of guajillo chiles. These ribs are not to be confused with the baby back ribs, cooked in an even thicker, creamier pipian rojo, that sometimes turn up as a daily special. Best of all, perhaps, will be the chamorro de borrego, or lamb shank stewed with chickpeas; it will be very tender and very flavorful in its rough sauce of pulla chiles with crushed guaje seeds. The name of that sauce is huaxmole, or sometimes guaxmole, or even mole de guaje. Yes, it’s a mole, and one that rarely flies as far north as New York City. At Casa Enrique, it has found a permanent perch. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.

380,Della Rovere,One Star,20050323,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/23/dining/reviews/italian-classics-and-wine-to-spare.html,"NEW YORK needs another Italian restaurant like Seattle needs rain. It wants for salumi and crudi as much as New Orleans wants for gumbo, and it represents about as virgin a theater for long lists of wines by the glass as Las Vegas does for keno cards. But the dining scene is less often about introducing us to what we have never experienced than about giving us more of what we have already signaled we like. And we have signaled ample affection for the embellished enoteca, where the wall behind the bar showcases artfully stacked bottles of Barolo and Barbaresco, the Parmesan comes in nobly jagged wedges, and prosciutto, speck and a convivial time can be had by all. Della Rovere belongs to this overworked genre and could very easily be overlooked. But disregarding or dismissing it would be something of a shame, because it goes through familiar paces with a more appealing gait than many of its peers, and because signs of creativity and greater ambition flicker beneath its surface conformity. Yes, it has the obligatory selection of cheeses, cured meats and lightly seasoned raw fish to go with its wines. But the number of those wines by the glass -- about 100 -- is epic even by today's Homeric standards. The raw fish preparations are smart and satisfying, netting a great deal of flavor without turning the expedition into burlesque. Yes, the dinner menu reads a tad formulaic. Appetizers include a ubiquitous pairing of scallops and bacon and an ineluctable winter staple: the beet salad. Under the heading of pasta there are, for good and safe measure, gnocchi and risotto, and main courses dutifully encompass branzino, duck breast and steak for two. But that beet salad, made with mint, goat cheese and a hazelnut vinaigrette, was among the best of the 1,189 I have tasted over the last nine days. Those pasta dishes include a few unusually clever and satisfying ones. And while the main courses were a mixed bag, the desserts were almost uniformly excellent. Della Rovere exhibits enough skill and exerts enough charm to stand out in its sizable crowd. That said, it also displays a sloppiness that extends well beyond several glaring misspellings (bronzino?) on the written menu. I would chalk up some of its lapses to its newness except for the arc of my experiences there. The best dinner that I had was on my first visit, when the restaurant was greenest, on a night when it was fairly crowded. The worst was the most recent one, weeks later, on a night when the restaurant was less than a quarter full and neither the workers in the partially open kitchen nor the servers were remotely taxed. During that visit my friends and I practically had to perform calisthenics to catch the servers' attention. The persistent emptiness of our water glasses suggested a sudden TriBeCa drought. Dishes were repeatedly placed in front of the wrong people, and the gap of time between when we finished our entrees and when we were asked about dessert could almost have accommodated a showing of ""The Aviator."" More troubling still, a few dishes that had been expertly cooked on previous visits were overdone this time around. Such was the fate of garganelli with garlic, cabbage, pine nuts, anchovies, capers and raisins. Such was also the fate of a Cornish hen with a Sicilian pistachio, almond and vin santo honey glaze. Della Rovere's lack of discipline forces me to temper my otherwise considerable enthusiasm for this restaurant. It also prompts me to suggest a detailed itinerary to optimize the very real possibility of a terrific experience. When you reserve or arrive, ask to be seated in the less formal front room, not the larger and less charming back one. The front room has big, handsome windows and an attractive bistro feel. From the list of crudi, try the fluke and, better still, the tuna, despite the fish's overexposure. Della Rovere outfits it in a black truffle coulis and an anchovy mayonnaise, not revelatory bits of styling but unequivocally delightful ones. Of the bar snacks, go with the roasted baby cauliflower, slapped to salty and pungent life with the addition of anchovies (barely detectable), garlic (emphatically present) and capers (also out in full force). Pasta dishes can be ordered as half or full portions. If you have ranged widely among the crudi and snacks and perhaps indulged in oysters, which are also available, you should consider having a full portion as a main course and then moving on to dessert, because the pasta dishes are more reliable and interesting than the entrees and less expensive. The osso buco tortellini is especially memorable. For this dish the chef, Roberto Bellissimo, who cooked at Le Cirque, fills the pasta with braised veal and tops it with bits of seared marrow and a full-bodied saffron sauce which is essentially made by liquefying risotto Milanese. Mr. Bellissimo puts fried sweetbreads and a sausage ragu over pappardelle and browned butter and crumbled bits of almond-flavored biscotti over butternut squash cappelletti. Neither dish disappointed. All of the seafood entrees did, so you would be wiser, if moving beyond the pasta dishes, to head for a pan-roasted veal chop or the grilled steak. Or to go straight to dessert, the charmed province of Mr. Bellissimo's wife, Monica, another veteran of Le Cirque. She strikes gold with a gooey, lemony version of bread pudding which uses toasted panettone in place of bread and with a milk chocolate panna cotta presented in a sundae glass and layered with banana mousse, pralines and caramelized bananas. She also makes tiny, terrific fritti from a dough which has been infused with a sweet potato purée. The spongy nuggets encase honey and sheep's milk ricotta and wear a glittery coat of sugar. Does New York need them? Not exactly. But even a city as lavishly delectable as ours can stand another treat.

386,A Voce Madison ,★★,20060510,Frank Bruni,Midtown South,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/10/dining/reviews/10rest.html,"DURING his six years at Café Boulud, the chef Andrew Carmellini achieved something remarkable. Although the restaurant bore the last name of one of New York's most celebrated culinary figures, Daniel Boulud, and Mr. Carmellini was technically his on-site surrogate, its many fans came to see it as Mr. Carmellini's place. They gave him the credit, along with their trust. It was just a matter of time before the right financial backers beckoned and Mr. Carmellini struck out on his own. The only real question was what shape that venture would take. Would it be French and somewhat fussy? Mr. Carmellini had as much of that as of anything else in his background. Before Café Boulud, he worked at Lespinasse and Le Cirque. Would it strain for invention and strut for attention? Still in his early 30's, Mr. Carmellini was young enough to dream showy dreams and old enough, in the context of the restaurant business, to want to make his boldest mark sooner rather than later. But his solo debut, A Voce, which means ""word of mouth"" and is generating plenty of it, doesn't fit either of those descriptions. It's Italian, a nod to Mr. Carmellini's ancestry. Many of its dishes have a rustic bent  — they're as likely to arrive in terra cotta bowls or copper pots as on preciously shaped plates. And most of them are intended above all else to make you happy, which they do  — very happy. Mr. Carmellini cares more about robust flavors than about clever conceits. In that way A Voce really isn't such a departure from Café Boulud. The idiom has changed, but not the sensibility, not the premium on sating diners as opposed to wowing them. Not the fondness for duck, either. Duck doesn't get as much play in Italian cooking as in French, but Mr. Carmellini isn't about to let a good bird go unplucked, and so he finds several terrific uses for it. In addition to glazing duck meat for a relatively conventional entree, he grinds it and mixes it with foie gras and pork to make unforgettable meatballs, which are listed at the bottom of the appetizers but rank at the very top. He turns again to duck for his richest pasta dish, an absolute knockout. He braises the leg meat and then folds it, along with some egg and Parmesan, into the center of agnolotti. He covers the agnolotti with a creamy foie gras sauce and then, over that, in dozens of impossibly narrow stripes, layers a glaze made with vin cotto and balsamic and red wine vinegars. The sweetness and slight acidity of the glaze are classic foils for the liver, and they work precisely the magic they're meant to. Mr. Carmellini and A Voce are just as deft at,  and put even more stock in,   less traditionally luxurious, simpler pleasures. Apart from the duck meatballs, the appetizers I sampled were more or less plainspoken affairs: salads that underscored the season; thinly sliced wisps of prosciutto with pickled vegetables; gorgeous asparagus decorated with first-rate Parmesan, bits of truffle and a fried egg; imported sheep's milk ricotta whipped into a state of sublime creaminess and seasoned with nothing more than salt, pepper, thyme and olive oil. Beyond the duck agnolotti, most of the pasta dishes didn't boast unusually fancy pedigrees. The glories of house-made pappardelle were the impeccable consistency of the lamb Bolognese,  neither clumpy nor runny,  that topped the noodles and the deployment of that terrific ricotta in the right measure, so that it asserted itself without taking command. Mr. Carmellini's appetite for heartiness is hitched to an almost unerring sense of proportion. A spaghetti dish advertised with deceptive succinctness  — the menu said only ""local ramps, American speck, Parmesan""  — turned out to be a vaguely creamy, slightly eggy riff on a carbonara. But it was a relatively guiltless carbonara at that,  a light shawl, not a leaden cloak. The ramps further cut its richness, and their presence reflected a commitment to seasonal ingredients that defines the entire menu. The selection of entrees  — or more precisely, their prices  — contained a few puzzling surprises. I'd argue that a restaurant serving chicken cacciatore for $23 and putting it in one of those clay bowls shouldn't be doing a $110 rack of veal for two. On the menu I saw a figure of $55, didn't examine it closely and, until the bill arrived, didn't realize it was per person. All in all, the pricing of dishes  — some strikingly reasonable, some much less so  — didn't add up. And the setting doesn't really go with the food. Mr. Carmellini and his partners made a laudable decision not do the obvious and indulge in rustic shtick. But when you look at A Voce's green leather tabletops, swiveling Eames chairs and cold contemporary art,  including towers of what look like Lincoln logs bathed in orange light,  you may well conclude they traveled much too far in the opposite direction. The comfort of those broad, deep chairs is potent consolation. An expansive covered patio, expected to open soon, will provide a less stylized  — and, crucially, less noisy  — option for seating. And then, of course, there's Mr. Carmellini's cooking. If April Robinson's fittingly straightforward desserts (bombolini, chocolate amaretti cake) are a bit of a letdown, it's because she has such a tough act to follow. It's because of his fantastic gnocchi, the size and texture of miniature marshmallows, in a sauce of spring peas with crunchy bits of pancetta. It's because of his rigatoni, tossed not just with broccoli rabe and pecorino but also with pale, tender balls of ground pork loin, shoulder and pancetta. It's because of his beautifully steamed black bass, surrounded in its copper pot by fava beans, English peas and Manila clams, their open shells containing an additional treat: meatballs made with shrimp. For his inevitable next venture, maybe Mr. Carmellini, now 35, should consider an all-meatball restaurant. I wouldn't put it past him. And I wouldn't want to miss it. A Voce *** 41 Madison Avenue (entrance on 26th Street); (212) 545-8555.

388,The Little Owl,Two Stars,20060726,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/26/dining/reviews/a-little-love-and-a-big-pork-chop.html,"ONE of the reassuring wonders of the New York dining scene is the speed with which word about some unassuming new restaurants gets out. Take the Little Owl, which opened in late May with little fanfare, a little menu and little space: 30 seats, including the four barstools. By Week 3, it was full. By Week 6, people stood behind the barstools and just inside the door. And by Week 8, when I arrived after 9 p.m. to meet a friend for dinner, there were so many supplicants at the gates that the co-owner and manager, Gabriel Stulman, had created an impromptu sidewalk cafe for the overflow, serving people wine and complimentary canapés out there. ""It's the Little Owl way,"" he said as he tended to all of us. ""We're just trying to put the love back in dining."" Hokey? No doubt. But when Mr. Stulman says things like that -- and he says things like that with disarming frequency -- he does so in a slightly mischievous voice, acknowledging the hyperbole and turning it into a kind of joke. More important, he backs up his bromides, his enthusiasm speaking as loudly as his words. Every time I left the Little Owl, having watched servers' sunny demeanors become diners' bright smiles, I thought, ""What a nice place."" Every time friends who had been there talked to me about it, they said, ""What a nice place."" It has an irresistible earnestness and exuberance that explain its instant, well-deserved popularity. The earnestness links the front of the house with the kitchen, which turns out food without much pretension. The star of the menu, a dish that seemingly every third diner orders, is the grilled pork chop, which is no more -- or less -- than a glorious hunk of flesh. Perhaps its most serious competition for affection are the ""meatball sliders,"" made with beef, veal and pork on tiny, bouncy garlic rolls. Forget the overcute overuse of the term sliders in New York restaurants these days and just concentrate on the pleasure of these miniature sandwiches, arrayed in a row of four that officially constitutes an appetizer but also works as a side. They were moist and meaty, with a pivotal kick from pecorino in the mix. Pork pops up repeatedly, not just in the centers of dishes but also on the peripheries. It pops up when it's essential and even when it's not, which makes its popping-up no less appreciated. There's crunchy pancetta atop a very fine grilled strip steak. A side of butter beans is flavored with smoked ham hocks. First-rate housemade cavatelli wrap around a tomato sauce, fava beans, ricotta and, yes, bacon. The person calling these porky shots is Joey Campanaro, who worked as the executive chef at two Jimmy Bradley-Danny Abrams restaurants, the Harrison and then Pace. At the Little Owl, which he owns with Mr. Stulman, he embraces and repudiates his past. This restaurant is in some senses a shrunken version of the Harrison and the original Bradley-Abrams hit, the Red Cat. The cooking has a similarly straightforward, full-flavored style. But the Little Owl is the opposite of Pace, which closed last year. At Pace the menu reached in so many trendy directions that the kitchen couldn't do justice to everything and the ratio of hits to misses wasn't impressive. The Little Owl manages a much, much better one. Mr. Campanaro has pared down his menu to what he obviously feels complete confidence in preparing: about nine appetizers, including that cavatelli and a wedge of seared hamachi with an uncommonly nuanced coleslaw; seven entrees, including the steak and a ""crispy chicken"" that lived up to its billing; and a handful of sides. That conciseness didn't ward off disappointments, like a starter of slightly gluey, mostly bland spinach and lobster risotto beneath grilled scallops. It didn't prevent the appearance of a timid salad of bibb lettuce, hearts of palm and fennel. But the bolder, wiser successes came one after another, starting with that superthick pork chop, skirted by an ideally measured strip of fat; seasoned alliteratively with cayenne, curry, coriander and cumin, and cooked medium-rare. I had it twice, and twice marveled at its juiciness, so often absent from such an oversize pork chop. If I could have justified a third evaluation (consistency must be monitored!), I would have. But even a critic's rationalizations have their bounds. So I stopped as well at two inspections of the Chatham cod, the next-best entree. Before broiling it, Mr. Campanaro coated it with a pesto aioli, which was transformed into a rich, salty second skin. He then lay the fish atop a big, colorful bed of roasted corn, English peas and red onion -- typical of the bountiful way he constructs and rounds out plates. The cod's flesh was beautifully cooked, as was a fillet of roasted halibut, which rested on a cushion of mashed potatoes. In dish after dish the kitchen demonstrated remarkable care. The Little Owl's reach is modest and its limitations real. Its wine list isn't hugely exciting, although there are interesting selections in a considerate assortment of half bottles. Only one dessert -- an oversize brownie with a praline coffee sauce -- rocked my world. And apart from blueberry pancakes made with cornmeal and served with mascarpone in place of butter, brunch was merely pleasant. Because of its size, the restaurant has little wiggle room if diners linger. My companions and I had to wait a half-hour past the time of our reservation one night. But there's more space between tables than at Prune or the Spotted Pig, two downtown restaurants that the Little Owl brings to mind. While it shares their homey emphasis and hip clientele, its extra inches make it crucially more comfortable. It's also prettier, with a gorgeous pressed-tin ceiling and two walls of enormous paned windows that take in an archetypal West Village street corner. I don't know if it puts the love back in dining. But it puts the focus of dining where it belongs -- on real hospitality and disciplined cooking -- and it's a welcome antidote to so much of the razzmatazz around town.

390,Kobe Club,Satisfactory,20070207,Frank Bruni,Midtown,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/07/dining/reviews/07rest.html,"IT’S a rare and less than propitious moment when dinner out begins with a server asking: “Are you scared?” But that eerie query set the stage for a recent meal at Kobe Club, and it was prompted by one of this bizarre steakhouse’s many design oddities. Hanging upside down from the ceiling in the nearly pitch-black dining room are sharp, gleaming samurai swords, about 2,000 of them. The server volunteered that number, appended with an assurance that the blades, firmly anchored, shouldn’t cause any concern. The food and the bill should. Although Kobe Club does right by the fabled flesh for which it’s named, it presents too many insipid or insulting dishes at prices that draw blood from anyone without a trust fund or an expense account. For the most part it feels like a cynical stab at exploiting the current mania for steakhouses in Manhattan by contriving one with an especially costly conceit and more gimmicks than all of the others combined. Unsurprisingly, it’s the work of the restaurateur and gimmick maestro Jeffrey Chodorow, who scored big in years past with China Grill and Asia de Cuba but hasn’t had as much local success of late. Kobe Club occupies the Midtown space once inhabited by Mix in New York, Mr. Chodorow’s cheeky, ill-fated collaboration with the French chef Alain Ducasse. Mix wasn’t even Mr. Chodorow’s flashiest recent failure. Who can forget Rocco’s on 22nd, scene of “The Restaurant,” where Mama’s meatballs were sauced with acrimony and eventual litigation? Or its short-lived successor in that location, Brasserio Caviar & Banana? Brasserio Caviar & Banana  — the name really does bear repeating  — tried a grill-from-Ipanema approach and foreshadowed Mr. Chodorow’s fascination with sharp objects. Meats came on  disturbingly, dangerously long skewers. As its name suggests, Kobe Club pays tribute to the fat-marbled beef of pampered wagyu cattle, beef correctly termed Kobe only if it is from a particular area of Japan. The menu at Kobe Club advertises  genuine Kobe beef, along with Australian and American wagyu,  and encourages discerning carnivores to compare and contrast these different sources by making small cuts available and assembling a “samurai’s flight” of four-ounce tasting portions of Australian, American and Japanese wagyu, plus six ounces of American prime beef, for $190. For $295, there’s an “emperor’s flight” of four ounces each of Kobe fillet and strip loin and 10 ounces of Kobe rib-eye. Although tempted by this imperial excursion, intended for two, I confined myself to more restrained, strategic samplings. They were enough to establish the kitchen’s usual competence with steaks, grilled and seasoned only with salt and pepper, the right call. Anything more would distract from the glories of a steer well fed. At Kobe Club these glories were more evident in the Australian than in the American wagyu, and they were most evident in the Kobe, which has the densest marbling. Kobe does for steak what o-toro does for tuna, showcasing a holy communion of flesh and fat, inseparable from each other and impossibly silky on the tongue. It’s rapturous. At upwards of $5 a bite, it  had better be. Kobe and wagyu never come cheap, so the jaw-dropping prices of many steaks at Kobe Club  — $35 for just four ounces of American wagyu fillet, $150 for 10 ounces of Kobe rib-eye — aren’t entirely unwarranted. But even diners who steer clear of wagyu, thereby missing the whole point of the restaurant, don’t get off easy. A 12-ounce prime fillet is $48,  an organic chicken entree $32. What’s more, servers seem intent on plumping up the tab, whether by omitting any mention of a tap when asking about water preferences or rushing to replace cocktails and glasses of wine that are suspiciously shallow on arrival. Surrendering to that hustle is all too easy: extra alcohol helps blot out the environment. And blotting is essential, not just because of the swords. In one corner there’s a broad screen with an image of roaring flames, a seemingly inadvertent and decidedly unfortunate allusion to the television Yule Log. Strings of leather that look like fugitive shoelaces dangle here, there and everywhere, creating sinister-looking canopies and screens. Black-painted bricks in some areas and chains along one wall bring to mind a torture chamber. If Akira Kurosawa hired the Marquis de Sade as an interior decorator, he might end up with a gloomy rec room like this. Will the last samurai to leave please turn on the lights? Will someone else prune the tables of their crazy-making clutter? Oversize ornamental plates leave too little room for anything else, and although salt, pepper and steak sauce are already present, a gratuitous chemistry-set tableau of gray, pink and black specialty salts arrives with the steaks.  The steaks themselves sprout toothpick flags identifying the country of the beef’s origin. The menu is as tricked-out as the presentations, detailing 13 available steak toppings (classic béarnaise, lobster béarnaise, wasabi-and-shiso béarnaise, ad infinitum) and four kinds of mashed potatoes. The potatoes appear among a predictable profusion of sides, many given a vacuously luxurious sprinkling of truffles or truffle oil, just to tip the restaurant’s slavishness to trendiness off the charts. The appetizers, entrees and desserts alternate  steakhouse stalwarts like Caesar salad, Dover sole and cheesecake with less predictable fare, some of which, like a starter of salmon cured in sake, reflects the restaurant’s quasi-Asian bearings. And there are winners, to be sure: you can’t throw this many swords without occasionally hitting the wagyu bull’s-eye. The wagyu and Kobe beef tartare, prepared tableside, had a lusciousness in sync with its $32 price. Fried Malpeque oysters benefited richly from a smothering of creamed spinach and lobster béarnaise. But more of the food was disappointing, sometimes even infuriating, be it a rubbery roasted pork chop, perhaps left too long in its brine; limp iceberg lettuce, propped up insufficiently by blue cheese; those mashed potatoes, gluey; or a crème brûlée in dire need of a crunchier hood. And some of the food was alarming. A clam in an underwhelming cold seafood platter had a metallic tang, while an American strip loin had a sourness that didn’t taste like aging or, for that matter, like anything anyone intended. On the night when the server assured me of my safety, as I put my coat back on and headed toward the door, I suddenly found that I couldn’t leave. Something was pulling me back, but what? A delayed appreciation for the restaurant’s triple-decker crab cake? A yearning to retrieve a toothpick flag? A need to make peace with the check, which had come pinned to a wooden board by a dagger? No, it was one of those leather strings, which had wrapped like a tentacle around me. Scary indeed.  Kobe ClubSatisfactory (no stars) 68 West 58th Street; (212) 644-5623.

395,Savoy,★★,20090609,Frank Bruni,SoHo,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/10/dining/reviews/10rest.html,"BY all accounts, the two of them are collegial, even friendly. But still you have to think that Peter Hoffman sometimes wants to bean Dan Barber with an extra-juicy heirloom tomato — at the peak of its season, of course — or scatter some Jolly Green Giant into Mr. Barber’s freshly harvested sugar snaps. Mr. Hoffman must marvel: How did this whippet-thin whippersnapper, some 14 years his junior, become downtown Manhattan’s farm-to-table guru, enshrined by Time magazine as one of the world’s 100 most influential people and affirmed by the Obamas themselves, who used Date Night to dine at his Greenwich Village restaurant, Blue Hill? Mr. Hoffman, after all, was foraging in the Greenmarket (to which he has always traveled by bicycle, mindful of his carbon footprint)  when Mr. Barber was still in high school. And Mr. Hoffman, and his wife, Susan Rosenfeld, began exalting all things organic, sustainable and humanely raised at Savoy, in SoHo, a full decade before Mr. Barber did likewise at Blue Hill. It’s easy to overlook that, given all the loud and proud locavores upon the land today. It’s easy to forget about Mr. Hoffman and about Savoy, whose leafy, principled menu now seems less a breath of fresh cooking than the default setting of the urban bistro, where a chef contemplates ramps in May, butternut squash in November. But if Savoy is no longer a trailblazer or paragon — and if, indeed, it makes a more modest impression than a latter-day temple of ethical eating like Blue Hill — it remains an attention-worthy restaurant, on account of how deeply pleasant an afternoon or evening here can be. Its low-key charms haven’t faded since its opening in 1990, and its adjustments over time have been wise ones. Physically, for example, it’s more attractive than when it was last reviewed in The Times, in 1995, getting two stars from Ruth Reichl. That was around the time it expanded from one level to two. But it was configured differently, and it didn’t have the long bar just inside its entrance, one of the most inviting bars in the city, a band of dark stone shaped like a horseshoe, so that when you sit at it, you face the people around you. It’s a bar as a drinking and dining community, a circle (almost) of enlightened epicures. Early in the evening there’s a cutting board at the base of the horseshoe. On it are olives, pickles, meats cured in house, farmstead cheeses and the like. They’re seductive bar snacks, though the one you shouldn’t miss isn’t in view. It’s a plate of crunchy battered duck livers, which make an important statement about Savoy. They say  that for all its virtue and vegetables, it’s not playing waistline watchdog. It will give you something rich, even something fried. The breaded egg that’s part of  an appetizer of asparagus, for example. Egg and asparagus: scores of restaurants do that. But lightly breading the egg after poaching it and dunking it briefly in hot oil? That’s not as prevalent, and it gives the dish an extra texture, an added heft. Over the years Savoy has served as a classroom for Greenmarket chefs who graduated to other restaurants just as beloved, if not more so. It has also, apparently, served as something of a gastronomic dating service. Charles Kiely and Sharon Pachter, the couple who own the Grocery in Brooklyn, met at Savoy. So did  Andrew Feinberg and Francine Stephens, who own Franny’s, also in Brooklyn. In fact there’s a tie between the style of cooking and restaurant that define the current Brooklyn scene and what’s been going on at Savoy for two decades. There’s a shared concern not just with the provenance of ingredients and the straightforwardness of their presentation but with a dining experience more folksy than glitzy, more bluntly nourishing than madly exhilarating. At Savoy, whose front windows open onto an intersection with actual cobblestones, that sensibility translated into a wild dandelion salad with toasted hazelnuts whose faint and distinctive sweetness was the perfect counterpoint to the bitter greens. It translated into a clear-flavored, resonant spring onion broth with ramp-and-Gruyère dumplings that lifted it above the kind of soup you’d find in a lesser restaurant or could make at home. The Savoy  kitchen, in which Ryan Tate is chef de cuisine,  doesn’t operate in a showy manner. But it definitely operates in a skilled and diligent one, manifest in the dependable juiciness of the roasted Belle Rouge chicken, served on a broad plate that, when I had it, brimmed with mashed new potatoes and braised leeks. Almost all of the entrees I had — including an excellent salt-crusted duck (with caramelized sunchokes) and a pork shoulder (with cornbread pudding) that was gorgeous one visit, dry the next — were generously portioned. The desserts, under the direction of the pastry chef Lisa Fernandez, reflected as much of a premium on pure indulgence as on Greenmarket correctness, the standout being a vanilla cheesecake that was more like a mousse — like a cloud, really — flecked by early-season strawberries. Mr. Hoffman’s menus are confidently edited, with no more than eight appetizers and eight entrees on most nights, so the duds stand out. A cornmeal-crusted soft-shell crab tasted mainly of salty batter, and bacon-wrapped rabbit sausage had a generically fatty, unfocused flavor. The grass-fed beef that he uses at Savoy and at Back Forty, a more casual sister restaurant that he opened in the East Village a year and a half ago, doesn’t have the richness of the best grain-fed beef. So Savoy’s steaks, by far the most expensive entrees, don’t seem worth the price. Instead get the halibut, poached in olive oil and served with sugar snap peas and a radish salad. Ask to sit downstairs. While both dining rooms have working fireplaces, the  street-level one feels at once more intimate and livelier. And raise a glass of wine (from an appealing, varied list) to Mr. Hoffman, an evangelist outpaced by younger adherents but not out of the picture. Not even close.

406,Colicchio & Sons,★★★,20100316,Sam Sifton,Chelsea,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/dining/reviews/17rest.html,"TOM COLICCHIO came out of the kitchen at Colicchio & Sons the other night wearing a short-sleeved dishwasher’s shirt and a white apron. His black clogs were scuffed beneath his jeans, and there were burn marks on his forearms. He appeared tired, his angry eyes more sunken than usual. He had been in Los Angeles earlier in the week, running a big dinner for the Oscars. He had been down in Dallas before that, for a charity dinner for, among others, Jay-Z and LeBron James. Mr. Colicchio has Craft restaurants in both cities, as well as others in Atlanta, San Francisco, Las Vegas and at Foxwoods in Connecticut. He had been in Washington, too, where he will film the next season of “Top Chef,” the cooking competition on Bravo for which he is chief judge. It draws something on the order of three million viewers a week. Mr. Colicchio is a celebrity. He is also a businessman with varied and complicated interests in cities across the United States. But he is by temperament and deportment a cook. And at Colicchio & Sons he is running his kitchen at a level that New Yorkers have not been able to experience since his days at the helm of Gramercy Tavern, the restaurant he opened with Danny Meyer in 1994. For the moment, anyway, Mr. Colicchio’s is the must-try New York menu. His restaurant isn’t perfect. But it is exciting. And the food is terrifically good. Order the tasting menu: $125. (Expensive, yes, but still cheaper than orchestra seats for “The Nose,” or a facial at Bliss.) Currently it begins with a single roasted scallop placed beside an equal measure of silken foie-gras terrine. Pale turnips turned in honey, and peppery, chicory-like puntarelle separate the species. They elevate what might be a menu cliché into something fantastic. Much more follows, an intricate dance to flavor. A cone of squid arrives stuffed with cavalo nero, a kind of black cabbage, over an ebony-ink risotto that itself emerges from a fiery chunked tomato sauce. A stroke of dark sauce — roasted cacao nibs blended into verjus — runs a bass line under the salt and sweet, heightening both. Then lobster, a slash of red and white claw meat in a lobster bordelaise so deeply flavored as to recall both veal stock and opium smoke, with cabbage to bind them together. And sturgeon, a rectangle of meat the color of ivory, with a sauce of reduced grape must and a grape-pumpkin marmalade. It’s a mad hatter’s dish, cooking out of Lewis Carroll. Red squab is next, the tiny bird lacquered and crisp, scented with vadouvan, the French-ish curry powder that made its big-market debut on “Top Chef” a few years ago. It tastes of funky sophistication, illicit rides in late-night cabs. And last, before a dessert round of orange-scented cannoli and a phenomenal mango tatin from Stephen Collucci, the restaurant’s fearsomely talented pastry chef, comes a perfectly roasted piece of lamb loin. It’s served with nettles, green and puckered chickpeas and a caramelized yogurt with luxurious tang. This is low-whistle-and-chuckles food. At Craft, Mr. Colicchio’s flagship restaurant on 19th Street, there is no caramelized yogurt, no grape-pumpkin marmalade. Even at Tom: Tuesday Dinner, the supper club he ran there for a time, the composed plates did not exhibit the sophistication currently on offer at Colicchio & Sons. “As much as I love what I do at Craft,” Mr. Colicchio told New York magazine in December, “I don’t want to be known for putting a piece of fish on the plate with olive oil and salt and pepper.” And so he has gone in an opposite direction. There are elements of French technique to the cooking here, as well as an appreciable Italian devotion to ingredients. There are Indian flavors, and central European ones; there are nods also at Spain, at the Greenmarket, at North Africa. The result is a menu with an aesthetic that is entirely American. It appropriates all that has come to it, without apology. There is an astonishing array of beer available to match this food, most of it well suited to it;  a varied and excellent wine list has prices that, unlike Craft’s, do not provoke winces. Whatever you’re drinking, it’s hard to go wrong with an appetizer of butter-poached oysters, off the regular menu. These are served in a wide bowl with celery root cooked and cut into a perfect rendition of tagliatelle pasta, with a large dab of American caviar for seasoning. The dish is spooky perfection, crazy-making in its clean simplicity, its slinky richness. Butter traces run into oyster liquor, and the amalgamation swirls forward over the sweetness of a vegetable that acts as a starch, and carries the salty pop of the fish eggs carefully toward the tongue. Also nice: an addictive sea urchin and crab fondue; a hugely fat roasted sweetbread with honey-napped onions and a bacon-sherry vinaigrette; and agnolotti stuffed with a mash of white beans, with chorizo, pork belly and octopus, a buddy-and-sidekick film that should do well at the box office. For entrees, there is a wide wrist of monkfish, wrapped in pancetta and cooked crisp, atop braised red cabbage that’s been dressed in black-truffle vinaigrette. The combination of flavors — sweet again, and salty, with a bite of acid — cross-references the varied textures like a math problem, or an Escher print. Chicken pot-au-feu is hardly stewish beneath its crisp sheet of skin and fat cuts of black truffle, but it maintains the Escoffier standard while stepping into the modern age; a veal breast with tripe, trumpet royal mushrooms and a sweet cousin of baby broccoli, spigarello, explodes it for the same purpose. There is excellent striped bass with chopped razor clams and pea shoots, the sort of meal where you want a fork, a spoon and a few napkins, and a precisely Frenched little rack of rabbit, with braised fennel and olives. This last is dollhouse cuisine, not bad, if a little creepy. About the only misses are a perfectly cooked and defiantly under-seasoned fist of sirloin that is no match for the salsify, bacon and black garlic that come with it, and, for the same reason, a braised loup de mer with pork trotter and shallots cooked sweet and sour. Colicchio & Sons occupies the space that used to be Craftsteak, which Mr. Colicchio opened in 2006. Versions of that restaurant have done well in casino towns. But in Manhattan, the conceit started and stalled, then gained traction only to drive into the teeth of a new, diminished economy. Mr. Colicchio closed it right before Christmas last year. Colicchio & Sons came less than a month later. Some of the staff has remained (“Craftsteak, good afternoon!”). But a lot of testosterone has been drained off, and a combination of flowers and a Grateful Deadish soundtrack do much to counter the boom-era feel of the restaurant’s towering ceilings and soft leather seats. It’s not precisely comfortable, but it’s close. This is true especially at lunch, up in the Tap Room, where there’s a big rug in front of the bar and a menu that runs to pizzas and sandwiches and low-caliber versions of some of the dinner meals. An open-face Dagwood taken there at noon — grilled toast and pulled pork piled high with sauerkraut with a run of Fontina — is a perfect introduction to a long walk on the High Line and an argument for blowing off the afternoon’s work besides. Mr. Colicchio stands by the pizza oven up front, his arms crossed, his bald head gleaming in the heat. He’s talking low to a cook, forceful already, a couple of hours into a doubleheader day, customers who recognize him from billboards streaming past, whispering as if he were Derek Jeter at batting practice. You think celebrity is easy? Colicchio & Sons says: not if you’re ambitious. Colicchio & Sons ★★★ 85  10th Avenue (15th Street), Chelsea; (212) 400-6699, colicchioandsons.com.

410,L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon,★★★,20061004,Frank Bruni,Times Square Theatre District,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/04/dining/reviews/04rest.html,"THE best chefs have long been treated as artists worthy of adulation, and rightly so. But have they been promoted in recent years to deities who can expect reverence and sacrifice? And have some of us gone from sweetly doting patrons to slightly deranged supplicants? Consider this scene from the first days of L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon. It’s 11:30 a.m. Lunch officially begins now. Except it doesn’t. A hostess blithely says that Mr. Robuchon and the others in the kitchen aren’t ready. About 18 of us settle into chairs around the entrance. We await anointment. At 11:43 or so, two people get the nod. Over the next 15 minutes, another six are tapped. A flustered woman among those of us not yet admitted asks about the delay. The hostess says she doesn’t want to seat more people than the kitchen can handle. The woman surveys the sparsely populated dining room. “My kitchen can handle that many people,” she grouses. But does she leave? Do any of us? We’re put out, but not enough to forgo whatever Mr. Robuchon has to show us. He’s one of the most acclaimed chefs of the last quarter century, at long last making his New York debut. He had us at bonjour. It turns out that he deserves us, too, though not in so pious a posture, and certainly not on that day, during a supposedly “soft” opening when prices were actually higher than they are now. Although L’Atelier had already been installed and refined in Paris, Tokyo and Las Vegas, it hit the ground limping: bad bread, flustered service, palpable arrogance. It improved quickly and greatly, and your focus can now fall on its mostly exhilarating food: a layered cake of smoked foie gras and caramelized eel that’s the stuff of dreams; a mélange of sea urchin roe, lobster and cauliflower cream that’s pure rapture; a pair of precocious sliders — made with Kobe beef, foie gras, caramelized peppers and the most perfect little brioche buns imaginable — that get my vote for haute burger of the new millennium. To find this bliss, you still have to push past some nonsense. L’Atelier’s signature counter seating, the only option at its sleek Paris branch, doesn’t come off as well in the plusher, stuffier corner of the Four Seasons Hotel in Midtown that this offspring inhabits. That’s partly because there are tables in the mix as well, making this L’Atelier feel fractured and conflicted. The hotel intrudes on the restaurant, challenging a fundamental reason for the counter arrangement — to allow you undistracted communion with your food. You have to walk through the vast lobby to get to L’Atelier, and then you have to tune out the crowd in an unrelated bar area outside the restaurant’s entrance, which provides too little of a buffer. But once you do, you’ll encounter unusual dishes whose exceptional refinement and seductiveness can’t be denied, like a succulent piece of langoustine, deep-fried in a cradle of crunchy pastry so thin and delicate that the whole basil leaf between it and the langoustine’s flesh is plainly visible. Or like mock ravioli made with lobster salad inside a pocket of finely sliced turnip. When I asked about the full list of ingredients — what bound the lobster, what dressed the turnip — I was stunned. It went on and on, encompassing honey, Cognac, nutmeg, ketchup and even more, yet the unsullied impact of the dish was the gorgeous sweetness of that lobster. Mr. Robuchon has frequently been praised for his ability and determination to amplify the charms of whatever lies at the center of a dish, and it’s true that he pays more heed to emphasizing two or three flavors than to inventing oddball partnerships or imagining eureka flourishes. If you ask about the swish of dust on this plate or the scattering of grains on that one, you probably won’t hear about some pollen of some herb that will have you scrambling to Wikipedia. You’ll hear about pepper, although of a particular kind that he’s chosen carefully for its heat or color, like the pale red pepper from southern France on a bracket of whipped cream beside the layers of eel and foie gras. What made the restaurant’s sweetbreads sensational were their inherent quality, along with the potency of the veal jus beneath them and, of course, the pancetta added to the affair. Sautéed squid leaned on its own tenderness, as well as some chorizo. Mr. Robuchon knows when and how to bring a pig into play. But his reputation for simplicity isn’t quite accurate. In a noble French tradition, he and his team at L’Atelier — including his executive chef, Yosuke Suga, who will shoulder most of the burden as Mr. Robuchon attends to a growing global empire of L’Ateliers and other restaurants — like to make a showy fuss. Take that sea urchin composition, arranged like a sand sculpture in a translucent globe. There was a band of lobster-flavored gelée, which encased the sea urchin, and a band of cauliflower cream above it. And then, on the surface of that cream, tiny green dots of parsley mayonnaise — each the same size, each the same distance from the next one — traced a perfect circle. Or take ruby red dominoes of blue fin tuna, arranged in a horizontal line so straight that a geometry geek with a protractor couldn’t have detected any deviation. Crowning these rectangles were fresh chives, chopped so painstakingly that all the minute green segments appeared absolutely identical. This sort of handiwork does more than look good. It communicates the high standards that a kitchen sets for itself, the formidable technique it musters, the extensive manpower it deploys. The desserts resembled stage sets, replete with odd props like an orb of blown sugar that recalled the vessel that brought Mork from Ork. It belonged to a fruity array that included red currants and raspberry. I preferred a chocolate adventure with so many slopes and swirls in the landscape around a butte-like molten cake that I needed a road map to find my way back out of it. Much of the kick of this  Atelier, like its predecessors, is the way such formal mastery occurs in an essentially informal, contemporary context, highlighted by those 20 counter seats, which face preparation areas where cooks huddle, and by a stated policy of saving many of those seats for walk-ins. But the application of that policy has been persistently confused and confusing. Based on my experience, you may not be told when you make a reservation where you’re destined to sit, and you may not be asked when you arrive where you’d like to. You may not have any idea how much food to order. The menu, most of which is devoted to “small tasting portions,” doesn’t make sufficiently clear how small they are. Neither do the servers. And many appetizers (a category apart from the tasting portions) are significantly larger than some entrees, like a few undistinguished slices of roasted rack of lamb. That lamb was one of the menu’s definite soft spots and the $46 that it cost underscored how seriously expensive, in bites per dollar, L’Atelier can be. A few of the prices remain perplexing. So does the reservation system, as well as aspects of the service. Sometimes the bread, which is now outstanding, came with butter. Sometimes it didn’t. A companion’s iced tea had no ice and no lemon wedge. Mine had both. Why hasn’t all of this been worked out? Maybe because it doesn’t have to be — because chefs regarded as demigods aren’t compelled to sweat the small stuff. L’Atelier suggests what happens when we too readily genuflect. But it amply illustrates why Mr. Robuchon attracts such ardent worship in the first place. L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon *** Four Seasons Hotel, 57 East 57th Street; (212) 350-6658.

416,Imperial Palace,★,20091027,Sam Sifton,Flushing,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/dining/reviews/28rest.html,"ALMOST dusk in Flushing, Queens, the crowds thick on the sidewalk in front of Imperial Palace, people already waiting for tables to clear. Multigenerational Chinese predominate, the elderly leaning on parked cars while children run or pout and moms and dads work mobile devices against the delay. Past the scrum at the door is a room familiar to anyone who’s done time in Chinatown banquet halls: long and crowded, with big round tables that run all the way through to the back, and a small wall of aquariums halfway down, by the kitchen. Fat grouper are in there, black bass, eel, crab, crab and crab stacked tight. It is crab most everyone awaits — Dungeness, cooked over sticky rice and river leaves in a bamboo steamer, dotted with scallion. Cut through into pieces, the hard shells cracked, their essence exudes over time into the rice, bounces slowly off the vegetal bass note of the leaves and rides into the soft bite of the scallion, making the whole dish combine into flavors that are rich and complicated and delicious beyond compare. Crab is the restaurant’s calling card. But a series of meals taken there over the last few months say more: The Palace is riding high, at the zenith of Cantonese cooking in New York City. Time was in New York City that eating Chinese food meant eating Cantonese food, however bastardized: light stir-fries, lots of ginger and scallion, black-bean sauce, crisp chicken, steamed fish. This was true all over the United States. After all, China’s first immigrants to America were from Canton — Guangzhou these days —  and on their backs were Chinatowns built. These men — and they were men at first, almost entirely — cooked what they remembered from home. They cooked as best they could without wives and sisters and mothers, and then they adapted the result to the tastes of those who suddenly wanted not just to taste what they smelled cooking in their work camps and crowded urban neighborhoods, but to buy it and often. Thus were Chinese restaurants in America born. That sweet and sour pork you ordered in a mall in Scranton came out of Canton in some way; so too the chow mein you ate in a school cafeteria, the dim sum you had one hung-over morning in a city not your own. Lately, of course, patterns of immigration have changed. Since the 1990s, at least, the bulk of Chinese immigrants to the United States have been from elsewhere in China, especially from Fujian province, and they have brought their own cooking with them. Among the food-obsessed in New York, interest in Cantonese food has faded as it has risen in the spicy (and tasty!) flavors of China’s interior. Imperial Palace does something to reverse the trend. Entirely on the fly, it is possible to eat brilliantly there, in the manner of an improvised Cantonese banquet. It is not a formal restaurant nor in any way a perfect one; service can be slapdash, particularly if you speak no Chinese. But the cooking is extremely sophisticated. Those who miss the quiet, deep flavors of the cooking at Eileen Leong’s late, lamented Canton on Division Street would do well to book passage to Queens. Start with clams cooked in black-bean sauce. The sweet brininess of the shellfish is a nice foil to the briny sweetness of the fermented beans, with the lightest beat of fire behind them. (Advanced students may prefer the Palace’s periwinkle version of the dish instead, each shell drilled out at the end for easy sucking and devouring of the snails within.) Smart joes will try an order of salt-baked duck tongues, the tongues crunchy and sweet and firm around their cartilage centers, and a plate of cold jellyfish salad bright with the flavors of soy and black vinegar, sparkling with pepper. There are giant, three-slurp steamed Pacific oysters, too, dressed in spicy, salty, XO sauce — a taste of Hong Kong. Soup is a must, either before one really starts to eat or after: a silky corn chowder with minced white chicken, for instance, or verdant, porky mustard greens and white pillows of tofu in a glistening broth. Dried scallops and ham? This is a salty perfection in stock that tastes of both, what Calvin Trillin would call a double-trayf special. Once at lunch a waiter suggested a clam casserole served in what the menu calls the Vietnamese style: beautiful little scrubbed clams in a fiery chicken stock built strong with chilies and onion. Strewn with coriander stems, with a few lemon slices and cut red onion, it was a palate scrubber, exactly the sort of taste shocker that gets a person ready to feast. If you’re eating with more than three or four people, the restaurant’s deep-fried chicken with minced shrimp makes an excellent mid-meal snack. A perfect brown sheet of fried chicken skin, cut into a rectangle, appears on a plate, blanketing a thin futon of minced shrimp that is cased on its bottom with fried panko. The dish is crisp and soft at once, a marvel of technical cooking. It is astonishingly rich and flavorful besides. Meanwhile, an order of that Chinatown standby of deep-fried chicken reveals a bird that is no slouch in the flavor department itself: lacquered and sweet and moist, served with a small bowl of fermented red bean sauce through which to drag the meat. (The Peking duck here is credible, but you wouldn’t take the 7 train to the end of the line to eat it.) Then sable served sizzling over more black bean sauce, like a special at Nobu or a gift from a friend. And a wok-fried gray sole (the restaurant calls it flounder) to giggle over: smooth chunks of thick, perfect, curving boneless meat served above snow peas, celery and the fish’s deep-fried and half-edible skeleton, crunch to counter the velvet flesh. Pork chops in the Peking style arrive in a tangle: deep-fried and dressed in a sweet and sour sauce that makes a mockery of the neon gloop you find in strip-mall versions of the dish. More fried meat: sweet lamb chops with Chinese celery, crispy garlic and red onion, chewy, rich and satisfying. Snow pea leaves with egg sauce? Yes, that would be nice. Is an order of lobster over sticky rice better than the Dungeness crab over same? It would be a fun argument to have over big steamers of each, to be sure, picking at shells, eating rice gone pungent and rich with broth, slightly musky from the leaves that line the bamboo steamer. Either way, though, it’s the dish to end your meal: a sticky, garlicky, sweet adventure, one of the city’s great meals. Then eat your canned pineapple and beat it. Someone wants your table.

420,Bouley,★★★,20160301,Pete Wells,TriBeCa,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/dining/bouley-restaurant-review.html,"Yes, the apples are still there. Hundreds of them, lining shelf after shelf in Bouley’s first room, the small one with the coat closet. Going soft under the skin, ripening, giving up the yeasty cider-mash smell you meet in orchard barns. As far back as 1987, when he opened the original Bouley on the other side of Hudson Street in TriBeCa, David Bouley has wanted that scent inside your head the minute you walked in. Yes, the trick works. Before your mind has time to doubt, your senses are leading you. Yes, the restaurant is trying to seduce you. There’s no other explanation for the gold leaf on the groin-vaulted ceiling or the crushed velour just about everywhere — on the curtains, the banquettes, the frame around a softly radiant field of lavender in an enormous painting. There’s even a velour armchair next to a toilet in the men’s room downstairs. It must be there in case you have brought along an especially devoted valet. Yes, it’s faintly silly. But there’s also visual joy in the baronial curves of the limestone fireplace and the patterns woven into the antique rug. This is a restaurant for romantics and sensualists, just the place to take my friend who collects Victorian jewelry and mounted butterflies, the one who will smile when she sees the Chartreuse prominently shelved with the other after-dinner drinks. No, Bouley is not trendy. Mr. Bouley doesn’t even seem aware that trends exist apart from those shooting through his own mind, of which there are more than anyone can count. Occasionally, these overlap with trends in the world outside. This is the case with his interest in gluten-free bread, as evidenced by two dense loaves that ride around on a wooden chariot with at least a dozen other proprietary breads. Typically, gluten-free bread in restaurants is, like margarine, a barely credible substitute. These two bricks at Bouley, on the other hand, reflect creativity, experimentation, maybe a shade of obsession. Yes, they’re delicious. The black one is a little salty, earthy from buckwheat, crackling with walnuts, reminiscent of the seeded health breads of northern Europe, and wonderful as toast. The white one is a little sweet and speckled green with pistachios, slightly tropical-tasting from the coconut fiber that helps hold it together. Yes, you can eat bread with wheat flour instead: get a slice of the dried cherry or the saffron-walnut loaves, press some cultured Norman butter across it. That would be delicious, too. But these two bricks, their mere existence and their distinctiveness, tell you a lot about what makes Bouley compelling. Mr. Bouley takes paths nobody else is on, and walks farther along them than anybody else would. No, I’m not opposed to refined sugar and heavy cream the way he is. When servers murmur that the desserts use only coconut-palm sugar for its “low glycemic index,” it doesn’t particularly turn me on. I don’t really care that the slouching white slab of powdered snow that appears before dessert won’t give me diabetes, although customers who already have diabetes are no doubt appreciative. No, what I care about is the way it melts on my tongue: so fast the cold barely registers before there’s nothing but a cool trace of skim milk sweetened with white chocolate. It’s an impression, no more than that, like sticking out your tongue in a snowstorm and catching a few flakes. No, neither the bread nor the milk fluff is on the menu. They simply appear, along with other surprises that make the cost of a three-course menu, $125, seem eminently fair. But they illustrate a key facet of Mr. Bouley’s cooking: By ruling out some ingredients for reasons of health or digestion, he forces himself to find new ways to whip up delight and a sense of luxury. True, it’s not all dreamy. Buffalo fillet was served with a nondescript sauce and bland, lumpy gluten-free gnocchi. The “chocolate frivolous” dessert, a mainstay for many years, seemed worn out one night, the warm chocolate cake in the middle of the plate filled with a strangely bitter and oily ooze. A tart of apples and black olives was more provocative than delicious. O.K., meals can last longer than they need to. Servers can forget who ordered what, or present a wine bottle to the wrong person. And I wish more women worked in Bouley’s dining room; the gender imbalance there is old-fashioned in the wrong way. Yes, but it gets much, much better. For sure, the most dramatic dish in New York is the Malibu sea urchin in its spiky shell that looks like a medieval torture device. Inside is a layered composition of almond and soy milk; tofu; soy and vinegar; yuzu jelly and bursting orbs of salmon trout roe; creamy tongues of sea urchin under yuzu sorbet; and an olive-green spoonful of golden osetra caviar. Swooshed around it all is a puckering froth of green apple juice. Each bite is exciting in a different way. Yes, the wild mushrooms in the “forager’s treasure” were so richly flavored they fooled me into thinking they were cooked in butter. With melting lobes of grilled tuna belly, a truffle sauce and a light coconut garlic broth, the dish sent me to some other world in a whoosh. All right, I should have learned, but I was tricked again by the lushness of the “ocean herbal broth” pooled around gorgeously fresh shrimp, scallops, a belon oyster and a bundle of sea cucumber cut into ribbons. No butter in this dish either, just puréed garlic and other aromatics with tomato water and the sweet brine that drips from shucked clams. No, the rabbit salad — juicy loin wrapped in crisped belly with inky poached prunes and foie gras — is nothing like a salad. It is a warm appetizer that would be one of the star main courses in another restaurant. Yes, chicken baked in a sealed pot over hay and alfalfa sounds like punishment. It is not. As fowl cookery goes, it is something close to perfection. Yes, perfection. Bouley can skim within sight of it on the right night with the right people. At other times, it’s clear that the restaurant can’t maintain a single-minded focus on doing absolutely everything right. Eccentricity and consistency don’t always get along, and Bouley is a slightly eccentric restaurant, as Frank Bruni noted the last time it was reviewed in The New York Times, in 2009. He thought it was a three-star restaurant. Yes, so do I."
423,Torrisi Italian Specialties,★★,20100608,Sam Sifton,Nolita,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/09/dining/reviews/09rest.html,"THERE is one piece of framed art at Torrisi Italian Specialties, a tiny and terrific new restaurant on Mulberry Street at the very top of Little Italy. It is a large photograph of Billy Joel, a reproduction of a promotional still released with his album  “The Stranger,” in 1977. Mr. Joel wears a wide-shouldered suit of the age, with a loose tie and a pair of boxing gloves knotted around his shoulders. He is 28. He looks wistful, not unhappy, grown. The image — propped on a shelf above an installation of plastic Italian-ice containers, set between shelved cans of peeled tomatoes and bottles of Manhattan Special espresso soda — serves as introduction to the loving, ironical heart of a restaurant that is unlike any other in Manhattan. During the day, Torrisi is a sandwich shop modeled on those of the neighborhood old school. You can get a good chicken parm or an excellent turkey hero there, some flavorful contorni, a can of beer, a small bottle of Coke. The dishes are all smart upgrades on classics, beautifully cooked, humble Italian-American lunch fare for an era that respects the form. At night, though, the room is transformed into a restaurant of around 20 seats, in which artists make work and customers consume it. The prix fixe for this is $50. The food is still beautifully cooked, still aggressively Italian-American: the dried pastas and Progresso bread crumbs and other Little Italy grocery items stacked on shelves are not for show. But the dishes are no longer humble. They are edible paintings, comestible short stories. It is strange and wonderful to eat them in the same place you were sitting before, eating a chicken parm. The restaurant’s menu, written and executed by the owners and chefs, Mario Carbone and Rich Torrisi, changes every day. It offers eight courses set over the classic Italian rhythm: antipasti into pasta, into protein, into dessert. Over the course of a number of meals, over a number of months, the restaurant shows itself to be towering in its ambition.  Say what you like, Billy Joel could play the piano. There is always warm, just-made mozzarella as a starter, sprinkled with salt and drizzled with olive oil, and rich garlic toast on which to place it: outrageously good beneath its garnish of dried tomato, its weight of olive oil. There is always a little Italian ice to end the meal — tart grapefruit recently — and then a plate of classic Italian cookies and mini cannolis of the sort you can still get on Arthur Avenue in the Bronx or along Court Street in Brooklyn, only approximately 22 times better in quality here. But the rest, save for the decision to have meat or fish for the entree, is dealers’ choice. A server will tell you so at the start of the meal, when she asks for your drink order: beer or wine only, off a concise all-American list, on top of housemade sparkling water or city-run tap. (And no joke intended: perhaps a bottle of rosé? The Wölffer, from Long Island, works well in this weather.) The dance begins then, casual and rowdy, and you in the middle of it. Corned tongue with cucumber and pickled garlic was one evening’s starter, along with salami toast spread thick with baccalà and cured lemon. Once there was a beach-foraged salad of sea beans and butter lettuce, cactus leaves and sea rocket, followed by pickled eggplant with fiery lamb sausage and a smoked-sable crostini with cod roe, crème fraîche and everything-bagel spices. Another night, sweetbread Milanese made the scene: a gem on the plate, salty and rich, beside a soft dish of potatoes and egg scrambled with herbs, beside yet another of fresh ham with mustard and a hunk of Cheddar. A cucumber salad took us through to the pasta that evening, dressed in a dried scallop vinaigrette that seemed to come from a fantasy Italy, better even than the real one, farther south on Mulberry Street, closer to Chinatown. The pasta course stays on the American end of the Italian-American spectrum. (All the ingredients at Torrisi are American grown or made.) You might get clams and spaghetti with a Tabasco sauce, brine and fire combined along the length of the noodles, or a soft sheep’s-milk ricotta gnocchi, gnudi-like in texture, with lemony asparagus. One night brought fusilli in an offal-rich duck ragù; another, a sweet ravioli with a tang of red wine vinegar and a low hum of salty chicken liver. The menu had it named for Caruso, the opera singer. You could have tasted it over the radio and wept. The entrees are deceptively simple. The fish option might be skate Francese, buttery against the crisp skin of the fat wing, with a rushing undercurrent of lemon to match a throw of sweet sugar-snaps, a master class in fish-station technique. One evening there was tilefish carrying a load of blue-crab backfin meat, with small fried artichokes to amplify the richness of the meat. Black bass came drenched in a Manhattan-style chowder broth on another night, with pilot crackers for texture and thickening. It tasted of the Fulton Street of Joseph Mitchell, up in his old hotel. Meat options have included deviled chicken with a skin crisp enough almost to crackle, leavened by a swab of yogurt the texture of sour cream. And there was Long Island duck with broccoli rabe and a mulberry mustard  —  the fat beneath the skin rendered almost to the consistency of butter on its way to melting. Most recently, there was a heritage pork chop, cooked crunchy and dark on the outside,  soft and luscious within, beneath a tangle of vinegar-laced roast peppers. A roasted, glazed pork rib, fiery and bold, was placed on top as a garnish. Whatever the option, you’ll be asking for your icey after, and will take it slow through the cookies. The whole process takes roughly an hour, over bare wood tables, with paper napkins and wine out of water glasses. It is not fine dining, but it sure is fine. No reservations are taken. The best strategy for a table is to go as a couple, either at 5:30 for the first service at 6, or on the hour thereafter, with the hope that you will be seated within 90 minutes. (Leave the number for your mobile phone and go get a cheap drink at the Spring Lounge, or an expensive one at Balthazar.) Larger groups should consult horoscopes and witch doctors for advice. It sounds awful, the waiting. But Mr. Carbone and Mr. Torrisi are in a burst of creative excellence, and reinventing themselves daily. Theirs is not the simple, pared-down Italian-American food of the Frankies restaurants  — their cooking is too aggressively technical for that. But it is simpler than the inventive, luxurious new-Italian fare of Michael White at Marea or Mark Ladner at Del Posto.  It is reminiscent most of the spirit of Gabrielle Hamilton at Prune, and of the early days of David Chang at Momofuku Noodle Bar. And how long can that last? The Torrisi project as it stands surely must run its course, the way any performance does, the way any combination of kinetic energy and art must eventually fall off its axis. (What happens if the money gets tight? No one counts on the tears.) Presumably Mr. Carbone and Mr. Torrisi will cook this way until it gets boring, and then will do something else. Which means the time to get to Torrisi Italian Specialties is now. Torrisi Italian Specialties ★★ 250 Mulberry Street (Prince Street), Little Italy; (212) 965-0955, piginahat.com.

424,Matsugen,★★★,20080812,Frank Bruni,TriBeCa,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/13/dining/reviews/13rest.html,"AT Megu, which is only a few blocks from Matsugen, you can marvel at the gigantic bell that hangs from the ceiling, at the ice Buddha beneath it or at any number of other decorative exclamation points. Matsugen, in contrast, has some fish tanks between the dining room and the kitchen (a holdover from the previous restaurant, 66), but no other particularly striking visual flourishes. Its aesthetic is uncluttered, almost monastic. At Nobu, also nearby, you can choose among more than a dozen colorful kinds of tempura: pumpkin, sweet potato, carrot, bell pepper. Matsugen presents just two possible selections: “assorted vegetables,” to be ordered as a pot-luck group, and prawn. That’s it. None of this restaurant’s eight types of sushi rolls wears the tag “California” or incorporates avocado. Instead there’s a roll showcasing fermented soybeans and another advertising “soy braised gourd.” To find them you have to turn to the fourth, last page of the menu. The sushi and sashimi there receive less promotion than what’s on the third page: different kinds of soba  — buckwheat noodles  —  presented in different ways. Soba is Matsugen’s defining mission, its central selling point. And that puts it on rarer, riskier ground than its neighboring peers inhabit. Apart from being an excellent restaurant, it’s a brave one. With nearly 150 seats to fill in a section of the city where other destination restaurants also fly the Japanese flag, Matsugen hasn’t chosen to be flashier, more conventionally approachable or more accommodating to American palates. It has chosen to be more obscure, more pure and more true to Japanese culinary traditions, including some that aren’t especially well known beyond connoisseurs of Asian cooking. It doesn’t shy away from challenging dishes, though they certainly aren’t the majority. And for the most part it doesn’t tame or tart up exotic treats in the manner of Vong, 66 and Spice Market, restaurants with which the chef and restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten previously sought to tug the East into the West. With Matsugen he’s tugging, too, but with a fundamental difference. He owns just half of it, his staff managing the bar and the dining areas, including an endless communal table that’s in some ways the most appealing perch. The other half is owned by Taka, Yoshi and Masa Matsushita, brothers who also operate Matsugen restaurants in Tokyo and Honolulu. And Mr. Vongerichten has entrusted them with the kitchen. He says he doesn’t want to filter Japanese cooking through his own pan-ethnic sensibilities. He wants to reproduce the experience of eating in Japan, and he expects that a substantial fraction of Matsugen’s customers will be Japanese. He can also probably count on the Honmura An diaspora, which has been wandering the city since that cherished restaurant  closed last year, searching for a soba substitute. He and the Matsushita brothers have gone so far as to install a special mill that grinds buckwheat kernels into fresh flour for the handmade noodles. The noodles  — never too floppy or too firm, yielding at just the right moment to just the right bite  — come in three gradations of weight and texture: rin, which recalls angel hair; seiro, which is also smooth but heavier; and inaka, the roughest and, deliberately, the chewiest. You can have hot or cold soba. You can have soba with any of many condiments, dips, broths and interlopers: dashi, grated yam, fresh wasabi, scallions, uni, duck soup. Most are so clearly and cleanly flavored that you feel, as you use your chopsticks to drag the next tangle of soba through them or to twist it around them, that your senses have been sharpened, that your palate is more alert. Superior Japanese food has that effect. My favorite soba combination was the inaka with a white sesame dipping sauce, which has a luxuriously nutty taste and a creaminess that’s a perfect foil for the noodle’s coarseness. But you needn’t even order the soba, not when there’s a hefty clay pot with gorgeously cooked rice under strand upon strand of sweet, supple crab meat. Not when there are tissue-thin ribbons of pink kurobuta pork loin to be dunked for a few seconds  — and no more than a few seconds  — in a pot of gently boiling water in the center of the table. That’s one of three “shabu shabu” options, the other two being wagyu beef and lobster. The magical white sesame sauce appears as a condiment for this dish, too, but don’t drag the pork through it. It masks the fineness of the meat, better anointed with ponzu. Shabu shabu permits some easy, amusing theater, and there’s a similarly populist section of the menu titled “from the grill.” That’s where you’ll spot chicken, pork belly, the requisite wagyu steak and, yes, the ineluctable black cod with miso. I guess Matsugen just couldn’t resist. But their counterpoint is the “bakudan” appetizer, to my mind one of the restaurant’s iconic dishes: unfamiliar to most diners, gorgeously composed, meticulously accessorized. At the bottom of a ceramic bowl is a brightly hued mosaic of ingredients, including matte orange uni, glittering orange salmon roe, the ochre yolk of a poached quail egg. All are reliable luxuries, but with them is natto, a smelly fermented soybean paste that changes everything, especially because your server encourages you to mix the ingredients together, then roll the results in crisp sheets of nori. The nori is in a wood box to the side, kept warm by faintly smoking charcoal embers beneath it. I was riveted by the way bitter, funky and briny notes in the dish jousted. And at the end of that same meal, I was riveted by the one-two punch in a startling dessert that floats cubes of tomato gelatin in a cold coconut soup. Just as you savor the soup’s silky sweetness, you bite into a cube and set off a tart explosion. Although soba isn’t particularly expensive, the rest of Matsugen doesn’t come cheap, especially not the sushi and sashimi, which is only as terrific as it should be, given that most sushi is $7 to $8 a piece. And there are occasional failures of execution: an overcooked chicken breast, rubbery clams in a wan Japanese chowder. But more often there’s an obsessive attention to detail, and it spans every facet of a meal, even the cocktails, one of which mingles shochu with grapefruit juice that’s squeezed fresh at the bar for each drink. The juice’s sunny, singing taste isn’t gimmicky. It’s just wonderful."
427,Hotel Griffou,★,20090922,Pete Wells,Greenwich Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/dining/reviews/23rest.html,"WHEN the operators of restaurants known as celebrity hangouts are asked how an ordinary civilian can get V.I.P. treatment, they invariably give the same answer: Make yourself a regular. I used to believe them before Hotel Griffou, a new restaurant on West Ninth Street, came along. Its owners — among them veterans of the Waverly Inn, Freemans and La Esquina — have the frequent pleasure of reading gossip items about the meals enjoyed there by Kanye West, Jennifer Lopez, Sean Penn and the like, but Hotel Griffou seemed to follow the principle in reverse. I was treated worse each time I showed up. After my first dinner, I sat by the bar to wait for my friends to catch up. An employee rushed over and asked, in a voice that floated like a paper airplane, “Can I buy you a drink while you’re waiting for your table?” I wish she had been around for my final  meal there, when I checked in on time for an 8 p.m. reservation. “Three people?” asked the man at the desk. No, four, I said. He replied, with evident sorrow, that he had me down for three. “I called a couple of hours ago to change it to four,” I said. “Our reservations line closes at 5,” he said, as if he’d caught me. Why did it matter? At every restaurant I’ve seen, a three top is a four top missing a chair. Not at Hotel Griffou, where we were sent to the bar while someone hunted down our table. The restaurant has four dining rooms, and we had an excellent view of one, a bright space with long beer-hall tables that sat empty. We imagined that they were being held for a group. Naturally,  this is where we were seated, 50 minutes after we had arrived. I was afraid that if I returned they would hit the one-hour mark and lead me to a produce crate by the dishwasher. So I stayed away. That’s too bad in some regards, because Hotel Griffou does have its allures. Each dining room has a different motif, as if the restaurant were trying to ignite a collect-them-all frenzy. A friend described the Library as “very man-cavey,” outfitted with wooden ducks, a manual typewriter, a fiddle, a saddle, shelves filled with law books, a football that looks as if it was in play when F. Scott Fitzgerald was at Princeton, and four fox pelts. The Salon, dominated by a large photograph of an old woman shooting flames from her wrists, looks like the drawing room of an English aristocrat with a weakness for odd contemporary art. The most sedate chamber is coyly known as the Palm Terrace. It  sports a potted palm along with ivory leather banquettes and wallpaper celebrating the glory days of the Raj. A Little Red Riding Hood installation distinguished the last room I ate in, but I was too addled to give it a full exegesis. Apart from the modern art, the overall aesthetic drinks deep of the current nostalgia for country houses and hunting lodges in the sunset years of the British empire, mixed in with the renaissance of the types of handmade cocktails that faded during Prohibition. There’s a letter-perfect mint julep and a navy grog with pineapple juice and rum that almost makes you want to  join a ship. Of everything Hotel Griffou offers, the drinks are the easiest  things to swallow. They helped buff the rough edges of the food that followed. The cooking is hard to classify, partly because the menu is divided into “Seasonal” and “The Classics.” In the first category are garden-variety takes on Mediterranean-derived dishes. Grilled trout with tomatoes and braised fennel was typical, and successful. Much stranger was a chicken breast “in pistou,” as the menu claimed. In actuality, the delicate basil sauce coated a handful of crisp vegetables rather than the powdery, overcooked chicken, which could have used it. Tender fettuccine appears with a rotating cast of seasonal vegetables. One night it was a very enjoyable pairing of kale and cranberry beans, on another, fresh chickpeas with eggplant, so  underdone it squeaked. As modern as these dishes were, their presentations were often scattershot, as if the food had been lobbed in the general direction of plates as they sailed toward the kitchen door. The classics were more solid. On this side of the menu you’ll find a dish not served anywhere else in the city, a plate of pounded and fried pork cutlets under a dark mushroom sauce with peas. It is an appealingly unreconstructed throwback, dating to 1892 and attributed to Marie Griffou, who once ran a boardinghouse at this address. The tender and rich burger was a solid success, and the secret seemed to be the way the kitchen let  a mildly tart and spicy ketchup soak into the top bun. It shouldn’t have made a difference, but it did. A strip sirloin steak was cooked just as we had asked, and hit the right beefy notes, though the sauce au poivre seemed to be geared  to diners who don’t like black pepper. But you’d think that our waiter might have delivered a $37 steak, or for that matter a $17 burger, without having to be reminded who got what. Service at Hotel Griffou can be wildly inconsistent. In the Library, we were under the ministrations of a flotilla of servers. (Given the country-estate mood, and how briskly and unobtrusively they patrolled the room, I am tempted to call them servants.) On another night, we got the kind of gruff attention you expect at a steakhouse. After that last meal, having abandoned the gooey desserts that had the excessive sweetness that is the hallmark of school bake sales, we saw a vehicle parked at  the curb, a Mercedes Sprinter cargo van  that had been expensively retrofitted for passengers. A driver had ferried somebody from out of town for dinner at Hotel Griffou. With luck, that somebody did not have to wait for a table. I’d hate to think of the driver’s overtime.

435,Grünauer Bistro,★,20160621,Pete Wells,Upper East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/22/dining/grunauer-bistro-review.html,"Our server at Grünauer Bistro called the men at our table Sir. When one of the women asked for a glass of water, he replied, with deep seriousness and an Austrian accent, “Madame, consider it done.” He set off deliberately, his chest billowing before him and his feet moving with slow, battle-weary pride. A few minutes later, he returned. “There you are, Madame,” he said. “As fast as I could.” Once he had hauled away the dessert dishes — by that time, we had reduced the Sacher torte to a rubble of dark crumbs and the palatschinken folded over chestnut mousse to a few stray smudges of chocolate sauce — he came back with a bottle and four glasses. The clear spirit he poured was a pear-apple brandy from Austria. After a sip, one of the women said it reminded her of grappa. He lifted his chin and gave an indulgent chuckle. In that laugh was compressed the entire history of Austria’s contributions to European culture. “Yes, Madame,” he said. “But … more refined.” He was so perfect for Grünauer Bistro, and Grünauer Bistro was so perfect for him, that it’s impossible to imagine a time when they hadn’t been together. The whole restaurant is like that. Although it opened in early March, it might have been frying Wiener schnitzel and simmering tafelspitz on the corner of First Avenue and 82nd Street for decades. More than I would have thought possible, Grünauer Bistro seems to be a holdout from Yorkville’s past, when businesses fed the Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Austrian and German immigrants who lived side by side in microneighborhoods that replicated the arrangement of Mitteleuropa. I could believe that Grünauer Bistro was founded the same year as Elk Candy, a German confectioner who formed tiny carrots, pigs and strawberries out of marzipan. That it had outlived Mrs. Herbst’s, baker of a Hungarian cabbage strudel that Nora Ephron once called “almost the only thing I remember about my first marriage.” That it once competed for expatriates with the Viennese Lantern, where diners were serenaded by a strolling fiddler, a strolling accordionist and a lyric soprano or two, firmly planted. Grünauer Bistro is a quieter spot. Late on Thursday nights, a pianist works the baby grand by the bar. On other nights, customers have to make do with a poster-size photograph of a fiddler hanging on the wall, the gilded statue of Johann Strauss II in Vienna. The picture helps brighten the spirit of a dining room that tends toward contemplative twilight. A sunset glow emanates from the coffered ceiling panels. Wood needs time to look this warm, and I wasn’t surprised to hear that the ceiling was inherited from Primavera, the Italian restaurant that sat on this corner for 32 years. When he took over the address, Peter Grünauer must have realized that any restaurant built under that ceiling would appear long established. He is long established himself, having made his name in Manhattan in the late 1970s and ’80s as the owner of Vienna 79. That restaurant made Austrian cooking waltz to the tune of nouvelle cuisine. What this meant was “lightening up on fats and flour” and “garnishing dishes with an unusual rainbow of bright steamed and sautéed vegetables,” Mimi Sheraton wrote in her four-star review in 1981. Not much about the traditional cooking under Thomas Slivovsky, Grünauer Bistro’s chef, could be called nouvelle, but ghosts of Vienna 79 whisper in the kitchen. Dill-strewn bands of house-cured gravlax with whole-grain mustard sauce reappear, and are worth getting. Applesauce cut with horseradish still makes an interesting complement to the tafelspitz, beef braised to tenderness with root vegetables in a light broth. Beef consommé with the sharp nip of black pepper is filled out by browned ribbons of crepes rather than the liver dumplings of old. Goulash here is made with beef, not veal, but it still comes with buttered spaetzle that squiggle their way into the meaty, paprika-choked sauce. Oddly, the spaetzle tossed with herbs, vegetables and a squirt of lemon as a vegetarian main course were less tender and appealing the night I tried them. There is Wiener schnitzel, of course. There has to be Wiener schnitzel, and it has to come with lingonberries (intact and not too sweet), potato salad (on the mild, creamy side) and marinated cucumber slices (classic). And if on some nights the rippled crust over the tender veal cutlet doesn’t crunch quite as emphatically as you want it to, it may be that the kitchen is simply trying to play along with the illusion that everybody at Grünauer Bistro has been doing this for so long that imperfections are to be expected once in a while. You could draw the same conclusion about the somewhat dry chunks of white meat in chicken paprikash. As for unusual rainbows of vegetables, the closest the menu comes is the vinegared beets in several colors, with big white puffs of whipped goat cheese. But it’s a very nice salad. At an Austrian restaurant, the desserts had better be good. For the most part, they are. The shell of pastry wrapped around apple strudel was damp one night, but flaky and crisp on another. More notable — ridiculously good, actually — was the kaiserschmarrn, a dense, eggy pancake broken into pieces that were white with powdered sugar and stained dark by fruit compote. A server always asked whether we wanted coffee, from the Viennese roaster Julius Meinl, during dessert or after. It’s a small detail that helps set the Old World tone. “Austrian vineyards offer lean pickings for wine lovers,” Ms. Sheraton wrote in 1981. In this case, the outlook has improved. The list is full of reds and whites from notable producers including Prager, Nikolaihof and F. X. Pichler. Most of the bottles are under $70. There are also some Austrian wines that Mr. Grünauer, who runs another Grünauer Bistro in Kansas City, Mo., has commissioned under his own label. Each of my meals ended with the same ritual, a bottle of pear-apple brandy poured out for everybody at the table. I don’t believe the restaurant had spotted the critic; the gift simply seemed to be an acknowledgment that we had shown heroic appetites. Once, we supplemented the brandy with a single $25 glass of Hans Reisetbauer’s astonishing carrot eau de vie. It tasted like carrots, but more refined."
438,Millesime,★★,20110104,Sam Sifton,Midtown South,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/05/dining/reviews/05rest.html,"ANOTHER year, another restaurant keeping up its end of the bargain in an awkward hotel lobby space. Millesime is a smart young French establishment from the talented chef Laurent Manrique. It is spread out over the back of the second floor of the Carlton Hotel on Madison Avenue and 29th Street, where Country was once strong. The entrance sits at the intersection of two lounges that lie off the hotel’s sunken lobby: Salon Millesime, where you may run into a woman playing a lighted accordion, or see a Michael Jackson impersonator perform (really!); and the dark and comfortable Bar Millesime, which could easily appear in divorce papers as the location where plaintiff’s husband initiated the commission of an act of adultery. Visitors to Millesime the restaurant must first walk down a staircase, then through one or both of these spaces, to find themselves,  perhaps confused and hesitant by this point, at the start of another staircase that leads up. The dining room lies at its end: Millesime, at last. It is not particularly promising, all this walking and climbing through other businesses to get to the one where you have reserved a table. (And what’s with the name? Millesime is French for “vintage,” as in wine, though the restaurant does not use the accent that, in France, would appear over the first “e,” nor the one that in some uses appears over the second. The resulting pronunciation — “Mill-ah-seem,” “Mill-EY-zeem” — is up to you.) Crowds have as yet been sparse. But, holy cats, is there a beautiful, even exciting brasserie up there at the end of the journey, a restaurant devoted to the pleasures of the sea that manages to be luxurious and humble, ambitious and rustic, all at once. The room has red banquettes and tile floors and soaring walls that lead toward a Tiffany-style dome ceiling. There is white paper on the tables, and glinting little Eiffel Towers of salt and pepper, small galvanized buckets holding napkin-wrapped heavy silverware, all in beautiful light. The atmosphere is festive and urban, pleasant in the extreme. Waiters bustle this way and that in long aprons and black vests as Samy Kebbab, the restaurant’s effusive and seemingly omnipresent maître d’hôtel, rushes that way and this, managing the room as if it were a party — a master of the hotel, in the truest sense of the term. Eat, eat! There is marvelous bread with a butter cut with red wine and shallots. Mr. Manrique serves an outstanding appetizer of smoked herring placed on warm, glistening fingerling potatoes. He offers a silken grilled Caesar salad, with melting hearts of romaine wrapped with soft, smoky black cod, with a dusting of Parmesan and a squeeze of lime. There are bracing platters of oysters and clams, and of remarkable tartares that manage to evoke classical traditions in some preparations (a sweetly briny mixture of salmon and mustard, dill and fennel) and new ones in others (tuna cut with dates and mint, against a fiery Berber spice mixture). Steamed mussels achieve much the same trick. Mr. Manrique offers a standard bistro concoction of white wine, parsley and shallots, and another that ramps south to Marseilles with a Pernod broth flavored with saffron and fennel. A third option involves curry powder, apples, lime and coconut bouillon. It would be a treasure of the American South if there were mussels in Charleston Harbor; it is country captain, essentially, and exciting for that. Mr. Manrique was for a number of years the chef at the renowned Aqua, in San Francisco (those who’ve been following the food game in New York long enough may remember him from Peacock Alley in the Waldorf-Astoria, back in the early 1990s). His menus have been slick and inventive. But he was taught in a very old school. So, distinguished pike quenelles appear, as well, served in a lobster sauce of great depth. These are far larger than the ones you’ll find at those few elegant French restaurants that still serve them (La Grenouille comes to mind), but very much of a piece with their work: what Julia Child called “this delicate triumph of French cooking.” Mr. Manrique credits them to the style of the New York chef Jean-Louis Dumonet. And there is an outstanding dish of poached eggs, briny clams and salty French ham, a liquid breakfast sandwich, and as satisfying. Entrees bring a moment of pause: five species of fish, only vaguely identified (salmon, cod, black sea bass, snapper, tuna), that may be grilled or cooked on the hot griddle known as a plancha. To go with them, sauce: five choices again, ranging from a simple and technically perfect meunière to a gingery beurre blanc made with Jurançon wine. These are all expertly prepared, if a little boring after the first-course fireworks. (Save for a marvelous toasted brioche with Armagnac ice cream, the desserts follow suit: profiteroles, etc. Sigh.) A steak for two is neither good enough nor frankly large enough to justify its $86 price tag, even with an extra dollop of shallots plopped down around the meat. And duck confit cut into a macaroni gratin is simple fatty ridiculousness, a cheap nod at the city’s fashion for excessive cuisine. But Mr. Manrique — or his executive chef, Alan Ashkinaze — can cook a roast chicken to beautiful, burnished perfection, and serve it with a gravy rich with garlic, with a fragrant mist of thyme. And there surely cannot be a better deal or package of lobster flavor than the restaurant’s $48 pot au feu, which brings two people a fat lobster to share, with plump little lobster sausages and a heady, cream-heavy broth. Millesime has opened in a city where restaurant tastes have lately been running Italian, and hard. But its earnest young servers toil under Mr. Kebbab to emulate a version of the scene you used to be able to find at brasseries all over Manhattan. (Ah, Jean-Jacques Rachou, we miss you so.) There is some of that energy, and verve. The restaurant serves as a swell reminder of why this city fell in love with brasseries in the first place, and as a hopeful sign that there could be a resurgence in that affair. See if you can find your way there.   Millesime ★★ Carlton Hotel, 92 Madison Avenue (29th Street), Flatiron district; (212) 889-7100; millesimerestaurant.com.

439,Franny's,★★,20070829,Frank Bruni,Park Slope,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/29/dining/reviews/29rest.html,"ALMOST from the moment it opened in 2004, Franny’s had followers so ardent that they seemed to be willing themselves into their swoon over the place. Their unfettered enthusiasm was one of several reasons for skepticism. Another was their ZIP code: many lived near Franny’s, which is in the Prospect Heights section of Brooklyn, and you know how Brooklyn boosters can be about their restaurants. Football fans who show up on sub-zero days with bare chests and painted faces have more perspective. And it was hard to fathom their passion when they had such difficulty making the food sound special. What, you’d ask, did this mecca for the modern epicure serve? Crostini, they’d say. (Yawn.) And cured meats. (How transgressive!) Salads, too. (Heart palpitations commence.) And, and, and ... pizza. So was Franny’s essentially a glorified pizza parlor? For those outside Brooklyn, did it really warrant a water crossing? To the first question the answer is no; to the second, an emphatic yes. Other restaurants have honorable pies, admirable lettuces or noteworthy salumi. But take it from a cranky Franny’s doubter, now a besotted Franny’s believer: not many do all three with as much joy and distinction as Franny’s. Besides which, Franny’s does more. In June it reinstated pasta dishes on its menu. A few had been there in the beginning but were quickly jettisoned, because Franny’s chef, Andrew Feinberg, didn’t think he’d mastered them. Now his kitchen has new equipment, while he has new confidence. So it’s pasta once again, and the rigatoncini with peppery pork sausage and sweet cipollini onions will have you hoping it’s pasta forever. The lengthened menu makes Franny’s feel more fully formed, though you could subtract the pasta and still be left with plenty to savor and celebrate. Even in this era of Greenmarket reverence and food-miles shame, not many restaurants put as high a premium on seasonality and freshness as Franny’s does. Artisanal pizza may be all the rage, but it’s the rare pizzaiolo who spreads dough thin enough and gets a brick oven hot enough to produce the gorgeous blisters like those on Franny’s best pies. And the restaurant’s soppressata has a suppleness that would make Armandino Batali blush. Franny’s simplicity is deceptive. The restaurant finds transcendence in dishes and genres that wouldn’t seem to yield so readily to invention or open the door to so much pleasure. For a Franny’s crostino no mere caponata will do. The crostino I had on a recent night was topped with porky, fatty pancetta — cured in the basement, along with the soppressata — and a house-made peach butter that simultaneously amplified the meat’s richness and provided some sweet relief from it. A clam pizza at Franny’s isn’t one of those clumsy pies studded with shells that force you to embark on an odyssey of deconstruction and reconstruction. The clams have already been liberated and placed on a thick amalgam of clam juice and cream — a doubly clammy whammy. If you ever loved a bivalve, you owe yourself this romance. Mr. Feinberg owns Franny’s with his wife, Francine Stephens, for whom the restaurant is named. And although Franny’s has plenty of polish — a sophisticated  Italian wine list, a manicured garden out back, a long mirrored brick wall more urban-chic than rustic — it retains a certain mom and pop soul, though the mom and pop in this version are notably young and idealistic. Ms. Stephens is 35, Mr. Feinberg is 32, and they have a year-old daughter, with a sibling en route. The couple clearly want Franny’s to be an open-hearted, accessible place, and to that end there’s not a menu item over $17. And the restaurant doesn’t take reservations. This policy creates predictable chaos, but it also seems to encourage a diverse crowd: families with small children early in the evening, tattooed hipsters later on. They can drop by on a whim and have the same chance at a table as anyone else. Franny’s has its vanity. Turn over the menu and you’ll learn the provenance of not only the restaurant’s organic ingredients but its conservation-oriented energy supply (“35% New Wind and 65% Small Hydroelectric”). I didn’t need to be told in writing that milk from Evans’ Farmhouse Creamery is “rich and creamy just like Mother Nature intended before homogenization.” I could taste its splendor in the fantastic fior di latte gelato on Franny’s brief list of desserts. Several of those desserts — the cannoli, the chocolate sorbet — are underwhelming, as are a few of the dishes on the menu’s “small plates” and “plates” sections, where the crostini are found and the salads predominate. Although I loved the sulfur beans and salsa verde with wood-roasted octopus, the octopus itself could have been more tender. You may not even encounter this dish. Franny’s menu seems to change almost hourly, reflecting the real value Mr. Feinberg and his chef de cuisine, Joshua McFadden, place on using the best ingredients they can rustle up at a given moment. Wood-roasted eggplant replaces raw zucchini in a salad with pine nuts, purple onion and mint. Shell beans arrive just as wax beans depart. Mr. McFadden arrived this year, having worked at Franny’s in the early days and then left for other restaurants, including Momofuku Ssam Bar and Lupa. Ms. Stephens and Mr. Feinberg said Mr. McFadden’s experience at the latter restaurant is partly why Franny’s can now do pasta right. Right, but not flawlessly. A pork ragù in one dish was slightly gummy, and the restaurant’s apparent determination not to overcook noodles leads to undercooking them at times. But the carbonara sauce on top of al dente bucatini was almost ideal, neither stinting on eggy richness nor turning the bucatini into a gluey mess. Equally on target was the saltiness of pasta alla chitarra with butter and bottarga. Franny’s earliest supporters weren’t impulsive. They were prescient, and they’re going to have to keep making room for more recruits to the religion. Franny’s ** 295 Flatbush Avenue (Prospect Place), Prospect Heights, Brooklyn; (718) 230-0221.

442,Braeburn,★,20081223,Frank Bruni,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/24/dining/reviews/24rest.html,"RESTAURANTS that have opened in downtown Manhattan over the last decade tend to fall into one of two categories. There are those that worship in the Church of Carrie Bradshaw. And those that honor Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm. Braeburn, named for an apple, is Rebecca almost all the way, with maybe half of a heel of a Manolo thrown in. You’re going to be stunned to hear this, but along some walls are horizontal panels of what looks like reclaimed barn wood, the genre’s inevitable rustic flourish. (It’s actually — even better! — from a tobacco shed.) Many servers dress in checked or plaid  shirts: corn-pone chic. And what defines the otherwise plain main dining room is a painting of a white house with a red  barn  and fleecy sheep, the livestock color-coordinated with the domicile. Apparently all of us who make ruinous housing payments to be a part of Warhol’s city really dream of Wyeth’s world, at least when dinnertime rolls around. We want not only farm-fresh ingredients but also farm-evocative décor. And that’s much of what Brian Bistrong, the chef and one of two principal owners of Braeburn, delivers, with an earnestness that’s palpable, often pleasurable and also a little dull. Before Braeburn Mr. Bistrong ran the kitchen at the Harrison, where his cooking had less subtlety but more muscle. Maybe that reflected the guiding spirit of its owner, Jimmy Bradley, bullish about keeping his restaurants in a crowd-pleasing groove. Braeburn is Mr. Bistrong’s show, and so far he, along  with John-Paul O’Neil, an alumnus of not only the Harrison but also Blue Hill,  has been running it in a slightly timid, confused way. While some dishes on his short menu were the products of clear  ambition —  a quail appetizer, for example, that compresses an entire bird’s worth of meat and flavor into a horizontal column that recalls a sausage  —  others came across as underachievers in  conception as well as execution. A Bibb lettuce salad made its unpersuasive case with little more than toasted pumpkin seeds. While some dishes communicated blunt down-home goodness, others were assembled or presented in intricate, precise fashions that sent a much more nuanced message and asked you to summon a much less freewheeling mood. Some portions were sizable, some stinting. And the overall feel of the place is neither that of an easygoing neighborhood haunt nor that of a destination restaurant. None of this  is to say that there isn’t some memorable eating. Although I wished there was more of it, I loved that quail, and in another appetizer, Mr. Bistrong had scored and lightly floured the two scallops  so that what they had on top wasn’t so much a sear as a crown, golden and regal. The house-smoked brook trout had a gorgeous texture, although perhaps too many hangers-on: Asian pear, pecans, a horseradish sauce and some apple, befitting the restaurant’s name. As for entrees, the juicy “rack of pork”  —  a chop with semantic pretensions  —  had just the right amount of fat skirting it, while medallions  of seared duck breast were rimmed by just the right amount of skin with just the right degree of crispness. But for almost every successful dish there was a modest disappointment: something that missed its mark or simply didn’t seem to be taking aim at anything worth sweating over. The grapefruit and avocado with peekytoe crab were precisely the kind of company it usually keeps. I felt I had eaten this appetizer a half-dozen times before. A starter of calamari, meanwhile, was a surprise, because I could barely taste the squid, lost in an unruly heap of frisée, Serrano ham and piquillo pepper. A weekly entree special of chicken pot pie was a soupy snooze, while codfish, beautifully cooked but blandly seasoned, was shown up by the shrimp dumplings with which it shared its  bowl. The representative steak on the menu, a rib-eye, promised a certain fatty richness, but delivered an unexpectedly stringy, tough wedge of meat. And the Fuji applesauce with a main course of skate tasted like something that had been destined for the pork chop but had taken a wrong turn. Apples and more apples: there were a half-dozen apple ciders on hand, both sweet and hard, and  my favorite dessert, which made up for  the strangely wan chocolate bread pudding, paired doughnut holes with an apple-cider syrup   for  dunking. Grapes and more grapes: Braeburn’s wine list, on which there’s plenty in the $40 to $60 range, traffics in more varietals from more countries than most lists of its medium-size length. It’s a sign of the restaurant’s scrupulousness and good intentions, which endear it to you   even as you find yourself wishing you could get more excited about it."
445,Standard Grill,★★,20090929,Pete Wells,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/dining/reviews/30rest.html,"DOESN’T your heart sink a little when you hear the words “Here’s a little something from the chef”? I know I’m ungrateful, but when I find myself spooning sunchoke froth from a demitasse I wonder why the chef couldn’t send out a little something I actually want, like six cold oysters or a nice sausage. Dan Silverman, the chef at the Standard Grill in the meatpacking district, does not make that mistake. At dinner, as the main courses are being set down, he sends out a cast-iron platter of fried potatoes dressed with pimentón mayonnaise, his spin on patatas bravas, the tapas bar classic. Crisp, smoky, spicy and very hard to resist, this little something rounds out the meal rather than slowing it down. Small grace notes like this have helped the Standard Grill play to robust crowds since it opened three months ago. It is not the place I would send friends who want to study the latest contortions of the yoga masters of haute cuisine. But it is exactly where I would direct anybody who needs to recharge by plugging straight into the abundant, renewable energy source that is downtown Manhattan. This was not a foregone conclusion when Mr. Silverman teamed up with the Standard Grill’s owner, André Balazs. Mr. Balazs operates remorselessly stylish hotels in California, New York and Florida, and with them, a number of restaurants. Yet none of them really established Mr. Balazs as a restaurateur. The Standard Grill, adjoining his Standard Hotel, does. The rambling menu doesn’t always cohere, and the waiters can be unequal to their jobs, but somehow none of that matters much. The pair had the great luck to open their restaurant just under the High Line and the good sense to know what to do there. A location beneath a disused railroad trestle is not an automatic ticket to success. But this trestle has been transformed into a pedestrian park that is one of the most exciting promenades in the city, and the design of the Standard Grill taps this excitement. Windows in the dining room look north and south, taking in the steel underbelly of the High Line and the endless human circus of the walkers drawn to it. Few of them will end their stroll with a meal at the Standard Grill, unless they booked well ahead. Those who did, and who survive the line at the host’s pulpit to be granted entrance to the inner dining room, find themselves in a handsome, big-city space that invokes either the Grand Central Oyster Bar or, less romantically, a subway platform at rush hour. The tiled, barrel-vaulted ceiling makes for treacherous acoustics. At times conversations across the room are beamed directly to your table. Sitting by the open kitchen one night, we heard an expediter shouting out orders as if he were communicating with cooks in Jersey City. With 100 seats in this room, another 100 in an even noisier antechamber, and 85 more on the sidewalk, it is a marvel that the kitchen reliably bangs out solid, flavorful food. Mr. Silverman, a veteran of Lever House, Alison on Dominick Street and Union Square Cafe, may be overqualified for cooking at a mess hall. But, as in archery, high-volume restaurants must aim above the bull’s-eye to allow for the effect of gravity. Like the potatoes, some of the best dishes show the chef’s fluency with ingredients from Spain. Their casual integration alongside French and Italian ideas on the menu is vivid testimony that Spanish cuisine has entered New York’s vernacular. Wax beans often leave me wanting something more, and Mr. Silverman provides it, tossing them with miniature coins of chorizo. I sank my spoon with pleasure into a velvety white gazpacho, although I wished it hadn’t been garnished so freely with onions, grapes, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers and almonds that it threatened to become more salad than soup. It was not the only item that seemed to suffer some kind of identity disorder. A vegetable plate with wild mushrooms, corn and airy herb dumplings came with plenty of broth, but not the soup spoon it needed. And, like the sweet, tender ravioli of peas served with pistachios and mint, it was sold as an entree, but ate more like an appetizer, in portions that were put to shame beside a generous plank of grilled trout or a fillet of swordfish grilled, like tuna, to a flattering medium rare. We did ask for a spoon, and our server responded with a quick and chipper, “Absolutely!” Her smile went a long way, as did the good cheer of most of the staff, in making up for frequent wobbles. An iceberg wedge was ordered as a side dish but showed up just before desserts. Espresso arrived without sugar, and empty cocktail glasses hung around on the table until the check was paid. What is billed as “million dollar” roasted chicken for two cost $32 and occasioned a service failure you wouldn’t expect if you were paying 99 cents. The chicken was set down before me in a cast-iron skillet. I did not get a plate, nor did the friend who was sharing it with me until he spoke up, and then he was given one scaled for an appetizer. We didn’t blame the overwhelmed waiter, but we did want to wrap him in a warm blanket and pack him into a cab with the names of a few restaurants that give the staff more than 30 seconds of training before sending them into battle. The place is full of small oddities: the restrooms that look unisex, but aren’t; the disc jockey in a glass booth whose tunes don’t play in the dining room; the very good chocolate mousse that you are meant to eat with a big rubber spatula. Does any of this make sense? No. Does it, against the odds, add up to a worthwhile restaurant? Absolutely. The Standard Grill ★ 848 Washington Street (West 13th Street), (212) 645-4100.

450,Mission Chinese Food,★★,20120724,Pete Wells,Lower East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/dining/reviews/mission-chinese-food-nyc-restaurant-review.html,"LED ZEPPELIN was thumping and moaning at stadium volumes inside Mission Chinese Food. Everybody knew what Robert Plant was thinking: I am a traveler of both time and space To be where I have been. As for our little group, it wasn’t as clear. We were sitting below the wooden chairs and the Chinese dragon that hang from the ceiling, shouting into one another’s faces, gesturing like mimes and attempting to put an order together. They talk of days for which they sit and wait All will be revealed. Outside on Orchard Street, they were waiting, all right, with plenty of time to peer in at the backlighted takeout-style pictures of kung pao pastrami and ma po tofu. Beneath the photos was a keg, and free beer in plastic cups for anybody who could fit inside the door. Unseen others were sitting in bars nearby, wondering whether they would order a third round before the phone rang. When the call came at last, they would return to Mission Chinese Food, go down a few steps, pass behind a curtain and enter a narrow corridor separated from the kitchen by one long window. It must have been hot as a forest fire in the kitchen, because the burners were raging and Danny Bowien, the chef, was in swim trunks. All I see turns to brown As the sun burns the ground. Hot woks run fast. Minutes after we’d ordered, our table was covered with plates. The ma po tofu that had looked impressive on the menu board was staggering in real life. Ivory cubes of bean curd were sunk deep inside quantities of simmered pork and fermented fava paste under a shimmering lake of chile oil. It burned and buzzed in the pulsating manner of Sichuan, but in China the meat would be a mere seasoning. Mr. Bowien’s version emphasized and amplified the pork to the point where it knocked you down and left you happily breathless. We cooled down for a minute with smashed cucumbers that had the old-fashioned tang of barrel-fermented Lower East Side half-sours. Then came the cumin lamb, and conversation (never exactly free-flowing) ceased completely. Hissing on a hot iron platter were pickled long beans, powerfully fragrant fresh bay leaves, sticky dates that we chewed as if they were taffy, and slabs of lamb breast, thick cut around a bone that jutted out like a stick from a Popsicle. Robert Plant was keening now. He wanted to take me there, baby baby. But I was there already, a lamb rib in one hand. Mr. Bowien does to Chinese food what Led Zeppelin did to the blues. His cooking both pays respectful homage to its inspiration and takes wild, flagrant liberties with it. He grabs hold of tradition and runs at it with abandon, hitting the accents hard, going heavy on the funk and causing all kinds of delicious havoc. The story of how Mr. Bowien — the Korean-born, Oklahoma City-raised, retired indie band frontman; dark-horse world champion of pesto; Food Network reject, and serial workaholic — ended up pillaging and celebrating Chinese cuisine does not follow a straight line. In brief, he and a collaborator, Anthony Myint, were reverse engineering the cuisine of celebrated restaurants from around the world. They did this two nights a week in a not particularly celebrated Chinese restaurant in the Mission District of San Francisco. Somehow this led to their deciding to invent what Mr. Bowien came to call “Americanized Oriental food” with the blessing of the restaurant’s owners, who dished out chow mein in the same dining room. The rest can be told in a montage: Long lines. Newspaper and magazine clippings. The Manhattan skyline. Because he more or less makes stuff up, Mr. Bowien is free to hallucinate dishes like kung pao pastrami, with a riotously smoky housemade pastrami. It’s laughably inauthentic, but the only reason you laugh while eating is because you can’t believe how well it plays out. He is also free to make his own mistakes. A recent take on mouthwatering chicken, a Sichuan classic, substituted a chicken roulade stuffed with pickled ramps for the traditional plain boiled chicken. But the roulade was so thickly sliced and tightly wrapped that there was almost nothing for the hot-and-numbing dressing to cling to. (Mr. Bowien apparently thought so, too, and now he uses poached chicken thigh.) And a delicate monkfish liver sashimi was trampled underfoot by an intense soy dipping sauce. Such stumbles are rare. More common is the random sequencing of the meal. Apart from the night our rice (steamed with nutty grains of barley) showed up just before the check, this was only a minor problem, but it did tend to pit subtle dishes against more fiery ones. You can guess which team lost. A version of chawanmushi, an egg custard topped with raw scallop, a little confetti of green apple and comma-sized basil seeds, was so quiet and defenseless I wanted to take it into another room and bolt the door. This is one downside of tearing an old cuisine away from a culture that has been working out ways to extract the most pleasure from a meal for centuries. But you can write off that loss when the upside brings dishes like the amazing salt-cod fried rice, rich with the oils of slowly poached mackerel that slick each grain of rice. Or the take on Sichuan fish and pickled vegetable stew. Mr. Bowien spikes the stew with peanuts boiled in Old Bay seasoning, which is both certifiably crazy and certifiably delicious. A bit like the rock stars who neglected to pay royalties to blues masters like Willie Dixon and Howlin’ Wolf, many American chefs have freely appropriated the cuisines of other cultures, repackaging them and selling them at a premium. They might do well to study the example of Mission Chinese Food, which gives 75 cents to a food bank for each entree sold. The restaurant could almost certainly charge twice as much as it does on Orchard Street, where currently the most expensive dish is $15 and where four people can eat like pashas for less than $100. The prices (like those at Pok Pok Ny, in Brooklyn, opened by another out-of-towner) should give some proprietors of other loud, cramped, chaotic local restaurants a shiver of guilt, and cause them to glance nervously over their shoulders. Charging fine-dining prices in a dive may bring you gold, but it won’t buy you a stairway to heaven."
451,Cendrillon,Two Stars,20050803,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/03/dining/reviews/cooking-without-concessions.html,"IN a city full of inquisitive diners ever eager for a change of pace, the Filipino restaurant Cendrillon should be attracting many more fans and much more interest than it does. It certainly shouldn't be only about one-sixth full, as it was during the first of the many recent times I dined there, or one-fifth full, as it was the third. Sure, summer can be cruel to restaurants, and, yes, Cendrillon is getting on in years. (It turns 10 this month.) Admittedly, there are a few too many unremarkable dishes on the menu, and the service can veer from poignantly attentive to epically absent-minded. But here's the thing, and it's no small thing: the food at Cendrillon doesn't taste like the food at other upscale Asian restaurants, because Cendrillon's chef and owner, Romy Dorotan, doesn't follow the dictates that more cautious restaurateurs do. Cendrillon's SoHo location and vaguely hip, loftlike décor would seem to augur Asian food tailored for a broad audience, which often means potent gusts of sweetness, pointed blasts of heat, a deluge of coconut milk, a riot of peanuts. But Cendrillon doesn't cook or act in predictable, populist, homogenized ways. It doesn't serve dishes that are merely anagrams of what's available a block or two in any direction. It makes choices that fly against the grain and leans on effects that are more intriguing than they are instantly appealing (and have a special merit for that reason). Countless other restaurants serve duck as slices of breast so trimmed, tender and red they could almost be mistaken for beef. Cendrillon glories in the layers of fat and thick skin that make a duck a duck. It air-dries the bird, encases it in kosher salt, cooks it in the oven at very high heat and then chops it into crunchy nuggets that can -- and should -- be eaten with your hands. Beyond that salty treat, Cendrillon favors sour notes, which it hits so hard and often that you experience a kind of taste revelation, realizing as never before just how far into the background of most cuisines these notes recede. Cendrillon probably uses as much vinegar per ounce of food as any restaurant in Manhattan, and uses it perhaps most memorably in its chicken adobo. The chicken is braised in a mixture of rice vinegar, soy sauce, garlic and Thai chili pepper, and then bathed in a reduction of that liquid, paired with coconut milk. But Mr. Dorotan employs restrained measures of the chili pepper and coconut milk, so that the tangy vinegar marches to the fore. The dish had a boldness that delighted me. Adobo is a classic Filipino stew, just as sour notes are a hallmark of Filipino cooking. They are often achieved through vinegar and sometimes through the use of certain fruits, like kalamansi, a sort of Filipino lime, which gets a thorough workout at Cendrillon. Kalamansi infuses a marinade for air-dried, jerky-like strips of meat in the beef tapa salad, another bracingly tangy treat. Kalamansi also infuses the marinade for the less appealing chicken inasal, essentially a barbecued chicken with most traces of sweetness eliminated. Mr. Dorotan told me in a telephone interview that Cendrillon is more Filipino, with more authentic or slightly tweaked Filipino dishes, than it was when it opened in 1995. (The following year, it received one star from Ruth Reichl in The New York Times.) In the beginning, he said, he thought of it as a pan-Asian experiment. He gave it a distinctly non-Filipino name, a reference to a French ballet about Cinderella. But, he said, his Filipino ancestry and the presence of Filipino flourishes on the menu prompted most writers to cast the restaurant in terms of Filipino cuisine, a mélange of Malaysian, Chinese and Spanish influences. So he nudged the restaurant farther in that direction over time. The Filipino dishes at Cendrillon include, at brunch, the bibingka, a soufflé-like mixture of ground rice, eggs and coconut milk, which Mr. Dorotan tops with Gouda and feta cheese, albeit sparingly, so that no one effect trumps any other. The result is subtle, nuanced and a good example of Mr. Dorotan's refusal -- either noble or stubborn, depending on your perspective -- to pander to diners' expectations. Another example, at dinner, is the oxtail kare-kare. It's a stew with tomatoes, ground peanuts and eggplant, among other ingredients, and many cooks would lean harder on those peanuts than Mr. Dorotan does. He uses them sparingly, because what's supposed to slap the dish to life -- and does -- is something less familiar and more challenging: a pungent fermented shrimp paste. Mr. Dorotan's one accommodation to timid diners is that he serves the paste on the side. Cendrillon has plenty of mass-appeal dishes, most of them just fine: deep-fried pork and shrimp spring rolls; a platter of smoked spare ribs; a lamb shank braised in coconut milk; pad Thai with grilled squid instead of the usual shrimp. It has disappointments, most notably the squash soup with crab dumplings, a feat of near-flavorlessness. But at prices extremely reasonable for its high-rent neighborhood, Cendrillon showcases ingredients that you don't encounter every other day at every other restaurant, like purple yam, which appears in a dessert tart and in an ice cream, and young coconut, which is used in a fantastic pie and in a gentle juice served at brunch. Cendrillon brushes mustard and miso across a fillet of fish but doesn't stop there. That coating, over striped bass, is the glue for a second, more exotic skin: a mixture of leeks and hijiki. Cendrillon may not be easy or sexy. But it's daring, different and a sure remedy for the malady, too widespread these days, of dining déjà vu. That has to matter, and that gives food lovers a real investment in the survival of this unconventional place.

454,Dressler,Two Stars,20060607,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/07/dining/reviews/for-grownups-not-gadabouts.html,"AS often as not, traveling to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, for dinner meant one of two things. You were bound for a proudly musty crowd-pleaser -- Bamonte's for red-sauce Italian, Peter Luger for that holy grail of porterhouses -- or you were looking to cadge some hipster luster. The new restaurant Dressler should change that. Dining there is worth crossing neighborhood lines, even crossing water, not because Dressler promises a fad-proof time capsule or dressed-down irreverence. Dressler promises, and delivers, something more difficult to pull off: food that's sophisticated without being too clever, in a room that's beautiful without being too flamboyant. Dressler may well turn out to be trendy, but it hasn't transparently set that goal for itself. In fact a friend who spends time in Williamsburg says many of the neighborhood's young denizens complain that Dressler is the kind of restaurant they would take their parents to. What they mean, I'm guessing, is that it's the kind of restaurant they would let their parents take them to. And what they're acknowledging is that Williamsburg has grown up. Just a stone's throw from Dressler towers the Gretsch Building, a former guitar factory that now houses million-dollar apartments, refugees from Manhattan and a celebrity or two. It's a safe bet that Dressler, in a space that was once a printer's shop and once an artist's studio, will become their go-to trough. It certainly has higher prices than DuMont, which has the same owner, Colin Devlin, and than Diner. But from a Manhattan perspective, part of Dressler's appeal is that it's a fair deal. I got a terrific entree of roasted chicken, its crisp skin rubbed with gremolata, its bountiful crew of seasonal sidekicks including asparagus and ramps, for $18. I got an appetizer salad of fried artichoke, white beans, Parmesan and arugula for $9, which was a bargain in terms of the pleasure I also received. Salads don't usually claim a prominent place in the memories you carry away from a restaurant. This one did, thanks to its freshness, its proportions and, even more so, its dressing, a creamy, fleetingly tangy blend of steamed artichoke hearts, lemon juice and sherry vinegar. For the most part the cooking at Dressler, supervised by Polo Dobkin and Cal Elliott, who worked at Gramercy Tavern, isn't wildly creative, and the menu, which wears the label of contemporary American, plays things somewhat safe. There's a familiar, sensible distribution of seafood, poultry, red meat and meatless pasta dishes. There's an inevitable evocation of Italy on this plate, France on that one. There's an inconsequential chopped salad with feta and olives, and of course there's a rib-eye, in this case supporting a tower of onion rings that are nearly big enough to double as Hula-Hoops. But predictable doesn't have to mean disappointing, at least not when the execution of dishes is as polished as it usually is at Dressler, not when a restaurant indulges you with as many first-rate ingredients as this one does. A flawlessly pan-roasted fillet of halibut was circled by a veritable catalog of beans: green and wax and cranberry and fava. Wild striped bass got an assist from Swiss chard, Yukon Gold potato, leeks, cockles and, to cinch the deal, bacon. There was reputedly a time when most fish dishes were trusted to stay afloat without the buoyancy of pork. But that was long ago. Speaking of beans and bacon, both had a hand in one of the best entrees, a grilled pork rib with fresh bacon, also known as pork belly, and white beans. But the triumphal touch was a bit of preserved lemon, which cut the stolid qualities of its companions. The best appetizer was smoked sturgeon, painted with crème fraîche, showered with sharp arugula and springy frisée, and placed over a slightly oily, very crunchy potato galette. It introduced untoward emotions at a table of sharers, each of whom monitored the others' bites and angled for the final morsels. I gallantly negotiated a peace pact, by which I mean I claimed those morsels for myself, maintaining that I needed to be more certain of the dish's delights. A critic's prerogative is a beautiful thing. Not every dish prompted such piggy deceit. There were a fair share of flubs by the kitchen at Dressler, which is named for the title character in Steven Millhauser's novel ""Martin Dressler: The Tale of an American Dreamer."" During one dinner I developed something of a Goldilocks complex because the spring pea soup with chilled lobster seemed much too warm, while strozzapreti with a veal ragù was definitely too cold. The leaden rolls deposited on my table another night could have functioned as doorstops, and the naming of the strawberry-rhubarb crisp had to be an attempt at irony, because its consumption would have been better aided by a straw than a spoon. But I loved the other desserts I tried, including a crème brûlée with tawny caramel-flavored custard and adorable little ginger cookies. I was impressed with the friendly service. And I was smitten by the dashing setting, a nexus of old-fashioned elegance and contemporary whimsy. With a zinc bar up front, a mosaic tile floor and big mirrors along one wall, Dressler has some of the vibe and shadings of a brasserie. But it also has mesmerizing metalwork -- in the grilles over lighting boxes and in the spidery, ornate arms of custom-made aluminum chandeliers -- that gives the dark room a romantic, seductively spooky charge. It's like a baby Balthazar made over by Anne Rice. As it happens, all the friends who accompanied me to Dressler were Manhattanites. All said they would head back on their own. I've heard similar statements before, especially after a few shared bottles of wine. But these pledges seemed less like boozy lip service than like clearheaded -- and prudent -- travel plans. Dressler  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  149 Broadway (Bedford Avenue), Williamsburg, Brooklyn; (718) 384-6343; dresslernyc.com. ATMOSPHERE -- A zinc bar, a mosaic tiled floor and ornate, custom-made aluminum chandeliers blend old-fashioned elegance and subtly funky romance.  SOUND LEVEL -- Significantly but not unbearably loud.  RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Artichoke and white bean salad; smoked sturgeon; scallops with citrus; halibut; roasted chicken; duck breast with braised leg; pork rib with fresh bacon; peanut butter and chocolate parfait; caramel crème brûlée; pistachio semifreddo.

469,LE,BERNARDIN,20050316,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/16/dining/reviews/only-the-four-stars-remain-constant.html,"THERE is reason to pity the nearly perfect. They have so many ways to falter. In thrall to their own legend, they might well overreach, trading glory for folly, or they might simply coast, converting acclaim into idle narcissism. They might allow self-assurance to bleed into arrogance and let down their guard against error. These are a few of the traps that Le Bernardin has faced -- and avoided -- for nearly two decades. It grabbed hold of four stars from Bryan Miller in The New York Times less than three months after it opened in early 1986 and has never let them slip from its grasp, maintaining its superior rating more than twice as long as any of the other New York restaurants in its elite company. (The runner-up, Jean Georges, earned four stars in mid-1997.) None of its peers have built legends so large and sturdy. All of its peers can learn from its example. Le Bernardin has aged with astonishing grace, more Deneuve than Dunaway, doing what it must to remain youthful without ever making an elastic fool of itself, staying true to its identity while adapting to changing times. Now as before, it is a high church of reverently prepared fish. But more than ever global currents inform and influence what emerges from a kitchen that can no longer be succinctly described as French. Consider one of the best appetizers, a ""progressive tasting"" of four fluke ceviches that turns into a world tour. Reading the plates from left to right, first up is fish that has been marinated in lime, cilantro and onion: Peru. Next, olive oil, tomato and basil are thrown into the mix: the Mediterranean. After that comes the addition of ponzu: Japan. And then the fish is finished with a splash of coconut milk: Thailand. The flavors of Asia have beguiled Eric Ripert, who has been the chef at Le Bernardin for more than a decade and at first worked alongside Gilbert Le Coze. (Mr. Le Coze died in 1994; his sister, Maguy, still helms the ship.) Asian accents are scattered throughout a menu that bears scant resemblance to the one in 1995, when Le Bernardin was last reviewed in The Times and received a fresh four stars from Ruth Reichl. Mr. Ripert enlivens a fantastic hamachi tartare with a ginger-coriander emulsion and wasabi-infused tobiko. Cardamom and yuzu make appearances in other dishes, joining a distinctly international cast. ""For a while our mantra at Le Bernardin was that the fish is the star,"" Mr. Ripert said in a telephone conversation after my visits to the restaurant, where he repeatedly recognized me. ""Today we are a little less fanatic about that."" A little but not a lot, and therein lies both the secret to Le Bernardin's continued success and the reason I regularly field complaints from friends who found their experiences there disappointing. Because of the restaurant's legend they expect a riot of flourishes, an explosion of fireworks. Nothing less than being made to levitate above the table will do. Le Bernardin does not work that way. Sure, it musters bits of incidental theater: in keeping with its French background it serves many appetizers and entrees with a final, fancy application of broth or sauce at the table. But it eschews high drama, both in the dining room, which has all the sex appeal of a first-class airport lounge, and in the dishes, many of which are paradigms of subtlety. Only with careful attention do you register and revel in Le Bernardin's grace notes: a trio of tiny arugula leaves, all precisely the same size and each perfectly equidistant from the others, which surround codfish, providing vaguely bitter, peppery, mintlike hints. You can absent-mindedly polish off an appetizer of barely poached lobster in a broth of butter, Champagne and chives and know that you are eating something good. Or you can pause, ponder and realize that you are eating something with an exquisite balance of colors, shapes and flavors. The amorphous clumps of sweet white lobster meat sit atop coin-shape bits of mango, which are orange and slightly acidic, and below rectangles of avocado, which are green and vaguely unctuous. The full Epicurean appeal of the dish reveals itself only upon close scrutiny. Le Bernardin is a restaurant for people who really focus on the food. It has made modern adjustments in addition to its journey into a wider world of flavors. A few years ago it changed its prix fixe dinner from three courses (appetizer, entree, dessert) to four smaller ones (two appetizers, entree, dessert), which better accommodate today's adventurous grazers. The savory courses are divided into three categories -- almost raw, barely touched and lightly cooked -- which underscore Le Bernardin's sustained belief in the sacredness of piscine flesh. The pastry chef, Michael Laiskonis, came aboard less than a year ago, and his exemplary desserts -- including crispy wafers layered with hazelnut and caramel and a dark chocolate, cashew and caramel tart -- stay true to the rest of the meal. They are sophisticated without being pretentious, multifaceted but not unduly fanciful. Mr. Ripert just turned 40 and has not lost any of his passion. Except for occasional appearances on the ""Late Show With David Letterman"" and his participation six years ago in an advertising campaign that featured chefs in the buff, he has sidestepped the more flamboyant manifestations of celebrity chefdom. He has resisted imperial impulses, confining most of his work outside Le Bernardin to consulting. His dedication shows. ""This is what sushi only wishes it could be,"" one dinner companion said as his fork all but sank of its own weight into an entree of wild salmon with an arrestingly vivid hue and taste. The fish inhabited a limbo between raw and rare, which was just where it belonged. You may encounter preparations at Le Bernardin with less ostentatious complexity than you expect, but you will never doubt that the fish is of the highest quality and has received the utmost care. Some dishes soar on the luxuriousness of their ingredients. ""This is a love affair,"" another dinner companion sighed as she savored a criminally opulent ragout of scallop, langoustine, clam, sea urchin and caviar, an appetizer that entails a $60 supplement to the $92 prix fixe. Other dishes excel because Mr. Ripert knows what makes a good match, knows monkfish is meaty enough to be married to a hearty paprika sauce but halibut needs something less forceful. He weds it to a lemon grass and coconut sauce, Asia entering the picture yet again. Le Bernardin may be the most confident restaurant in the city. Consider another of its best appetizers: thin layers of yellowfin tuna, foie gras and toasted baguette, which compose a symphony of crunch and ooze, hard and soft. Another restaurant would be tempted to go heavier on the foie gras, to go for broke. But Le Bernardin holds the ingredient and the effect in check, doing justice to the adjective ""tantalizing."" This restaurant's confidence also comes through in its portions, which are judiciously restrained, and in its service, which is expert but unintrusive. Epitomizing a certain kind of class, Le Bernardin amounts to the restaurant equivalent of old money, so secure in its station that it need not strut, so practiced in its posture that it never slouches. And yet it somehow avoids stodginess and complacency, a minor miracle that, for us diners, is a major blessing. LE BERNARDIN  155 West 51st Street, Midtown; (212)554-1515.

475,Mesa Grill,★,20080123,Frank Bruni,Flatiron,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/23/dining/reviews/23rest.html,"FOR one illustration of the chef Bobby Flay’s formidable celebrity, just check out the Food Network. He stars in, or appears on, three shows now in production, meaning you can’t watch for long without spotting his sunny face. For another illustration, head to your nearest Barnes & Noble. More than a half-dozen  books by Mr. Flay have been published, giving any kitchen adventurer a ready path to his sunny cooking. But for the best illustration, poke your head into Mesa Grill in Manhattan, the sunny restaurant that set all of this into dizzy motion. It was pretty much packed during each of my recent visits,  and yet I saw little reason  —  other than Mr. Flay’s star wattage  —  that it should be quite so popular. Mesa Grill, no question, has considerable charms. You can’t mix this many creative margaritas, put this much vivid color into the décor and the food, and tap this wide a variety of chilies without summoning a festive spirit. And there’s frequent evidence of sustained pride and caring. Every time I’ve had the restaurant’s signature pork tenderloin, glossed with a bourbon and ancho chile sauce,  the pork and its preparation were top-notch. Some of the meat and fish in other dishes  —  the raw tuna in a riff on nachos with a rich avocado cream; quail in an appetizer salad jazzed up with bacon  — reflect earnest concern with ingredients. But on balance Mesa Grill presents only flickers of the excitement it did in 1991, when it opened, or in 2000, when William Grimes gave it two stars in The Times. It’s an overly familiar, somewhat tired production. More to the point, it’s an inconsistent one. During one dinner the three slivers of chicken in the appetizer tacos were among the most shriveled, desiccated pieces of meat I’ve seen outside a bodega buffet at 3 a.m. No measure of the nifty peanut-thickened, chili-spiked barbecue sauce with them could save the day. At  another dinner the chicken for these tacos was plump and juicy, but the tacos shouldn’t have even been there. I had ordered something else, and two minutes after my guests and I were told that our long-in-coming appetizers were about to appear, the server announced that my selection was unavailable. The tacos were a last-minute substitution. A cauliflower gratin was wetter than bisque on a first try, nearly as dry as gravel on a second one. One time the meat in a blue corn pancake with a sauce of habanero chile and star anise was discernible as duck; weeks later it could have been  any bird or beast contributing a generic fleshy texture rather than a distinct flavor. Service could be sluggish or disconcertingly fast. Appetizers once appeared about  three minutes after they were ordered, suggesting preparations less fresh than a diner might want. Checks were repeatedly dropped before they had been  requested. I wonder if Mr. Flay has taken his eye off Mesa Grill, and not just because I never spotted him there. A celebrity chef can govern effectively in absentia, and diners are as happy to bask in his aura as in his presence  —  an explanation for Mr. Flay’s ability to do business in places as diverse as Las Vegas and the Bahamas (there’s now a Mesa Grill in each). But his capacity for vigilance may be undercut by all the change in his world of late.  Real estate problems forced  him to close Bolo, his most acclaimed Manhattan restaurant, leaving just Mesa Grill and Bar Americain here. And he’s plotting what could wind up as an ambitious chain of burger restaurants. At the same time the margin for clumsiness at Mesa Grill is narrower than ever. The restaurant can no longer lean on novelty; its Southwestern swirl of peppery rubs and smoky glazes, of tropical sweetness and desert fire, has been popularized to the point of cliché. It informed the menus of Chi-Chi’s, Chili’s and Chipotle. And while that’s a credit to Mr. Flay, it’s also a burden. The saucing and seasoning of the busy dishes at Mesa Grill, which have always straddled the line between exuberant and chaotic, need to be executed with precision and nuance to be impressive. Very often they are, leading to delightful moments. I was riveted by the degree of heat, at once assertive and tempered, in the pale green broth for Mr. Flay’s answer to cioppino, a seafood stew. He combines jalapeño and poblano peppers and tomatillos to achieve this heat, and it doesn’t eclipse the vibrant presence of cilantro. Cilantro mingles beautifully with roasted garlic in the creamy, hugely flavorful combination of corn and tender shrimp in a corn tamale that’s been on the appetizer list since the beginning. By keeping the dish around, Mr. Flay isn’t being lazy, he’s being smart. He’s a real pro, and he’s shown that in recent years at Bar Americain, which opened in 2005 with a menu that included bursts of invention, and at Bobby Flay Steak, an Atlantic City mash-up of his other restaurants that, when I ate there around its start in 2006, put more energy into its food than it probably needed to. But some meals at Mesa Grill devolve into a redundant, vague haze of smokiness and syrupiness, the heat-with-sweet effects delivered in a blunt fashion. And some dishes, including a few desserts, feel as tossed off as a server’s answer to one of my questions one night. I asked her what the spices were  in the restaurant’s so-called 16-spice-crusted chicken. “Salt, pepper and 14 other spices!” she buoyantly reported, as if the details didn’t really matter. It was a Bobby Flay recipe, after all. Wasn’t that enough? Mesa Grill * 102 Fifth Avenue, near 15th Street; (212) 807-7400.

476,Trestle on Tenth,One Star,20060913,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/dining/reviews/a-welcoming-place-to-raise-a-glass.html,"AS a chef on a path to running his own restaurant, Ralf Kuettel did what anyone would expect, spending most of the last two decades in professional kitchens. He cooked at Union Square Cafe in its early years. He cooked at Cena before it closed. But it's the unexpected thing he did when he stepped away from the stove that had the most important impact on Trestle on Tenth, which he opened in Chelsea about two months ago. From 2001 to 2005, Mr. Kuettel wallowed in wine. He started out as a salesman at the Chelsea Wine Vault. Then he was the buyer and store manager there. His arc matters less than his destination. He became a grape geek of the most fetching, infectious kind. I say this not because I know him (I don't), but because I know the wine list he has put together for Trestle on Tenth, a principled document that favors small over large producers, spirited over lulling wines, adventure over surefire accessibility. While so many other wine lists seem to have been assembled by a computer program -- with France and California meted out in predetermined measure and enough generically velvety pinot noir to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool -- this one has a real point of view. On it you'll find as much cabernet franc as cabernet sauvignon, and you'll find more Italian lagreins (two) than Chiantis (none). You'll find a white wine called a savagnin from the Jura region of France, a red wine called a gamaret from Switzerland and other wines that seldom claim attention from wine-producing areas that seldom command adulation. And you'll have enough confidence in Mr. Kuettel's judgment to be tempted to order them, because when you do find a wine you know -- I spotted and drank a beloved Breton Bourgueil, Clos Sénéchal -- you'll recognize it as a prudent choice. What's more, you're likely to feel you can afford to take a chance. Most of the bottles on the list, which encompasses about 75 wines, are around or under $50, in part because Mr. Kuettel tends not to mark his wines up more than about double the retail price. That's gracious and reasonable, and it's a reason to single out Trestle on Tenth, an otherwise uneven neighborhood restaurant whose individualism doesn't work as well when it comes to food. The first part of its name refers to the High Line tracks nearby. The second part refers to the address of the restaurant, which extends the recently formed restaurant row on 10th Avenue a bit farther north. Mr. Kuettel is obviously betting on new development in the area: the low-key, unselfconsciously handsome environment he's fashioned from what used to be the Chelsea Commons is the kind of warm little hug that beckons those at hand. Diners who live more than a dozen blocks away can probably find these sorts of exposed brick walls, wide-plank wood floors and even a back garden like Trestle's closer to home. Mr. Kuettel was born and trained in Switzerland, and his menu, like his native country, is stamped with German and French influences. But what's most striking about it is the force with which it hits rebelliously hearty notes. It seems to anticipate winter long before the first frost, and it challenges vain, health-conscious New Yorkers to wade into the starchy and dive headlong into the flabby. Cuts of meat came with what must have been the legal limit of fat stippling, striping or skirting them. Each of three pudgy, pale red slices of meltingly tender saddle of lamb, for example, was encircled by a shockingly broad white border. I mention this not in protest but in gratitude, and it's in that same vein that I salute a bracingly rich crépinette that pulled together pulled pork shoulder, braised Savoy cabbage and an intense pork reduction. As for starchy indulgences, there was a side dish of dumplings called pizokel, pleasantly thickened with Gruyère. A crunchy potato pancake that accompanied sautéed veal kidneys in a Trappist ale sauce was the shape and size of half a Frisbee. It was also an example of the way homey joins hearty as one of the menu's guiding adjectives. Trestle on Tenth is the kind of restaurant at which, no matter what you ate, you feel as if you had brisket. Sure, there are two salads on the dinner menu, but the good one showered a rich buttermilk dressing and hunks of bacon over butter lettuce. The other salad, a collection of field greens with a sherry vinaigrette, was a wan throwaway. Yes, there's fish, but it didn't stand out. And in the cases of both an appetizer of Arctic char gravlax and a salmon entree, there were additional elements -- pumpernickel bread for the char, lentils and horseradish for the salmon -- that turned the dishes into heavier affairs. In fact too much at Trestle on Tenth didn't stand out or succeed. A restaurant with a lineup of dishes this peculiar and concise (about eight appetizers and eight entrees) can't afford to serve an oxtail and pig's foot terrine as gelatinous and unfocused as the one here. Or a cauliflower soup, sautéed frogs' legs, a roasted chicken and a sirloin steak as bland. It needs a stronger finish than it gets from a merely serviceable roster of desserts -- the worst being an alarmingly sour chocolate cake. But before that final act, there's plenty of available pleasure, including the selections on the wine list, commendably tailored to the robustness and pedigree of the food. It's predominantly European and emphasizes colder climes in its search for wines with more structure and presence than immediate fruitiness. It doesn't pander by trotting out oak-choked, numbingly buttery California chardonnays, and when I was there (the list changes), there wasn't a pinot grigio to be had. All in all this list is a model of what a restaurateur can do without tons of money or storage space. He can target affordable discoveries. Coax diners to take chances. And keep secrets from his wife. Mr. Kuettel is married to Juliette Pope, the beverage director for Gramercy Tavern. In a telephone interview, he said that if he happens across two cases of a treasured wine, ""I might snag the first case and tell her there's a second."" ""But generally,"" he added with a laugh, ""I don't."" Trestle on Tenth  * [Rating: One Star]  242 10th Avenue (24th Street), Chelsea; (212) 645-5659. ATMOSPHERE -- A bar near the entrance, a garden out back, lots of exposed brick and wide-plank wood floors create a warm, casual feel.  SOUND LEVEL -- A very lively buzz.  RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Pork crépinette; butter lettuce with buttermilk; lamb saddle; veal kidneys; pork loin; pizokel with Gruyère; beets; strawberry sundae; walnut and caramel torte.

480,Adour Alain Ducasse,★★★,20080416,Frank Bruni,Midtown East,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/16/dining/16rest.html,"ALAIN DUCASSE may never live down the grandiose way he first swept into town, granting blinkered New Yorkers a vision of French elegance few of them had ever experienced, expected or, for that matter, asked for. He may never live down those pens. During the early days of Alain Ducasse at the Essex House, his 2000 debut, diners were presented with the choice of a dozen fancy ones for signing the stratospheric check: a cuckoo coda to an evening of ample eye rolling. Over the six and a half years that the restaurant survived, it never quite thrived. Now Mr. Ducasse is taking a new chance. He’s also possibly making amends, or at least that was my thought when, during my first dinner at Adour Alain Ducasse in the St. Regis New York, I spotted the little bagel. It came with and sat beside a sublime cauliflower velouté, having nothing, really, to do with it. So why was it there? Maybe as a peace offering, half genuine and half winking. Maybe as a signal to wary New Yorkers that he knows full well which city he’s in and where its tolerance for Gallic fussbudgets taps out. Adour opened in late January, and it will be followed next week by another new Manhattan restaurant from Mr. Ducasse, Benoit, specializing in hearty bistro classics. Together they mark his reengagement with New York, where his  phenomenal international acclaim hasn’t yielded a solid hit. Both his Essex House venture and a subsequent one, Mix, struggled and perished. This time around he’s taking a less flamboyant approach, and he’s eager to get out that message, so much so that advance reports on Adour, named for a river in France, made it sound like an embellished wine bar. Right. It’s a wine bar the way Lourdes is a roadside shrine, and it proves that even a dressed-down Mr. Ducasse is still a puffed-up anybody else. Under the direction of the Rockwell Group, the regal space in the St. Regis that was once home to Lespinasse has become a decorative homage to wine, with pinot noir-colored fabric on chairs, bottles stacked in gleaming coolers around the main dining room and grapevine images etched into shimmering glass screens over the walls. There’s a corridor upholstered in leather, a host stand made of bronze, a mural with inlaid mother-of-pearl and a median entree price (on a recent menu) of $39. But you’ll notice a relative straightforwardness in many preparations that distinguishes Adour from its Essex House ancestor. And among a well-edited collection of dishes that range from quietly appealing to quietly stunning, you won’t notice that forebear’s ostentation. Some diners have responded with yawns, accusing Mr. Ducasse and Tony Esnault, the chef supervising the kitchen night to night, of dullness. If Adour is dull, it’s dull mainly in the context of what Mr. Ducasse previously attempted and what New Yorkers previously resisted. Can the man win? I think so, and I consider Adour a qualified victory. It’s not through-and-through rapturous, but it’s first-rate: polished service, a knockout wine list, beautiful oil-poached cod, gorgeous roasted lamb and exquisite desserts, courtesy of Sandro Micheli, the pastry chef. The last part of a meal at Adour is arguably the best, because  you get to savor the tart glory and tropical top notes of Mr. Micheli’s “contemporary exotic vacherin,” with  layers of mango marmalade, passion fruit sorbet and coconut meringue. For another layered masterpiece, he puts a warm chocolate sauce over vanilla ice cream, which covers an espresso ice, which in turn covers chocolate sorbet. Brioche croutons bob in this stippled, dark sea. An affected-sounding “raspberry composition” turns out to be unpretentious, raspberries over crème brûlée over pastry. There’s also yuzu sorbet, but on the side. It has a sharp, clean citrus taste. And it encapsulates what I remember most fondly about most of my favorite dishes here: the way one flavor, one ingredient or just a few rang clear and true. Take that velouté, which has a creamy texture but tastes entirely of cauliflower, cut with some lemon, the acidity of which insures against any, well, dullness. Or take a sweetbreads appetizer. There’s an amusingly sculptured egg  —  it’s a dead ringer for a head of garlic  —  with the organ meat, and there are wild mushrooms and a veal jus afoot. But what anchors and exalts the dish are the sweetbreads themselves, intense and succulent, with that wonderful faint undertone of funk. Lamb isn’t densely crusted or lavishly sauced; it’s just skirted with tiny triangles of red piquillo pepper and circles of golden apricot. They’re ideal companions for each other and for the robust meat, and they form their own vivid mosaic. Things occasionally get more complicated. To add dimension and opulence to an entree of striped bass, the kitchen concocts not only a foam of shellfish stock, milk and butter but also a sauce with vin jaune, a wine from the Jura that’s like a dry sherry. Around the bass are clams and sweet shrimp: more of the ocean’s brine and breath. And the signature appetizer is ravioli filled with foie gras and tapioca pearls, and sauced with a sunchoke foam, its earthy, neutral presence keeping the richness in check. Things also go (slightly) wrong. Should venison medallions be this bland? Shouldn’t the beef tenderloin with a brick of glazed rib meat be truer to its name? The wine list is a consolation. Don’t be taunted and daunted by the $800 showboats; look through the principal book and the additional “cellar book” for  bargains. I found appealing white Burgundies in the $50 range and, for the same price, a leathery, peppery 1999 Châteauneuf-du-Pape. Information about wine can be summoned via an interactive, touch-screen surface on a bar up front that the restaurant has done a lot of crowing about. But I never found a spot at that altar. With just four seats, it has limited utility. It’s all about flash, proving that some of the old Ducasse still lives in the new.

486,The Harrison,★★,20080528,Frank Bruni,TriBeCa,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/28/dining/reviews/28rest.html,"“I haven’t had anything I didn’t like,” said one of my tablemates as she reflected on the meal we were just finishing at the Harrison, and her tone  communicated surprise and significant regard. What sounded in one sense like faint praise was actually a major compliment. The rest of us nodded like dashboard figurines. We agreed with her assessment, and we, too, didn’t consider it a throwaway one. How often, really, do you go through four appetizers, entrees and desserts without confronting a total bore, a total bust or an overwrought underachiever? Take it from someone who spends as many hours dining out as a cat does dozing: not often. Even the best, most exciting restaurants stumble from time to time over their own ambitions. They’re exhilarating rides, but also risky ones. The Harrison, in contrast, is the very definition of dependable, poised to impress you, if not quite wow you, with a hefty, juicy “English-cut” lamb chop that might well be the famous Keens Steakhouse mutton chop just before the age of consent. It will give you calf’s liver done the right way, the smart way, in that it’s cut thick enough to make sure that the meat doesn’t wind up chalky or leathery. And its chicken, glossed with Meyer lemon, will come to you crisp and tender, and it will come that way time and again. That’s not to say that anything you order is 100 percent guaranteed to satisfy. I’m talking here about a restaurant, not a fairy tale. But it’s a restaurant that stays true to the conservative, honorable niche it’s carved out, which is that of a contemporary American bistro where you won’t have trouble spotting something appealing on the menu, and won’t be puzzled when it arrives. It’s also a restaurant with as much going for it as ever, thanks in large part to the exemplary work being done by the chef, Amanda Freitag, who came on board in January. She’s the restaurant’s third executive chef in its six and a half years, following Brian Bistrong, who followed Joey Campanaro. Mr. Campanaro, now one of the principal owners of the Little Owl and Market Table, was there at the start, when the Harrison received two stars in The Times from William Grimes. What an anxious, difficult start that was. The Harrison opened shortly after Sept. 11, 2001, when the going for TriBeCa restaurants was extremely tough. It encountered a different kind of turbulence two years ago when its owners, the chef Jimmy Bradley and the restaurateur Danny Abrams, dissolved their business partnership, with Mr. Bradley maintaining control of the Red Cat and the Harrison. Ms. Freitag has been asked, just as Mr. Campanaro and Mr. Bistrong were, to filter her own ideas through his straightforward sensibility and unmannered style. Unsurprisingly, she and he turn out to be a good match. Both have long been in thrall to Italy  — she ran the kitchens at Sette in Park Slope and, later, Gusto in Greenwich Village  — and both understand that so-called new American cooking has a lot of old Mediterranean in it. Her menu at the Harrison makes that especially clear. And its evolution over recent months has been prudent. An appetizer of ricotta dumplings is gone, and good riddance: it took the current push to contrive ever-softer gnocchi and gnudi to a near-liquid point of overkill. It’s O.K. to have dumplings in soup, but not to have them be soup. What popped up subsequently was another Italianate appetizer, delicate (and suitably firm) raviolini filled with lobster and crawfish. This dish plies the Grand Canal by way of Bourbon Street, its sauce combining tomato, shellfish stock, cayenne and paprika. One recent night’s special of rigatoncini, a smaller version of rigatoni, was sauced with a hearty lamb ragu, coarsely grated pecorino and fresh ricotta. Nothing delicate there. And nothing wrong with that. It’s worth noting, among other appetizers, how often the words crispy or fritter appear, signaling the Harrison’s populist bent, its awareness that breaded or fried objects are a sure path to many a diner’s heart. Pay special heed to the crispy shrimp, naughtier than run-of-the-mill fried shrimp. They’re essentially meaty, rectangular shrimp cakes, bound with cream and butter and dipped in panko. The kitchen tends to put only a slight spin on most main courses. The lamb chop is marinated in anchovy as well as rosemary. Some rosemary and onion join the Meyer lemon in seasoning the chicken, but that’s about it. A grilled New York strip steak gets more decadent treatment: a cloak of marrow, butter and shallots. But its beefy essence is enhanced rather than subverted by this flourish. The pork chop doesn’t make as strong an impression, and the only truly captivating fish entree is a fillet of Arctic char. It receives what is, in the context of the Harrison, an unusual flurry of attention: a grapefruit gastrique, grapefruit segments, black trumpet mushrooms, a salsify puree. The players and flavors mingle beautifully. There are sides worth embracing, primary among them the fries cooked in duck fat. The dessert list has just been reinvigorated by a newly appointed pastry chef, Colleen Grapes, an alumnus of the Red Cat. Her chocolate tart, with its pretzel-dough crust and a potato-chip plume on top, demonstrates her rightful appreciation of salty with sweet. Although Mr. Bradley has had the black walnut throughout the restaurant buffed and made other updates, the Harrison’s visual evocation of a country inn in the big city still strikes me as more stodgy than cozy. And its soundtrack, too heavy on pop rock from 15 to 25 years ago, needs help. It’s neither classic nor cool. Just odd. But service isn’t merely attentive; it’s aerobic. During the TriBeCa Film Festival, when the restaurant was slammed, waiters and bartenders raced around fleetly enough to qualify for Beijing. Like the Red Cat, which is technically its older sibling but feels like its younger one, the Harrison doesn’t promise or deliver out-and-out excitement. But it safeguards against disappointment as well as just about any other Manhattan restaurant. Faint praise? Nah. Just modulated. And, I should add, genuine. The Harrison ** 355 Greenwich Street (Harrison Street), TriBeCa; (212) 274-9310.

490,Kawi,★★,20190528,Pete Wells,Hudson Yards,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/dining/kawi-restaurant-review.html,"You will find Kawi, the latest Momofuku restaurant, on the fifth floor of 20 Hudson Yards, assuming you stay determined and swallow back the urge to run for the exits that may grip you as you negotiate escalators that don’t connect to one another, elevators that are hidden out of sight like somebody’s crazy grandfather and shiny retail windows that seem to be trying to provoke a class war. By the time people reach Kawi they tend to look rattled; New Yorkers who will easily weave their way around broken sidewalks, potholes, garbage piles and al fresco rat conventions come undone when faced with the interior of a shopping mall. Kawi, now two months old, can be disorienting in its own way, but at least you can have a seat and a drink while you get your bearings. Space there is used, or not used, the way it is in Las Vegas. There’s a very long bar behind a line of black, geometric bar stools receding toward the vanishing point; low lounge tables; taller, square wood tables; round wood tables; black-leather booths; red-leather booths; red-leather banquettes; and a row of chairs facing a kitchen counter. Between all this furniture are aisles wide enough for a Zamboni. All those seats have backs, too. Kawi is loaded with the comforts and accommodations that critics, including me, were begging Mr. Chang to pay more attention to as recently as the opening of Nishi three years ago. Has anybody complained before that a David Chang restaurant was too quiet? They’re saying it about Kawi. If there is anybody left who still thinks of Mr. Chang as a downtown punk, Kawi will clear up that misconception. The early Momofuku restaurants were skateboards; Kawi is a minivan with sliding doors, armrests, cupholders and Don Henley on the stereo. The ride may not be as fast, but it’s a lot smoother. Kawi is also the first Momofuku restaurant in New York to address Korean cuisine head on and at length. Majordomo, which opened in Los Angeles last year, is at least half Korean, but the menu is loaded up with other stuff, a lot of which is big and showy and seemingly designed to dazzle the high rollers. It can be hard to remember you’re eating galbi-jjim after a server buries it beneath a tableside avalanche of shaved raclette. Eunjo Park, Kawi’s executive chef, avoids this type of distraction. This is lucky, because she makes food that you want to concentrate on. Before joining the Momofuku stable, she worked in the formal and highly fastidious kitchens of Daniel, Le Bec-Fin and Per Se. She later returned to South Korea, where she had lived until she was 12, for advanced studies at the Seoul restaurant Gaon and at the kitchen of the Chunjinam hermitage, presided over by Jeong Kwan, certainly the most celebrated cooking Zen nun in her country. A strong interest in tradition marks Ms. Park’s food at Kawi. Her dishes are set apart from versions you may have had before by the exactitude of the technique and the quality of the ingredients. One section of her menu is turned over to kimbap, those wide, nori-wrapped sushi rolls often spotted at salad bars, languishing under plastic wrap. Most kimbap is designed to be portable, filling and inexpensive. Ms. Park’s kimbap, on the other hand, is built for pleasure. She has a pickled vegetable kimbap on the lunch menu that is truly exciting; you are meant to dip it in a dark liquid that tastes a bit like soy sauce but is made with beets. The dinner menu brings kimbap filled with chives, pickled daikon, citrus jelly and a buttery pink vein of foie gras terrine. Has this really never been done before, you wonder as you eat it, and if not, why not? Among the other gussied-up raw fish that you expect in Momofukuland, like a refreshing if somewhat staid madai tartare, are some dime-size clams in chile sauce and an elegant, inspired interpretation of gejang. Blue crab legs and claw are cracked and given a three-day soak in soy sauce, among other things, which gives them an impressive amount of flavor. Then, in case you haven’t noticed that you’re dealing with a real chef, Ms. Park stirs the crab’s roe with creamy rice and spoons this Korean risotto into the open belly of the shell. At moments like this, or in the hwedupbap filled with raw fish as strikingly good as any you’ll find in a $200 omakase, or in the doenjang jjigae, a potful of braised fermented bean paste with pork belly that appears on the menu as “yesterday’s stinky soybean stew” and manages to be homespun and polished at the same time, it’s possible to see Kawi as Ms. Park’s response to Atomix. It’s as if she had looked at Junghyun Park’s dazzlingly complex compositions at his year-old modern Korean restaurant and decided that she could cook in a style that was every bit as modern and painstaking, but that instead of turning traditional dishes into tasting-menu food she would keep the old forms and innovate inside them. With her tidy, refined, French-influenced neo-traditionalism, Ms. Park could become something like the Alain Ducasse of Korean cooking. It’s not obvious, though, that Kawi needs an Alain Ducasse. Certain appetizers seem to belong on another planet, more beautiful and gentle than ours, such as the soft tofu with soy syrup that, sitting under a shattering thin crust of caramelized sugar, is like a savory crème brûlée by way of Seoul. And there are others, such as the sticks of fried cod that a server pointlessly snips in half with scissors and then spritzes with atomized yuzu juice, that are right at home at Hudson Yards. The presentation seemed forced. That could also describe the boiled chicken dish, one of the menu’s showiest items and, at $64, one of its most expensive. The whole bird is steamed, then the breast is sliced and served plain while the dark meat is fried and coated with spices. Neither is spectacular on its own, and the combination is bizarre. More successful versions of elaborate, oversize, multicomponent dishes are proven moneymakers elsewhere in the Momofuku republic. But arm-waving platters like that seem out of place at Kawi, which is the least Momofukian of the Momofukus. The most uncharacteristic thing of all is that the dining room has never been operating at anything close to capacity, at least when I’ve been there. Maybe tables are being kept off the reservation books to give the cooks time to learn where the spice cabinet is. Or maybe the fans who are so devoted to Mr. Chang’s downtown spots are still trying to figure out the escalators.

493,Park Avenue Autumn,★★,20071010,Frank Bruni,Upper East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/10/dining/reviews/10rest.html,"IF you believe the news releases and buy into the lore, half the chefs in the city practically sleep in tents in Union Square, the better to hit the Greenmarket at sunrise and snap up the snap peas before some upstart from a 12-seater in the East Village does. Every April they forage for first trimester ramps, hustling them onto early-spring menus. They pounce on rhubarb the nanosecond it’s ready, heirloom tomatoes the instant they’re ripe. And their restaurants trumpet missions in extra-crunchy tune with Mother Nature and her earthbound messiah, Alice Waters. So how does any one establishment stand above its seasonal peers? It proves its seasonality from the outside in. It gets seasonality into its skin as well as its soul. I hereby introduce you to Park Avenue Autumn. A few weeks ago it was Park Avenue Summer, a few months from now it will be Park Avenue Winter. After that it will be Park Avenue Spring — you get the drift. Then the cycle begins anew, if all goes well. It should, because Park Avenue Look-at-the-Weather-and-Fill-In-the-Blank has more than a striking gimmick. It has some terrific food and a talented executive chef, Craig Koketsu. But who knows? Ours is a fickle restaurant economy, and that’s part of the message of this restaurant’s quarterly reincarnations, which are an ode to, and an expansion of, the original vision for the Four Seasons. Before you can get bored of the restaurant, it will close for a few days, then unveil a new décor, new server uniforms and a tweaked name on the awning, no matter how expensive the overhauls, no matter how thoroughly they addle the staff. “Park Avenue ... Autumn,” said a woman who answered the phone the other day, taking a long beat after the address. She had to find her bearings, and so did I when, after several summer visits, I got my first glimpse of the fall collection. With changed wall panels and seat cushions and a new layout of tables and booths, the restaurant was unrecognizable. What had been yellow and white was copper and brown. Allusions to the beach had given way to evocations of the harvest. The design firm AvroKo was definitely earning its keep. This restaurant, an aggressive redo of Park Avenue Cafe, marks the firm’s second collaboration with Fourth Wall Restaurants, previously known as the Smith & Wollensky group. The first was Quality Meats. Mr. Koketsu, too, carries over from Quality Meats, where he remains executive chef. At this restaurant his cooking is much more interesting. Seasonality isn’t as binding a yoke as the steakhouse genre, no matter how liberally interpreted, and Mr. Koketsu uses his freedom to have fun. In the summer I had several knockout treatments of shellfish. Peekytoe crab took a predictable partner, avocado, but the avocado was the base of an ice cream, which deftly accentuated the sense of summer in this cool breeze of a dish. Other elements of gazpacho were also present and also in unconventional forms: a tomato-based gelée under the crab meat; a julienne of tomatoes, cucumbers and red bell peppers over it. Tempura-style soft-shell crab was the crunchiest, meatiest soft-shell crab I had all summer. The bright salad with it — strawberries, avocado and jicama sprinkled with a passion fruit vinaigrette — had a textbook interplay of tart and sweet notes, with a beautiful integration of crisp and soft textures. The restaurant gets some of the sweetest, supplest langoustines imaginable, and uses them instead of lobster in a fantastic lunchtime roll. It’s still on the menu, joined recently by an equally memorable filet mignon sandwich with an ideal degree of tingle from horseradish cream. Apart from those all-purpose sandwiches, the restaurant strives to capture the seasons not just in the ingredients used — there was sweet corn throughout the summer menu, certain mushrooms throughout the current one — but in the spirit dishes project. Go now and you’ll encounter venison chops, festooned with pomegranate and pumpkin seeds, that feel like a necessary prelude to winter, like an investment in insulation. You’ll find a saffron-scented, pistachio-dusted, impeccably braised lamb shank with the same gestalt. Some glimmers of invention transcend the time of year. A Caesar takes on a bracing new identity with the mere addition of cured lemon. Mr. Koketsu overdoes sweet effects, like the marshmallows with a side of carrots on the summer menu. Some dishes are excessively busy, taking things an aioli or a garnish too far. Others are sops to conservative diners. The striped bass with pears could put you to sleep. The desserts won’t. Remember the board game Mouse Trap? That’s what the elaborate compositions assembled by Richard Leach, the pastry chef, recall. He’s a holdover from Park Avenue Cafe, and justly so, because his flash doesn’t come at the expense of flavor. While I never imagined bacon with banana, their union in one dessert is a happy one, and it honors the season by letting a maple mousse tag along. Like Mr. Leach, this restaurant is determined to get your attention, even if it has to let you mix your own vodka drinks in a special vestibule. The owners know that merely constructing a seasonal menu is no longer enough. This purest of approaches needs the most calculated of sales jobs. So at BLT Market, another newcomer, one column of the menu provides a discrete list of in-season ingredients, which you can then hunt for in the dishes in another column. While doing so, you can pour yourself water from an old-fashioned glass milk bottle that underscores the farm-to-table point. And at Park Avenue Autumn, the pumpkin with the excellent roasted chicken isn’t all that will disappear in December. The lighting fixtures, too, will go, so that a cold-weather menu can be served in an aptly wintry wonderland. Park Avenue Autumn ** 100 East 63rd Street; (212) 644-1900.

501,Mr. Chow Tribeca,SATISFACTORY,20060628,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/28/dining/reviews/new-mr-chow-same-formula.html,"IT'S easy to see the bad in things and harder to see the good. Take Mr. Chow Tribeca. There are sane, prudent, well-intentioned people who will tell you why you should avoid this new outpost of a nutty empire, and they'll be indisputably correct. But with a slight adjustment of perspective, a certain generosity of spirit and a bit of willed enthusiasm, many reasons for embracing it can be found. Reason No. 1: You can participate in a strand of social history and mull over the eccentric genius of Michael Chow. Almost four decades ago Mr. Chow, who fled Mao Zedong's China for England, had an inspiration. Why not take Chinese food, at that point still somewhat exotic in the West, and swathe it in exaggerated elegance? Tether it to exorbitant prices? Make it fabulous, simply by declaring it to be? First came a Mr. Chow in London, then a Mr. Chow in Los Angeles, and then, in 1979, a Mr. Chow in New York, on East 57th Street. Like its forebears it proved that you didn't need great cooking to attract boldface names; you just needed other boldface names. And Mr. Chow, the Amy Sacco of an earlier era, got them in the door, mining contacts in the overlapping worlds of art, fashion and all-purpose elitism. Regulars included Andy Warhol, who, Mr. Chow has said, didn't so much eat his food as play with it. An understandable decision. Mr. Chow Tribeca stays true to the template. There are white tablecloths; waiters in white or black jackets and bow ties; a gleaming black bar in front; gleaming white lighting fixtures hanging from the ceiling. The restaurant looks and feels like a slick parody of a suave Italian restaurant, like an oxymoronic experiment in haute kitsch. Reason No. 2: Once you've visited Mr. Chow Tribeca, you will appreciate your favorite neighborhood Chinese takeout place like never before. The menu at Mr. Chow, which supposedly fuses various Chinese regional traditions, advertises many familiar dishes: scallion pancakes, shark's fin soup, pot stickers, crispy beef, beef with oyster sauce, sweet-and-sour pork. What's unfamiliar is how much they cost. For that pork, you pay $29. For crab meat soup, $13. Were there discernible crab in it, you'd understand. But there wasn't, so my companions and I didn't. There are also less ubiquitous dishes, along with dishes that -- as servers announce with inexplicable fanfare -- are making their Mr. Chow debuts. One is ""fiery buffalo,"" which wasn't fiery or, for that matter, particularly hot. Was it buffalo? The cubes of bland flesh could have come from any number of beasts or birds. And for $31.50, there weren't many cubes. If I'm going to get a main course this mediocre, I'd at least like more of it. Most of the food was precisely that -- mediocre, not bad -- and some of it was quite good. Peking duck had dazzlingly crisp skin and an appealing measure of fat. Sliced pork with chili peppers had an appealing measure of heat. Fried rice was never oily or clumpy. But almost none of the dishes improved significantly on cheaper analogues around town, and a few were unforgivable. Asked to steer us toward the best lamb dish, a server chose a minimally spiced shank. If I learned that it had been plucked from a freezer after the better part of a decade and then nuked in a microwave for the better part of a day, I'd be shocked. It didn't taste nearly that tender or flavorful. Reason No. 3: You will encounter a kind of service so aggressive at certain times and incoherent at others that it becomes a divine comedy. At the start of each meal, servers push expensive Champagne. (""For a toast! How about a toast? Don't you want to make a toast?"") They do it even if you have a full martini in front of you. Even if you have already said no. During two visits servers pitched desserts in the middle of a meal, not realizing that our table was empty because we were between appetizers and entrees. And they weren't daunted by not having much to pitch: some ice cream, some fruit, maybe two tarts, unless they run out of one. Of course they ran out of one -- at about 9 p.m. on a night that wasn't busy. On a slightly busier night, it took repeated pleas and 25 minutes to get a check. Once we were done with spending, our servers were done with us. Reason No. 4: You can get excited about spotting a celebrity, though you may not actually lay eyes on one. You know that the possibility exists, because Mr. Chow is the kind of restaurant whose opening is noted in Us magazine, not Saveur. But celebrities are like the best animals at the zoo: theoretically present in the designated exhibit but always obscured by a bush or boulder just when you're looking. I arrived at Mr. Chow late one Friday night to be told by a waiting companion that I had just missed Tobey Maguire. Had my companion seen him? Well, he said, sort of, but. Reason No. 5: You may indeed lay eyes on Mr. Chow. On a Sunday night I watched him bop from table to table, peering through those owlish glasses. Like Sir Elton and Dame Edna, he gets a lot of iconic mileage out of eyewear. His is made for him by Cutler & Gross in London. His prescription adjusts problems with near and far sight. I learned this because I called his Los Angeles offices for information about the restaurant and he insisted on getting on the phone. We had to talk about something. Food seemed beside the point. But vision, well, that made sense. Mr. Chow, now 67, foresaw that salt-and-pepper prawns and squid in XO sauce could be vessels for an aura of clubby exclusivity. You just had to season them with enough amusing mannerisms. And regard them with the right kind of attitude. Mr. Chow Tribeca  SATISFACTORY  121 Hudson Street (North Moore Street), TriBeCa; (212) 965-9500. ATMOSPHERE -- A room with lacquered black and white surfaces and waiters in black and white jackets is the sleek stage set for less impressive food.  SOUND LEVEL -- Moderately painful when crowded.

502,Plein Sud,Fair,20100824,Sam Sifton,TriBeCa,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/dining/reviews/25rest.html,"ANY lingering doubts about whether television is affecting New York City restaurants are erased by a visit to Plein Sud, an awkward little bistro that opened recently off the lobby of the Smyth Hotel, on Chambers Street and West Broadway. The restaurant’s chef, Ed Cotton, has worked behind Cat Cora on the “Iron Chef” programs, and is a contestant on the current season of “Top Chef.” His food at Plein Sud, vaguely Provençal in inspiration, is camera ready, beautifully composed and ready for its close-up. But in the full experience of real life, over a number of meals, whether at a crowded dinner or leisurely lunch, the cooking at Plein Sud reveals itself to be lacking in flavor, texture, temperature or interest: room-service fare that leads to increased loneliness, raiding of the minibar, sleepless hours staring at the television in blue light, thinking about home. The nonpleasures begin at the start of each meal, with cold, industrial rolls served with a black-olive butter that is neither smooth nor studded but simply purple and salty, with pieces of olive flesh here and there. They continue apace: a slops salad of frisée and lardons, with a slimy chicken-liver ragout; dry and featureless flatbreads, neither hot nor cold, including a pissaladière topped with limp onions, a few black olives and only a hint of white anchovy. Some celery rémoulade was ordered to accompany this, off a list of “seasoned” vegetables meant to be eaten with the restaurant’s selection of acceptable deli meats: saucisson sec, bresaola and the like. There is also a fine pâté de campagne. Mr. Cotton adds apples to the classic mixture of mayonnaise, lemon juice and Dijon mustard. The result might be a base for someone else’s transgressive ice cream. This was followed one night by a mushy skate wing with a brown-butter sauce that ran very close to scorched, defining the taste of inattention. Skirt steak was cooked into chewy submission. Pasta with fiery merguez, however, was perfect and welcome. A lunchtime burger stuffed with white Cheddar and slathered in a McSpecial sauce of black-truffle aioli came aboard a toasted-stale brioche bun with a pink slice of supermarket tomato. Five Guys does better. Shaved roast leg of lamb came riding something on the order of dry Texas toast, over an herbed goat cheese reminiscent of Boursin. Consuming it took much water. In all, this is grim stuff, even if served by cheerful service-industry newcomers for whom every phrase is exclamatory: “Awesome choice!” (They’re as French as the sisters of Delta Nu.) The seats are comfortable enough, and the L-shaped room — designed by AvroKo to resemble some combination of a barn in Avignon and a chic grandmother’s Paris apartment — is not unpleasant. Plein Sud draws a handsome crowd, seemingly made up of equal parts hotel guests (“I used to stay at 60 Thompson”), television fans (“Psst, look, I think that’s Kenny from ‘Top Chef’!’ ”) and gastro-tourists photographing their mussels in coconut milk (not bad, as it happens). It is not the snack room at Motel 6. But it is by no means a good restaurant. Wall & Water, a sprawl of a room that opened in the spring above the lobby of the Andaz Hotel, at Wall and Water Streets, suffers from a different problem. The food is mostly first rate. But the room, handsomely designed by the Rockwell Group, is at the top of a staircase that may require of some diners the use of crampons and ropes to ascend. It is hidden from the street. There are no passers-by within it, and as yet no people hoping for a glance at the chef, Máximo López May, who was the chef at the Park Hyatt in Buenos Aires. Before him are tableaus of men and women poring over the drafts of PowerPoint presentations while stabbing at vegetables, terribly alone, or families in repose, children whining over milk, parents staring wordless and exhausted at the ceiling. Groups of business associates dine together at large tables at each end of the place. The rhythm of the open kitchen is stilted by the ebb and flow of big parties in an otherwise uncrowded room — the service runs hot and cold as a result. But Mr. López May’s food, which looks to the Hudson Valley for ingredients and to both South America and New England for preparation, can soar. His cooks  grill baby zucchini and serve them still crunchy with slices of orange and red onion, with chervil and plenty of salty, slick anchovies: each taste distinctive and full, combining into loveliness. They slow-roast red peppers, then chop them into a kind of cocktail sauce to mix with tender steamed shrimp for a rustic, full-flavored take on shrimp cocktail. There is a vibrant cucumber salad, with caper berries, olives, parsley, mint, basil, a hint of chili fire and a cool dressing of sherry vinegar, with bits of crouton for texture. It is hardly in season, but the cooks sear asparagus in a small cast-iron skillet, then serve it beneath a dressing of sharp Cheddar, red wine sauce and a farm egg — one time duck, fat and yellow; another time pheasant, wee and rich. A salt-cod casserole might follow, like something out of 1870 Beacon Hill, with peas and potatoes and cream; or pork-belly confit out of the modern age, with sautéed collards and rosemary-scented apples, with a fat-cutting horseradish sauce. Only a tiny so-called New York steak disappointed: flavorless, very expensive and leatherlike beside crushed new potatoes and a spicy roast-tomato sauce. (Dull some of the pain with a build-your-own sundae dessert.) Wall & Water is a simple restaurant, with a modest menu, the sort that, were it served on a West Village side street, might develop a neighborhood following. In the financial district, on the third floor of a hotel owned by the Hyatt chain, it is a delightful surprise, a case of pleasure arising out of diminished expectations. And we may yet hear more about Mr. López May, who is from Argentina. Before coming to America, he was the host of a number of cooking shows on El Gourmet, the Latin cooking channel. Perhaps he could be the next Food Network star. Plein Sud Fair 85 West Broadway (Chambers Street), TriBeCa; (212) 204-5555, pleinsudnyc.com. ATMOSPHERE Lobby chic.

505,Blue Hill,★★★,20060802,Frank Bruni,Greenwich Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/02/dining/reviews/02rest.html,"EARLY one night at Blue Hill at Stone Barns about two years ago, I watched the chef, Dan Barber, bound through the front door with a bucket of sugar snap peas from the surrounding farm. It was a kitchen delivery, but it was also theater, and I was reminded of it late one night last month at the restaurant Blue Hill in Greenwich Village. In came Mr. Barber, toting yet another bit of bounty from that farm, up in Westchester. It was cradled against his chest and wrapped in a blanket, but not too well. Its legs dangled low and visible, a jolting clue to what it was and what it would become. Mr. Barber had the carcass of a lamb, and diners over subsequent days would have chops and shoulder from a beast raised by his edicts and butchered in his own kitchen. Perhaps no other chef in New York City does as enthusiastic an impersonation of the farmer in the dell as Mr. Barber, and perhaps no other restaurant makes as serious and showy an effort to connect diners to the origins of their food as Blue Hill. Here the meals have back stories, lovingly rendered by servers who announce where the chanterelles were foraged and how the veal was fed. It’s an exercise in bucolic gastronomy, and it might be slightly cloying if it weren’t so intensely pleasurable. When Mr. Barber started this restaurant six years ago and received two stars in The New York Times from William Grimes, he couldn’t execute his vision as thoroughly and as successfully as he can now. Back then he was reaping the limited fruits of his family’s farm in Massachusetts and was more reliant on the Greenmarkets and other suppliers than he is these days. Back then he was also teamed with another chef, Alex Urena, whose cooking is more fanciful and provocative than Mr. Barber’s. The kitchen turned out dishes like poached foie gras with smoked eel and ravioli of cod tail encased in thin sheets of beet. But Mr. Urena moved on, and Mr. Barber gained access to the sprawling Rockefeller family farm in Tarrytown, N.Y., where he opened Blue Hill at Stone Barns. Although his menus haven’t changed all that much, the quality and immediacy of the ingredients have. Much of the chicken, pork and lamb he serves at both Blue Hill restaurants comes from animals that graze on that land, which also yields many of the herbs and vegetables in his quiver. And more than ever Mr. Barber seems dedicated to making sure that those ingredients, along with the Greenmarket fare he uses to supplement them, don’t compete with flashy sauces or spices. Most of the dishes executed by him and Juan Cuevas, the current chef de cuisine at Blue Hill in the city, avoid excessive trickery or unusual flavor combinations. They pay clean, pure homage to nature’s remarkable bequests. An especially memorable dinner at Blue Hill began with a shot glass of pale tomato water so concentrated it was like some Platonic ideal of nourishment. Tomatoes came into play again later on: crimson and rose and yellow tomatoes, bouncy tomatoes and supple tomatoes, cut into wedges and mixed into a salad that charted a whole spectrum of tomato possibility, from modestly tart to immodestly sweet. The salad was dressed with a “tomato cloud” of tomato and cucumber water whipped with gelatin into something with the texture of an ethereal mousse. Our server spooned the nimbus onto the salad, where it began to dissipate and spread, becoming more of a tomato fog. There was a dairyless corn soup with pickled mushrooms, which deftly framed the sweetness of the corn, and there was a brilliant green gazpacho, made from dozens of the farm’s vegetables and herbs, with a dollop of yogurt sorbet that provided a crucial blast of tempered richness. That sorbet suggested Blue Hill’s awareness of its ascetic tendencies and of the need to make adjustments, like the pistachios in  — and the glistening rectangle of lardo over  — another salad, which showcased green, wax and fava beans. A subsequent dish of “pastured chicken” from the farm suggested Blue Hill’s attachment to sous vide technology, which yielded butter-soft slices of breast with a striking clarity of flavor that seemed to reflect the bird’s principled raising. During a different visit, tiny chops of grass-fed baby lamb, placed on a pool of quinoa, had a similarly pristine quality. For better and worse, Mr. Barber loves the tenderness that comes from sous vide cooking, which he uses as well for that lamb, for duck and for wild striped bass. But while the results are gorgeous they can often be sexless, making you long for crunch and ooze, for some charred skin here, some messy fat there. Instead you make do with the roasted chanterelles beside that chicken and with the duck breast’s virtuous, chivalrous chaperones, including turnips and carrots. Blue Hill is not for everyone or every mood. If it’s a full-throttle, free-wheeling feast you’re after  — a vintage Brian De Palma movie of a meal  — you should choose a different show. What Mr. Barber presents is more like a hushed foreign film with subtitles. You have to pay attention and heed the nuances, and you can get only so carried away. But while he expects you to eat your peas, he doesn’t deny you interesting wines from a considered list, or several good dessert options, the best and longest-running of which has nothing to do with any agrarian ideal. It’s a chocolate bread pudding with roasted peanuts, salted caramel and caramel ice cream — no subtitles here. All of this is served in a simply and smartly decorated room below street level with a low ceiling that actually works to its advantage, creating a sense of intimacy. The exquisite lighting and the deep red upholstery on chairs add touches of romance and urbanity. Mr. Barber may be carrying whole animals through the front door  — there isn’t a service entrance — but he doesn’t carry his rustic conceits too far.

508,Bao 111,One Star,20041222,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/22/dining/spice-for-the-alphabet-city-soup.html,"IT had been more than a few years since my last sustained excursion to the far East Village when I found myself walking down Avenue C toward Bao 111 one night in September. I felt a stab of that unresolved happy-sad, excited-disappointed feeling I get whenever I notice that another Manhattan neighborhood has taken a turn toward vodka-based specialty drinks and raw tuna. On the one hand, the sexy lounges and studied restaurants in this increasingly tamed patch of wilderness make for a more accessible place to play. On the other, they tug a once outré tributary perilously close to the mainstream. We all know where that can lead, or at least we do if we've paid a recent visit to the meatpacking district. Bao 111 has the feel of a starter Spice Market, which, in fact, it preceded by more than a year. Wedding Vietnamese cuisine to a hipster aesthetic, it tries to conjure that same sexy vibe of Asian exoticism both on and around the plate, but with a decidedly -- and obviously -- smaller budget. It too attracts a self-consciously attractive crowd, albeit one with a slightly greater affinity for tattoos and meat-free menu options. Most diners at Bao 111 are young. Many are thin enough to call their utility as culinary canaries into question. All of them pack tightly into a cramped rectangular room with deep red woods, black leather banquettes, a bevy of gargantuan throw pillows and two enormous Bosch-like paintings of what look like Asian monks as seen through the lens of a pleasant acid trip. The food is similarly colorful and artful and at its best reminded me of what I liked most about eating in Vietnam. Into their soups and onto their meats the Vietnamese generously sprinkle the freshest and most fragrant of herbs, often emphasizing a middle range of tartness, tanginess and sharpness over extremes of fiery heat and cool sweetness. Bao 111's chef, Michael Huynh, who was born and reared in Vietnam, exercises an identical impulse in many of his most successful dishes. He puts an abundance (but not an excess) of scallions in a yam and shrimp soup, emphatically waking it up without recklessly slapping it around. On the nights when I tried his hearty pho, the star anise in the oxtail-based broth sang out clearly and seductively, a coherent siren in a delectably complicated swirl. Lucky for all of us, lemon grass is a recurring player on Bao 111's stage. It delivers a mostly fetching performance. It forms the piquant crust around three lamb chops that were grilled to a satisfying tenderness on the night I sampled them. Hard, thick skewers of lemon grass are used for the grilling and serving of thin rolls of beef short rib, which pick up a zesty scent as a result. Kaffir lime adds citrus zing to a moderately thick, mildly spicy curry that forms a deep pool around cubes of basa, a Vietnamese fish with some similarities to catfish. The curry also includes coconut, Japanese eggplant, taro root and butternut squash. This dish was one of my favorite seafood entrees, another being a whole red snapper in a tamarind and basil tomato sauce that flirted with being too sweet but pulled back at the last possible moment. The snapper had been briefly deep-fried, its moistness preserved under a crunchy exterior. Not all the cooking at Bao 111 is that careful; not all the flesh I sampled was moist. This is a restaurant with serious consistency problems. I am hard pressed to remember any duck breast as dreary looking and dreary tasting as the chewy slices that my friends and I tried and quickly abandoned one night. Another night's beef short rib entree had plenty of flavor from a lemon grass and red curry sauce, but the stringy texture of the meat sabotaged the dish. Shrimp were significantly overcooked. With his business partners, Mr. Huynh spun off a more informal successor restaurant, Bao Noodles, which opened last year near Gramercy Park. He is an increasingly active promoter of Vietnamese cuisine, working with the Culinary Institute of America, befriending top chefs, spreading the recipes and the word. Bao 111 has been his principal calling card; it is here that he experiments with attention-getting fare more fanciful than that at less ambitious Vietnamese restaurants. Among this restaurant's appetizers is a memorable ""lacquered quail,"" off the menu just now but likely to return. The lacquer is formed by guava, star anise and lemon grass. For an entree, soft-boiled quail eggs are tucked between strips and cubes of chicken meat that has been braised with ginger in an iron pot. In the service of making an impression, Mr. Huynh travels as far from Vietnam as he wants. He accommodates our provincial tastes, putting an untraditional filling of tuna tartare into a traditional spring roll. His partners lend a downtown Manhattan panache to a polyglot production with lengthy lists of infused sakes (their signature spirit) and trademark cocktails, including the Bao 111 itself, a combination of banana-flavored rum, mango juice and fresh lime served in a glass with a transfixing dust of black sesame seeds, yellow sesame seeds, red pepper and orange peel around the rim. And then there are the desserts, ever changing, ever inventive, heeding the call of audacity as much as authenticity. My companions and I could not summon much affection for the ""apple spring roll,"" which came with an indiscriminately sweet caramel dipping sauce, but we adored the funky nuances of a cheesecake made from goat cheese. The service at Bao 111 (the name connects Mr. Huynh's childhood nickname with the restaurant's address on Avenue C) could stand considerable improvement. As soon as the restaurant becomes crowded -- and it fills up quickly once the hour passes 8 p.m. -- the servers tend to become distracted, disorganized and none too visibly concerned about that. The neighborhood, after all, is still valiantly resisting those final coats of polish. Why should Bao 111 get too far ahead of it? Bao 111  * [Rating: One Star]  111 Avenue C (East Seventh Street), East Village; (212) 254-7773.

RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Grilled short rib appetizer; turmeric and dill glazed sea scallops; yam soup; pho; lamb chops; red snapper; basa fish curry; goat-cheese cake; black sesame ice cream.  WINE LIST -- Unusually interesting for an Asian restaurant this size, with an emphasis on wines from vineyards that use organic and biodynamic techniques.

512,North End Grill,★★,20120320,Pete Wells,Battery Park City,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/21/dining/reviews/north-end-grill-in-battery-park-city.html,"AT times I wondered if North End Grill was trying to look dull on purpose. Its name may mark the first time a restaurant has tried to lure New Yorkers by pretending to be in Boston. It’s not, of course. It’s in Battery Park City, where they don’t literally roll up the sidewalks at 10 p.m., but where almost nobody would notice if they did. Danny Meyer, whose Union Square Hospitality Group opened North End Grill in January, has called it an update of the American bar and grill. Expecting a trudging parade of steaks, chops and other battle-hardened veterans, I studied the menu. Pumpkin soup with crab ... halibut with clams ... scallops with cauliflower ... brussels sprouts on the side. It all sounded pleasant, but not the kind of thing you’d readily cross the howling six-lane purgatory of West Street for. And then I started to eat. That pumpkin soup had a deep, pasilla-chile warmth that made the fat lumps of peekytoe crab taste all the more sweet. The cauliflower with those scallops had a low rumble of cumin. Shaved brussels sprouts were crisp, not gummy, and hummed with mustard seeds and curry leaves. The halibut came at me from all directions. Fried shallots and ginger with roasted pine nuts brought a toasty crunch. Around the fish was a clam broth with the smoke of chipotles, the licorice tease of anise, the perfume of coriander seeds. It is high on the list of the least boring halibut dishes I’ve ever tasted. Dull? I should have known better. The kitchen is in the hands of Floyd Cardoz, who deploys spices with as much sophistication and authority as anyone in town. Mr. Cardoz was born in Mumbai, trained in Europe and made his name in New York. When he ran Tabla, coaxing Indian flavors into contemporary American presentations, his watermelon curry served as the sauce for the single least boring halibut dish I’ve ever tasted. After 12 years, Tabla closed in 2010, taking the watermelon curry and a host of other inventions down with it. One of them stages a welcome comeback at North End Grill, the Kachumber Cooler, a gin cocktail built on an herbaceous base of muddled cucumber, coriander leaves and green chiles. It sounds like a drink for August, but feels just right in your hand in March, too. In search of a concept for North End Grill, Mr. Cardoz and Mr. Meyer looked west to the Hudson River, a stripe of which you can see from the dining room. This made them think of a fish restaurant. They did some reconnaissance in Spain, where they watched the way seafood is grilled over wood. They started free associating. Mr. Cardoz enjoys single malts; could they be incorporated somehow? He also likes to cook eggs; why not devote a section of the menu to them? You enter through the bar, which in the early evening might mean slaloming around traders from Goldman Sachs’s mother ship around the corner. A wall of Scotch bottles is on your left. Straight ahead is a long counter facing the open kitchen where Mr. Cardoz is on duty, watching over a state-of-the-art open grill. It now holds a whole turbot, to be shared by two people who will marvel over its meaty flesh and chew appreciatively on the smoky, gently crisped skin. Turn a corner and you pass piles of oysters. To your right is Alexandra Ray’s pastry station, where somebody is cutting a sky-high wedge of tart lemon meringue pie. (Remind yourself to order it later, along with the butterscotch pot de crème. Ms. Ray, who transferred from Gramercy Tavern, has a gift for the kinds of business-casual makeovers of classic American desserts that have been a strong suit of that restaurant’s since Claudia Fleming’s days.) After this cinematic entrance, settling into the dining room can be a bit of an anticlimax. There’s little intimacy or drama in this empty square, although the sunlight off the river in the afternoon makes it a very cheerful place to enjoy the amazingly good “burger” of chopped rock shrimp and bacon, or the smooth, mustard-scented grilled seafood sausage. Speaking of cheer: Smiles, everyone, smiles! This is a Danny Meyer restaurant, and goodwill is doled out by the armload. One night a server might act out the menu in a jolly interpretive dance; another day a guest might be complimented on his socks. The service is not always highly polished. (Did somebody just describe the Eccles cake as “an English pastry made by peasants?”) But faulting such details would be like blaming a puppy for licking your hand. What you might fault at North End Grill is a slight hollowness at its core. This may be the first major Danny Meyer restaurant that feels as if it grew not from an organic sympathy for its neighborhood but from a reading of the real estate market. The space was part of a deal that also gave Mr. Meyer’s company three ground-floor venues in the Conrad New York hotel. (The other two became a Shake Shack and a Blue Smoke.) That much may have been simple, but giving North End Grill a firm personality was not. Mr. Meyer and Mr. Cardoz decided to try to have it all: the fish and the Scotch, the grill and the eggs, the spice-route seasonings and the brown butter cheesecake, the lunch-hour finance crowd and the dinner-rush condo owners. North End Grill may be trying to be too many things to too many people for it to work its way into the city’s heart the way Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern have. Buried here and there on the menu are items that don’t feel very convincing. Lamb with chickpeas tastes like a last-minute concession to people who don’t eat fish. A salad of shaved turnips and fennel doesn’t go anywhere, and one billed as “spicy greens” is only a little better than mesclun from a bag (though this may improve after Mr. Cardoz plants his 1,000-square-foot roof garden). And there is an odd dish of cod throats, handsomely pan-fried, but done in by a veal reduction that blots out any hint of the sea. Navigate around these, though, and there is so much left to revel in: a clam pizza that might surpass the one at Franny’s; a massive appetizer of white bones filled with buttery marrow topped with pink trout roe; every one of the egg dishes. Set loose from the constraints of an Indian-inspired kitchen, Mr. Cardoz can simply cook, showing off his deep understanding of flavor without worrying about anyone’s preconceptions of how those flavors are supposed to be used. In the restaurant’s big-tent approach, Mr. Cardoz has found something better than a concept: freedom."
517,Wakiya (CLOSED),Satisfactory,20071003,Frank Bruni,Gramercy Park,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/03/dining/reviews/03rest.html,"WHAT high hopes there were for the new Chinese restaurant in the restyled Gramercy Park Hotel. What a godsend it was supposed to be. The city needed  — needs —  more establishments that give Chinese food the kind of treatment that French, Italian and Japanese routinely receive. That accord it both humble respect (the best restaurants in Chinatown) and immodest gloss (Mr. Chow), not just one or the other. And that’s what Ian Schrager, the hotelier who took charge of the Gramercy’s redo, seemed poised to do. To accomplish it he recruited the acclaimed London restaurateur Alan Yau for what would be Mr. Yau’s American debut. The restaurant got as far as a name: Park Chinois. It was the talk of the town (well, of the food-obsessed set), as eagerly awaited as baby Brangelina. Then it was over before it began, the deal between Mr. Schrager and Mr. Yau unraveling. In its place came Wakiya, with a new set of players but the same big ambition. It’s managed by members of the team behind Nobu, and its Japanese chef, Yuji Wakiya, commands respect for his interpretative Chinese cooking at four restaurants in and around Tokyo. There’s a lingering promise in this pedigree. But there’s a crushing sense of letdown in what it’s produced, an experience in which pleasures are flickering and unreliable, in which the slickness of the gleaming red-and-black setting and the poise of the best servers are undercut by inconsistent cooking and dishes that too often look three times as good as they taste. Out comes the “fiery pepper hunt chicken,” one of Mr. Wakiya’s signature dishes. It’s a glittering hillock of bright red Chouten peppers, there to infuse the chicken with a tingly heat but not to be eaten, as your server playfully warns you. You tunnel with your chopsticks to the buried chunks of battered, wok-fried meat, and what’s your reward? Nuggets no more tender than those you retrieve from many a drive-through window. Out come the chin shan scallops, nestled with broccoli, baby corn and other vegetables on the top level of a bamboo steamer, clouds of heat from a special oolong tea rising up to envelop them. The theater is impressive; the scallops aren’t. They’re undercooked, with a uniformly flabby texture and minimal flavor. A version of Peking duck arrives, and there are puffy shrimp  crackers along with the shards of skin and slivers of meat. They’re an extra element to be folded into the pancakes, apparently intended as an additional agent of crunch. But they turn out to be the only agent of crunch, because the skin is floppy. The pancakes, for their part, are gummy. Wakiya traverses Chinese regions and at times passes them through a Japanese filter, producing fastidious compositions  pruned of clutter.  The version of cold sesame chicken, called bang bang chicken, is a leaner, cleaner affair, with a welcome, well-modulated current of heat. The menu is structured in a way that’s familiar and accessible, cold appetizer-size dishes in one category and hot entree-size dishes in another. There are separate sections for soups, for noodle and rice dishes, and for dumplings and other dim sum. And there are successes, no question about it. The Shanghai soup dumplings and the shrimp-and-chive dumplings hold up. Sweet-and-sour treatments of pork and of sea bass have a nervy, bracing sourness that’s a welcome rebuke to all the cloying glop in paper delivery cartons out there, and the sea bass is phenomenally tender to boot. In one knockout dish, fried rice with diced pork is tucked into a fluffy omelet that’s made from eggs scrambled with XO sauce. And while the potato slivers beside tea-smoked lamb in a black pepper sauce could be mistaken for soggy, underdone McDonald’s fries, the lamb is juicy and the green beans that round out the plate are crisp. Pork belly makes an impressive showing. For a cold appetizer it’s sliced thin, so that it’s not as glutinous as it can be, and its richness is offset by long strands of cucumber and by a chili-soy sauce with gingery sparks. For an entree it’s braised to a state of almost criminal lusciousness. That entree, called tung po pork, isn’t available one night, and our server’s overly contrite announcement of this begs for some mischief. I pretend to get up to leave, exclaiming, “No tung, no deal.” She deadpans,  “That’s what my dates always say.” Wakiya can be fun, except when it’s not. And when it’s not, it feels like a swindle, because the relationship between price and portion doesn’t always make sense. The sizable omelet is a deal at $13,  but at $34 the chin shan scallops — an unremarkable  cluster of them — are anything but. The oddities accrue. A mixed vegetable soup holds little more allure than Veg-All doused with hot water. The coat of  mayonnaise on wok-fried shrimp is too thick, while the “sweet taoban” sauce drowning  wok-sautéed lobster is too reminiscent of ketchup. Nuances that should be present aren’t; flavors that should come through don’t. And to add to the befuddlement, chapters of the meal that turn out to be highlights aren’t ones you’d predict. The pastry chef Gabriele Riva has put together a better, more ambitious selection of desserts  —  including an elaborate, eye-catching riff on an Italian affogato with Vietnamese-style coffee  —  than many flashy Asian restaurants bother with. The requisite list of special cocktails, heavy on the -tini suffix, isn’t as hacked-out and inane as such lists so easily become. The design upends expectations as well, forgoing clunky set pieces for subtler effects. The windows facing Gramercy Park are covered, but with a material just sheer enough to permit shadowy glimpses of the traffic outside. Throughout the narrow dining room, rippling columns formed by red silk tassels give the tables an illusion of privacy. To get to these tables, you walk down a brilliant red carpet. It’s the egg-drop Oscars. But  as with so many breathlessly hyped events, the reality doesn’t live up to the great expectations.

523,Table 8,Satisfactory,20090728,Frank Bruni,East Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/29/dining/reviews/29rest.html,"FOR all its flaws, the new restaurant Table 8 must at least be given credit for a novel gesture of customer appreciation — a toast of the most unusual order. In its opening weeks, it rewarded anyone who went to the bathroom with a glass of sparkling wine. At least that’s what happened the first time I dined there, when my companions and I noticed bubbly for the taking in a chamber beside the sinks. What to make of this? Freud surely would have had one answer. We had another: diners were being congratulated for actually managing to reach this remote, ill-marked destination, a Herculean feat involving an instinctive left here, a speculative right there, a hunch, a leap of faith, a descent into the underworld and a fearless crossing of the river Styx. That tortuous journey — only the final phrase amounts to exaggeration — isn’t just a mood killer; it’s a metaphor, too. The people behind Table 8 have given too little thought to logistics and comfort. They were inattentive when they put the place together, and they’re inattentive still. The acoustics are insane, the absurdly narrow lanes of foot traffic clog, the bread isn’t reliably fresh and the filet mignon on a recent night had the stringy texture and stew-y taste of something that would only barely pass muster on a tray table in coach. What, then, explains the considerable attention paid to this restaurant in the weeks immediately following its opening in early May? It marks the New York debut of Govind Armstrong, one of those supremely telegenic chefs whose celebrity seems to outpace his accomplishments: in his case, a Table 8 in Los Angeles that was ultimately scaled back to become a hamburger haven called 8 oz., and a subsequent Table 8 in Miami, which is temporarily closed. New York’s Table 8 is the third, though I’m guessing the goal is five more. The numerology of his career demands it. Mr. Armstrong appeared prominently in the Miami season of the reality show “Top Chef,” which broadcast his charisma. His new New York restaurant, though undisciplined, broadcasts some talent to go along with it. He composes more than a few of the dishes here with brio and imagination, using chanterelles and orange to cast a roasted quail appetizer in a simultaneously earthy and sunny light, then turning to sunchokes and kumquat to achieve a vaguely similar effect in a duck entree. The thoroughness with which he pillages garden and orchard struck me as distinctly Californian, though the crowding of ingredients on many a plate was out of sync with textbook California cuisine. The stage for his work is the second reason Table 8 has drawn notice. It’s the Cooper Square Hotel, a whimsical glass sliver that doesn’t just stick out among the nearby tenements but more or less taunts them, declaring them holdovers from a frumpier East Village past. The hotel tries to claim the neighborhood around it as a party zone on a homogenously slick, glossy par with South Beach or West Hollywood. Not all the neighbors are amused. Some have responded to the din of chatter and generic lounge music coming from the hotel’s second-floor terrace by hanging dirty briefs and the like from a clothesline readily visible to the revelers. It’s a campaign of undermining by underwear. I spotted only one sad, fluttering garment on the evening when I ate on Table 8’s street-level patio. And it did less to ruffle my serenity — the patio is a pretty, breezy treat — than the door that crashed into the back of my chair when someone decided to step outside. Placing a table for diners smack in the door’s way exemplifies the curious planning at which Table 8 excels. The food that night was a mixture of appealing and ho-hum. In addition to appetizers and entrees, the menu has a section called “salt bar,” essentially an array of crudo and charcuterie in tiny portions, for tiny prices. The duck prosciutto delivered a fatty, funky charge; the mortadella was mortadella, never a bad thing. I couldn’t figure out why the menu bothered with a flatbread when the bread itself was no more interesting than standard pita and the topping — goat cheese, honey — was so predictable. The quail, though, had an unpredictably generous measure of juicy meat, and an appetizer of sautéed scallops, paired with wilted spinach and spring succotash, fulfilled its plump, faintly sweet mission. But even during this, the best of my meals at Table 8, I was struck by how overworked and overdressed many dishes were. A deep puddle of excess liquid was left behind once the grilled octopus with celery heart salad, tomato and Moroccan olives was gone, and a similar puddle outlasted duck sausage with grilled radicchio, pine nuts, grilled peaches and a watercress salad. I would have traded all those accessories for more sausage with more of a crisp-soft contrast than this one had. On a subsequent night, the torn pasta that served as a bed for pan-fried sweetbreads was mushy. Another pasta was even worse: a gluey clump of linguine with a combination of ricotta and lemon that might as well have been Elmer’s and Pledge. Although a coffee parfait and most other desserts that night were unobjectionable, my companions bid me the most damning of farewells, expressing gratitude only for the company. They could have spared a kind word for the dining room, which was where we ate and which has a wall of glass onto that patio, another wall of leather and a dark, sexy luster. It also, regrettably, has a low ceiling, which doesn’t help with the excruciating noise. You may search out the restroom not because nature is calling but because your ears are bleeding.

530,Mia Dona,★,20080402,Frank Bruni,Midtown East,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/02/dining/reviews/02rest.html,"AT the big-hearted new restaurant Mia Dona you’ll find pasta dishes so forcefully flavored and generously portioned they could play as well at Carmine’s as at Del Posto. You’ll find a deep-fried rabbit appetizer that owes less to the grand commanders of haute cuisine than to Colonel Sanders. You’ll find meatloaf. And if you step back to survey all of what you’re eating and all of what it’s costing — which, in the context of the restaurant’s East Side neighborhood, isn’t very much — you’ll find something else: a portrait of a rising young chef with more practicality than vanity, even though the acclaim that’s rushed his way over the last few years has given him ample reason to preen. Meet Michael Psilakis, renegade and realist. On the heels of his James Beard Award nomination, his Esquire-magazine coronation and other affirmations, you might expect him to reach for a fussier level of accomplishment, polishing his crown. You might expect a new restaurant from him to feel like a throne. Mia Dona doesn’t. Mr. Psilakis and his savvy business partner, Donatella Arpaia, seem content to let Anthos, which opened in Midtown last year, remain their standard bearer, their Cadillac. With Mia Dona they’ve created something along the lines of a Buick, a more matter-of-fact restaurant suited to a budget-conscious time and to a space that has a low ceiling and somewhat awkward dimensions — it’s like a railroad flat. It even serves beer in pitchers. While much of the food does justice to Mr. Psilakis’s talents, there’s nothing high-flown about it or the prices. Full-size pasta dishes range from $15 to $17 and entrees from $18 to $24. In terms of pleasure per dollar, Mia Dona is as successful as any place he and Ms. Arpaia have worked on with or without each other. It’s the child of Dona, the restaurant they opened nearby in 2006, and which flourished for about nine months, before lease problems did it in. But Mia Dona has only carefully selected strands of its parent’s DNA. Dona’s longer menu and more elaborate dishes paid tribute to Italy, Spain and Greece, the country of Mr. Psilakis’s ancestors, whose culinary traditions he had deftly updated and reinterpreted at Onera (which morphed into Kefi) and would refine anew at Anthos. Mia Dona spotlights Italy, although it takes liberties, among them the generous scattering of dill. Mr. Psilakis loves dill and capers and olives and salty cheeses like feta and ricotta salata. If you don’t, you probably don’t want him cooking for you. Although sufficiently pampering, Mia Dona doesn’t have many of Dona’s fancy flourishes — white tablecloths, for example. But its décor is a put-back-together-again half-Humpty of its predecessor’s reclaimed shards. In the front room, where the bar is located, the Fornasetti black-and-white plates that were used as place settings at Dona adorn the walls. In the middle and back dining rooms, which are quieter, the zebra-striped carpeting from Dona lives. The food is robust, often rustic and sometimes proudly unsubtle, hammering away at its intended effect. Mr. Psilakis wants to give an appetizer of fat, tender grilled octopus a salty charge, and does he ever, courtesy of capers, caper berries, olives, melted feta and an anchovy vinaigrette. Other standout appetizers include a golden, crisp cake of salt cod and potato; the crunchy hunks of bone-in rabbit, which can be dipped in a cucumber rémoulade; and a combination skewer — for just $13 — of grilled quail, merguez, sweetbreads, pork involtini and lamb meatballs. Most of the pasta dishes, which can also be ordered as starters, are big hits. Although butternut squash tortelli with dried cherry, walnuts and browned butter taste too much like dessert, pudgy strands of bigoli, which is like hollow spaghetti, get a brawny, gut-punching treatment: pork sausage, broccoli rabe, lentils, peperoncini and lots of garlic. Mr. Psilakis justly drew raves for his sheep’s milk ricotta gnudi at Dona, and he reprises them here, where they swim happily in black truffle butter beside super-salty bits of crispy speck. In another memorable dish, served in a gargantuan crock, he layers so much melted buffalo milk mozzarella with thick, flat noodles and a plum tomato sauce that he just about blurs the line between pasta and fondue. Among the dozen or so entrees, fish doesn’t fare as well as meat. At Dona, as at Anthos and Kefi, Mr. Psilakis tends to overwhelm the main player in seafood dishes, be it poached cod or roasted red snapper, with accouterments. He shows more focus and better judgment with an appropriately fatty veal breast, braised and partnered with cannellini beans, and with chicken. The chicken dish comes in many differently tweaked parts, but it’s mostly chicken: roasted breast, braised thigh, leg ground (along with capon meat) into meatballs. Ricotta salata and a piccata-inspired sauce with capers and olives give the dish Mr. Psilakis’s characteristically salty stamp. Desserts aren’t uniformly successful; a chocolate and hazelnut semifreddo makes a stronger case than a “Sicilian ice cream sandwich” that, both times I tried it, amounted to a soggy, metastasized profiterole. The uneventful (though thorough and accessibly priced) wine list has a hokey section of “Donatella’s Picks,” which schools you in what she drinks when on a budget versus when she wants to linger with friends versus when she doesn’t have to get up the next day. She better steer clear of that last wine, because the way Mia Dona is packing people in, she needs to be on her toes. It’s open for weekday lunch and Sunday brunch and Mr. Psilakis even wants to start offering take-out and delivery. A lauded up-and-comer doing pappardelle to go? Good for him, and good for us."
532,Le Cirque,★,20060719,Frank Bruni,Midtown East,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/19/dining/reviews/19rest.html,"RESTAURANTS, like poker players, often have tells. The tip-off to Le Cirque’s inner musings and true intentions is just inside the entrance, on a table to the left. Arrayed there are copies of Sirio Maccioni’s autobiography, each with his face beaming proudly, maybe even a little complacently, on the cover. A clumsy sign makes clear that they’re for sale — $29.95 each. But the display from which it rises only hints at something more important: that Le Cirque isn’t peddling a particular dining experience so much as a larger legend, constructed by its ringmaster, Mr. Maccioni, over more than three decades of soufflés and stroked egos. Le Cirque means luxury. Le Cirque equals privilege. Le Cirque connotes a culinary pecking order by which the rich and famous get the best tables and others get to breathe the same air. The name has so much iconic resonance that it’s molded into the butter on every table, stamped in gold on the chocolate flecks in some desserts and scrawled in red across the restroom towels. But the restaurant itself is no longer an especially exciting one, at least not in its current incarnation. The new Le Cirque, in the Bloomberg Tower in Midtown, seems to be coasting on its myth, counting on the star power of Mr. Maccioni to compensate for a menu that could use more spark and a kitchen that could show more finesse. It does a superb foie gras terrine, a sorry risotto Milanese. Its ethereal Dover sole meunière makes you believe that this fish was put into the seas to await its appointment with butter and lemon. Its drab lobster salad makes you question the crustacean’s gastronomic calling. There are more imaginative dishes, including a few that nod in a voguish and perfunctory fashion to the Greenmarket or the spices and traditions of continents other than Europe. Like the subdued décor, which trades the whirl of the big top for the dignity of the boardroom, they represent attempts to bring Le Cirque into an era of diminished fussiness and less hidebound rites. But this restaurant by and large speaks the same language it has for many years, an endangered idiom of haute French and Italian cooking and profound self-regard. It does so less fluently and musically than in the past, when chefs like Daniel Boulud and, later, Sottha Khunn ushered it into chapters of four-star glory. And it feels a bit like a museum piece, at once timeless and badly dated. Of course it has celebrities — on one starry night alone, Henry Kissinger, Bill Cosby and Helen Gurley Brown — but I didn’t see many who looked younger than 65, the exertions of their plastic surgeons notwithstanding. I detected a great deal of hair spray, spotted many pocket handkerchiefs and marveled at the gargantuan white toupee on a man who preened on a nearby banquette, seemingly unaware that a Samoyed had fallen on his head. I also experienced Le Cirque’s famously split personality, half dismissive and half pampering, depending on who you are. On my first visit, when a companion and I arrived before the two other members of our party, a host let us know we should wait in the bar area not by asking or telling us to go there but by gesturing silently in that direction with his head. Most of the seats were occupied, so we stood. Over the next 10 minutes, no one asked us if we wanted a drink or anything else. After we were taken to our table, servers seemed to figure out who I was and offered to move us to prime real estate with better sightlines. (We declined.) So on a subsequent visit I sent three friends in ahead of me. One sat at the bar for 15 minutes without getting a server’s attention, and a bartender quarreled with the two others when they asked that the charges for their Champagne be transferred to the table. At a place as self-consciously posh as Le Cirque, such a request should be granted instantly. But I was treated like royalty when I showed up, and on another night, when I dined with a filmmaker whom the staff also knew, soft-shell crabs, which weren’t on the menu, appeared almost as soon as she mentioned an appetite for them. They were fantastic: crunchy, meaty, sweet. Almost as good were firm, exquisitely cooked ravioli with bacalao on the inside and, like an echo of the filling’s saltiness, capers on the outside. And even better were the desserts, big in size and impact, including a criminally intense chocolate soufflé, a floating island that came in a majestic chalice and a multi-tier napoleon that appeared as a veritable skyscraper of light, crisp pastry. For the right diners on the right night, Le Cirque can muster a magnificent performance. The restaurant, which initially opened in 1974, has occupied two previous locations, most recently the New York Palace Hotel, where it went by Le Cirque 2000, a name with a millennial braggadocio you had to admire. Its digit-pruned successor seems taciturn by comparison, but then everything’s relative. Its regal palette is burgundy and gold. Varnished ebony covers its walls. There’s the expected monkey business — monkey sketches on the plates, stuffed monkeys among the plants — but it’s kept in prudent check. The overall effect is stately, even a bit lugubrious. Pierre Schaedelin, who was the last executive chef at Le Cirque 2000, continues in that role here. The menu is new but not really novel. For every expression of ambition, like a trio of tomato treatments that include a chilled gazpacho and a tomato sorbet, there’s a safe fallback, like duck glazed with honey and orange, or pan-roasted cod with mussels, clams and chorizo. For every knockout, like succulent langoustines in a light, fragrant, deftly integrated pool of red curry paste, ginger and kaffir lime, there was a fizzle, like steamed branzino stuffed with shrimp and calamari and seasoned, according to the menu, with star anise, saffron and fennel. Despite all that seafood and all those promised flavors, the dish somehow managed to be bland. A casserole of peas, spring onions and bone marrow that accompanied a pro-forma steak also defied its ingredients to achieve insipidness. The fanfare of a roasted chicken’s table-side carving was more noteworthy than the bird itself. A different, ginger-inflected, chicken served at lunch was equally dull and borderline dry. But a lunchtime dish of trout amandine had incredibly moist flesh and a lavishly nutty crust. The lunch menu differs slightly from the two dinner menus: a main one and one that, after Labor Day, will be available only in the bar area. The latter menu is where the Dover sole resided, along with the roasted chicken and risotto. But it would be silly to attend this circus and bypass the center ring, which has a value that transcends the uneven food, little of which is unappealing, most of which is conventionally and unremarkably decadent, some of which (the crispy deboned pig’s feet in one appetizer, the mix of peas and morels in another) is truly memorable. With its formally attired servers, puffed-up patrons and transparent hierarchy, Le Cirque clings to a kind of pomp that undid most of its competitors. It upholds a tradition that’s increasingly rare. How it survives has a lot to do with Mr. Maccioni, 74, who still Cadillacs among the tables, sprinkling affirmation on the chosen few. His story and secrets are beside the path to the door.

537,Suba,★★,20070808,Frank Bruni,Lower East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/08/dining/reviews/08rest.html,"SHOULD you need a fresh example of how oddly and cruelly fate can operate, consider Seamus Mullen’s past year. In August 2006 he realized a dream. After working mostly under other chefs or in kitchens set up long before he got there, he joined the restaurateur Yann de Rochefort to open Boqueria, where the menu was his own and the food reflected his special passion for Spanish cooking. Diners packed it. Critics praised it. And in short order he and Mr. de Rochefort moved to build on that success. Mr. de Rochefort asked him to take charge of the kitchen at Suba, a beleaguered Spanish restaurant that Mr. de Rochefort had been trying to get right for five years. (William Grimes gave it one star in The Times in 2002.) It closed briefly this year  and reopened in late April with new paint, new furniture and a whole new lineup of dishes by Mr. Mullen. Just days later, Mr. Mullen didn’t show up for work. He couldn’t. A sudden, excruciating pain in his hip prevented him from standing, let alone walking. He spent nearly two weeks in the hospital, where he was diagnosed with a form of rheumatoid arthritis, which may well plague Mr. Mullen, 33, for the rest of his life. About a third of the people in his condition, he said during a recent telephone interview, end up disabled. Medicine and therapy got him back on his feet and back to Suba, but the pain returns frequently. He has to take regular breaks to sit, to stretch, to regroup. One night I spotted him on the steep, long staircase from Suba’s street-level entrance to its subterranean chambers, where both the main dining room and the kitchen are located. He moved haltingly, like an old man. Given what he’s been through and what he continues to endure, you might expect Suba to be struggling as well. Here’s another strange twist: It’s not. While it has definite shortcomings and at least a third of its dishes don’t measure up to the others, the best of the food here is distinctive and exciting. In a few instances it’s even dazzling. I can’t stop thinking about the potatoes. That’s right: the potatoes. Instead of repeating the very fine, straightforward patatas bravas at Boqueria, Mr. Mullen constructs layered balls with a soft center of sausage-flavored potato purée and a spiky, crunchy exterior of fried strands of potato. The pimentón aioli with them has less heat than the one at Boqueria, and that’s a smart call. Between the sausage and the textural contrasts, there’s already enough going on in the dish, which is tremendous fun. An entree of lamb is even better. Along with fat-rimmed slices of loin, there’s a fat-capped brick of belly that’s meltingly tender on the inside but crisp on the outside, thanks to a final-step sear on a plancha. To cut its richness, there’s some tangy sheep’s milk yogurt on the plate. It’s just what’s needed. Pork belly appears as the centerpiece of one entree and as a resounding accent in two large rice dishes on the menu. The less satisfying and less inspired of them recalls a creamy risotto, studded with peas and perfumed with mint. The better one combines the belly with pork shank, morcilla (a Spanish blood sausage), pine nuts and grains of rice that have deliberately been given firm, almost burnt edges. Lamb belly, pork belly, morcilla: Mr. Mullen isn’t much for retiring flavors, with only a few notable exceptions (including a terrific, colorful salad that encourages comparisons between three kinds of radish  — black, breakfast and watermelon). While he obediently assembles a gazpacho, he insists on putting bits of serrano ham and a thick slice of avocado in it. Nowhere on the regular menu will you find chicken or any of its surrogates. But you will trip across octopus, squid, cuttlefish, sea urchin, eel, sardines, anchovies, mackerel and cod jowl, a chewy muscle of the fish that you should definitely get to know. If you can’t summon the requisite curiosity and nerve for it, stick with the tender octopus, skirted by olives and dressed in a walnut vinaigrette. You’ll also notice hanger steak, and I let out a little sigh of disappointment when I did — I was so taken with the guts behind much of the rest of the lineup. But the pan-roasted steak itself was first rate, and thick slices were placed on a generous bed of tomatoes, potatoes and cipollini onions that sopped up the juices. There’s a clear dedication to quality at Suba, and it was evident as well in a dish with a bevy of different shellfish, including a big fat sea scallop and succulent little rock shrimp. As at Boqueria, the menu isn’t structured the usual way. Most of the dishes fall under the headings of tapas or “media raciones” (medium portions), which are basically small entrees. There are also three to four rice dishes in a category of their own. Desserts aren’t especially noteworthy; it appears that more energy has been poured into a lengthy list of sangrias, including a beer sangria  like Boqueria’s. That may reflect Suba’s location on the Lower East Side, which caters to younger diners. And younger diners may be the ones who most appreciate the eye-catching dining room. It’s surrounded by an illuminated moat of water, which makes light flicker along the base of the brick walls. But the walls, painted white as part of the renovations, are completely bare. And that minimalism, combined with the absence of windows, produces an austere effect. It also does nothing to muffle sound. When the room is packed, laughter and chatter ping around it in a screechy way. The coldness of the setting is redeemed to some degree by the service, which is extremely warm without being remotely goofy. That’s  a balance  many restaurants don’t strike. Mr. de Rochefort apparently knows how to hire and train staff, because the same virtue exists at Boqueria. With Suba it’s clear:   he and Mr. Mullen have forged a partnership with enough talent to get them past all the usual travails of the restaurant business, and enough determination to get them past some unusual ones. ** 109 Ludlow Street (near Delancey Street); (212) 982-5714.

555,Craftsteak,★★,20060712,Frank Bruni,Chelsea,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/12/dining/reviews/12rest.html,"THE line between freedom of choice and the tyranny of too many options isn’t such a fine one. There were any number of moments when the chef Tom Colicchio and his collaborators on Craftsteak, yet another new mega-restaurant on the edge of the meatpacking district, should have realized they were crossing it. That moment might have come when they included, in a menu category for New York strip steaks, beef aged not only for 28 days and for 56 days but also for 35, 42 and 49 days. You look at the options, the prices of which escalate to $66 from $42 in accordance with the steak’s seniority, and wonder if you’re in a restaurant or a numerology class. Or that moment might have arrived when they put, in a separate category for Wagyu beef, particular classes of this already particular flesh: a Grade 6 “flat-iron” steak, a Grade 8 strip, a Grade 10 rib-eye. You scan the selections, which reach $20 per ounce as a steak’s educational level rises, and wonder how much a postgraduate porterhouse would set you back. At Craftsteak you can have hanger or sirloin or T-bone steaks; corn-fed or grass-fed beef; beef from any of several breeds or farms or continents. The pedigrees and provenances are so specific (“Ridgefield Farm Corn-Fed Premium Hereford Beef”) that my companions and I found ourselves wondering if we could inquire after a steer’s color (we’d always been partial to piebald) or sexual orientation (we figured gay cattle might be in especially good shape). Forget the omnivore’s dilemma; this was more like the carnivore’s discombobulation. And that would have been less irksome if it had been more delicious. But apart from the Wagyu beef, which was so pricey that being tasty was less an accomplishment than a contractual obligation, the steaks at Craftsteak proved disappointing. Is the restaurant really getting the best beef? Is its in-house aging program on track? Or is the main problem a dictatorship behind a Potemkin democracy? Perhaps self-defeatingly, the kitchen cooks each of these many kinds and cuts of steak one way only, and it’s not grilling or broiling, which most steak lovers prefer. It’s roasting. Mr. Colicchio said in a telephone interview that the steaks are seared briefly on a griddle, tucked into pans, then put in an oven, a method that he believes prevents them from drying out. But the steaks I tried weren’t notably juicy. And many had a near sameness of texture and tinge from exterior to interior, matched by a flatness of flavor. The grass-fed beef had a more herbaceous, muscular flatness than the corn-bed beef, while the mild flavor of the more aged steaks lingered longer than the mild flavor of the less aged ones. But none had any sizzling char, any messy ooze. Despite their heft, they seemed sort of prim. If you delete the steaks, there’s a great deal to like about Craftsteak, which then becomes a bloated version of Craft. Over the five years since Mr. Colicchio opened that seminal temple to superior ingredients, he has been on a heady, crafty roll: Craftbar; a growing network of ’Wichcrafts; and, in Las Vegas, the first Craftsteak. This second one is big and dramatic enough to be Vegas-worthy, though its uncluttered elegance and restrained palette are very New York. It has about 50 seats in a front lounge and about 150 in a dining room with blond leather banquettes and dark brown leather chairs, all remarkably comfortable. A spectacular glass display and storage area for wine is complemented by spectacularly broad, tall windows that take in the West Side Highway. The view could be better. The sense of airiness couldn’t. Some of the food is also hard to beat. Like Craft, Craftsteak revels not in elaborate seasonings or intricate dressings but in the intensity of carefully sourced ingredients like pencil-thin wild asparagus, which kept company with a profusion of potatoes and mushrooms among roughly two dozen sides. It celebrates the intrinsic vibrancy of bouncy fava beans, sprinkled with hazelnuts, in one of many terrific salads. And it showcases the crazy succulence of exquisitely braised short ribs, one of about 10 main-course options above and beyond the steaks. Craftsteak preaches its minimalist religion by serving warm dishes, including those short ribs and enormous and tender sweetbreads, in cast-iron vessels. It pares down several cold tartares, like salmon belly and Wagyu beef, to their fleshy essences, diminishing the usual prominence of tangy, spicy and salty contributors. Those tartares were terrific, as were Fanny Bay oysters, marinated in a ramp vinaigrette and topped with trout roe. The oysters belonged to an array of raw-bar selections much more extensive than a traditional steakhouse’s. All around the edges Craftsteak leaves the traditional steakhouse in the dust, presenting a wine list more varied and sophisticated, along with desserts that put the usual steroidal cheesecake to shame. A chocolate soufflé, served with “creamsicle ice cream,” and a salty chocolate tart were standouts. Then again, Craftsteak, which offers béarnaise and bordelaise but no conventional steak sauce, has only a slight tether to tradition. It joins the ranks of steakhouses that inhabit their genre with evident restlessness, like indie movie actors making salary-pumping appearances in summer blockbusters. Think V Steakhouse, which contorted itself into an early grave, or Quality Meats, still in its infancy and unproven. At Craftsteak the bonuses and fringe benefits go on and on, requiring many lines of dense type on a menu so unwieldy that one of my companions asked our server if it came with its own easel. How to make sense of it? The menu’s central column, like the restaurant’s name, points you toward the beef. But even if you head in that direction you encounter too many additional forks in the road. And you soon realize you got a bum steer. Craftsteak ** 85 10th Avenue (15th Street), Chelsea; (212) 400-6699.

566,Primehouse New York,★,20071219,Frank Bruni,Kips Bay,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/19/dining/reviews/19rest.html,"ON today’s voluble, provenance-obsessed menus, it’s not uncommon to be told what breed of cattle your beef comes from or where it was raised. But Primehouse New York goes one better. It identifies the proud papa of your porterhouse. I’m talking about a bull named Prime, introduced on the restaurant’s menu as the genetic source of its steaks. Considerable effort has obviously gone into harvesting and making the most of this particular beast’s mighty seed, and why not? They pimp horses, don’t they? But Prime’s most important contribution to Primehouse, which the prolific restaurateur Stephen Hanson opened in early October, isn’t his name or stud services. He gives the restaurant an original conceit. And in an era and city as beef-struck as ours, that’s as crucial to a new steakhouse as a Caesar salad and creamed spinach are. Uptown in the Time Warner Center, Porter House New York — see, even the names start to blur — unveiled  so-called porterhouse cuts of meat other than beef, and of monkfish to boot. Downtown in the meatpacking district, STK seeks distinction not just by ostracizing vowels but by presenting steaks in various sizes, small, medium and large, as if T-bones were T-shirts. And Primehouse New York, on Park Avenue South? It’s the seminal steakhouse. It’s also an estimable one, with virtues that will rightly earn it the affection of many discerning carnivores and give it a solid chance in a competitive field. It puts a laudable premium on comfort: cushioned, swiveling stools at the bar up front; cushioned, broad chairs at the well-separated tables in the series of dining rooms beyond. These rooms have oversize booths and seemingly acres of space, floored and walled with gleaming marble, limestone and travertine that make Primehouse look like the drained, spit-polished pool of an ancient Roman emperor. Serious money went into this place. And serious ambition goes into its steaks, starting but not ending with the restaurant’s vaunted Secretariat of sirloin. Primehouse ages its beef on site, in a climate-controlled underground room tiled with Himalayan rock salt. You can gaze at the dangling flesh, if you like, through an enormous window. Dinner meets diorama. This process yields steaks that are reliably appealing and occasionally exceptional. The best have a strong mineral flavor, tenderness, juiciness and a crisp exterior, if not quite as pronounced a char as some of us would like. There’s fat stippling and skirting the porterhouse, but not so much that it’s a cheat or that you go from feeling indulged to feeling undone with just a few bites too many. Filet can be ordered on the bone, a cut you find more often in southern California than in these parts, and it’s a thrilling anomaly. The bone lends nuance to the meat nestled against it, so the filet has more than a pliant texture to recommend it. But there are some oddities afoot. While a sirloin aged for about two months had a much more concentrated, tangier taste than one aged for half that time, two rib-eyes with a similar discrepancy in age weren’t similarly distinct from each other. And the rib-eyes weren’t always quite as hefty and rich as rib-eyes can be. Friends and I were more taken with a hanger steak, coated generously with chimichurri sauce. At $24, in contrast to $46 for the least expensive rib-eye, it’s the best deal on the menu. There are about 10 kinds of steak in all, and on any night the three or four most aged will be promoted as  “reserve cuts.” On one night only one of these cuts was available, a sad fact made only gradually apparent to my friends and me by servers who circled back to our table time and again to tell us we had to amend our order. Prime’s house was in disarray. More than 10 minutes would elapse before requested drinks reached the table. And while we asked to have the “new wedge” salad of romaine with blue cheese split in two, we received two whole salads, and were charged for both of them. On other nights service was faultless and many of the surprises were happy ones. A bevy of raw bar selections was supplemented by a special of terrific stone crab claws. A jumbo lump crab cake among the appetizers was more crab than cake. A lavish scattering of bacon turned brussels sprouts into a smoky, piggy romp. But the menu put together by the executive chef Jason Miller, who worked under David Burke at the original Primehouse in Chicago, is inconsistent. Although I sampled lamb, chicken and peppercorn-crusted tuna, I couldn’t find an exciting entree beyond the steaks, and I stumbled across one side that should be sidelined, onion rings with hard, inadequately cooked interiors. I wish more of the bottles of red wine under $70 were more appealing. That would represent a better update of the traditional steakhouse than any of the restaurant’s many little tricks and flashy theatrics, which become too cute in aggregate:  a martini with a dribble of veal stock that’s called the Dirty Bull; the presentation of bagel-shaped bread on a spindle; knives nearly the size of tomahawks; a traffic jam of service carts in the aisles; and dessert doughnuts that come in the form of hollow balls, accompanied by three plastic syringes of a sort containing chocolate, butterscotch and strawberry.  You use the syringe of your choice to, um, fertilize each one. Prime is never far from mind, and I found myself wanting to learn — and share — a bit more about him. He’s a Black Angus,  6 years old and some 2,500 pounds in weight. His home is a farm in Kentucky, a state fittingly known for thoroughbreds. His daily diet includes more than 100 pounds of hay, corn and protein supplement. It must be a charmed life. It’s certainly a purposeful one.

573,Co.,★,20090407,Frank Bruni,Chelsea,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/08/dining/reviews/08rest.html,"THE frequently mobbed and fervently discussed new restaurant Co. — pronounced “company” — was born of a worship of dough. That’s why the pizzas at the center of its menu are as good as they are. That may also be why they’re not even better. Its sire and guiding spirit, Jim Lahey, hails from the breadmaking side of things. It’s bread above all he knows and loves, and you may well have tasted the evidence of that if you’ve eaten out in New York over recent years. Many restaurants buy loaves, rolls, focaccia and such from Sullivan Street Bakery, his yeasty baby. At least they do if they’re smart. The man can do wonders with flour and water, massaged or not. (He’s a leading proponent of the knead-less method of baking.) He can do fluffy, crunchy, supple, dense. He can do pizza bianca —  man, oh man, can he do pizza bianca —  those salty squares of almost entirely naked crust. And his talents have made him, among many of the city’s food-obsessed, a high-carbohydrate counterpoint to David Chang, less chef than shaman, especially with that monklike bald head of his and otherworldly gaze. As soon as he announced plans to expand into full-fledged pizzas and open a restaurant, the breathless chatter began, and the lines formed the instant Co.’s doors opened more than three months ago. Mr. Lahey couldn’t have made a bigger splash if he’d named his new place Momofuku Mozzarella Bar. But he could indeed improve upon his pizzas somewhat. Although the best of them are outstanding and all pack the pleasures of a serious crust with serious blisters — Mr. Lahey uses an oven that generates heat in excess of 900 degrees — he hasn’t yet nailed the toppings. It’s as if he’s too focused on, and maybe too confident about, what lies beneath. A pizzaiolo-come-lately, he needs to sweat the cheese and the rest of it a little more. On some pizzas — the mushroom-bedecked boscaiola, for example — the advertised bufala mozzarella was barely discernible. The classic margherita pizza suffered from a deficit of just about everything: cheese, tomato, even basil leaves, rationed as if they were shavings of white truffle. Co.’s pizzas read different from the way they register, the menu touting twice as many toppings as actually make an impact. And those blisters sometimes multiply and spread into jarringly ashy, sooty territory. What’s a desirable sear and what’s no better than cinders? A few of the many pizzas I had at Co. left me wondering. Co. is at the forefront of the city’s artisanal pizza fixation, which has deepened and broadened over recent months, as establishment after establishment pops up to pronounce its individual-size, Neapolitan-style pies better or truer than what’s come before. The downturn in the economy surely has something to do with it. Even when a mozzarella diva like Una Pizza Napoletana charges nearly twice as much per square inch as Patsy’s, John’s or Grimaldi’s would dare to, a pizza dinner doesn’t cost what steak or sushi would. And pizza feels like the right, rustic, filling answer and antidote to austerity. Unlike other newcomers around town, Co. tries to be — and is — a relatively complete restaurant, offering some excellent alternatives and accessories to pizza, including salumi and cheeses, a few serviceable desserts, a half-dozen beers and more than twice that number of wines. It doesn’t take reservations, and at dinnertime that can sometimes mean waits in the vicinity of an hour, with nowhere to sit comfortably in the meantime. You’re usually safe, though, at lunch, which has the advantage of all the soft light that trickles through Co.’s big exterior windows, facing west and south. The room, organized around a long communal table, has a simple, clean prettiness thanks to pale white oak paneling and a lack of clutter. Service is upbeat and efficient — maybe too efficient: if you don’t build your own pauses into your meal, you could be in and out in an hour flat, whether or not that’s your wish. Resign yourself to a starchy free fall, because some of what you should order in advance of the pizza is not entirely unpizzalike. By all means get the pizza bianca, along with ricotta for spreading and olive oil for dipping, though you’ll want to keep some of the bianca pristine. That’s how they eat it in Rome, where they sagely eat a great deal of it. Get the creamy chicken liver, which comes on toasted bread. And not merely because it’s a change of pace and an injection of needed roughage, get the butter lettuce salad. The roasted butternut squash and pumpkinseeds in the mix provide loads of flavor and a variety of textures. On most days there’s a special pizza or two to supplement about eight regulars. I’d rank the top five regulars as follows: the popeye (spinach leaves with three cheeses); the ham and cheese (with first-rate prosciutto); the stracciatella (more densely cheesy than many other pies, with some arugula and crushed tomato); the flambé (rich and maybe a touch too sweet, courtesy of béchamel and caramelized onions) and the leek-and-sausage. On just about every pie the toppings stopped the right distance shy of the edge, leaving a rim of crust that wasn’t too  broad or puffy, like some crusts I’ve encountered. The dough had character: no question about that, and no complaint there. Mr. Lahey has character as well, and one expression of it in particular amuses me. It’s a line in small type on the menu that says: “Our pies are not always round.” Is that a declaration of rebellion? A prophylactic apology? Most likely it’s just the musing of a craftsman, as intrigued by his work as its hungry and devoted consumers are. Co. * 230 Ninth Avenue (24th Street), Chelsea; (212) 243-1105.

576,Monkey Bar,★★,20090714,Frank Bruni,Midtown East,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/dining/reviews/15rest.html,"ALTHOUGH it hands out menus, prepares food and charges lavishly for it, the newest incarnation of the Monkey Bar shouldn’t be mistaken for anything as plebeian as a restaurant. It’s a clubhouse, its members making their way to it not from the 18th hole but from the vanity fairways of Condé Nast, I.C.M., Time Warner and the like. Maybe they take a moment to glance at the listed appetizers and entrees, maybe not. It hardly matters, because they’ve been here often enough to know what’s what, and the lighting is too magnanimously dim for an annoyance like reading. At the Monkey Bar they’re spirited to a bygone era when waiters wore uniforms this crisp and white and ferried vichyssoise, clams casino and lobster thermidor — all present on the retro roster of dishes here — to properly set tables. This could be a cruise ship in the early 20th century. Or it could be Chasen’s in Beverly Hills in the 1950s. It even serves “Chasen’s chili.” It’s a big-city big-game reserve for the lions, gazelles and jackals of the urban veldt. That proud, roaring figure in one of the prime circular red booths — isn’t that Vernon Jordan? And that band of underfed creatures with such hungry, all-knowing miens: that must be a herd of Vogue editors. They’ve come because Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair and one of the principal architects of this experience, summoned them. On top of everything else the Monkey Bar is his social pulpit, affirming his ordination as the high priest of a certain fame-focused, power-obsessed sect of Manhattan society. With his magazine sanctum doubling as a reservations office, Mr. Carter, the raconteur-cum-restaurateur, decrees who gets in and which table they occupy. And he fashions a fantasy New York where arrivistes bask in mutual recognition and reciprocal adoration, each mirroring the others’ sense of triumph, the unruly city edited down to one preposterously romantic room for the most unromantic of pursuits: back scratching and social climbing. The fantasy started more than two and half years ago in Greenwich Village, when Mr. Carter and several partners spruced up the Waverly Inn and turned it into a quasi-private, quasi-public tavern for people like them. Waverly gave him an exclusive watering hole and human chessboard just steps from his home. The Monkey Bar, a fabled 1930s hot spot crying out for a makeover, gives him one just a dozen or so blocks from his workplace in Midtown. With a different lineup of partners, he took it over last year and restored it to shimmering life, installing the commodious new booths, a patch of zebra-striped carpeting right at the dining room’s entrance and, most glorious of all, an Edward Sorel mural populated by Dorothy Parker, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Fred Astaire and more. It opened about four months ago. But it didn’t open equally to everyone, as I learned when I called, using a pseudonym, to make a reservation. I wasn’t simply told that 6:30 was the closest to a prime time that I could hope for; I was told that anything better was for people with private lines to the owners. I took that table, but passed on the next 6:30 reservation I was offered, because it came with what the cheery woman on the telephone unabashedly informed me was a 90-minute limit. Shortly after that the Monkey Bar essentially shut down its phone line and began accepting general reservation requests — the ones from those of us not pulling strings — by e-mail only. The first time I sent an e-mail, I got no response. One of the next times I got a 7 p.m. table, but when I showed up, the restaurant had no record of the reservation, and I had to plead to be let in. All of that would be more objectionable if it weren’t just an amplified — and curiously forthright — version of the haughty games so many restaurants play. And it would be less forgivable if there wasn’t actually something to savor on the far side of the velvet rope, along with signs that Mr. Carter and his crew truly care about that. There’s no denying that this is one of New York’s best-looking restaurants and that the food has improved markedly since the first weeks, after which the original chef was dismissed and the venerable veteran Larry Forgione was brought in. Mr. Forgione hasn’t changed the gestalt of the menu — more expansive and expensive than Waverly’s, but written in a similarly straightforward, intentionally unimaginative vein — but he has fine-tuned its execution. That lobster thermidor was stringy and wan before him. It was supple and sweet more recently. I still encountered many mishaps: a watery dish of linguine with flavorless clams and calamari; a buffalo mozzarella salad drowning in its dressing. But you can eat well if you order carefully. Among the dozens of starters, including raw-bar selections and a raft of serviceable salads, my favorites were the plump and wonderfully buttery oysters Rockefeller; the creamy scrambled eggs, which could work as an entree as well; and the salmon tartare, with fish that tasted fresh and true. As for entrees, the kedgeree, a Scottish-Indian amalgam of rice, egg, smoked haddock and curry, was flat-out fantastic, not to mention an inspired bit of coloring outside the menu’s predictable lines. And the veal chop here can compete with the veal chop anywhere. It packed a juicy, fatty wallop. “Nora’s meatloaf,” made with input from the writer and moviemaker Nora Ephron but not from an actual recipe of hers, was thicker and richer than the usual meatloaf, though I found its mushroom gravy slightly overbearing. And it established a chummy insiders’ nomenclature that carried over to such dessert options as “Babe’s chocolate cake” — a reference, it turns out, to the slugger Ruth, not the socialite Paley  — and “Mrs. Carter’s butter tart.” Our server wasn’t sure whether the tart (excellent, by the way) paid tribute to Mr. Carter’s mother or grandmother or some other family matriarch, but whatever the case, its name suggested an invitation to an inner circle, a moment of contact fabulousness. Some diners won’t care. Plenty of others can’t wait. Monkey Bar ★ 60 East 54th Street; (212)  308-2950.

578,Anthos,★★,20070516,Frank Bruni,Midtown,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/16/dining/reviews/16rest.html,"ONE of the real pleasures of dining  in New York over the last few years has been keeping tabs on Michael Psilakis, whose path to success hasn’t been conventional and whose goal  — a quest, really  — isn’t ordinary. And one of the real pleasures of his newest restaurant, Anthos, is its affirmation of how far he’s come and how fast he’s done it. Mr. Psilakis (pronounced see-LAH-kees) didn’t go to culinary school or do the requisite apprenticeship in a kitchen run by David Bouley or Jean-Georges Vongerichten. He more or less taught himself to cook in a relatively unknown restaurant on Long Island, where he still lives. When he dived into Manhattan, it was a headlong plunge. In a half-underground Upper West Side space that hadn’t been kind to other restaurants, he unveiled a tasting menu of organ meat, an à la carte menu of retooled Greek dishes and the beginnings of his grand plan: to win Greek cuisine as much respect as any other. He asked diners to trust an unknown chef more than they might a celebrated one, and he gave his restaurant an apt name: Onera, Greek for dreams. That was three short years ago, and much has happened since. He entered into a partnership with the restaurateur Donatella Arpaia, another creative, gutsy striver, and together they opened Dona, which combined haute Greek with haute Italian and Spanish, on the East Side. Together they watched it close, despite its acclaim, when it lost its lease. Mr. Psilakis responded with a frenzy of activity. He remade Onera into Kefi, striking a casual tone better suited to its neighborhood. And with Ms. Arpaia he opened Anthos, the restaurant you might get if you triangulated between Onera and Dona. It has the former’s resoundingly Greek soul. It has the latter’s fussy tics and more sophisticated wine list, with sommeliers who can guide you through the impressive advances of Greek winemaking. It’s better than its predecessors, although it doesn’t come together quite smoothly or sharply enough to loft Mr. Psilakis and Ms. Arpaia to the level they clearly aspire to and will almost certainly reach. Much of the cooking is inspired, and much of it is excellent. Mr. Psilakis takes familiar Greek ingredients and flavors and puts them through unfamiliar paces, the results wedding the rustic and the elegant in keenly enjoyable ways. I think of his skordalia soup, named for the garlicky Greek potato purée. At Anthos the potato is present and accounted for, but it’s thinned and lightened with Greek yogurt. The resulting liquid is poured tableside into a shallow bowl that harbors a painstaking arrangement of skordalia interlopers: a long, sliced caper berry; an oval of diced beet; several crispy, batter-encased orbs of cod; and stacked petals of cod confit with an amazing tenderness and a generous sprinkling of dill. Currents of dill run more forcefully through dishes at Anthos than at other restaurants, joining yogurt and citrus as key players and flavors. They brighten the taste of the soup, while the diced beet brightens its color, dispersing into gorgeous ruby swirls and wisps. It’s a painterly dish, but no more so than one of the other most memorable appetizers, a triptych  of an oyster topped with radish and pink peppercorn; sweet shrimp covered in crumbled feta, tomato and basil; and strands of crab meat beneath a sea urchin tzatziki and pearls of trout roe. That crab composition is a glittering orange dream, with some of the sweetest and briniest notes the sea can offer. Of special note among the other appetizers is an intense hilopita, or Greek pasta, that has a salty, earthy sauce of   manouri cheese, black truffle, snails and rabbit. Anthos also presents a five-item variety pack, if you will, of Mr. Psilakis’s answer to crudo, including  — my favorite  — yellowtail placed over an artichoke purée and crowned with crisped grape leaves. The variety pack, like the soup’s dual treatments of cod, speaks to Mr. Psilakis’s pronounced tendency for doing dishes in multiple parts, an inclination that can feel generous, affected and quizzical, sometimes all at once. It works very well in a pork entree of tiny rack chops, pork belly and cabbage stuffed with braised pork shoulder and rice, all of these elements united by a lemony, eggy, surprisingly light avgolemono sauce. It makes less obvious sense in an entree of grilled swordfish flanked by octopus and medallions of a lamb and pork sausage, but no matter: the contrast between the swordfish’s crisp outside and moist inside is all the logic the dish needs. This fondness for intricacy is echoed in the arresting desserts by the pastry chef, Bill Corbett. Out comes a long transparent pipe with five indentations for yogurt mousse topped with spoon fruits made of   such ingredients as lemon (one indentation) and  olive (another).  Out comes baklava interpreted three ways, only one of them instantly recognizable. On all levels, Anthos works hard to please. There are deft little considerations and extras everywhere: the faintly tangy, intoxicatingly creamy goat’s milk butter that’s provided, along with regular butter, for the bread; a slew of canapés at a dinner’s start; the bowl of lightly pickled vegetables that comes,  in addition to  fries, with the terrific lamb burger at lunch. And the sommeliers aren’t the only servers who know their stuff. While many haute French restaurants struggle to find servers who can talk about the menu nimbly and authoritatively, Anthos has fielded a sizable team of them. Their polish is a hallmark of an Arpaia production. But the script they’ve been given  — extended musings on the provenances of ingredients and the nature of Mr. Psilakis’s “flavor profile”  — communicates a self-consciousness that only a few of the dishes are transcendent enough to justify. And it’s a self-consciousness at odds with the drab rectangular room, which has none of Dona’s sly exuberance. Washed-out pictures of cherry blossoms hang on off-white walls; brown chairs sit on a slate floor. Anthos has a seriously depressed air about it. It has other problems as well. Pauses between courses are too long, and not everything that arrives is worth the wait. Apart from the swordfish and a shellfish stew that’s like a spicier bouillabaisse with a more diverse population of shellfish (razor clams, whelks), the seafood entrees proved disappointing, with the fish having to fight somewhat to float above the overly busy company it kept. Turbot, for example, was weighed down by puréed eggplant,  onions glazed with vin cotto and pickled fig. Even so, the ratio of hits to misses is better at Anthos than at Dona, where the menu’s sprawl worked against it. If the setting were cheerier and the kitchen’s efforts just a little more selective and straightforward, Mr. Psilakis and Ms. Arpaia would have a restaurant that represented not just the blossom but the full flower of his dream. The quest continues, or at least I hope it does. Anthos ** 36 West 52nd Street; (212) 582-6900.

579,Rouge et Blanc,★★,20111108,Eric Asimov,SoHo,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/09/dining/reviews/rouge-et-blanc-nyc-restaurant-review.html,"PART joy, part conundrum, Rouge et Blanc defies expectations. In this age of no secrets, where just about everything imaginable has been revealed through Twitter, blogs and obsessive Web sites, not to mention the old reliable print media, how does a restaurant as intriguing and satisfying as Rouge et Blanc, open for a year, remain quietly apart from the murmur — not ignored but out of mind? Yet, here on a SoHo side street, you have a small bistro that takes a fresh approach to combining France and Vietnam. Partly, that’s by blending fresh herbs, tangy sauces and other Vietnamese ingredients with French techniques. Other times, dishes evocative of Vietnam are juxtaposed with the thoughtful list of French wines. It all comes together in a quiet, simply attractive room with few airs or pretensions. The history of French-Vietnamese cuisine in New York is not particularly distinguished. Places like Indochine and Le Colonial are devoted more to imaginary worlds of colonial decadence than to creative cooking. Má Pêche is excellent, but it is at least as much David Chang as it is French or Vietnamese. The most successful French-Vietnamese culinary merger is not a restaurant but a sandwich: the banh mi, a hero that generally offers some combination of pâtés, hams and sausages with Vietnamese pickled vegetables. Rouge et Blanc offers a superb pork belly banh mi for brunch. Rouge et Blanc succeeds, not in a splashy way, but with low-key understatement. The small, rectangular dining room suggests its theme through scattered bric-a-brac rather than a grand design scheme. France is clear enough: the battered metallic bar, the fleur-de-lis wallpaper, the oil portrait of Julie Christie, who, to me at least, transcends semiotics. The Vietnamese side is more vaguely Asian: Chinese wooden screens, ceiling fixtures resembling paper lanterns. Ah well, high concept meets low budget. What’s on the plate and in the glass are far more intriguing. Perhaps a blanc de blancs Champagne from a good small producer like Guy Charlemagne, or a more moderately priced sparkling Vouvray from Domaine d’Orfeuilles while you wait? Like so many recent restaurants, Rouge et Blanc expands the conventional European dinner service of appetizer and main course. An argument could perhaps be made that preliminary “wee plates,” in advance of the small and large plates, would appropriately offer Vietnamese street bites. It might make sense if they were all like one of the dishes, four seared razor clams served on the shell with a little tumble of charred leeks. You can gobble each off the shell in one delicious bite. Other wee dishes are compositions that subvert the category, though, frankly, I consumed them with no complaint. Heirloom radish salad is gorgeous to look at, with colorful, gossamer-thin slices of radish fanned out over a plate dotted with both pumpkin seeds and tiny bites of crisp pork, and it’s perfectly refreshing. Squid stuffed with slightly sweet short rib is not wee by any calculation, but delicious over a pile of savory white beans, while slivers of octopus bathed in a vinaigrette flavored with pennywort, a not uncommon herb in Vietnamese cooking, are almost melt-in-the-mouth fragile. Not surprisingly, neither the owner nor the chef are French or Vietnamese. Thomas Cregan, the owner, is an American sommelier who loves French wines and imagined that a Vietnamese inflection would be a new twist on a French bistro. The chef, Matt Rojas, has cooked at Eleven Madison Park and Degustation. Perhaps the most brilliant dish is a rouget served whole, delicately fried, the sweet flesh easily removed from the bones and beautifully augmented by deep, anise-flavored holy basil, peanuts and pungent nuoc mam, the Vietnamese fish sauce, blended with a touch of vinegar, lime, chiles and sugar. I also loved rich, unctuous bone marrow topped with chunks of tiny octopus, and Vietnamese sausage wrapped around licorice root, with rice noodles, greens and pistachios. Mushrooms tossed with soy sauce, garlic and butter are wrapped in parchment and steamed until earthy and tender. Four prawns fried to a dainty crispness, the shells so fine they can be consumed, too, lend a crunchy exclamation point to the refreshing green papaya salad on which they sit. May I suggest a light white Burgundy, or perhaps a Muscadet, with any of these small dishes? Main courses are not as consistent, but standouts include a plate of meaty lamb ribs that fall off the bone, served with luscious eggplant confit and charred peppers. A mix of seasonal vegetables comes in a coconut curry that feels more Thai than Vietnamese, but is the rare dish aimed at vegetarians that will satisfy anybody. It comes with monkey bread: salty, buttery Parker House rolls by another name. By the way, bread will not appear automatically, but simply asking for monkey bread will work wonders. Crisp duck confit, topped with a duck egg and served over escarole and beans, entices with its dark, rich flavors, but pork belly, steamed in a banana leaf and served over sticky rice with sweet Chinese sausage, is unaccountably bland. A medley of juicy mackerel, scallops and prawns is brought together by a barigoule sauce tasting of lemon, garlic and oil, but skirt steak topped with a mushroom ragout, sweet potato and sea urchin, of all things, comes across as confusing, with nothing unifying the disparate elements on the plate. Rouge et Blanc offers two good choices among the desserts: espresso ice cream sandwiched with pastry, like a profiterole, drizzled with a cinnamon chocolate; and a slender chocolate cake with cashew ice cream surrounded by sage oil and feathery malted chocolate meringues. Unfortunately, a third, ghastly choice is offered as well: caramelized foie gras with peaches, vanilla ice cream and cocoa nibs. Anyone expecting a sweet punctuation to the meal will be sorely disappointed by the foie gras, regardless of its garnishes. Rouge et Blanc has its eccentricities, like the foie gras, but mostly it has its pleasures. The restaurant is hampered by a lack of polish and consistency, but I’m swayed by its creativity, vision and, yes, that wine list. It’s an inspired neighborhood restaurant that overdelivers.

580,Tanuki Tavern,★,20091215,Sam Sifton,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/dining/reviews/16rest.html,"JEFFREY CHODOROW is a bewhiskered seducer of the restaurant world, a tough-guy gourmand, one of the smarter cats ever to ring big money on drinks and bar food. For more than two decades he has run counter to restaurateurs interested in rubbed-wood authenticity and locavore cuisine. He has stood, always, for brash showmanship, the belief that in restaurants, the whole and complete point of the business is volume. In the face of recessions and in boom times alike he has accumulated more than 25 restaurants and bars in close to a dozen cities, all of them tied to the idea of dazzling, low-cut, cocktail-fueled good times. “You’re going to a restaurant and you’re spending $150 for two people,” he told The New York Times in 2005. “You’re entitled to have fun.” From his first foray, the flashy China Grill, to his latest, Tanuki Tavern in the Hotel Gansevoort and Ed’s Chowder House in the Empire Hotel, he has promised that opportunity: fun, against the customer’s outlay of cash. The concept at Tanuki Tavern is that it’s an izakaya, or Japanese-style tapas bar. That is not entirely accurate. Really Tanuki is Ono, the immense Japanese-style restaurant Mr. Chodorow opened five years ago, now in a smaller space with almost the same number of seats. He sublets the rest of the space to the nightclub Provocateur. (Mr. Chodorow isn’t in this racket to spill soup.) The result is young and exciting, with food from the same larder as Ono’s: respectable, perfectly good quasi-Asian fare. Also like Ono, it is pretty in design and execution: Japanese cabinetry and piped-in ’80s rock, LED candles, paper lanterns and two floors of tables full of men and women in clothing inappropriate to the weather. Tanuki is a fine place to drink sake, eat chicken wings and visit a simulacrum of South Beach, Sunset Boulevard, the timeless thump-thump-thump of Saturday night on the Vegas strip. It provides direct transport, in other words, to Chodorowland. To eat, there are sushi maki rolls of the sort you can find all over the East Village: spicy, sweet, salty, crisp. (Best is the spider roll, with soft-shell crab and spicy miso; worst is the yakuza roll, with eel, avocado and boursin.) A plate of corn and white miso tempura cakes come from the same playbook. They’re like something out of a fantasy high school cafeteria: sweet, crunchy and addictive. An Ono-style hibachi comes to the table with an excellent hunk of hanger steak. Skewered grilled chicken wings are likewise uncomplicated, likewise worthy: tender meat, with a slight crunch, seasoned with lemon and soy. Crisp seafood tempura offers one of the better $17 deals in the neighborhood: bites of lobster, scallop, clam, shrimp and oyster, with a sweet-chili aioli. Sweet and fire are on board with a Thai-style fried chicken as well, drizzled in honey. A marrow bone with black-lava sea salt may display none of the “miso braised” technique offered on the menu, but it’s still a pleasant moment in a night of eating small. Desserts are available. But they make you look fat. Up at Ed’s, a glass and mirror-filled rectangle on the second floor of the Empire Hotel, which Mr. Chodorow used to run as Center Cut, a steakhouse, the vision is fuzzier and the fun not so readily apparent. In part that’s a factor of the neighborhood and its market forces: less pulchritudinous and, because of Lincoln Center across the street, eager for a fast dinner besides. But of course it’s also, you know, the chowder. Chowder is flannel, fleece and chilly noses. It’s tough to sell as glamour. Chowders and mojitos don’t mix. Ed’s Chowder House is a product of collaboration between Mr. Chodorow and Ed Brown, the ridiculously talented chef who broke into Manhattan consciousness as the hand behind Tropica in 1990, and who spent almost 15 years as the executive chef at the Sea Grill. Most recently he has been at the helm of Eighty One on the Upper West Side. One wonders, though, how much time he’s spent at Ed’s, which advertises its seafood bona fides with plastic salt and pepper cellars, stock photographs of fishing scenes and the profligate use of lemons as objets d’art. There was, one night, something of his style and worth in a terrific dish of smoked Chatham cod cakes with a roasted tomato-chili jam. A piece of striped bass was cooked simply and well, served without pretension to mask its flavor. And the signature chowders were, if not revelatory, at least fairly rich. But none of his delicacy was apparent in other meals — in greasy, overdone fried calamari with saffron aioli, for instance, or in celery-heavy, muddy-hued steamed clams with plonk broth. It was not evident in a cartilage-rich, flavor-poor lobster roll on a buttery hot-dog bun, or in lightly battered, nameless fish and chips showered in Old Bay seasoning. It was absent from comically over-buttered sea scallops with butter beans, bacon and escarole, and another of overcooked scallop ravioli with white wine sauce. It was deeply missed in a rubbery dish of “moist grilled lobster” with “spaghetti vegetables & lemon butter sauce” that might as well have been shipped direct from a grim summer wedding in a beachside catering mill. Did Mr. Brown personally have something to do with the ammonia taste of a particularly elderly wing of skate served with horseradishy mashed potatoes and left untouched on the plate (to the shrug of a waiter)? It seems somehow unlikely. This still being 2009, there are the requisite glass towers of wine, but cocktails and beer are the more appropriate response to this food. You might want strong coffee after a dessert of pudding and crumble. (To the good, they recall Durgin-Park in Boston.) A few weeks ago, Mr. Chodorow was seen striding out of Ed’s with an armful of file folders and a look on his face that would not be unfamiliar to anyone with a passing interest in professional wrestling. It may bode well for the restaurant’s future. (Maybe he had the skate?) Professional wrestlers work either as baby-face heroes or evil heels. Mr. Chodorow, glowering, has cast himself as a heel. And he’s riveting. You can’t stop watching the guy, wanting to know what comes next.

584,Buddakan,Two Stars,20060503,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/dining/reviews/in-a-palace-of-plenty-supersize-surprises.html,"IF a restaurateur is going to enter the competitive downtown arena of pseudo-Asian pleasure domes, he might as well go for broke. He might as well blow out more than 15,000 square feet of space, fill it with bright colors and festoon it with jumbled visual allusions: an enormous fake European tapestry here, scores of artfully showcased Buddha pictures over there. He might as well set the ceiling of the central dining room as high as the Himalayas, hang a row of gargantuan chandeliers from it, and, ignoring the constraints of stiletto heels and the possible tipsiness of their wearers, make diners descend into this gaudy banquet hall -- and the maze of moody chambers around it -- via a vertiginous staircase. He might as well dim the lights, crank up the hypnotic music and flood the zone with dozens of servers. He might as well try to leave Megu and Matsuri in the dust and Spice Market gasping for air. That seems to be the philosophy that Stephen Starr brought to Buddakan, a restaurant as flashy as any this city has seen. Buddakan is the apotheosis, at least for the next 60 seconds, of a distinct genre: the post-millennial urban mess hall as supersize cocktail lounge with superstylized dishes, which chart a far-out trip to the Far East. The specific cuisine in its sights is Chinese, and the real surprise is how good many of Buddakan's alternately faithful and fanciful interpretations of it are. A restaurant this sexy doesn't need to be smart. But its chef, Michael Schulson, breathes intelligence and creativity into it. His mao poe tofu may be the most crazily addictive thing I've tasted in months. Cubes of silky bean curd act as crucial moments of calm in a wet, fiery mix of garlic, Thai chili peppers and, well, minced pork. If you want tofu to bust loose like this, you have to give it meat as well as heat. There's an appealing spin on tuna tartare that actually manages to taste somewhat novel, with the diced big-eye tuna layered atop bits of poached egg in scallion oil. It comes on an undulating white plate that looks like a snowdrift. There's also a nifty take on beef tartare, which has tapioca, mint and fish sauce in the mix. Cantonese spring rolls were so plump with shrimp and chicken and so crunchy on the outside that a companion who shared them with me was still raving about them a month later. She wasn't saying much about the Peking duck, which lacked sufficiently crisp skin and notably tender flesh. But that's the thing about Buddakan -- more than a few losers keep company with the many winners. Buddakan, which opened in early March, has an identically named forebear in Philadelphia, where Mr. Starr operates 12 restaurants. He's not so much testing the waters of New York as doing a headlong dive into them, and his chosen point of entry is the fringes of the meatpacking district, where the crush of fabulousness is getting a little confusing. Buddakan, with 275 seats for dining and about 50 more for drinking, should not be confused with the unrelated Buddha-Bar, which just opened a few blocks to the south and can squeeze in at least as many people. Nor should it be confused with Morimoto, another Starr newcomer, which serves quasi-Japanese food on a similarly glitzy stage no more than a few hundred yards away. Entering Buddakan, you encounter a host station nearly as large -- and often as thronged -- as an airline check-in counter. The journey to your table takes you past what look like the lacquered windows of a Chinese temple to a red room or a teal room or maybe a shimmering gold ""library,"" its walls lined with fake books. Make a bid for the library, which is fittingly quieter than other areas. Order a cocktail called ""heat."" Made with tequila, Cointreau and cucumbers muddled with a chili paste, it's like a margarita with martial arts training -- and it's the only specialty drink I didn't find too sweet. Among appetizers, avoid anything in the shape of a ball -- meaning dumplings and fritters, which tended to be dull -- with the exception of the sui mei. Each of them had a rich amalgam of crab meat and shrimp mousse on the inside and, on the outside, a tiara of additional crab meat. Consider the tartares, spring rolls or boneless pork spare ribs, sauced sweetly but not cloyingly. In a restaurant this mammoth, you don't expect fish to be as beautifully cooked as Buddakan's steamed red snapper, a dish cribbed from the short-lived restaurant Yumcha in Greenwich Village. It was served with black fungus mushrooms and lily bulb, which had a pleasant bitterness. An equally moist steamed sole wore a glistening coat of oil infused with ginger and scallions. The kitchen dutifully rounded out more than a half-dozen seafood entrees with glazed black cod because, ever since Nobu, a splashy Asian restaurant has to. Mr. Schulson told me on the telephone that he serves about 80 orders of that cod, which happens to be excellent, a night. He serves about five of the mao poe tofu. The world is unjust. Tea-smoked chicken with a scallion and ginger chutney was about as tender as chicken gets. While various red meat entrees -- pork belly, short ribs, lamb chops -- were prepared with obvious care, they felt too rote. Among solid noodle and rice dishes, the standout was fried rice with a creamy congee of scallops on top. Like Mr. Schulson, the pastry chef, Daniel Skurnick, does work distinctive enough to compete with the décor. A ""crying chocolate"" cake wept delectable tears of white chocolate ganache, while intensely flavored sorbets of blood orange and ginger lemon grass were bedecked with fried ginger chips. Buddakan won't please diners of all ages equally. It's better suited to the young, and its own youth is crucial to its appeal. Restaurants like this tend to look junky upon fifth or sixth inspection, and it's hard to believe this kitchen, serving so many diners at such a fleet pace, won't show signs of strain over time. But for now it's keeping up with the crowds -- and providing more reason than many patrons need to teeter down those scary steps into a labyrinth that Kubla Khan would undoubtedly have found appetizing.

590,Choptank,Satisfactory,20100302,Sam Sifton,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/dining/reviews/03rest.html,"THE Choptank River runs like a paper cut down the thumb of Maryland’s Eastern Shore, across the Chesapeake Bay from Baltimore, out of Kent County, Delaware, toward points south and west. There is marshland along parts of it, where ducks land in the fall and winter, where crabs once burrowed and oyster spat took hold. Rockfish still cruise its brackish waters, down to the salt. There is a lot of farmland along its shores. Choptank the restaurant opened this winter on Bleecker Street in Greenwich Village, taking the watershed as its muse and Baltimore as its butler. The restaurant evokes the Chesapeake region in the way that dorm rooms at Johns Hopkins do: Duck Head khakis in the dresser and lacrosse sticks leaning against the desk, postcards from Rehoboth Beach tacked to the wall along with the covering board from grandfather’s sloop, a thrift-store oil painting, sconces from mom. So there ain’t no pit beef here, hon.  Too low-class. No steamed crabs on paper tablecloths, either. (Though they say come summer.) You can’t buy a can of Natty Boh beer. (The company doesn’t distribute up north.) There is a fine Ostrowski’s Polish sausage sitting with its pretzel brother on a plate, garlicky as a Pigtown housewife, but there is no John Waters to Choptank, much less Avon Barksdale or Stringer Bell. The restaurant’s vibe is suburban, as safe as Cal Ripken. The food is to match, especially among the appetizers: crab dip out of a Junior League cookbook, with potato chips russet with Old Bay seasoning, all celery salt and heat; church-supper Virginia ham, with biscuits that taste morning-made and midday-refrigerated. A blandish crab chowder looks like a paste pot even if the taste is credible, the region’s more typical base of tomatoes and broth swapped out for cream, soft potatoes, bits of bacon. Also off map, there’s an excellent rock-shrimp taco plate, with a slaw brightened with cumin and lime; it comes with a slash of crème fraîche, a Mexican debutante. Jonah crab claws are a gift of Maine, served with a fantastic Old Bay vinegar sauce that gives them a Deal Island drawl. And if Rappahannock oysters on the half shell are local enough, they could use a dip in batter and some time in the fryer; those interested in oysters that taste good raw would do far better to stick with offerings from the Northeast. Peel-and-eat shrimp, that great mid-Atlantic treat, generally come in a bowl by the pound. Covered in Old Bay (the most important spice box in this restaurant’s kitchen), it makes for eating that is almost as messy as crabs. At Choptank, though, the dish arrives with the shrimp as neatly stacked as socks from the Gap, a full dozen meaty, slightly overdone fatties wedged into a heavy serving tray. The effect is jarring, as if Mrs. Astor had served you a New York hot dog on silver plate, then nodded ever so pointedly toward your knife and fork. Braised octopus, with pepper confit and potatoes, isn’t something you’re likely to find anywhere near the Chesapeake Bay, but it’s soft and flavorful, beautifully made. (In this, it resembles at least the basic wine list, which is diverse while steering clear of tidewater varietals; the “reserve” list offers ludicrously expensive bottles ill-suited to such putatively basic fare.) Even better is a bowl of roasted wild mushrooms with a soft egg yolk at their center — a marvel of haunting taste,  a terrific dish. Main courses follow the trend. They are Marylandish and not, good and bad, confusing to think about. The requisite crab cake is fat and delicious, well bound, not too cut with breading. And Arctic char with lentils and bacon is just about perfect, though it has as much to do with crab cakes and the rest of the restaurant’s aesthetic as a fist of hake, served with Tuscan kale and a scattering of clams (also nicely made). Fried chicken with black-pepper honey and collard greens ought to shine, even in a Manhattan overrun with high-end restaurants serving high-end versions of fried chicken. But Choptank’s runs in the opposite direction: pale and flabby on one night; greasy and dense another. Here’s to the restaurant’s handsome and flavorful oyster po’ boy, though. It comes with a good house-made ranch dressing if also regrettable “tobacco onions” that taste like wood shavings. And here’s to a decent hamburger as well, beefy under its crust, with bright pickled-pepper mayonnaise, Cheddar, a bacon jam and fries. Here’s a double huzzah to those fries, actually, dark brown and salty, with a healthy crust that breaks open on creamy, excellent starch. They are great. Douse them in malt vinegar and you might be at Thrasher’s on the Delaware boardwalk, sand in your hair, hangover receding in the heat of the sun. But a bistro steak with sweetbread gravy, mashed potatoes and baby vegetables puts you right back into a New York winter: eating B-minus food with friends, throwing money down a hatch. And dessert keeps you pinned there, with only a short list of recited specials that may have a good banana-bread pudding on it, but which culminates in a bayberry sorbet that tastes like a candle. Choptank used to be Bar Q, Anita Lo’s misstep into barbecue and gastro-pubbery. The space hasn’t changed much: a flight of stairs at the entrance leads past a bar and into a narrow room that leads through a pass into another narrow room. It has the feng shui of a rabbit warren. That doesn’t appear to bother the crowd, however, which has been building steadily since the restaurant’s opening. Part of this is good word of mouth (seriously, dude: awesome fries). And part of it is excellent use by the management of blocking techniques that are designed to pique desire while denying the ability to satisfy it. Want a table for four at 8 in a week? The online option denies you. And we have but 5:30 and 9:30, the nice woman on the phone said. Subsequent walks by the place at the appointed hours revealed plenty of open seats. New Yorkers probably deserve better. Certainly better is available. But as Snoop once said on “The Wire,” a stone-cold gangster making sense of the Baltimore night, “Deserve got nothin’ to do with it.”"
592,Satisfactory,One Star,20060816,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/16/dining/reviews/two-trailblazers-well-down-the-trail.html,"AS gracefully as any of his peers, Jean-Georges Vongerichten shows that today's globe-trotting, genre-straddling, hyperextended superchef can still create memorable -- even riveting -- meals. You need only visit the restaurants Perry St. and Jean Georges to believe. But can a chef stamp his name as wide and far as Mr. Vongerichten has and still make magic at the older as well as the newer establishments, at the fringe players as well as the flagship? You need only visit Mercer Kitchen and Vong to doubt. Start with Mercer Kitchen. Go on a Sunday night. The restaurant is almost empty, but that doesn't mean any extra care from the staff. A svelte hostess bestows a perfunctory greeting, as if irked at being roused from her photogenic torpor by something as humdrum as the arrival of guests. A bartender watches you close out your tab in preparation for dinner, then lets you sit there for five minutes before telling you that he won't be letting the hostess know you're ready and that she probably won't check back. It's up to you to make it all happen. So you do. And you order. And the food appears quickly: a mixed blessing if ever there were one. Your pea soup doubles as a salt quarry. Your hamachi sashimi comes with two incongruously gargantuan bread sticks, which Babe Ruth could have used to hit homers. The mussels in your seafood platter don't taste right. A pork chop with a hot-cool chili glaze requires the incisors of a jungle cat. You're mystified, so you go back a few times. And sure enough, there are scattered pleasures, though the distracted service is never one of them. The toppings on the brick-oven pizzas -- raw tuna and wasabi; pear and pistachio; black truffle and Fontina -- are bold and flavorful. A salad showcasing steamed shrimp and avocado realizes its timid ambitions. The same goes for roasted chicken, the meat of which is tender, the skin crisp. But the skin on roasted duck is floppy, slippery and the saltiest thing you've tasted since a certain pea soup. A soft-shell crab has supposedly been dipped in tempura batter and deep-fried, but there's no vestige of either activity in the cold, spongy wreck before you. Come dessert, you almost chip your tooth on one of the hard, frozen strawberries in a deconstructed ice cream sandwich. Mercer Kitchen opened in 1998, and one of its attractions then is an attraction now: an underground space that looks like an improbably sexy rathskeller. Its darkness blurs flaws, making the food, like the diners, seem more appetizing. But the reviews from eight years ago (Ruth Reichl awarded it two stars) suggest that the kitchen once operated more reliably. They also describe a menu seemingly more creative than the current one, which is an ethnically indistinct assortment of dishes with enough pro forma salads and sides to make you question the point of Mr. Vongerichten's involvement, beyond the cachet it lends the restaurant and the money it presumably brings him. Mercer Kitchen doesn't represent much of a showcase for him or his chef de cuisine, Christopher Beischer. Its true calling becomes clear on a crowded Friday night, when the tables turn quickly, tweaked martinis line the bar and clay pots of crunchy French fries (excellent, as it happens) sprout from every third table. This is the SoHo version of an Applebee's. While Mercer Kitchen feels like a cynical enterprise, the Thai-French trailblazer Vong merely feels like a tired one. It's been around since 1992, when oversized palm fronds still counted as theatrical Asian décor, the pairing of sautéed foie gras with mango was considered novel, and the galangal in a chicken and coconut milk soup seemed exotic. Bryan Miller gave it three stars back then. More than a decade later, the virtue of Vong's décor is its calmness in comparison to such like-spirited successors as Kittichai and Mr. Vongerichten's own Spice Market. That foie gras and that soup lack a sense of surprise that, it turns out, were integral to the intensity of their appeal. Like the majority of the dishes at Vong, they're entirely pleasant but not remotely compelling. At least Vong, unlike Mercer Kitchen, sharply reflects aspects of Mr. Vongerichten's culinary personality -- for example, the obsessive, measured integration of sweet and sour, fiery and lulling. You see it in a few welcome newcomers to the menu, like an appetizer with alternating slices of king oyster mushroom and avocado. They're heated by Thai green chili and jalapeño oil, which gather force slowly in your mouth, and cooled by mint. There's more chili -- along with mango, Asian pear, tomato, cilantro and Thai basil -- in a kaleidoscopic appetizer that spotlights pale red cubes of Tasmanian sea trout. The dish has an opulent texture, thanks to not only the fish but also lime-infused tapioca and a coconut gelée. Vong's desserts remain impressive, and its servers exude an upbeat spirit you wouldn't expect from people trussed in silly white jackets with shiny gold buttons. But you keep wondering if the food they deliver is really as it should be and all that it could be, if the restaurant is receiving Mr. Vongerichten's most considered judgments and the most dedicated efforts of the chef de cuisine, Pierre Schutz, who's been around since the beginning. Should the black pepper and soy paste on grilled sirloin be quite this thick and sweet? Should black sea bass with coconut juice and parsnip purée be quite this vapid? Shouldn't the flavor of lobster be more present amid the curry paste, carrots and apple enveloping it? And shouldn't Mr. Vongerichten be called on this? His reputation is attached as firmly to Vong and to Mercer Kitchen as to restaurants that undoubtedly absorb more of his worry. It's the same lure, but it's no guarantee. It's no guarantee at all.

594,Perla,★★,20120515,Pete Wells,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/16/dining/reviews/michael-toscano-provides-a-thrill-at-perla.html,"UNTIL I ate the vitello tonnato at Perla, I’d never thought of it as a dish to get a carnivore’s pulse racing. The veal is often too thin, too gray, too much a blank canvas for the mayonnaise and tuna. Then one night the version at Perla showed up, and I heard part of my brain, the part that we share with wolves and lions, calling out an urgent message: There’s meat at the table. This veal was pink all over, thrillingly pink. It was cut into juicy slabs almost a quarter-inch thick, not shaved into onionskin layers. And it was fantastic, with that quiet but very real flavor of true veal that America has all but forgotten. The meat was the point of the dish, and a demonstration of what Perla and its chef, Michael Toscano, do best. The restaurant, which opened on Minetta Lane this year, serves a swaggering red-blooded version of Italian food. One dish that sums up the philosophy is duck ragù on handmade cavatelli. Dark and glossy with duck fat, sweet from slow braising, the ragù can stop conversation all by itself. But in Mr. Toscano’s world, that’s not enough. A server holds a grater in one hand and a frozen cylinder of foie gras terrine in the other, and begins to rub them together above the pasta. You might ask whether this benediction of foie gras dust, which disappears into the sauce and leaves behind only a wink of privilege, is necessary. I would reply: What kind of silly question is that? You might as well wonder whether Mr. Toscano’s sensational roast guinea hen really needs its foie gras sauce. Or ask whether the rib-eye for two, blasted in the wood-burning oven to give it a serious Fourth of July backyard char, would work without a few spoonfuls of syrupy balsamic vinegar aged so long it’s almost as complex as Madeira. While you’re at it, why don’t you go ahead and order a bourbon cocktail called Tombstone Sunday Nights, and tell the bartender to leave out the pepperoni bitters. If these are the kinds of things you worry about, this is not the restaurant for you. Enjoying Mr. Toscano’s cooking requires a willingness — even an eagerness — to go a little too far, and then tell yourself that too far is exactly where you wanted to be. This willingness is the price of admission at many of Mario Batali’s restaurants, too. Not coincidentally, Mr. Toscano spent years in the Batali circus, first as a sous-chef at Babbo, then as the chef at Manzo, inside Eataly. The cooking at Manzo, at least under Mr. Toscano, was exceptional, but you ate it in a dining room that sits inside a pumped-up grocery store, without benefit of doors or walls. To get to the restrooms, you go to Eataly’s beer department and turn right. Perla is in most respects a more welcoming environment. Like Minetta Tavern across the street, it deploys red banquettes and mirrors and lighting the color of aged Parmigiano-Reggiano in a way that suggests it has been around for decades. Unlike Minetta, Perla isn’t a period piece, not with its framed photo of Mos Def, the unsettling portrait on the cover of his record “The New Danger.” Perla’s proprietor, Gabriel Stulman, also operates Jeffrey’s Grocery, Joseph Leonard and Fedora, all of them small, all of them somewhere on the spectrum between ambitious bars and actual restaurants. He staffs his places largely with Midwesterners, who have become the smiling storm troopers for his brand of hospitality: earnest, familiar, very downtown yet entirely nonthreatening. One night, a female server at Perla bounded over to a table of youthful big spenders in cotton shirts and silk neckties given a 5-o’clock tug, and greeted them with a flirty “Hi, boys!” In this comfortable setting, I’m happy to report, a great deal of the Manzo menu has been transplanted with very slight amendments. The beef that was a specialty of Manzo reappears, to glorious effect. Here is the suave tartare of beef from the Razza breed of Piedmontese cattle; here is the squared-off braised and grilled tongue, soft as ice cream at the beach (though it called out for a more forceful sauce). And here are some ideal gnocchi, in a dead-simple tomato sauce with a stealthy chile warmth. There is no foie gras or marrow in this dish, or in the delicate tortelli with ricotta salata and miniature coins of sliced asparagus, or in the orecchiette with sweet sausage and ramp pesto that had an untamed, garlicky edge. Mr. Toscano can step lightly at times, but not always. The fig vinaigrette on a salad of field greens was pointlessly sweet, and skate with black truffle vinaigrette was oily, flat-footed. He is in charge of pastries, too, and this may be too much to ask, because some sloppiness creeps in at the end of the meal. Rustic desserts like chocolate crostata or date cheesecake looked as if they had been dropped on the floor, and fennel cookies showed up one night so underdone that they might have been made in an Easy-Bake oven. Dessert in a glass might be advisable, because Perla has a fascinating selection of after-dinner drinks, including otherworldly Austrian eaux-de-vie from Hans Reisetbauer. The wine list is a charming read, too, until you check out the prices. There are too few choices below $50, and many of the bottles have been marked up at about three times retail, rather than the standard two times. Better values would be welcome and so would reservations. Currently only six tables can be reserved; the rest are first come first served, a policy that is easier to take at an ambitious bar than at a restaurant where you are encouraged to order antipasti, primi and secondi, and where a roast chicken for two costs $65. Dining at Perla takes a significant commitment of time and money. The restaurant should make a reciprocal commitment, rather than force customers to stand around near the bar — not at the bar (stools are reserved for dining at peak hours), but near the bar. By 8 p.m. the mob gets thick and the wait can be two hours. One night, somebody sent a 2002 Dom Pérignon to the table next to mine. The bottle cost $400. With a few customers like that, Perla could subsidize quite a few less expensive choices for everybody else. Hospitality means more than a friendly smile."
597,Resto,★★,20070523,Frank Bruni,Kips Bay,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/23/dining/reviews/23rest.html,"IT’S time for a quiz. A diagnostic test, really. This one is best taken on an empty stomach, with a napkin and a defibrillator at hand. 1. If the lamb ribs you’re served are striped with garishly thick bands of fat, you ... a) use your knife as if it were a scalpel, surgically isolating the meat. b) quiver with joy. 2. If a tower of French fries is skirted by a deep well of mayonnaise, you ... a) gasp, and ask for ketchup instead. b) say a prayer of thanks. 3. If a deviled egg wobbles on a pedestal of breaded, deep-fried pork jowl, you ... a) send it back. b) wonder how much better the egg might taste on a double-decker pedestal of breaded, deep-fried pork jowl. If you answered (a) to all or most of the above, stop reading now. What follows may sicken you, ruining your breakfast of low-fat cottage cheese and jeopardizing your attendance at Bikram yoga class. If you answered (b), perk up. A terrific new restaurant named Resto serves lamb ribs just like the ones I described. Its deviled eggs really do piggyback on pork. And the mayonnaise for the thick, lustrous fries can be ordered plain or in flavors like sweet chili and lime pickle. I suppose you could do a mayonnaise tasting, though the architects of Resto’s menu don’t actually set it up that way. They’re brave, but they don’t want Mayor Bloomberg swooping in to cite them for crimes against cardiology. Resto calls itself Belgian, an inadequately revered genre in this city, and it flies that flag in the requisite ways. There’s beer, more than 50 kinds, on tap and in bottles, zesty and ponderous, a Delirium Tremens and a Delirium Nocturnum. Order the Kwak, a beverage and a puzzle in one. If you don’t remove its hourglass-shaped goblet from a wood cradle at just the right angle, you go thirsty. And if you don’t return it to the cradle just so, it goes horizontal. There are fries and more fries, which pop up everywhere, even at the bottom of a steel pot, sopping up the juices from a flabby, tender hunk of beef cheek marinated and braised in beer. And there are mussels upon mussels, with broths of different ingredients and flavors: guanciale and chili flake; curry and coconut milk; Witte ale and orange zest. Mussels are as dainty as the cuisine at Resto gets, with the exception of an entree of loup de mer, a fish out of water in a restaurant where fatback is ground into a killer (almost literally) hamburger and where a tame-sounding poularde gets a wildly profligate shower of bacon. But Resto’s version of Belgium is neither clichéd nor isolationist. Asian seasonings flicker in a few dishes, giving this giddy fat fest nuances that take it to a higher level. Those lamb ribs, for example, are coated in cardamom and Indonesian red palm sugar, among other ingredients. A yogurt sauce beneath them has cilantro in addition to pickled tomatoes. This nimble internationalism to some extent reflects the background of Resto’s executive chef, Ryan Skeen. Mr. Skeen, 29, cooked at Elizabeth Daniel in San Francisco and 5 Ninth in Manhattan. He was recruited for this heart-stopping production by Christian Pappanicholas, 32, who was a manager at Otto and ’Inoteca and wanted to strike out on his own. From Belgian friends he developed a love of Belgian beer and food, along with a conviction that restaurants in this city weren’t doing Belgium justice. To right that wrong he took over a half-underground space around the corner from Les Halles and installed a long marble bar, a pressed-tin ceiling and about 40 seats  — in addition to 10 bar stools  — at simple, bistro-style wood tables more widely separated than you’d expect. The extra space, like the beaming greeting when you walk in, is a real courtesy, though I wouldn’t be surprised to see a few additional tables before long. There’s more than enough demand for them. Be forewarned: Resto — the name is slang for restaurant — doesn’t take reservations for groups smaller than six, and on some nights there’s a 45-minute wait by 7:30. It can be difficult to reach the bar through the crowd around it and even tougher to hear servers through the din. But the issue at restaurants like this isn’t whether such conditions are ideal; it’s whether they’re reflected in the prices. At Resto they largely are. You’ll pay $18 for a sizable heap of mussels with fries, $19 for the beef cheek carbonade, $6 for a serving of sausage. While the poularde, for two, costs $55, it could feed almost three people, and the regal bird, impeccably roasted, is from a Pennsylvania farm. Resto is as finicky as more expensive restaurants about the providers it uses, turning anew to that farm, Four Story Hill, for the black pig for its house-made, mousse-soft boudin blanc. The lamb in an even better house-made sausage with niçoise olives comes from a tiny Vermont farm. The brunch and dinner menus are concise, but their brevity doesn’t keep Resto from treading some predictable ground (steak frites, frisée aux lardons) and hitting some rough spots. Shards of chewy chickpea waffle, for example, had no business with an otherwise pleasant scallop dinner appetizer. Most of the desserts are utterly straightforward. In the spirit of the restaurant, you should probably get the tasting of Belgian chocolates, with different intensities and accents: Sichuan  peppercorn, almond. But think as well about the walnut tart, in which walnut plays no more prominent a role than caramel and chocolate ganache. The dessert’s decadent richness makes it a fitting segue from all that precedes it. You can’t eat this way every night. But shouldn’t a restaurant present an exception to rules, a license to gorge on such naughtiness as Resto’s bitter ballen, an appetizer of breaded, fried balls of veal, pork and Gruyère? I got these on the first of my visits but not the last, at 11:30 one night, immediately after a sushi dinner across town. I needed something weightier and couldn’t get Resto out of my head, not to mention my arteries. So I dropped in for a consistency check on that burger, made of hanger steak and beef cheek, in addition to the fatback, and served on a soft bun with red onion, pickles and — shock of shocks — mayonnaise. I gnawed on some more lamb ribs. And I bit into the tête de cochon sandwich, perhaps the best test of whether Resto is for you. It’s toasted brioche filled with pieces of curry-braised pig’s head, pickles and — stunner of stunners — mayonnaise. You can probably guess whether I ... a) cried, “Enough is enough!” b) trembled in gratitude, and thought, “A little more mayo wouldn’t be such a bad idea.”"
599,Intersect by Lexus,NYT Critic's Pick,20190122,Pete Wells,Meatpacking District,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/dining/intersect-by-lexus-restaurant-review.html,"The nice man who brought samples of the banoffee macaron to me and other customers one recent morning began, a few moments later, to gently buff the doors and windows of a new, rose-gold prototype car with a soft cloth. I could see this because the car and I were sharing a room on West 14th Street. The car was in the back and I was in the middle, sitting at one of the cafe tables near the stairs to the second floor, where there is a bar shaped like a wheel and a restaurant with a menu devised by Gregory Marchand, the chef of the Frenchie restaurants in Paris and London. The employees in all of these rooms work for the Union Square Hospitality Group, which I suppose means that Danny Meyer, the group’s founder and one of the world’s best-known restaurateurs, is now also in the business of polishing automobiles. The whole operation is called Intersect by Lexus, which gives you a good idea who made the car and was paying to keep it shiny and free of dust. Intersect by Lexus is one of those modern places where brands, instead of asking you to buy one of their products then and there, instead try to make you feel the kinds of emotions about the brand that may lead to a sale later on. This is a job formerly performed by advertisements. In fact, Lexus used to publish a print magazine and mail it to its customers, back when that seemed like a good way to persuade people to have emotions about a car. Now we live in the age of the “branded experience.” A toilet-paper manufacturer will send you a wheeled toilet on demand. A mattress company will encourage you to sleep inside a roaming “napmobile.” Makers of a crunchy orange snack open restaurants, lasting just a few days, where chefs put the crunchy orange snack into meatballs, tacos, cheesecakes and everything else. You cannot get Anne Burrell to sprinkle a Lexus over the top of your mac and cheese, however, and not just because the cheapest one costs $33,000 more than a bag of crunchy orange snacks. Intersect by Lexus takes a different approach, closer to that of A/D/O, a “creative hub” in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, owned by the car brand Mini. A/D/O offers temporary exhibitions, talks, performances, work spaces for designers and a sun-filled, roomy Scandinavian cafe whose kitchen was, for a time, overseen by the chef Fredrik Berselius and the restaurateur Claus Meyer. (Mr. Berselius is no longer involved.) When I ate at the cafe, shortly after A/D/O opened, the food barely dented my consciousness, although I remember thinking that if I worked nearby I probably would drop in for lunch or a cortado. In the same way, if I find myself in the meatpacking district by day, I might join the Wi-Fi philosophers who occupy the spindle-backed chairs downstairs at Intersect, just so I could get a maple-bacon scone, a recipe imported from Frenchie to Go on the Rue du Nil in Paris. On the other hand, I’d go well out of my way to eat upstairs at Intersect again. It’s not a restaurant in three dimensions — the service, while skilled, is a bit anonymous, and the interior is a hodgepodge of expensive, subtle design and bric-a-brac that might have been ordered from a catalog. But the food is some of the most engaging I’ve come across in the past few months, and it will go away after the end of March, when Mr. Marchand’s menu will be replaced by one devised by another chef from somewhere else in the world, chosen by representatives from Union Square Hospitality Group and Lexus. (A formal review, with stars, would be obsolete almost as soon as it was published.) I’ve never made it to Frenchie or its branch in London. Many New York chefs have, however, and working my way through Mr. Marchand’s dishes at Intersect helped me understand what other restaurants around town have been trying to imitate: the charred leaves, the cooked grains, the gently swirling patterns that suggest the chef has been plating food on a turntable. Grilled baby leek greens angled out around a pile of barley topped with what looked like a deviled egg. It was, in fact, a smoked and lemon-spiked yolk plopped in the center of some “whites” made of Parmesan sabayon. Spice and crunch came from puffed barley dusted with piment d’Espelette. It was just tricky enough, this dish. And I loved the way a caraway brioche, pickled mustard seeds and cucumbers completed the deli allusions begun by a foie gras terrine with layers of soft, smoky pastrami. There was a very welcome spin on skate grenobloise in which the fish was replaced by creamy white halibut under a golden bread-crumb crust; sea beans extended the briny flavor of capers in the brown butter sauce. And if this all sounds a bit cerebral, the big, pillowy, pan-seared gnocchi with fried sweetbreads and veal-glazed mushrooms proved that Mr. Marchand knows the appeal of animal instincts. What to make of those few dishes that did not come together — the pebbles of cauliflower under a layer of seeds and nuts that looked as if it had spilled from a bird feeder, or the lukewarm chocolate mousse at the bottom of a deep bowl? Was the problem Mr. Marchand’s recipes? The way the Union Square Hospitality kitchen crew, led by Nickolas Martinez, had carried them out? The local terroir? Mr. Martinez and Dylan Shipsey, the general manager, say they want customers to feel as if they are walking into Frenchie in Paris. Intersect does not have the premodern limestone wall and ceiling timbers of the Rue du Nil, but Mr. Marchand tried to sprinkle some Right Bank pixie dust on West 14th Street by choosing the plates and bowls, consulting on flower arrangements and sharing his Spotify playlists. Maybe those things help. But the dining room, by the design firm Wonderwall, mostly looks like money to me, apart from the shelves half-filled with coffee-table books, black crow figurines and other eerily generic knickknacks. At least somebody had the good sense to keep the car downstairs, by the restrooms, before it was rolled out last weekend to make room for another temporary exhibition. In what may not be a good sign for Lexus, nobody paid much attention to it when I was there, but somebody was always marveling about the toilets, the Japanese kind that seem to know exactly what you are going to do before you do. The chef-in-residence conceit is not unique to Intersect. On Mulberry Street, Chefs Club also turns its permanent kitchen crew over to somebody else’s menu; a new restaurant in Houston, the Decatur Bar & Popup Factory, gives its entire space to prospective restaurateurs for three months at a time so they can test-drive their ideas before going out on their own. The chefs of Contra, in Manhattan, and other restaurants sometimes turn over the menu to friends of theirs for a night or two. The most ambitious experiment in this vein may be In Situ, the restaurant inside the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art that on any given day faithfully reproduces a dozen or so dishes that are strongly identified with other restaurants around the world. To understand the appeal for chefs of these pop-ups and residencies, think about the Instagram posts, the email-address caches, the preview news items, even the occasional reviews they generate. For a few months’ or even a few nights’ work, a restaurant can refresh its aura of newness and relevance. In an era that feeds on novelty, chefs who just keep plugging along can seem older than they really are. The events make the host restaurant look cooler, too. (It’s been a while since Union Square Hospitality Group hired a chef who got menu analysts chattering the way Mr. Marchand does.) And of course, people who go to these dinners can boast about them on social media. It’s a big, beautiful marketing ecosystem in which everybody from predators to bottom feeders gets to believe they’re at the top of the food chain."
605,Wild Salmon,★,20070801,Frank Bruni,Murray Hill,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/01/dining/reviews/01rest.html,"I WISH I’d had Al Gore with me at Wild Salmon, where I stumbled across a new sign of climate change. It concerned dessert, and it might well have concerned him. I ordered the baked Alaska, a frigid diorama in which the meringue is molded to resemble an igloo. And I noticed right away that something was extinct: a proud chocolate penguin, described in write-ups of the restaurant, that had once stood beside the frosty abode. In its place a few humble chocolate  fish were adrift. When I ordered the dish a second time, even they were gone, the ecosystem impoverished once more. The igloo looked smaller, and its ice cream interior was softer. A fluke? Maybe. But I wonder about global warming. I wonder as well about other oddities at Wild Salmon: the oppressive exuberance of the service,  the markedly disparate appeal of the dishes. But the restaurant’s central idea is a sound one, notwithstanding that edible ode to  Eskimo  living.  Instead of   searching abroad for novelty and inspiration, Wild Salmon finds a fresh approach by looking only to the opposite side of the country. It showcases  —  and sometimes does justice to  —  the bounty of the Pacific Northwest: the oysters, crabs, mushrooms, beer and wine, from a list that reminds you how far Oregon and Washington have come. Front and center, of course, is the mighty Pacific salmon, its reputation embattled by too much fish farming and too many bland banquet-hall fillets. This restaurant endeavors to restore the fish’s rightful dignity by using only wild catch, getting it from the waters that nurture it best, and entrusting its preparation to a chef, Charles Ramseyer, who’s from Seattle, which presumably makes him a salmon savant. He may never have cooked as much of it in a given night as he does here. Wild Salmon presents the fish in so many varieties and guises that the tone of a question from one of my companions wasn’t necessarily facetious. “Where,” she asked, “is the salmon cereal?” Jeffrey Chodorow, who put this production together, must not have thought of that. After all, few restaurateurs work a conceit as exhaustively as he does, a tendency  evident in the nomenclature of the seafood platters. The smallest is called Mount St. Helens; the next biggest, Mount Shasta; the biggest of all, Mount Rainier. The amount of shellfish you get increases with the altitude of the Western peak you set out to scale. Wild Salmon swims in the Midtown  location where other Chodorow restaurants, including English Is Italian, went belly-up. Mr. Chodorow seemingly can’t quit this dramatic multilevel space, which has its drawbacks and advantages. It’s so vast  that it feels cold despite the soft glow of pretty lighting fixtures. But it has room for big, comfortable booths and big, comfortable chairs. From the high ceiling  dangles the most conspicuous décor tweak: hundreds of copper-colored fish sculptures. The food runs the gamut, by turns excellent, ordinary and puzzling.  I never met an oyster here I didn’t love, and I felt almost as much affection for the Penn Cove mussels, plump and meaty. But Alaskan red king crab legs lost any sweetness and picked up a tinge of iodine  when they logged all those food miles traversing the continent. And some of the Dungeness crab supposed to appear in a creamy chowder had apparently failed to get off the plane. I tasted mostly the corn that shared top billing with it. So it went with the starters, the worst being a “seafood margarita” that included crab, shrimp, orange, mango,  lime juice and tequila. If a posse of tough shellfish were mugged by an unruly fruit salad, the crime might look something like this. Salmon came to the rescue. In one appetizer luscious slices of king, sockeye and coho salmon, all cured and then smoked over apple wood, were presented with crunchy latkes, crème fraîche and paddlefish caviar. In another, crème fraîche and caviar  topped  king salmon tartare, while the sockeye in an adjacent tartare was tickled with Asian flourishes: soy sauce, ginger, pickled radish. Wild Salmon gives you multiple opportunities to compare different strains of salmon. The best method is to order the three kinds available as straightforward entrees. For each of them you’ll be asked to choose among   five cooking methods (go with grilled or “cedar planked”) and 10 house-made condiments  (go with Oregon morel pinot noir sauce). As presented here, coho is the least opulent  and king the most. Sockeye falls in between, its fish flavor more pointed but its mouth-feel less rewarding   than king salmon’s. Only the coho disappointed: too dry, in part from overcooking. The king was majestic, a glorious arch of   flesh, at once firm and delicate, with a pinkish complexion that gave way gradually to a much redder core. Other fish  —  grilled halibut,  black cod smoked over apple wood  —  also fared well. But ling cod, cooked en papillote, was a watery, salty mishap. Its presence on a menu that also spotlights yellow-eye rockfish (on some nights) and sand dabs (when available) speaks to the restaurant’s admirable attempt to branch out beyond the familiar. Although landlubbers are given many options, including wagyu beef steaks from Washington, they’re not on terra firma. Short ribs weren’t nearly as tender as possible, while a pork shank was encircled by a repellently thick band of rubbery fat. Among the sides the standout was creamed Walla Walla  corn; among desserts, a rhubarb-strawberry crisp that, with the advance of summer, became a slightly less impressive peach-blueberry crisp. A server recommended it.   Then again, servers seem to rave about everything, in such rapturous, insistent terms that you aren’t sure whether you’re ordering dinner or being reeled into a cult. “Yum!” said a waitress after one of my companions ordered the Sonoma  foie gras. Then, lest she be misunderstood, she added, “Yum!” And finally, to lend nuance to her testimonial, she concluded, “Yum!” Got it. But could we please have some more of the (yum-yum-yummy, as it turns out) flatbread? On that night we had to plead repeatedly for seconds. On another night, we waited more than an hour for firsts. At Wild Salmon the execution doesn’t always live up to the inspiration. That’s probably the explanation for the evolving igloo, though you can never rule out carbon emissions.

606,La Mar Cebicheria Peruana ,Satisfactory,20120327,Pete Wells,Midtown South,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/28/dining/reviews/a-review-of-la-mar-cebicheria-peruana-in-manhattan.html,"ON one of the few nights this winter when the temperature sagged below freezing, the host at La Mar Cebicheria Peruana led my party to an upstairs table without offering to take our coats. This was a surprise, because the coat check had been in full swing on a warmer night weeks earlier. In September, Gastón Acurio, the prodigious restaurateur and chef from Peru, opened this eighth branch of his expanding ceviche chain on Madison Square Park where Tabla once held court. The designer Stephanie Goto, hired to redo the two-story space, cast off its warm subcontinental palette in favor of a shimmery, tropical cool. When we reached the top of the stairs, images of the tropics came to a thudding halt. Nearly every chair had a winter coat draped over it, giving the room all the elegance of a church-basement bingo game. The coat-check clerk must have gone south for the night, taking along the employee in charge of cleaning up. At the beginning of that meal, the men’s room wastebasket overflowed with paper towels. An hour later, the room was still a mess. Like those paper towels, the oversights piled up. Pisco punch came in a goblet as sticky as a jelly jar. Explanations of menu terms like lúcuma and chicha morada were rushed and mumbled. Plates sat around so long before being cleared that they looked like archaeological sites. But what happened to a dish called Salmon Macho was no mere oversight. You could tell from the scorched surface of the fish that it had been cooked miles beyond the medium rare that the chef allegedly preferred. The flesh was parched, the yellow-pepper sauce was browned like crème brûlée and some clams that came with it were heat-blasted into nothingness. Any restaurant can get the hiccups. This one was having a full-blown seizure. I had other, better, far less disheveled meals at La Mar. And whenever I was spooning up a ceviche —bathed in a marinade that delivered chile heat and citrus acidity in precisely calibrated doses — I knew why Mr. Acurio is a rock star in Lima, and how he has managed to build a 31-restaurant empire in 12 countries. Still, once I got beyond ceviches, tiraditos (another raw-fish specialty) and a few other successes, too many dishes were either carelessly prepared or not very much fun to begin with. La Mar is a sometimes exciting, often disappointing demonstration of the ways in which a global restaurant chain opening an outpost in New York faces more complex challenges than a retailer planting a new Abercrombie & Fitch in SoHo. When you reproduce a menu from afar without testing it on the locals, or bet on a style of cuisine without scoping the competition, or hire servers who aren’t versed in the care and feeding of the natives, the city’s response can be cold and lingering, or brutal and swift. Some of this is local chauvinism. But the restaurateurs share the blame. Before presenting a choice of luxury fountain pens that turned the signing of the check at Alain Ducasse New York into a money-burning display that could well have embarrassed a Kardashian, Mr. Ducasse might have reflected that much of New York’s wealth is discreetly hidden away on the upper floors of skyscrapers. Before importing the menu for Le Caprice, Richard Caring might have asked whether the loyalists at his London original are loyal despite, rather than because of, the dressed-up and overpriced club food. As for Mr. Acurio, he had reason to be confident riding into Manhattan. Bogotá, Mexico City and São Paulo had taken to his ceviche-centric chain. Before a San Francisco location opened, he was asked how he intended to sell Americans on his country’s cuisine. Simple, he replied: “With a pisco sour in one hand and ceviche in the other, I think I can convince everybody.” La Mar’s ceviche is indeed compelling. Gleaming tiles of fish bask in liquids so vivid and potent that the Peruvian name, tiger’s milk, makes a kind of sense, almost. The one called Elegance, with Rhode Island fluke in an invigorating lime broth, is less marinated fish than raw seafood soup. I was persuaded, too, by a tiradito called Nikei, with sliced yellowfin tuna belly in a small lake of soy and sesame oil sauce; it starts out Japanese before a sour nudge of tamarind takes it in an unexpected, delicious direction. With all this fine raw seafood, I was surprised to find that my favorite appetizer of all was the tender, emphatic skewers of beef heart cooked on a grill. You eat it and feel strong. And if you are going to dip into the deep end of the menu, strength will help.Causas were busy assemblages of ingredients on bland cups of whipped potato; I could never figure out what was supposed to be good about them. Arroz con pato, a main course, featured washed-out duck on a mash of gluey green rice. Another rice dish, though, arroz negro, had the deep flavor and character of squid ink, and I appreciated the quality beef in lomo saltado, a stir-fry reflecting Peru’s Asian population. Both grouper and salmon belly main courses were overcooked, though they couldn’t compete with the Salmon Macho meltdown. The best part of a $42 lobster in hot ceviche was the dish of tiny potatoes that came alongside — a recipe from the family of Victoriano López, the executive chef. What about the Peruvian classic in Mr. Acurio’s other hand, his second weapon in the campaign for the American palate? The bartenders at La Mar can in fact shake up a reasonably good pisco sour. The trouble is that they generally do so only when a customer wants a more expensive brand of pisco. Everybody else gets a cocktail mixed ahead of time and finished in the blender. Meanwhile, serious cocktail haunts all over the city routinely shake every pisco sour to order as a matter of pride. A high-end restaurant in the heart of Manhattan that showed off Peruvian cuisine in all its vast, hybrid glory would have been a real event. If you sit at the bar of La Mar, order up a grilled heart and some raw fish, and get a drink made by hand, you can catch some bright glints of what that might have tasted like. And have a good little meal, too."
613,The Russian Tea Room,One Star,20061220,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/20/dining/reviews/tastes-of-russia-but-one-without-borders.html,"IT'S a safe bet that many visitors to the reborn Russian Tea Room won't realize that it still serves chicken Kiev and beef stroganoff, or at least interpretations thereof. These dishes aren't mentioned in the clear print on the dinner menu's first three pages, which cover appetizers and entrees and seem to exhaust the restaurant's savory offerings. They aren't mentioned on any kind of specials card. No, they're relegated to a typographical Siberia: an italicized blur on the mostly blank fourth page of the menu, where diners are also told of holidays on which the restaurant will be open. ""We are delighted to prepare historical Tea Room favorites, including chicken Kiev and beef stroganoff, on request,"" reads the blur, which of course conveys the opposite message. If the Tea Room czars are so chirpily delighted, why not put the Kiev where people can find it? That's easy: because a torpedo of breaded chicken with a butter-filled cavity isn't really what Gary Robins, a seriously gifted chef, wants to cook. Mr. Robins, whose new American cuisine at the Biltmore Room won him widespread praise, has a deservedly grander and less fry-happy sense of self. His surprising recruitment to revive this wheezing institution has produced an engrossing tug-of-war: his culinary internationalism and contemporary sophistication versus the institution's stodgy traditions and geographically constrained name; tataki of seared hamachi, which he sneaks onto the appetizer list, versus borscht, which he also dutifully includes there. Some dishes seem not to have any firmer tether to Russia than the restaurant's ersatz Chagall and Kandinsky paintings and golden firebirds have to conventional elegance. Other dishes blur the boundaries between Russia, Scandinavia, Eastern Europe and even the Far East. By Mr. Robins's reckoning, poaching Maine lobster in sour cream tugs it as close to Red Square as it needs to be, permitting him to round out the plate with pickled papaya and cauliflower flan. Putting dumplings made with tvorog, a Russian farmer's cheese, next to slices of seared venison loin allows him to dust the meat with cocoa, a fate it doesn't routinely meet in Moscow. Make a concession, take a liberty -- that's how he handles his ethnic compass. It's a smart approach, accommodating an impulse simply to do what feels right and yielding some very appealing dishes. As best I can tell, goose breast carpaccio isn't all the rage in St. Petersburg, but maybe it should be. Silky leaves of meat were sprinkled with toasted pistachio and crowned with baby arugula, tiny cubes of sour-cherry jelly and like-sized cubes of creamy foie gras. If beef and noodles are all that's necessary to claim a stroganoff, Mr. Robins satisfied the criteria while otherwise doing as he pleased. The beef was braised short rib, while the noodles were festooned with chanterelle and hen-of-the-woods mushrooms. For the rich, zingy sauce that completed this terrific dish, he mixed whipped cream, sour cream, horseradish and whole grain mustard. Adding sour cream or cabbage is one of his recurring strategies, as is pickling an ingredient. Slices of pork tenderloin were complemented by a version of stuffed cabbage -- steamed and filled with ground pork shoulder and foie gras -- that was out of this world. And the pickled cabbage beside a beautifully roasted fillet of turbot was a kraut to end all krauts, studded with pastrami and suffused with butter and olive oil. Sumptuous appetizer crepes already had a Russian name -- blinchiki -- and thus a Russian pedigree, so Mr. Robins was free to stuff them with goat cheese, duck confit and yet more chanterelles. He didn't toy around too much with the borscht, which had a brilliant ruby color and brimmed with fresh dill. And the potato pancakes with a fluffy lunchtime omelet were faithfully rendered and wholly on target, hitting that crunchy-oily bull's-eye. More than a few dishes weren't so successful. Tea-smoked sturgeon had an acrid aftertaste. The chicken Kiev, unexpectedly straightforward, did a rubbery impersonation of airline food, and I mean coach. There are nearly a dozen kinds of caviar -- foreign, domestic, wild, farmed -- and several of the ones I tried had an excessively pasty texture, lacking any bouncy pop. The kitchen was also bedeviled by inconsistency. Buckwheat blini that were golden and fluffy one visit were charred and leaden the next. But this restaurant's real shortcoming is its service, unforgivably poor in the context of dinner entrees that frequently exceed $40, appetizers that infrequently fall below $18 and 30-gram servings of caviar that cost as much as $300. Outdated menus with erroneous information were put on the table. Drinks and food were ludicrously slow to arrive. Servers responded dismissively to complaints, one of them telling us that we shouldn't bother him with questions about a fugitive bottle of wine. It was, he shrugged, the sommelier's problem. And what a problem. Although we had ordered a 1998 French Burgundy for $84, we got a 2001. We flagged the discrepancy, and for the next 15 minutes, as we ate our appetizers and thirsted for pinot noir, both the wine and sommelier were on the lam. When he showed up, he presented us with a similar 1998 -- the listed one was unavailable -- for $20 more. He paused, seemingly waiting for us to agree to spend that. Then, in the manner of a car salesman, he said: ""I'll make you a deal. We'll call it an even $90."" Could he throw in cruise control? A leather interior? He later dropped the price to $84, the right end to a wrong situation that typified the restaurant's clumsiness. Around since 1926, the Russian Tea Room has been teetering like an outmoded regime for more than a decade, its ownership repeatedly changing, its doors closing for years on end. Its last incarnation, which shut down in 2002, was rated satisfactory by William Grimes in The New York Times in 1999. This incarnation, owned by Gerald Lieblich, opened nearly two months ago, and it looks like a vivid memory made real. Velvet ropes point you to a revolving glass door, which in turn leads you to the Santa-red booths and spruce-green walls of the ground-floor dining room, where every day is Christmas. (An upstairs dining room -- the one with the translucent bear -- remains under wraps.) And at times the experience indeed feels like a gift. The desserts fulfill their sweet obligations, though apart from a pair of blintzes, they're geographically unbound. That was truest of the best of them, a buttermilk panna cotta with lingonberries and hazelnuts. To another chef's stroganoff, it might be an eccentric coda. To Mr. Robins's, it's as logical a next course as any other. In terms of food and all else, the Russian Tea Room doesn't add up neatly or quite make sense. Maybe that's its way of paying homage to the motherland. The Russian Tea Room  * [Rating: One Star]  150 West 57th Street; (212) 581-7100.

614,Chinatown Brasserie,One Star,20060809,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/09/dining/reviews/a-stylish-uniform-for-general-tso.html,"DIM sum speaks to the cad in each of us. It frees us from culinary monogamy, permitting us to wander from a crescent of pork to a bauble of shrimp, to have a spongy affair and then a crunchy dalliance. We get to slurp around. We can indulge two desires at once: to graze and to explore foreign territory, in this case Chinese. We can congratulate ourselves on the little portions, at least until we're a half-hour into a gathering feast. Then we can congratulate ourselves instead on the amount of territory we've covered. And we can have dumplings. What's better than dumplings? What's better than biting into something doughy to discover something meaty, or crashing through a bouncy casing and reaching a soft -- maybe even juicy -- core? Not a whole lot, especially not if those casings are as thin and pliant as they are at Chinatown Brasserie and those cores taste as clean and carefully put together as they do here. Chinatown Brasserie, which opened about two months ago in the NoHo space that used to be Time Cafe, joins an increasingly populous contingent of restaurants that attempt to apply a sexy gloss to Chinese food (both the real thing and its American mutations) and try to restyle takeout favorites with better ingredients. Think of Mr. Chow Tribeca, if you can bear the thought, or Buddakan, if you can bear the meatpacking district. Then think again, because Chinatown Brasserie finds ways to distinguish itself, the most notable of which also happens to be this uneven restaurant's principal strength: dim sum. There are about 20 dim sum selections at dinnertime and as many at lunchtime, when they're slightly different. At lunchtime, for example, you can get fish skin dumplings, which you should absolutely get. And after you get them, you should get some more. They're pan-fried and slightly crunchy, and there's something light and crisp about whatever exactly that fish skin is -- I don't want to think too much about it. With dining as with so much else, knowledge is not always pleasure's friend. Chinatown Brasserie takes dim sum seriously enough that it has a separate chef, Joe Ng, devoted to it. His thoughtful, prolific output includes not only soup dumplings but also steamed dumplings filled with shrimp and snow pea leaf. It includes not only pork pot stickers but also green chili peppers stuffed with shrimp and encased in tempura batter. Some of the dumplings come with external pinpricks of color or strands of herbs that make them look like adorable critters. A crunchy vessel of frog leg meat comes with a leg bone sticking out of it for use as a handle. Mr. Ng is having fun. You probably will, too. With this part of the menu, that is. With the rest of it, supervised by the executive chef, Tyson Wong Ophaso, Chinatown Brasserie was a mix of wins, losses and draws, and the outright wins, unfortunately, were rarest. Across many menu categories -- wraps, rolls, salads, barbecue dishes, entrees, noodles, fried rice -- the kitchen turned out food that was usually less gloppy than typical takeout fare, but not always more pleasurable. In dish after dish it demonstrated a sure hand with vegetables, be they broccoli, asparagus, snow peas or string beans. All were vibrant, none were overcooked, and the string beans, by the way, appear with minced pork in a side that's worth ordering. But the kitchen had trouble with meat and seafood. Crispy orange beef was stringy. The roast pork that kept company with scallops in a listless oyster sauce was even tougher. The latter dish, like several others, cried out for salt, and the scallops had little flavor. The same went for sautéed shrimp, which at least had the textural thrill of gossamer ribbons of egg white all around them. The crackling skin on both Peking duck and crispy chicken was close to flawless, but what lay beneath it was far from moist. In an example of the kind of flourish this restaurant brings to an otherwise unglamorous mainstay, it served that chicken with four tiny bowls containing four condiments: a mix of salt, pepper and cinnamon; a scallion purée; chopped ginger; and a soybean paste with hoisin sauce. The restaurateurs behind Chinatown Brasserie are Josh Pickard and John McDonald, who created Lever House and Lure Fishbar, and while the name they chose for it involves some misdirection, geographic and otherwise, it neatly distills their apparent intentions. They want to fuse recognizable versions of Chinese favorites with a recognizably hip stage that is not -- with the exception of a downstairs lounge with a koi pond -- too tricked out. The egg roll meets the Odeon. While a profusion of low-hanging tasseled silk lanterns lends some Asian theater to the enterprise, the black and red leather used for the seats and the way the long bar opens to the rest of a single big room evoke a brasserie. This one has a respectable, user-friendly wine list that laudably notes which chardonnays are aged in stainless steel. It has specialty cocktails much better than the usual martini manqué, including a frozen spin on a mai tai, but it has run-of-the-mill, ecumenical desserts. A pleasant but slightly chewy platter of General Tso's chicken held the place of honor usually accorded steak frites. Less predictable dishes -- like steamed red snapper, simple and impeccable; and a gooey lunchtime omelet made in a wok -- made much stronger impressions. And dim sum saved the day, or the night, depending. Not all the dim sum was created equal. I could have skipped the frog drumstick, but I wouldn't have wanted to miss the steamed dumpling with four kinds of mushrooms and sweet corn. I savored it, then quickly moved on to a turnip cake. Neither was asking for a commitment. Chinatown Brasserie  * [Rating: One Star]  380 Lafayette Street (Great Jones Street), NoHo; (212) 533-7000.

617,Momofuku Ssam Bar,★★★,20070221,Frank Bruni,East Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/21/dining/reviews/21rest.html,"THERE are reviews that introduce an unheralded chef to an unaware public and reviews that take a renegade view, saying a chef disrespected must be redeemed. Then there’s this one. If it came with a soundtrack, you’d hear the clattering of a bandwagon, along with the heavy thump of an overfed critic landing squarely (or is that roundly?) on it. That critic would be me, and his unsurprising message would be this: David Chang is a terrific cook, a pork-loving, pickle-happy individualist whose integration of Asian flavors and his own unbound sense of what’s delectable makes for some deliriously enjoyable meals. At Momofuku Noodle Bar, which he opened in 2004, and at Momofuku Ssam Bar, which came along in 2006, he has proven himself one of this city’s brightest culinary talents. But for all the adoration bestowed on Mr. Chang over the last two and a half years, it’s only over the last one and a half months, at Momofuku Ssam Bar, that he has really hit his stride, fashioning a nearly full-fledged restaurant in near-perfect sync with the times. Noodle Bar is a profoundly uncomfortable nook best suited for ramen on the run. And Ssam Bar came out of the gate with a mission narrowly in line with a part of its name, ssam being a Korean term for wrapped food. It lavished its attention on plump Asian burritos that only scratched the surface of what Mr. Chang, whose heritage is Korean, and the other gifted cooks he had gathered around him could do. But in early January he and his cohorts transformed Ssam Bar by taking inspired, beautifully assembled dishes that had been available only between 10 p.m. and 2:30 a.m., as an  after-hours experiment, and serving them during prime dinner times. You no longer have to wait until the dead of night for Ssam Bar’s grilled rice cakes, which are slathered with a sauce of pork sausage and kimchi and taste like gnocchi with a Korean passport. For its warm veal head terrine, a gooey, fatty and entirely warranted assault on the arteries. For its Asian-inflected raw seafood compositions, which hold their own against some of the best sashimi and crudo around town. While the drinks selection remains limited, Ssam Bar has added some beers and well-chosen wines.  It has also put a greater premium on service, distinguished by attentive young waiters with more knowledge and palpable enthusiasm about the menu than many of their counterparts at more conventionally polished establishments. And it has emerged as much, much more than the precocious fast-food restaurant it initially was. By bringing sophisticated, inventive cooking and a few high-end grace notes to a setting that discourages even the slightest sense of ceremony, Ssam Bar answers the desires of a generation of savvy, adventurous diners with little appetite for starchy rituals and stratospheric prices. They want great food, but they want it to feel more accessible, less effete. They’ll gladly take some style along with it, but not if the tax is too punishing. And that’s what they get at Ssam Bar, sleek, softly lighted and decidedly unfussy. Most of its roughly 55 seats are at a gleaming dark wood counter that runs the length of the narrow room, though these seats afford more elbow room than exists at the much smaller Noodle Bar. Many of the remaining seats are at communal tables, and reservations aren’t taken, except for groups doing a special feast that involves a whole pork butt, pieces of which you wrap with kimchi in bibb lettuce. Mr. Chang, 29, has not structured the new dinner menu to distinguish between appetizers and entrees, instead grouping his dishes, most of them midsize and priced between $10 and $20, in categories like offal, stews, wraps and platters of artisanal ham. The menu gives the excellent veal sweetbreads, which are grilled and sprinkled with sea salt and lime, no more prominent a showcase than the burritos or other fantastic finger food, like fluffy steamed buns filled with strips of pork belly, hoisin sauce, scallions and slices of lightly pickled cucumber. Everything about the setup of Ssam Bar encourages dropping in spontaneously, ordering piecemeal. Nothing about the setup prepares you for Mr. Chang’s wicked grasp of flavor and unerring sense of balance. A recently added salad  realized a surprising but ideal marriage of buttery roasted mushrooms (hon shimeji and king oyster) and a purée of pistachio nuts braised in dashi. He rounded out the composition with red ball radishes and pickled crosnes, reflecting his deft use of acid and of bitter, tangy notes to leaven or frame other elements in a dish. To that end kimchi, fish sauce and pickled vegetables appear frequently on the plates, the pickles adding crunch as well as bite. Mr. Chang and his team know when a dish needs an extra texture, a jolt of saltiness. They get both from the bits of fried seaweed and pellets of rice cracker coating gorgeous petals of cured hamachi, which rest on a zingy edamame and horseradish purée. They also know when and how to apply heat, like the pickled Thai and Korean chili peppers that spark a dish of fried Brussels sprouts with fish sauce, garlic and mint. Mr. Chang has real imagination, coupling sea urchin roe with litchi-flavored tapioca pearls and a snowy cloud of whipped tofu on which bonito flakes, sesame seeds and bits of dried vegetables are  sprinkled. He has standards: the grilled slices of pork sausage and hanger steak provided for different lettuce wraps were juicy and flavorful enough to be eaten on their own. His eclectic menu has soft spots (unremarkable pan-roasted skate) and weaker stretches (the stews, served in big clay pots). The kitchen occasionally wobbles: the sauce on the spongy rice cakes was as dry and clumpy one night as it was rich and moist another. And the backless stools at the counter and tables, the possibility of hour-plus waits, the absence of any coffee or tea and the one throwaway dessert, a mochi ice cream sampler, add up to a few inconveniences more than even many free-spirited diners will want to endure. Mr. Chang doesn’t really want you to linger. But he does want you to expect and enjoy artistry and professionalism without the formality that often accompanies them. That’s a noble enough goal, accomplished with enough finesse at Momofuku Ssam Bar, to keep the bandwagon clattering along for some time to come. Momofuku Ssam Bar ** 207 Second Avenue (13th Street),  East Village;  (212) 254-3500. ATMOSPHERE A narrow, sleek, softly lighted room with about 55 backless stools, most at a two-sided counter or at communal tables. SOUND LEVEL Moderately loud. RECOMMENDED DISHES Sea urchin with whipped tofu; scallops with pineapple; cured hamachi with edamame purée; steamed buns with pork belly; mushroom salad; fried Brussels sprouts; veal head terrine; grilled sweetbreads; rice cakes with pork sausage; hanger steak and pork sausage lettuce wraps; burrito-style flour pancake with pork and kimchi purée. WINE LIST Very short, with a focus on sparkling wines and just five wines by the glass. Supplemented by even shorter lists of beer and sake. PRICE RANGE Salads, small dishes, sandwiches, ham platters and burrito-style wraps, $8 to $16. Lettuce wraps, stews and other dishes, $13 to $29. Rib-eye or whole pork butt for groups, $120 to $180. Dessert, $10. HOURS Lunch, limited to wraps, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily;  dinner, 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. daily. RESERVATIONS Taken only for groups scheduling a  whole pork butt dinner. CREDIT CARDS  All major cards. WHEELCHAIR ACCESS  Separate, accessible entrance on East 13th Street.

618,Seasonal,★★,20111213,Eric Asimov,Midtown,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/14/dining/seasonal-nyc-restaurant-review.html,"I AM not one to sneer at the manifest pleasures of a Wiener schnitzel. I have friends, however, who are not nearly so accepting of these simple joys. They regard the Wiener schnitzel as too ordinary, the mundane low-risk equivalent of boneless chicken breasts. As impressive as a classic serving might be, its glistening, crenulated crust overhanging an enormous dish, the schnitzel strikes some as the enemy of the wider-ranging potential of Austrian cooking. At Seäsonal, a small Austrian restaurant near Carnegie Hall with ambitions reaching beyond faithful reproductions of the classics, you will still find Wiener schnitzel. But you might not recognize it. Rather than the flattened, breaded emblem of Germanic taverns everywhere, Seäsonal’s schnitzel arrives puffed up, as if it had been inflated with additional flavor, and perhaps a stiff helping of dignity as well. Though prideful, it is crisp and tender, tasting clearly of veal, and served with an orb of cucumber salad that offers more intensity than any cucumber has a right to, and potato salad that, alas, makes up for the boldness of the cucumber with reticence. Nonetheless, the schnitzel typifies the approach taken by the chefs, Wolfgang Ban and Eduard Frauneder, who opened Seäsonal a couple of years ago as a restaurant and a wine bar. Their main-course menu reads like a list of gemütlich Austrian favorites, easygoing, friendly dishes that were once more common in New York. Yet as with the schnitzel, Seäsonal rips these dishes from their amber traps and takes them on a culinary journey unforeseen by more homey guardians of this cuisine. It’s not an entirely new approach. Daniel Boulud, for one, took a pig’s foot and turned it into world-class cuisine, and he wasn’t the first to do that, either. The trick, when making gutsy peasant food decorous, is to augment the simple power of the flavors with subtleties and complexities. The aim is to amplify its character, not to conceal it. This is one of the challenges of modern global gastronomy: How do you present regional cooking in new guises without stealing its character? At one extreme is utter simplicity: you exalt the familiar with the best possible ingredients, achieving surprise through sheer quality. At the other is molecular gastronomy, which, by disguising familiar ingredients and flavors, offers the thrill of tasting them anew. Seäsonal stakes out territory in the middle, combining fine ingredients and modern techniques in a demonstration of the benefits and flaws of its approach. The restaurant itself is rectangular and plain, with neutral walls hung with paintings that at least suggest a touch of color, courtesy of a rotating array of artists. Seating is comfortable enough, unless you are near the door on a cold night, when icy winds knife in each time it opens. At the small bar, it is not unusual for travelers in the Austrian or German wine trade to stop in for a drink and conversation. I doubt you will find a better list of Austrian wines anywhere in New York, augmented by some excellent German selections. But it is fairly expensive, with little under $60. Much of the food seems hyper-designed, almost sculptural, barely resembling the simple list of ingredients that constitute menu descriptions. In many ways, the appetizers, which offer the least resemblance to the familiar Austrian dishes, are the creative apex. In one dish, generous pieces of lobster arrive under a cluster of almost microscopic hen-of-the-woods mushrooms, pumpernickel crumbs and a soft-poached egg. Break the egg, swish it around, and you’ve got a lovely, savory little porridge. A succulent cube of pork belly was so good that it had little need of its accompaniments, a potato purée and a sort of anchovy sauce. On my first visit, I enjoyed it but found little about it that seemed Austrian. By my third visit, the potato and anchovy had been traded in for mustard seeds and endive, which gave the dish a delicious Tyrolean accent. Veal sweetbreads were tender, with a crisp exterior, their earthy, butter flavor set off beautifully by a sweet-and-sour sauce. Potato soup seems simple enough, just potato in a chicken consommé, but leeks and speck gave it a haunting smoky flavor worth savoring. Pumpkin soup one evening was equally captivating. It had just a suggestion of sweetness, while a halved scallop added richness and pumpkin seeds crunch and texture. Each of these dishes had just a touch — pumpkin or mustard seeds here, vinegar there — that spoke to me of Austria. Not always the case with the main courses. Sauerbraten, really two dense circles of Wagyu beef with celery, potato and apple, was tender and delicious, but nothing about it suggested the sort of braised, tangy, sweet flavors I associate with the dish. As an aside, my late mother-in-law, a native of Berlin, made an excellent classic sauerbraten. Maybe I’m committed to hers. But still, Seäsonal’s version seemed disconnected. Tender kaisergulasch, or veal cheeks, by contrast, offered the sort of sweet and spicy tension that I missed in the sauerbraten, while thick-cut slices of duck breast, rich and tender, flourished with sides of classically vinegary red cabbage, kohlrabi and poppy seeds. But tafelspitz, flatiron beef that was boiled and served in an oxtail consommé, was dispiritingly bland, not helped at all by its apple, horseradish and spinach condiments. Ah, but you can always count on sweets in an Austrian restaurant, right? Yes and no. Yes to the straightforward apple strudel, delicate and cinnamony, and the classic kaiserschmarrn, caramelized pancakes that are crumbled and served with rum raisins. A qualified yes to the deconstructed Black Forest cake, served in layers in a glass tumbler. Even so, it remains a Black Forest cake. No to the deconstructed pumpkin cheesecake, also served in a tumbler. Well, I suppose you might feel differently if you like pumpkin cheesecake. A brief word about the service: It is friendly, efficient and thorough, yet it also has a rote, stilted quality. As with many restaurants, Seäsonal feels compelled to announce each dish, list the ingredients and explain how it was cooked. No matter how engrossed you are in conversation, the servers will interrupt. It’s a perhaps inconsequential but disconcerting reminder of the occasional conflict between kitchen ambition and consumer satisfaction."
630,Dressler,★★,20060607,Frank Bruni,Williamsburg,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/07/dining/reviews/07rest.html,"AS often as not, traveling to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, for dinner meant one of two things. You were bound for a proudly musty crowd-pleaser — Bamonte's for red-sauce Italian, Peter Luger for that holy grail of porterhouses — or you were looking to cadge some hipster luster. The new restaurant Dressler should change that. Dining there is worth crossing neighborhood lines, even crossing water, not because Dressler promises a fad-proof time capsule or dressed-down irreverence. Dressler promises, and delivers,  something more difficult to pull off: food that's sophisticated without being too clever, in a room that's beautiful without being too flamboyant. Dressler may well turn out to be trendy, but it hasn't transparently set that goal for itself. In fact a friend who spends time in Williamsburg says many of the neighborhood's young denizens complain that Dressler is the kind of restaurant they would take their parents to. What they mean, I'm guessing, is that it's the kind of restaurant they would let their parents take them to. And what they're acknowledging is that Williamsburg has grown up. Just a stone's throw from Dressler towers the Gretsch Building, a former guitar factory that now houses million-dollar apartments, refugees from Manhattan and a celebrity or two. It's a safe bet that Dressler, in a space that was once a printer's shop and once an artist's studio, will become their go-to trough. It certainly has higher prices than DuMont, which has the same owner, Colin Devlin, and than Diner. But from a Manhattan perspective, part of Dressler's appeal is that it's a fair deal. I got a terrific entree of roasted chicken, its crisp skin rubbed with gremolata, its bountiful crew of seasonal sidekicks including asparagus and ramps, for $18. I got an appetizer salad of fried artichoke, white beans, Parmesan and arugula for $9, which was a bargain in terms of the pleasure I also received. Salads don't usually claim a prominent place in the memories you carry away from a restaurant. This one did, thanks to its freshness, its proportions and, even more so, its dressing, a creamy, fleetingly tangy blend of steamed artichoke hearts, lemon juice and sherry vinegar. For the most part the cooking at Dressler, supervised by Polo Dobkin and Cal Elliott, who worked at Gramercy Tavern, isn't wildly creative, and the menu, which wears the label of contemporary American, plays things somewhat safe. There's a familiar, sensible distribution of seafood, poultry, red meat and meatless pasta dishes. There's an inevitable evocation of Italy on this plate, France on that one. There's an inconsequential chopped salad with feta and olives, and of course there's a rib-eye, in this case supporting a tower of onion rings that are nearly big enough to double as Hula-Hoops. But predictable doesn't have to mean disappointing, at least not when the execution of dishes is as polished as it usually is at Dressler, not when a restaurant indulges you with as many first-rate ingredients as this one does. A flawlessly pan-roasted fillet of halibut was circled by a veritable catalog of beans: green and wax and cranberry and fava. Wild striped bass got an assist from Swiss chard, Yukon Gold potato, leeks, cockles and, to cinch the deal, bacon. There was reputedly a time when most fish dishes were trusted to stay afloat without the buoyancy of pork. But that was long ago. Speaking of beans and bacon, both had a hand in one of the best entrees, a grilled pork rib with fresh bacon, also known as pork belly, and white beans. But the triumphal touch was a bit of preserved lemon, which cut the stolid qualities of its companions. The best appetizer was smoked sturgeon, painted with crème fraîche, showered with sharp arugula and springy frisée, and placed over a slightly oily, very crunchy potato galette. It introduced untoward emotions at a table of sharers, each of whom monitored the others' bites and angled for the final morsels. I gallantly negotiated a peace pact, by which I mean I claimed those morsels for myself, maintaining that I needed to be more certain of the dish's delights. A critic's prerogative is a beautiful thing. Not every dish prompted such piggy deceit. There were a fair share of flubs by the kitchen at Dressler, which is named for the title character in Steven Millhauser's novel ""Martin Dressler: The Tale of an American Dreamer."" During one dinner I developed something of a Goldilocks complex because the spring pea soup with chilled lobster seemed much too warm, while strozzapreti with a veal ragù was definitely too cold. The leaden rolls deposited on my table another night could have functioned as doorstops, and the naming of the strawberry-rhubarb crisp had to be an attempt at irony, because its consumption would have been better aided by a straw than a spoon. But I loved the other desserts I tried, including a crème brûlée with tawny caramel-flavored custard and adorable little ginger cookies. I was impressed with the friendly service. And I was smitten by the dashing setting, a nexus of old-fashioned elegance and contemporary whimsy. With a zinc bar up front, a mosaic tile floor and big mirrors along one wall, Dressler has some of the vibe and shadings of a brasserie. But it also has mesmerizing metalwork — in the grilles over lighting boxes and in the spidery, ornate arms of custom-made aluminum chandeliers — that gives the dark room a romantic, seductively spooky charge. It's like a baby Balthazar made over by Anne Rice. As it happens, all the friends who accompanied me to Dressler were Manhattanites. All said they would head back on their own. I've heard similar statements before, especially after a few shared bottles of wine. But these pledges seemed less like boozy lip service than like clearheaded — and prudent — travel plans.

642,M. Wells,★★,20110405,Sam Sifton,Long Island City,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/06/dining/reviews/06rest.html,"THERE was smoke coming out of the ventilation ducts. It was late evening at the M. Wells diner in Long Island City, Queens, and rain was coming down in sheets. A waiter dashed through the narrow dining room and turned off the fan. The smoke retreated, then started up again, thick and brown. Some people started to cough. “Let’s get out of here,” said a woman sitting at a booth near the restroom. It was the farthest one from the door. She was with friends and her husband, a restaurant critic. The party had just finished their appetizers and were partly into a bottle of Chinon. The table before them was littered with plates, stained and empty. They had eaten a Caesar salad, the dressing made with smoked herring instead of anchovies, and the romaine showered in enough Parmesan to qualify as both crazy and just exactly the right amount. The smoked herring made something new and comforting alike out of the dressing. It was, as Stephen Sondheim put it once about art, a hat where there never was a hat. They had ordered an immense blue cheese salad, with matchsticks of slivered apple and candied walnuts with a faint chili punch: a tribute to the 1970s, perhaps, from cooks born 10 years after their end. They had ordered escargots, too, served in a bone trench beneath, not on top of, dollops of shin marrow, with grilled toast, an amazing combination. And they had slurped oysters, a lot of them, served on the half shell beneath a delicate coffee sabayon. The flavor was that of a morning dive into coastal salt water, with a cup of French roast left behind, half-finished, in the boat. So it was a little smoky in the restaurant, so what? There was an entree still to come, a meatloaf for four: ground aged beef molded into the shape of a poundcake, then roasted, napped in stroganoff gravy and served with spaetzle and knuckles of foie gras. The spaetzle sucks up the cream sauce and acts as a kind of cousin to the foie gras, and the meatloaf itself has a deep and salty mineral tang. It is a ridiculous dish, a perfect meal. And it was still in the oven. There was a lot of eye contact at the table about that fact. It would be tough to leave such a meal behind. The woman looked at her husband. “We can go stand under that awning,” she said, pointing at it, a wide red tongue above the door of the Morgan Manhattan Record Storage building, across the wide and empty street. Then she raised her eyes a little, as if speaking to a child. “If the place doesn’t burn down, we can come back.” At M. Wells, this is a totally fair and sensible position to take. It would be terrible to miss eating the food there for anything less than a catastrophe. The restaurant opened in the summer of 2010, the brainchild of a French Canadian chef, Hugue Dufour, and his Queens-raised wife, Sarah Obraitis. Mr. Dufour had cooked and been a partner at a Montreal restaurant, Au Pied de Cochon, that is the subject of considerable devotion in the food-crazy set for its commitment to foie gras and excess. At M. Wells, Mr. Dufour and Ms. Obraitis have brought some of that spirit to New York, but in an entirely different sort of restaurant: a diner only in looks and feel. Those who recall the thrill of eating at the Momofuku restaurants for the first time would do well to book passage on the No. 7 train, bound for Hunters Point. Initially the couple served only breakfast, then breakfast and lunch, off an eccentric and laudable menu: enormous egg-and-cheese sandwiches on house-made English muffins with sage sausage and pickled jalapeños, for instance, or normal-size cake doughnuts with an admirable crust-to-interior ratio. There were seafood cobblers the size of throw pillows, flaky and sweet beneath their béchamel, cheese and biscuits, with a dusting of parsley. You could get pickled pig tongue with soda crackers and a smear of mustard, or an estimable burger of blended beef and lamb. These were great introductions to Mr. Dufour’s cooking, and to the concept of afternoon naps. In recent months, a dinner service has been added on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, along with a liquor license, a modest wine list and a rapidly changing menu, more often successful than not. Starters have included those Caesar and blue cheese salads, and an excellent pile of greens with dried cranberries and sticks of venison jerky. A small plate of butter chicken brought credible tikka masala set atop one of Mr. Dufour’s muffins, with a spicy yogurt sauce. A deep bowl of tripe cut to resemble noodles was severely under-salted (it had once been accompanied with smoked herring and ought to be again). Beef tartare, cut as beautifully as only a hand with a knife can cut, was its spectacular opposite: silky and powerfully seasoned, bound in a sauce that was rather wetter than one generally sees in tartare — and good for that. Also first-rate: a plate of veal brains that displayed the sort of sauté skills generally associated only with the very highest level of classical French cooking. They are served as two slightly crisp lobes. They do not look like much. But the exterior gives way to clouds of flavor. It is brain panna cotta, essentially, and if it is on the menu it is an absolute must-order even if this sentence freaks you out. For all the great cooking, M. Wells is still finding its way as a business. Dinner three times a week seems as much as the staff can handle. The kitchen is tiny, and during the day prep work takes over one end of the diner’s counter. It can be disconcerting to see a woman in street shoes and a dishwasher’s shirt making banana cream pie (excellent, by the way) on the very surface where you will later eat dinner, or ate a meal last week. And while Ms. Obraitis is a warm and charming host, she cannot be everywhere always, and those who cover for her are not yet in her league. Just try to get a reservation if she does not answer the phone. Invariably something goes awry and you are told to call back. What, when your mom gets home? Back on that night in the rain, as the smoke drifted down, M. Wells took on some of the aspects of an animated hipster version of Hopper’s “Nighthawks,” a Paul Thomas Anderson pilot for HBO. Cooks and runners hustled about. Someone climbed a ladder to the roof. Time passed and the diner did not burn down and eventually those who had run out to stand across the street returned to the dining room, where Ms. Obraitis poured them some sparkling wine and apologized. Windows were opened, and the smoke went away. Then that meatloaf came and blew everyone’s minds. You know those biographies where the great artist first moves to New York, has a cold-water flat in a desolate part of town? We are in that chapter now."
648,Chop Suey (CLOSED),★,20080409,Frank Bruni,Times Square Theatre District,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/09/dining/reviews/09rest.html,"A FRIEND from Spain was in town, and I needed to take him to dinner. On the promising list of new restaurants I was checking out, which would send him home with the most vivid memories of the city? With the right ones? I found myself choosing Chop Suey. And I found myself surprised by that choice. I add that second part because I knew that Chop Suey, which I’d visited before, wouldn’t give us a meal as proficient and pampering as the one we’d get at, say, Adour. It wouldn’t have the comely downtown crowd of Commerce or the gustatory bang-for-buck of Mia Dona. But we’d be sitting in a room that was New York all the way, its glass walls pressed up against the signature glow of Times Square. We’d be reminded, by the big letters spelling out “A Chorus Line” and the big hair of Elle Woods on the billboard for “Legally Blonde,” that we were in the center of one of the world’s most vibrant theater districts. We’d be dazzled, at least by the scenery. And by the cooking? Well, our reaction might fall more along the lines of puzzlement, because Chop Suey, which mingles Korean and other Asian traditions, is an uneven mash of inspiration and clumsiness. But sometimes food isn’t the primary consideration in deciding where to eat, and some restaurants have persuasive charms beyond the perimeter of the plate. Chop Suey is all about setting, a second-floor perch in the Renaissance Hotel that juts like a ship’s prow into a bold, brash sea of light. On three sides it presents a Manhattan postcard that’s perfect for an out-of-towner or an in-towner wanting to make like one. Why hasn’t this space drawn much notice over time? That was clearly a question asked and a frustration felt by the hotel’s proprietors, who shuttered Foley’s Fish House, the previous occupant, and started over. As part of an elaborate renaissance of the Renaissance, they set out in a less stodgy culinary direction with a less stodgy crew, turning to two chefs known to show some edge. Zak Pelaccio consulted on the savory dishes, Will Goldfarb on the sweet ones. The erratic results underscore the question  of just how engaged such consultants get: of whether, once they’ve lofted a few ideas and cashed their paychecks, they feel any real pride of ownership or bother to follow through. I have my doubts. Chop Suey didn’t assuage them. The name is incongruous, silly. There’s no chop suey and little of its hokey spirit on a menu more ambitious than that. Chicken and halibut are poached sous vide (sealed in plastic) to buttery effect. Striped bass, roasted, comes with a radish foam, which delivers the merry sting of radish in a way that doesn’t merrily obliterate everything in its path. Short rib, sliced too thin and grilled too long, shares its plate with a marrow bone, although not much marrow. Tunnel into the cavity: no one’s home. In intent, most dishes are more distinctive than the lowest-common-denominator tourist grub prevalent in this patch of town. Some are more distinctive in actuality, too. The char siu  — roasted pork with Hong Kong noodles as thin as angel-hair pasta  — is described on the menu as “twice caramelized,” and the dominoes of tender pork demonstrate why. They have crisp, sweet surfaces and corners. Crisp pie-shaped slices of scallion pancake are given some fruity zip by an Asian pear mostarda. A thick, juicy hamburger forsakes the usual condiments for kimchi, which does the trick. It’s a Korean Whopper. As for Korean gnocchi, Chop Suey rushes in where Momofuku Ssam Bar earlier trod, serving steamed rice cakes with a spicy pork Bolognese of sorts. They don’t fall far short of their idols. The trendy commingling of seafood and pork finds repeated expression: in nifty cups of lettuce holding oysters and bacon; in a serviceable slow-roasted pork shoulder encircled by clams; in fried rock shrimp piled next to pork belly so fatty and thin-sliced it could be lardo. That last dish is ludicrous, the sweet chili sauce on the shrimp cloying, the pork belly plastered to the plate, the two actors not communicating with each other. They need new scripts. Fried chicken wings seasoned with curry leaf need less frying and more evidence  — make that some evidence  — of the curry leaf. They’re a waste. The menu’s other failures are merely underperformers, like lobster “egg foo yung style,” served with black trumpet  mushrooms and a ginger beurre blanc that contribute much less character than they should. These dishes taste unfocused, the opposite of dishes at the Fatty Crab, Mr. Pelaccio’s downtown hit. Is it a failure of Midtown nerve? A sign that his commitments, multiplying at a farcical rate, have depleted his creativity? Or faulty execution by the kitchen, under the stewardship of another chef, Anthony Paris? Desserts work out all right. A version of a Napoleon, with hazelnut-praline mousse  layered between crunchy won tons, is less weird than witty. Service is sometimes witless, epitomized by the way hosts sweep you past a nook that can accommodate coats without ever asking if you’d like it to accommodate yours. How odd, because a real effort to make Chop Suey special can be detected in much else. Stylized lighting fixtures and icy-blue leather furniture turn the lounge outside the restaurant into a design showcase. The reddish-orange leather furniture inside the restaurant is so amusingly retro cool you expect to see Austin Powers canoodling on the banquette. It’s also comfortable, so you can relax as you go eye to eye with celebrities truly larger than life. To the east: Sylvester Stallone, glaring from a billboard for “Rambo.” To the south: Courteney Cox, smoldering on a billboard for “Dirt.” My Spanish friend was spellbound. And the potato croquettes weren’t quite mushy and bland enough to snap him out of it.

653,Chevalier,★★,20150811,Pete Wells,Midtown,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/12/dining/restaurant-review-chevalier-in-midtown.html,"“What’s the matter?” my dinner companion asked one night at Chevalier, the luxurious new French restaurant in Midtown at the base of the Baccarat Hotel & Residences New York. “You look like you just saw a ghost.” Maybe I had. A man wearing an elegantly knotted silk tie had just materialized at our side and wished us “bon appétit” with the ease of a native speaker. He was Charles Masson, who for years steered the stately old ship of La Grenouille until a family struggle sent him out on the streets. He landed at Chevalier as the “director.” In the pre-opening press, Mr. Masson drew as much attention as the chef, Shea Gallante, formerly of Ciano and Cru. But just a month after the opening in early April, he announced that he was leaving. Now, four weeks after that, I was startled to see him in the flesh, still haunting the dining room, wishing us a healthy appetite as we faced our scallops and cavatelli. Today Mr. Masson is officially gone, but Chevalier is still searching for a guiding spirit. This place is confused about its identity. The designer Stephen Sills gave the dining room the soft glimmer of an abalone shell; it’s pretty, but it also looks like a movie director’s idea of a restaurant for rich people. Some of the customers get into the spirit: On two separate nights, somebody walked in with the help of a sterling silver-handled cane. As one of my guests said, it’s a place where Bruce Wayne would have dinner. According to the website, though, Chevalier is a “brasserie de luxe.” The first person who can successfully explain what it has in common with a brasserie wins a choucroute garnie for 12 at my house. Finding the right tone for a new restaurant is fiendishly complicated. As expense and ambitions increase, so do the complications, and Chevalier is both expensive and ambitious. Already, even as it tries to figure itself out, there is a lot to enjoy. Mr. Gallante’s cooking is a little hard to pin down, but every meal reminded me just how compelling Ciano and Cru had been when he was in charge. Anybody whose taste buds are in working order could work up a good appetite for those cavatelli — chewy but tender, yolk-enriched, and shiny in a sharp, springlike ramp pesto with smoked pecorino. The next course brought what has to be the greatest piece of roasted veal loin I’ve ever met, supremely flavorful and juicy. The long slabs of dry-aged duck breast I ate another night had all the intensity, the blood-rich tang and the richness that I’m starting to give up on getting from steak. Thick slices of pork loin ringed with a narrow band of well-rendered fat were a model of subtle, sensitive roasting; most chefs can’t come up with pork this juicy without brining it until it’s as salty as ham. Mr. Gallante is smart enough to leave these strong flavors alone, with just minor help from the rest of the plate. With the duck came a dab of Medjool date-red wine sauce, not too sweet, and the pork got by with just a breezy, summery helping of beans and garlic scapes. With seafood, the sauces do more of the work. A buttery emulsion with a trace of lemon verbena was neatly calibrated for black sea bass; cucumber chopped to a pulp and yuzu juice had a powerful and wonderful effect on raw Japanese yellowtail. The charcuterie plate is a marvel of offal craftsmanship: duck rillettes with a bullet of foie gras shot right through the center; rough-hewed and pistachio-flecked liverwurst; calf’s tongue and chicken liver mousse layered in a terrine with a bronze jiggle of Madeira jelly on top; saucisson sec with a clear, bracing fermented sourness. Wow. But the same restaurant that achieved this near miracle also served foie gras mousse as cold and hard as butter right out of the refrigerator. I couldn’t spread it; worse, I couldn’t taste it. The veal that had been so transporting was, the next time I tried it, cooked to the unappetizing pinkish-gray color of canned tuna. Both nights, it came with a stodgy nub of sweetbread, reminiscent of pressed tofu. Fried soft-shell crab with burrata sounded weird on the menu and was weirder on the plate. It was like watching a bad date. I kept waiting for one of the ingredients to get an urgent text from a roommate who’s locked out of the apartment. Although Chevalier often seems to be in out-of-town-tryout mode, it charges Broadway prices. This may get ironed out in September, when the menu will go à la carte. Right now, a three-course prix fixe dinner is $96; two courses are $74, which means you could save $22 by skipping David Carmichael’s accomplished French desserts. The prix isn’t entirely fixe, though. The dense chocolate soufflé, which to be fair is enough for two and is delivered with a dark-chocolate, crème-anglaise-filled egg that servers carefully crack and place on the soufflé, is $8.50 extra. Side dishes, like excellent gratin dauphinois, are $12 extra; the charcuterie plate is $26 extra. Mr. Gallante also promised lower, more consistent prices for the bar, where the situation now borders on the irrational. A manhattan was $18, but a gin and tonic was $20. One night, my companion pointed to my $22 Moscow Mule and asked the bartender for something “just like his, but different.” One difference was its price, $24. Tweaks are planned for uniforms, décor and “service sensibility,” which the publicist said “will definitely be lightened.” I have no complaints about the service itself; the dining room staff came out of the gate with the fluid, watchful poise of people who have been in place for years. But its Old World tone would make more sense if the restaurant itself had a clearer point of view. Chevalier and its hotel were built by a real estate conglomerate, which sold them but still manages both through a subsidiary company. The conglomerate also owns the Baccarat crystal firm, and sprinkled its sparkly glass all over the building. At Chevalier, named after a Baccarat designer, the product placement is subtle but ever-present. There are charms in drinking water from heavy crystal tumblers, not least of all the workout you give your biceps, but it’s hard to escape the feeling that customer pleasure is secondary to corporate interests. Chevalier seems to have been conceived as a French luxury restaurant, in other words, simply because Baccarat is a French luxury company. French luxury restaurants can be wonderful, but they have to be played with conviction. Mr. Masson could have supplied that, but now it will have to come from somewhere else. Of course, there is one luxury that would overcome all arguments. Food as consistently good as the charcuterie plate and that first veal loin would make Chevalier a destination. It just wouldn’t be a brasserie."
654,Fornino Park Slope,★,20100907,Sam Sifton,Park Slope,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/dining/reviews/08rest.html,"TWENTY years ago, when Fifth Avenue in Park Slope could still be called marginal in the pages of The New York Times,  Michael Ayoub opened Cucina there, on the corner of Carroll Street. The restaurant was an elegantly casual Italian trattoria that managed to charm both a burgeoning population of young brownstoners with jobs in Manhattan and the neighborhood’s old guard of professional-class Brooklynites. Lawyers from Wall Street and Court Street alike sat side by side at Cucina, eating rigatoni, drinking wine, talking up a borough in ascendance. Bryan Miller, then the newspaper’s restaurant critic, expressed surprise at  Cucina’s location, and awarded the place two stars. In the years since, Mr. Ayoub’s fortunes have gone up and down and up. He opened and closed a steakhouse and cigar bar, cater-cornered from Cucina. He shuttered Cucina. He ran a catering business. In 2004, he left Park Slope to open Fornino in Williamsburg, a wood-oven pizzeria that drew praise and crowds for its Naples-style pies. And in May, he returned to the Cucina space to open Fornino Park Slope, an elegantly casual Italian trattoria in two parallel dining rooms filled with dark wood and old photographs of Brooklyn, as well as a great deal of the glass sculpture he creates when he isn’t throwing pizzas or running his business. The restaurant is a fine addition to the borough’s now-sprawling call-for-reservations dining scene. It aspires to no more than what it provides: a comfortable destination for those who live nearby and for those who have come from Bay Ridge or Mill Basin for a nice night out, from Ditmas or Kensington or Sunset Park. It is not a restaurant for gastrotourists. Those who take town cars to dinner in Bushwick or Vinegar Hill are thin on the ground. As was true at Cucina, the menu at Fornino Park Slope is improbably large. There are 17 versions of grilled pizza, and close to a dozen entrees. Eight pastas are offered, and more than a dozen antipasti, salads and side dishes. A modest wine list offers familiar varietals, at good prices. The dessert menu achieves similar goals. (Yes, you should get the tiramisù.) Start with a spread of antipasti. Mr. Ayoub makes a strong eggplant caponata, and better-still marinated chickpeas, adorned with Parmesan. He presents a superlative dish of beets with ricotta salata, cool and sweet and salty. He studs a plate of pale white anchovies with pink peppercorns, and grinds up a terrific, ever-so-slightly fiery Tuscan chicken liver spread. His prosciutto  —  from Salumeria Biellese  in Chelsea  —  is excellent. You can ignore the salads unless the notion of iceberg with cherry tomatoes and a creamy Gorgonzola dressing intrigues, in which case you’ll be pleased until you realize that you can’t follow it with a salty, thick-crusted, rosemary-scented strip steak. Fornino’s grilled meat options are limited to a portion of chewy skirt steak with bitter greens, olives and more of those cherry tomatoes. There ought to be a law. But the rigatoni remains from the original Cucina menu, in its creamy tomato sauce studded with fennel sausage, dairy sweetness covering the acidity of the tomatoes like a blanket. This is welcome. There is also very good crab cappelletti, the stuffed hats of pasta served in a garlicky broth with a delegation of Manila clams, and spaghetti alla chitarra, with crisp guanciale and melting prosciutto, red onion, a slap of chicken broth, pecorino Romano and a soft poached egg. This last  —  its flavors rich and layered, the pasta cooked beautifully, the egg yolk melding with the chicken broth  —  is a necessary order for anyone who knows Mr. Ayoub’s work only from the Fornino in Williamsburg, where he can still be spotted on occasional evenings in gleaming chef’s whites, serving textbook pies to the neighborhood ectomorphs who have crowded the room since it was the L Cafe. He isn’t simply a pizza man and never has been. His cod wrapped in prosciutto, served with capers, olives and a scattering of sweet cherry tomatoes, showcases real talent in the preparation of fish, and a nicely cooked duck breast with cherries, spinach, pine nuts and a glaze of white balsamic vinegar shows a sure hand with game as well. In fact, the pizza at Fornino Park Slope may be the restaurant’s weakest suit. Rather than capitalizing on his success with a wood oven, Mr. Ayoub has moved beyond it, and taken up the mantle of grilled pizza, a technique made famous by Al Forno in Providence, R.I., and popularized in New York mostly by the chef Vincent Scotto.  (His pies at Gonzo, on 13th Street, were among the best in the city until his sudden death in 2007, at 39.) “I’ve already done brick-oven pizza,” Mr. Ayoub told the Grub Street blog in April. He wanted a challenge. And he got one. The pies at Fornino Park Slope have thin crusts, in some cases almost shatteringly so, and they can lack the purity of flavor that characterizes the wood-oven versions at the Williamsburg location. Sometimes they don’t work at all. A plain margherita pie, for instance, sits flat and crackly on its plate, devoid of yeasty flavor; it felt in the mouth a little like a pizza made with saltines. A version made with clams, crescenza cheese and fior di latte also fell short, and even the liquor released from the clams failed to soften the crust. More successful are the versions in which a fair amount of stuff  is piled on top of the pie, and the cheese and fat perhaps protect some part of the dough. The pizza Mr. Ayoub has dedicated to the memory of Mr. Scotto —  piled high with Bel Paese, pecorino, fior di latte and ricotta, as well as slices of fiery salami and dabs of roast-pepper aioli  —  has proved itself to be a marvel of structural integrity, with great texture beneath the creaminess. It is the best on the menu. Fornino Park Slope is a throwback, the sort of restaurant that will appeal mostly to those who still think of Manhattan as “the city,” and who rarely cross a river to get to work. Fuggedaboutit, et cetera. It is a restaurant fit for Kings.   Fornino Park Slope ★ 254 Fifth Avenue (Carroll Street), Park Slope, Brooklyn; (718) 399-8600.

655,Gus & Gabriel Gastropub,Fair,20090915,Pete Wells,Upper West Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/dining/reviews/16rest.html,"WHEN three children under age 10 leave their milkshakes almost untouched, you know there’s trouble. They weren’t tempted by anything else on the table, either: barbecued pork, mashed potatoes and other dishes that would be gone in five minutes in any other restaurant. Gus & Gabriel Gastropub isn’t any other restaurant. It is the latest project from Michael Psilakis, a prodigiously gifted and largely self-taught chef who seemed to materialize out of nowhere five years ago and since then has gone from success to success. His Italian cooking at Dona, and then at its more relaxed successor, Mia Dona, was  distinctive and crowd pleasing. He plumbed the earthier pleasures of Greek food at Kefi; by keeping the flavors direct and the prices within reach, he filled the seats of its original space, and then a much larger one. Best of all is Anthos, his more rarefied take on Greek cuisine, where he refined a highly personal and original vision that proved he is a chef who can both dream and deliver. His fast and glorious run earned Mr. Psilakis, 41, national acclaim. It brought Gus & Gabriel a high level of attention upon its arrival early this summer. And it makes that restaurant’s colossal misfires almost impossible to believe and harder still to explain. The anglicized Gastropub of the name is a red herring. Gus & Gabriel’s menu reads like the one at countless casual American pubs, with a few nods to T. G. I. Friday’s and all the strip-mall P. T. Pennyfathers it spawned. Mr. Psilakis intended to improve mainstream food — fried mozzarella, spaghetti and meatballs, barbecued riblets — by making it all from scratch. The tortilla chips in nachos are fried  in house;  the ice creams in the shakes and floats are made at Anthos. This may strike some people as pandering. But the problem with Gus & Gabriel is not that it aims low. The problem is that it fails to achieve even its low aims. After all, almost every chef in town is experimenting with techniques for building a better burger. Mr. Psilakis may be the only one to have perfected a new technology that magically strips out all the taste. I never thought I would want to add salt to a burger topped with bacon, Gruyère, onion rings and a fried egg. Greasy and indistinct, it disproved the adage that fat is flavor. He uses the same device on pork butt and pork ribs. Is he sending all the flavor to his other restaurants? Exploring the first section of the menu, called Bar Snacks, you get a glimpse of what Gus & Gabriel could have been. Mr. Psilakis really has improved on Friday’s loaded potato skins, if the ones being served at an outlet of the chain near Penn Station last week were representative. Those were sodden, sad sinkholes with a potato-like appearance. The Gus & Gabriel version was made with identifiable potatoes, good bacon and chili with a hint of sweetness and cinnamon, Cincinnati-style, and they are terrific. So are the thick potato chips fresh out of the hot oil, the golden mozzarella balls and the enormous platter of nachos. This section of the menu made me long for a barstool and a ballgame. But I was in the wrong place: there are no televisions and room for just four customers at the stools stuffed into an awkward space near the front door. Everybody else walks down a passageway to an oddly stiff dining room in the back. Here we face the central mystery of Gus & Gabriel: if Mr. Psilakis wanted to serve bar food, why didn’t he just open a bar? Given the speed with which he moved, welcoming the first customers  about five months after announcing the plans, it’s impossible not to suspect that he was in too much of a hurry. He had an idea and, once he relocated Kefi, he had an empty restaurant. But he seems not to have paused to ask if they were right for each other. With a little more time (and extra money and headaches), he might have reconfigured the layout to make space for a bar along one wall. The room would have been livelier, noisier, more hectic. Gus & Gabriel may be the only restaurant in history that would be improved by adding a popcorn machine to the dining room. Initially, Mr. Psilakis was going to open Gus & Gabriel with Donatella Arpaia, his business partner in Kefi, Anthos and, until he left it this week, Mia Dona. She dropped out. Had she stayed, she might have pointed out that a suit of armor and a few Tiffany-style  lamps do not add up to interior design. She might have suggested that a place serving macaroni and cheese and milkshakes on the Upper West Side might want to have a highchair. The food would have benefited from a more deliberate rollout, too. The skin on what is advertised as “crispy chicken” was as crisp as a balloon, and the biscuits on the plate were wet and doughy, as if the cook had decided halfway through that he would rather make dumplings. A kind of gazpacho made with tomatillos was sharp, salty and weird. The broth with a French dip had the acrid taste of onions left to burn on the stove. Pork ribs sat on a smear of what looked and tasted like undercooked roux. But extra time didn’t save a section of the menu called Other Stuff, which appeared a few weeks after the restaurant opened. A selection of offal and other oddities, it raises hopes that those dishes are exempt from the pub theme because they’re so delicious. Those hopes wither at the first bite of a sour chicken-liver mousse paired with a mushy terrine, and they die with a taste of tongue that seems to have passed through the flavor subtractor. (The tongue came with a dish of what the waiter said was the poaching liquid. It didn’t taste like anything, either. The only thing on that plate that did was the bread.) The “other stuff” was particularly dispiriting because it brought to mind a lunch in this same room about five years ago, when it was called Onera and the chef was a newcomer named Michael Psilakis. He prepared a tasting menu of kidneys, brains and other butcher’s remnants. The flavor juxtapositions were so right they were almost spooky. I hoped that the chef would be cooking at this level for a long time to come. I still do. Gus & Gabriel Gastropub FAIR 222 West 79th Street, (212) 362-7470.

658,Allegretti,★★,20081021,Frank Bruni,Flatiron,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/22/dining/reviews/22rest.html,"I COULD tell  just from the heady, briny perfume of it how good the fish soup in front of one of my companions was. So the way her eyes widened when she took her first pale red spoonful and the verbal verdict that followed didn’t surprise me. “It tastes exactly the way it should,” she said, rushing the words out as soon as the soup was down. She wanted the rest of us   to know. She wanted to crow. She wanted to be done with talking and get back to the soup. She was even making those mm-mm noises, or something oddly close to them, as in the goofy Campbell’s commercials from years ago. What she meant,  as I learned when she passed the soup to me, was that that it tasted of Mediterranean waters  — scorpion fish, rouget  — and of Mediterranean sunshine, the tomato flavor robust and true. She meant that it had some proper mischief in it: a blast of fennel, a flicker of Pernod, a murmur of saffron. Watching and nodding as I myself made joyful sense of it, she said, “Are we in the south of France or what?” Actually, we were in Chelsea, though it was easy to be confused. The best of the food at Allegretti transported us to Nice or, I suppose, Monte Carlo. The restaurant’s chef and principal owner, Alain Allegretti,  was born  in the former and spent several years cooking in the latter  — under a more famous Alain, last name Ducasse. And the atmosphere transported us to Midtown or to the lower Upper  East Side, circa the 1970s. Though elegant in its way, Allegretti has a kind of stodginess and square-ness more commonly associated with those neighborhoods and with the prevailing fine-dining ethos of decades past. It’s a restaurant that produces a profound sense of dislocation, in ways good, bad and neither. It’s not of the here and now, or at least not of downtown Manhattan and a new chapter of intense economic anxiety and pessimism. Pick a trend or a seemingly sensible impulse. Allegretti travels in the opposite direction from it. Saucy, busy French cooking isn’t in vogue, and might not be what the toppled titans of Wall Street  — or anyone else re-examining spending habits  — are looking for. Allegretti embraces it, many dishes calling for a tableside application of some final, fancy touch by one of the servers, each outfitted in accordance with his or her station. Captains: suit and tie. Principal servers: collared shirt and tie. Supporting servers: collared shirt and apron. Although bare at lunch, the mahogany  tables in the creamy, relatively  colorless dining room are draped in   white linen come dinnertime, when the prices rise and the level of lighting doesn’t fall as much as in other restaurants. On a recent dinner menu there wasn’t an entree under $30. Will this fly on an unromantic street with, at one end, an Olive Garden, which may well be better suited to a sub-10,000 Dow? I wonder. But on its own terms, Allegretti distinguishes itself admirably. Although some dishes are overwrought, with an ingredient or two too many, and a few utterly miss their mark, more are executed with finesse and with a wicked sense of indulgence. They’re executed with a  nod to the seasons, too.  The fish soup, so evocative of the shore, was on the summer menu, which Allegretti retired a few weeks ago. The fall menu replaces it with a soup of pumpkin and foie gras that was shockingly wan, considering its ingredients, which also include chicken liver. The late summer’s exceptionally fine and colorful salad of heirloom tomatoes, paired with  burrata, has given way to a heartier and even more sumptuous appetizer of leeks with an eggy, salty gribiche-style sauce, a breaded poached egg that oozes when pierced and, best of all, deboned  flaps of pig’s feet pan-seared  until not just crispy but crunchy. Mr. Allegretti’s pasta dishes are terrific enough that you’d be wise to make one of them your first course, and they’re the right, modest   size  for that. He sauces and stuffs those currently in rotation in a manner that braces for the cold temperatures to come. There’s braised oxtail inside the ravioli, a duck ragout for  chestnut cappelletti, braised veal cheek over farro. My favorite pasta dish was tagliolini sauced with a zippy ragout showcasing cuttlefish, cherry tomatoes and briny currents of the fish soup. Also folded into the mix, for some extra bite and brightness, was an  almond-and-basil pesto. It’s the entrees that Mr. Allegretti is most prone to overworking. A fillet of cod suffered from too little attention to the star of the show, overcooked and dried out, and too sprawling a supporting cast: salt cod, chickpeas, piquillo peppers, chorizo  — everything but voice-over narration by Morgan Freeman. But the impulse   to cram a lot of drama onto a plate worked well in the case of a duck dish. Wedges   of breast were studded with honeyed hazelnuts, macadamia nuts and almonds. Beside the duck were   tender onions with  an intense, almost jammy stuffing of farro,   Parmesan and butter. In general I found the meat  — veal with mushrooms in a Gorgonzola and rosemary sauce; lamb shoulder with crispy rosemary polenta  — more reliably appealing than the fish, which gets as much of the menu’s real estate, befitting a Provençal restaurant. I found some  desserts, well, small. Fewer than a half dozen bites will get you all the way through a slender brick of jasmine semifreddo or, separately, will finish off the lemon brioche, constructed as a sort of dessert slider. Neither seemed worth $10. But the steep prices at Allegretti were accompanied, as such prices must be, with sybaritic flourishes and coddling service. The nuts given to a companion and me as we sat at the teak bar and explored the restaurant’s well chosen French wines by the glass were Marcona almonds. And when my companion  mentioned feeling a slight chill, a hostess appeared suddenly with a trove of beautifully folded silk-wool   wraps  on hand for such situations. I’m not sure what era or neighborhood that references, but it’s a lovely touch. Allegretti ** 46 West 22nd Street, Chelsea; (212) 206-0555. Allegrettinyc.com.

659,Momofuku Ko,★★★,20080507,Frank Bruni,East Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/07/dining/reviews/07rest.html,"WHAT you’re about to read may prod you to try for a reservation at Momofuku Ko, so it’s incumbent on me to say this right off the bat: Best of luck. Be strong. Be forewarned. You can’t fixate on a specific night. You can’t fixate on a specific hour. You must have patience, an efficient computer and nimble, fast-moving fingers, because the way to grab one of the 12 coveted seats is to click-submit a reservation request at precisely 10 a.m. precisely six days before you aspire to dine there and then hope against hope and dream against dream and promise the cyberspace gods your firstborn male child if they speed your electronic wish to Ko before all the other electronic wishes get there. Drat! The gods must be lazy. It’s 10:00:09 and the computer is saying that every reservation has just been taken. Try again tomorrow, and the day after that. Promise the gods your chocolate Lab as well. Ko doesn’t come easy, and that’s a big part of why it is, and will no doubt remain, the most talked-about new restaurant this year. But it’s noteworthy beyond its addling all-computer reservation system and the intense, revelatory pleasures of its partly Asian, partly French, wholly inventive food. Under the direction of the young chef David Chang, who has been celebrated to the point of deification, Ko boldly investigates how much — or rather how little — ceremony should attend the serious worship of serious cooking. Although dinner at Ko is a two-hour, eight-course, full-throttle commitment, it’s also an experiment in subtraction, in calculating which niceties can go without the enjoyment ebbing as well. Proper tables and place settings? At Ko you belly up to a plain counter that wraps around a plain galley kitchen, and your chopsticks rest on a wine cork. Lumbar support? At Ko you straddle a backless stool. Lovely scenery? There’s a plywood wall to your back and, in front of you, cooks so close you can count their beads of sweat as they not only prepare and plate your food but also hand it to you. You can feel the heat from the stoves like a sunburn on your brow. There’s no hard liquor, no tea, no regular coffee and above all no choice. You eat dishes of Ko’s choosing in the order it chooses, and most everybody around you is having roughly the same meal. The omakase experience at sushi bars is one point of reference; another is the feng shui of the French chef Joël Robuchon’s counter-centric L’Atelier restaurants. But Ko makes the interface between you and the cooks even more casual, more blithe: you sit like an Abdul in judgment of their ability to carry the Led Zeppelin tune blaring from the speakers, because try to carry it they will. Ko pares down stuffy atmospherics in a particularly thorough way. It wagers that for a younger generation more focused on food than on frippery, a scruffy setting, small discomforts and little tyrannies are acceptable — preferable, even — if they’re reflected in the price. They are. For $85 you get a number and caliber of dishes — including a wacky and wonderful blizzard of cold foie gras flakes and a cheeky panna cotta whose sweet, milky flavor mimics the sublime dregs of a bowl of cereal — that might cost $150 in a more formal environment. You don’t get start-to-finish enchantment, but that’s not a function of insufficient coddling. It’s a function of where you set the bar for a restaurant that must master only a cluster of dishes on a given night, and that compels you to surrender so fully to its authority. Under those terms there’s a promise of unwavering transcendence, and Ko in its early months serves a few dishes that merely intrigue along with others that utterly enrapture. It also falls prey to some inconsistency. Twice I was blown away by the first savory course, which follows an amuse-bouche of an English muffin soaked with whipped pork fat. It showcases uncooked fluke in a wash of buttermilk, yuzu and Sriracha that struck a thrilling balance of round and sharp notes, silky and spiky effects, coolness and heat. On top of this mix were enough toasted poppy seeds to give it a pleasant grittiness and a pointillist skin. But the next time I had this dish, with scallop filling in for fluke, the Sriracha was a tamer presence, and the sauce was slightly watery. One of the final savory courses, slices of short rib that are cooked sous vide for 48 hours before being deep-fried, was a miracle of tender-crisp contrast one night and a letdown of leathery-crisp redundancy on another. Deification may have come prematurely to Mr. Chang. But a low-key coronation makes sense. With Momofuku Noodle Bar and Momofuku Ssam Bar, both near Ko in the East Village, he has demonstrated a shrewd grasp of the culinary zeitgeist, bringing considerable skill and high standards to noodle soups, slider-size sandwiches, Asian burritos and chicken wings. He’s playful, never pompous, and despite the offal and other adventurous streaks on the menus at Noodle and Ssam, they resemble glossy snack bars, raucous and rollicking into the wee hours. The last seating at Ko, which means “child of” in Japanese, is 9:30 p.m. This even-tempered child gives Mr. Chang and his cohorts, including Peter Serpico, a business partner who acts as the restaurant’s chef de cuisine, a smaller, more orderly sanctum in which to labor over a succinct lineup of dishes more  classically artistic than the archetypal Momofuku pork bun, not to be found here. It continues his exploration of his Korean heritage, adoration of pork belly and penchant for pickling. Pickled carrots and pickled mustard seeds surround the short rib, offsetting its heaviness with tart, acidic elements. He’s also a fiend for smokiness, achieved with abandon and efficiency through the addition of a bacon purée — liquid pork belly! — to the dressing of a dish centered around scallop or trout, depending on the night. The soft-boiled egg that he serves with hackleback caviar is dipped in smoked water, but that’s not the fun part. Next to it are cooked onions and tiny slivers of deep-fried fingerling potato. It’s a chip-and-dip of a more delicate order. Lately he has replaced this dish with a less successful eggy meditation: a version of chawan mushi, the Japanese custard, with caviar, asparagus, argan oil and cashews, which don’t register forcefully or give the dish much textural contrast. There’s lasagna, but it’s a dissident lasagna, the noodles entwined with snails, porcini, spring asparagus, a ricotta foam of sorts and — the genius touch — a Lilliputian bouquet of dehydrated broccoli rabe flowers. They’re crunchy, a smart hedge against any lasagna soupiness. And they’re adorable, like miniaturized marigolds. There’s a Georgia pea soup with such resonant pea flavor that you wonder about the bastard pedigree of all prior peas in your life and almost fail to notice the morels and the delicate crawfish in the soup. I said almost. Crustaceans rarely get past me. And then there’s  that arresting foie gras, a torchon of which is frozen so it can be shaved into a loosely packed snowball. This preserves the liver’s creaminess while tempering its unctuousness,  and it’s rounded out with a brittle of cashews or pine nuts, a gelée of riesling or Sauternes, and litchi or pickled grapes. Ko rearranges the pieces from night to night. Its sense of mischief is underscored by the “wine pairing” for a course of soft-shell crab: a glass of chilly Budweiser, bringing to mind a day at the beach. Mischievous, too, is the pastry chef Christina Tosi’s apple pie. It’s sculptured into individual-size rectangles and deep-fried, as if it came straight from McDonald’s, only McDonald’s wouldn’t accessorize it with sour cream ice cream and a swish of sweet, salty toasted miso. You’ll love it, provided you ever get access to it. The unpredictability of accomplishing that — I entered into groveling, Ko-dependent arrangements with tireless friends and readers — has soured some would-be patrons, but Ko can’t be faulted for generating a demand in excess of the supply. And Mr. Chang to his credit doesn’t seem to be holding any seats in reserve for V.I.P.’s. Judging from the diners around me whenever I visited, the 10 a.m. reservations lottery favors people under 40, who are perhaps wiser in the ways of technology and more zealous and dexterous in their clicking. That’s probably as it should be: Ko looks to the future, ignoring the old rules and beckoning epicures open to new ones. Momofuku Ko *** 163 First Avenue, (10th Street), East Village; momofuku.com.

660,Isa,★,20111122,Eric Asimov,Williamsburg,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/dining/reviews/isa-nyc-restaurant-review.html,"LET’S just say it straight out: Isa is one peculiar restaurant. It’s warm, it’s welcoming, the dining room smells great, and, despite the hard chairs and benches, it’s fairly comfortable. The food’s pretty good, too. Yet while Isa can be idiosyncratic in the best sense, of going its own way, it’s occasionally strange for no apparent reason. Isa, on the south side of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, is the latest restaurant from Taavo Somer, the designer whose previous work has included those Manhattan bastions of downtown cool Freemans and Peels. Those restaurants heralded a journey away from the cold urban techno-beat aesthetic toward a perhaps satiric embrace of the trappings of a rural past. Mr. Somer continues his exploration with the rustic, meticulously rough-hewn Isa. Wood dominates, from the exposed, apparently unfinished ceiling beams to the knotty wall paneling to the tree branches that seemingly burst through one wall, giving that particular corner the airy feel of a treehouse. The carefully rendered country kitchen chairs and tables stand in mute testimony to Mr. Somer’s perfectionistic primitivism. The restaurant’s two rooms consist of a sedate dining room with a long wooden bar, and a more boisterous open kitchen area with tables that can be arranged communally or individually. Along one paneled wall perpendicular to the kitchen, firewood is stacked in triangular compartments, a design element with a practical function. The wood fuels a brick oven nearby, accounting for the enticing woodsy, smoky aroma. Did I say triangular compartments? Isa is awash in triangles. The wall and ceiling beams form triangular designs; the floor tiles, if not exactly triangles, suggest them; the menus, merely two-sided clip-art printouts, overflow with triangles. As if to underline the intensity of the themes by way of stark contrast, a unisex bathroom is so painfully bright, so full of hard glossy surfaces and pounding with music at head-splitting volume from an ear-level speaker that you cannot make your escape fast enough. The food of the chef, Ignacio Mattos, clings to a complementary primitive aesthetic. Ingredients are presented directly and cooked simply, often with a kiss of smoke. The quirkiness begins in the combination of ingredients, and in the menu, which changes daily yet in some ways changes very little. Each night’s offering includes about six appetizer-size plates and two main courses. It would be one thing if these main courses turned over frequently. Yet at each of three dinners at Isa over three weeks, one of the main courses was cod. Now, I will grant that each time the cod was slow cooked to an exquisite, pillowy softness, its flesh moist, delicate and as juicy as cod can ever expect to be. I will concede, as well, that the sides changed each time. On one visit the cod was served with chanterelles and cabbage leaves that had been cooked to a delicious sweetness, along with a thick citrus confit that was somewhat discordant. A second time, the cod was served with pil-pil, a Basque garlic-and-olive-oil emulsion usually made with salt cod, which here lacked a garlicky bite. Cod No. 3 was a study in beige, served with cauliflower and that same citrus confit. Despite the monochrome presentation, each of the elements seemed to go its own way, though the cod, frankly, did very well on its own. On each of the first two visits the second main course was duck, thick slices of earthy, almost livery meat served once with sweet roasted carrots and onions in a cool, soothing yogurt sauce, and a second time with that beige combination of cauliflower and citrus confit, which was soon to reappear with the cod. The duck was not the right pairing for the cauliflower and confit, either, though the duck itself was superbly flavored. Imagine my surprise on my third visit to find, instead of the duck, smoky sliced rib-eye, with almost-steely matsutake mushrooms and roasted fingerling potatoes coated in, of all things, bits of blackened hay. I must say, I loved those potatoes, the hay adding a — what else — grassy note to the potatoes’ salty char. Hay is for hipsters, I suppose. Perhaps Isa knows best what its clientele desires. Looking around me, I saw couples and small groups sharing many of the more diverse small plates and perhaps one main course, rather than ordering an appetizer and main course. Meals certainly get off to a fine start with a basket of the house-made bread — sourdough, multigrain or flatbread — still smoky from the oven. Dishes that may seem challenging are in fact delicious and easy to negotiate. Sardines are salt-cured. Then, after the meat is removed from the bones, the skeleton is deep fried and served alongside with olives and celery slivers. From head to tail, it’s a crunchy, savory delight. Pig tail is meltingly soft and rich, the caramelized flesh falling off the many bones, while chanterelles served with slivers of pig ear are superb, the ear offering wonderful contrasts of sweet and smoky, crisp and soft. Steak tartare is served in a decorous circle, beefy and pure, blended with a sunchoke purée with a little pile of brown flax — “soil,” the menu calls it — for crunchy contrast. I was not moved by a plate of daikon, seaweed and horseradish, a kind of amplified bitterness in which each bite seemed to result in a grimace. Chewy calamari, redolent of the wood-burning oven, was a far better option, as was a salad of white beets, apple, ricotta and granola — pleasingly sweet, tart, juicy and crunchy. Isa offers a short wine list that strikes many of the idiosyncratic notes of the wine avant-garde. Lambrusco? Check. Skin-macerated orange wines? Yup. The Jura? Of course. All go beautifully with the food. The quirky allure hit a snag with desserts, which emphasize vegetative notes and do not reward with sufficient sweetness or deliciousness. The effect can be punishing, as with a celeriac purée dressed in green tea, which essentially tastes like celeriac, or a lemon mousse with mascarpone and huckleberry, which is pleasant enough until you get to the slivers of black olives, and you stop chewing in puzzlement. Such failures can be comprehended when the effort is noble. In design and execution, Isa is very much an unusual expression, to be applauded for its successes, understood for its striving and forgiven for its lapses, which at least resemble no others.

667,A Voce Columbus,★★,20091124,Sam Sifton,Upper West Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/25/dining/reviews/25rest.html,"THERE are two A Voce restaurants in New York City. One opened in 2006, off Madison Square Park. It is dark and almost romantic, loud when crowded, pretty after a fashion, perfectly good. The other opened in September  on the third floor of the Time Warner Center, in the space that used to be Café Gray. The second restaurant is bright and airy, loud when crowded, pretty after a fashion, also perfectly good. Remember  Archie Comics? The A Voce downtown is Veronica. The one uptown is fair Betty. The chef at both restaurants is Missy Robbins, a young comer most recently out of Chicago, where she cooked at Spiaggia. At the start of this year, she replaced Andrew Carmellini, who opened the first A Voce and then left during the run-up to the opening of the Time Warner branch. (He wrote a cookbook, and is now the executive chef at and an owner of  Locanda Verde in TriBeCa.) Ms. Robbins is a cool character. She cooks rustic Italian food and sends it out of the kitchen looking like modernist plate paintings, little sculptures, edible art. She sautés a perfect rectangle of branzino, places it atop a foundation of thin-sliced warm heirloom tomatoes, then plants a lawn of caper pesto on top. The colors delight, and the flavors redouble the feeling: salt against acid against the sweet meat. Ms. Robbins is an excellent chef. She didn’t come here to mess around. But make no mistake. A Voce is a corporate enterprise, part of a master plan, and feels like it. Save for swiveling yourself around in the Eames-y leather chairs that appoint both restaurants, there is very little room for improvisation. Service is clinical, almost silent, beyond language. Wine is what a chairman would expect, what most would order: a lot of big California cabernets, excellent chardonnays. That’s on purpose. Marlon Abela, the airline-food scion who owns the restaurant, and who has other restaurants and gastro-businesses  in London and Greenwich, Conn., has grand and global plans. The point is to build a jig — a successful outfit with a particular menu, design aesthetic and experience — that can be used again and again and again. Properly handled by his lieutenants, this restaurant could yield more A Voces in other cities, in other malls, all over this land. For the moment, though, it is just a New York restaurant, its hardest test. And Ms. Robbins at least is up to the task. Start with some salumi and verdure — meat and vegetables to accompany a glass of wine, as you look at the menu. (Have, too, the terrific house-made focaccia with  ricotta, olive oil and a dusting of fresh herbs and pepper, served gratis at Time Warner, and for $12 downtown.) There is coppa from Iowa, nutty and bright with salt, and an Italian lardo that is not the plain white version you see in Mario Batali’s restaurants, but more streaked and less scented with rosemary, somehow more country, almost brave. It would be nice to have that in Dallas, in St. Louis, in Phoenix. Cured tuna sliced so thin as to make paper look bulky, in a lovely spicy-oil bath? Yes. And the nduja as well, a wickedly spicy Calabrian version of andouille, served out of its casing, a spreadable meat. There are sweet and hot peppers mixed, silky and terrific, and there is eggplant oiled and softened into pure, mouth-itchy deliciousness. There are sliced radishes in a rich anchovy vinaigrette, and beets with pistachio, sweet garlic, thyme and orange. Any two of these will do; there are many courses to go before you sleep. The appetizer list yields a remarkable house-made salt cod, with taggiasca olives, raisins and pine nuts, that is somehow both delicate and brawny — a football player in ballet’s fourth position. There are also roasted   mushrooms with mâche, hazelnuts and a creamed fontina, rich and earthy, quietly elegant, sensual: it’s bedroom fare. Beef carpaccio with walnuts, lemon and pecorino is a swing and a miss: almost flavorless. But a salad of creamy, burrata-like stracciatella cheese with marinated cherry tomatoes and arugula goes in the other direction. A plate of grilled calamari with a spicy vinaigrette comes with shelling beans and zucchini. It could come with yard grass and used tennis balls and still be decent. And the cassoncini — half moons of fried dough filled with Swiss chard and buttery crescenza cheese, served beside thin slices of prosciutto — are astounding, the Italian version of an Argentine empanada. Ms. Robbins has a sure touch with pasta. House-made spaghetti alla chitarra, with crab, leeks, lemon and a lobe of sea urchin, for instance, is delightful, perfectly cooked, flavorful. Hand-rolled pici — a thick-stranded pasta the Venetians call bigoli — is brawny and almost nutlike in flavor, served with brussels sprouts, bacon and Sicilian almonds. And ravioli stuffed with taleggio, with chanterelles and brown butter, is close to magic: smooth and autumnal, just right. Main courses can stumble. Chicken marinated in fennel and chili, then cooked under a brick and served with Tuscan greens, huge white beans and Yukon Gold potatoes was fantastic: crisp, salty and sweet all at once. A pork chop piled high with roasted abalone mushrooms, with arugula and grilled lemons, was excellent, though frankly a little much on the plate, even for a big fellow. But trout with crisp fingerling potatoes, bitter greens and an anchovy vinaigrette perfectly illustrated the great problem of aquaculture, even when it’s responsibly done: the fish is flavorless, a plain canvas upon which Ms. Robbins must paint the salt and bite of the anchovies. Grilled lamb chops with lamb sausage, Umbrian lentils and stone-fruit mostarda delivered good chops, though the lamb sausage was dry and uninteresting, and the lentils its close relative. Dry-aged strip steak with potatoes and olives was simply fine; it tasted as obligatory as it surely is. Dessert brings crepes filled with ricotta, with roasted apples and a rum-raisin sauce, good Italian cooking with a New England accent. Semi-frozen chocolate-chip mousse with bitter orange and a cocoa pizzelle could use more bitter orange to counteract the sweet; a better bet is the espresso-chocolate custard tart with toasted almonds and cocoa nibs. Or for those who ordered the steak: Tuscan doughnut bombs filled with sweet cream and served with a bittersweet chocolate dipping sauce that is essentially a melted chocolate bar. (Bring your own insulin.) After all this you want a grappa and a slide down the front of the building into a cab. Instead, there is an empty J. Crew to face on the way to the escalator, another long ride down to the street under harsh light. A meal at the flagship!

671,The John Dory,★★,20090210,Frank Bruni,Chelsea,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/11/dining/reviews/11rest.html,"TOO many new restaurants are just minor rewrites of a half-dozen restaurants before them, profit-minded plagiarisms with a side of bacon-studded brussels sprouts. Not the John Dory. In what is clearly a labor of not just love but also vivid (sometimes too vivid) imagination and real guts, the chef April Bloomfield and the restaurateur Ken Friedman have fashioned a place that doesn’t look like any other and that doesn’t taste like any other, either. It’s putatively British, which ties it to the duo’s previous hit, the Spotted Pig, but still doesn’t carry wide associations of exemplary, irresistible cooking. It’s a seafood house, but with the gastronomic muscle, swagger and — it often seems — cholesterol count of a steak place. The sides include sweet potatoes with marrow. No brussels sprouts here. And while the white tablecloths  signal fine dining, the walls and floors and shelves and counters say  something else. They’re a riot of fishy and kitschy adornments: an enormous tank with tropical fish, an illuminated footpath formed by what looks like crustacean fossils, dolphin and bass and salmon objets d’art, a mollusk  taxonomic chart, mirrors framed in seashells. Mr. Friedman is credited as the decorator, and it’s as if he went on eBay, typed in “fish décor” and bought and made use of everything that popped up. It’s all very “Finding Nemo,” or maybe losing Nemo, because the impact of this visual chaos — ratcheted up by an open kitchen that is a distraction too many — can be to give you a maritime migraine and tug your focus from the edible fish that are the purpose and point of the project. Nemo gets lost in another sense as well. In Ms. Bloomfield’s laudable determination not to treat seafood as lean and pristine cuisine, she sometimes goes too far, for example dousing the restaurant’s namesake dish, a whole roasted John Dory for two, with not just a salty salsa verde but also an audaciously generous measure of butter and other pan juices. Although gorgeously cooked, the fish becomes almost incidental.  Dungeness crab, meanwhile,  is bombarded by a black pepper sauce. With other dishes, though, Ms. Bloomfield’s revel in richness and big flavors pays off. Two in particular stand out: this restaurant’s answers to the gnudi that Ms. Bloomfield made famous at the Spotted Pig. Only they’re more adventurous, and possibly even more enjoyable. One of them, an appetizer labeled an oyster pan roast, is essentially a thick, garlicky, intense bisque in which several of the plumpest, most tender oysters imaginable loll. But even that’s not the whole of it. With the bisque comes crostini covered in overlapping petals of a pale orange purée of uni, butter and salt. If Poseidon had a preferred canapé, this would be it. The other marquee dish, an entree, involves several large,  seared bulbs of squid that are stuffed, as the menu promises, with chorizo. But once again the menu is indulging in understatement. The chorizo is joined by Bomba rice, saffron and more: a veritable paella’s worth of ingredients, and a very fine paella at that. If you’re vegetarian or allergic or kosher or such, you can skip the squid and the pan roast. But if you’re not and you do, you might as well hurl yourself into traffic outside the restaurant. You’re too big a fool to go on. In addition to its appetizers and entrees, the menu has raw-bar and crudo selections, and across all of it there are creative flourishes and an impressive attention to detail. Not content to merely showcase first-rate oysters, the John Dory gives  them two  zesty accessories: a mignonette made with cilantro and jalapeño, and a mix of freshly grated horseradish and Champagne vinegar. There are nervy surprises. For a while Ms. Bloomfield served pan-fried milt, which is basically cod semen, its flavor and texture not unlike that of sweetbreads. She blasted it with capers and butter, which is also how she blasts its replacement for the time being, monkfish liver, served not in the pâté-esque way of many Japanese restaurants but as a hulking, meaty, pan-fried lobe. I admire her immensely. Frying, roasting, grilling: the kitchen, under her supervision, does all of this expertly. It teases an ideal crispness from the skin on Arctic char, served with excellent French fries. It finds an exquisite tenderness in sea bream and in pompano. But experienced in aggregate, too many dishes are too blunt. The overall flavor spectrum is too narrow, a wallow in buttery, creamy and salty effects. I sometimes left feeling overwhelmed — maybe I should say capsized — in a way I seldom do. And if it was a night when I had the good treacle pudding, the excellent chocolate pot du crème or the serviceable sundae, I was (swollen) belly up. The prices, which have come down since the restaurant’s opening in November, remain an odd mix. For a terrific, bountiful fish stew with more of a hillock than a dollop of aioli, $30 seems about right. But the starters are too expensive. The wine list isn’t. It has been put together by David Lynch, who used to be the wine director at Babbo, with help from  Joe Bastianich.  And it reflects a sensitivity to lower budgets as well as to the restaurant’s cuisine: the big reds on Mr. Lynch’s Babbo list aren’t emphasized here. But there’s an aged, slightly oxidized white rioja for  $60. I admire him immensely, too. So plan on wine at the John Dory, but not on comfort. It’s curious: Mr. Friedman has said that with this restaurant he wanted to make sure Ms. Bloomfield had a more proper showcase for her serious talent than she does at the Spotted Pig.  Unlike the Spotted Pig, the John Dory takes reservations, passes out amuse bouches, has a broad selection of bread. But it nonetheless has a degree of commotion more apt for a restaurant with lower prices. The vestibule and traffic routes quickly become jammed. The seating is tight. Much of it is along a banquette whose green-and-blue-plaid upholstery recalls a Catholic schoolgirl’s skirt, behind a fencelike divider that brings to mind a boat’s deck. To maneuver better, maybe I should have worn Docksiders. I definitely should have worn looser pants. The John Dory ** 85 10th Avenue (16th Street); (212) 929-4948.

676,Veritas,★★★,20110315,Sam Sifton,Flatiron,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/dining/reviews/16rest.html,"VERITAS? Is that place still open? An elegant little jewel box on 20th Street across from Gramercy Tavern, the restaurant made its debut in 1999 as a showcase for the cooking of Scott Bryan and the immense wine collection of Park B. Smith, the avuncular textile entrepreneur and Rhône fanatic who helped found the place. Success followed, and then after Mr. Bryan left, a slow descent into stuffiness. A decade after Ruth Reichl awarded it three stars in these pages, Veritas was chiefly known for being expensive. It is now worth visiting again. Closed for renovation last summer, the restaurant reopened in November behind a new ownership team led by Mr. Smith, the defense lawyer Arthur Aidala, and the chef Sam Hazen, with a warm, pendant-lighted new design from Crème, the Brooklyn-based design firm also responsible for the restaurant Marc Forgione, in TriBeCa. Mr. Hazen, known primarily as the kitchen force behind the mega-club restaurants Tao and Tao Las Vegas, has introduced to the restaurant a tightly focused, extremely flavorful and somewhat less expensive à la carte menu of aggressively American cooking, terrifically executed by Alexander Williamson, his chef de cuisine. The sommelier Rubén Sanz Ramiro matches the treasures of Mr. Smith’s cellar to it with both an eye toward value and a firm understanding of glee. The long bar bustles with wine geeks, and regulars cram the wine-bottle-lined hallway near the restrooms to compare notes on Châteauneuf-du-Papes and Mr. Hazen’s maple-brined pork. Veritas, now without tablecloths or pretense, has become a sophisticated, enjoyable restaurant. It is the sort of place where people make their reservations not over the telephone from the office, but as they’re making their way out of the dining room after their meals. See you next week! Mr. Hazen spent close to a decade at the Tao restaurants before leaving in 2008, selling kung pao chicken under giant Buddhas for combined grosses of more than $90 million a year. But he is classically trained. He was forged in tough kitchens behind glittery dining rooms: La Côte Basque in New York; Le Gavroche, in London, where he was chef de partie; and Raymond Blanc’s Le Manoir aux Quat’Saisons, near Oxford. He has since run many large food mills here in Manhattan, including Rue 57 and the late Tavern on the Green. (Haters are going to hate.) Still, his haute-restaurant game is in place. A simple bowl of black lentil soup arrives as an appetizer supporting a pale tan golf-ball shape: a savory profiterole flavored with Ibérico ham, its buttery interior gushing forth under the pressure of a spoon to flood the creamy legumes with the nutty flavor of the meat, along with vadouvan and mustard. A wide plate of baby spinach sits fluffy and green between guardian deviled eggs, their yolks enlivened with blue cheese from Point Reyes and bisected by thin discs of dried pancetta. It is a fantastic salad, at once sweet and salty, crisp and slick. Mr. Hazen returns to these notes again and again, throughout his list of starters. They may be found in his crab salad, in which a mix of blue- and Jonah-crab meat comes in a phyllo-dough round, flavored with black olives and lemon jam, peppery with arugula. They are in a chilled oyster escabeche with candied lemon, tomato and cilantro, as well, the light sauce enhancing the flavor of the oysters without distracting from them in the least. And they are there again in a plate of lobster tail and roasted bone marrow, Ocean and Land, that manages at once to be outrageous and entirely possible to consume in one minute of concentrated eating, with the marrow acting as butter for the lobster tail’s — what? Corn on the cob? Steak? Toast? The dish makes for great eating, but gluttons will prefer the so-called Beef in Transition, a combo platter of beef tartare, peppered sliced sirloin and little purses of braised short rib. What to drink with all this? The restaurant’s collection of 75,000 bottles includes hefty holdings of Mr. Smith’s beloved Châteauneuf-du-Pape (here’s a nice 1998 Charvin now, for $220), but Mr. Sanz Ramiro and his staff — the sommeliers Orr Reches and Alexandria Cubbage — have much to recommend on the regular wine list as well, and can tailor their offerings to budgets both small and immense. A 2007 syrah from California’s north coast, for instance, the Pax Cuvée Christine ($76), was a lively companion to Mr. Hazen’s funky, superb Washington state Mangalitsa pork, brined in maple, roasted in rendered pork fat and served with braised, panko-crusted fried pork-neck meat, over wilted butter lettuce and charred tomatoes, with a dressing of whipped maple syrup, grape must and pork drippings. Those interested in red Burgundies and able to spend $300 or more on a bottle may do even better. Either way, an order of the roast chicken — La Belle Rouge, and crisp as puff pastry — is a requirement for any table, served moist and salty over a potato-leek cake that absorbs the fat and juice of the chicken as they seep into it during the course of the meal. (Couples, meanwhile, may wish to share a bone-in sirloin with a thatch of watercress and steak fries that manages to taste emphatically of beef and potato, starch and salt.) Immense seared scallops plunge in another direction entirely, with roasted cèpes and a sunchoke purée, and some sections of foie gras to elevate it all. (Some Chablis with that?) So does a dish of crisp striped bass with confited eggplant, sweet peppers and a simple, Mediterranean-hued sauce vierge. For dessert, the restaurant’s pastry chef, Emily Wallendjack, who came to Veritas from Cookshop, offers a marvelous cranberry bread pudding, and an heirloom apple crisp with crème fraîche ice cream to match, along with some fine chocolate goodies. If you have come to the restaurant, however, it should be for Ms. Wallendjack’s interpretation of the classic Dark and Stormy cocktail, rendered here as moist, sticky toffee pudding with ginger-lime ice cream, the whole concoction dusted with lime zest. That and a glass of Rittenhouse rye are enough to put down an ox. It would die pleased. Service at the restaurant is excellent — well informed about the menu and swift to its tasks. Aaron Zebrook, at the front of the house, is the man to see about a table, and runs the room as if it were his private club. There is little about the place to knock save the cacophony that develops in the dining room when it is crowded, the traffic jam at the door and the occasional line at the restroom. That’s truth.

677,The John Dory Oyster Bar,★★,20110125,Sam Sifton,NoMad,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/26/dining/reviews/26rest.html,"MAYBE there is something democratic about having a no-reservations policy at a restaurant as otherwise terrific as the John Dory Oyster Bar. Perhaps there is some benefit to having patrons come early and wait late. It is difficult to see what it might be, though, when after an hour you’re still standing at the bar  waiting for a table. Especially as the bartenders studiously work on Negronis for someone else, or pull carafes of riesling from a tap and ignore you. These jakes rarely look up at the crowd two-deep before them. It can be the devil to get a glass. The middle-aged curious stand with bags under their eyes going through the wait, shuffle their feet in impatience, stare at the high ceiling and try not to crab at each other. For them a no-reservation policy is a kind of age discrimination. They did not come here for the scene. They just want to eat. Young bucks in selvage jeans and attitude are present as well, holding down beers and the faint hope they will be recognized and seated by Ken Friedman, the towering and slightly rumpled restaurateur who owns this place with the chef April Bloomfield. (They won’t be, and perhaps this is a defense of the policy.) Meanwhile, look how they all tarry and laugh at the tables behind us, all these people who cut out of work early to score a table, or who waited their hour and now reap the reward. They lap up oysters in the din, clink glasses, order some more. Hurry up and eat, why don’t they? For the food at the John Dory is incredibly good. From the cilantro- and chili-spiked mignonette that Ms. Bloomfield uses to accompany the wide selection of cleanly shucked oysters at the top of the meal, through the soft and salty joy of a Parker House roll accompanied by smoked arctic char, into a salad thick with crab and threaded with puntarelle, through a lobster bisque of great depths of flavor and a kedgeree that might have pleased Kipling, the restaurant’s pleasures rise and tumble like waves against the shore. The John Dory Oyster Bar is a do-over of the plain-old John Dory, which Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield opened in a narrow storefront in far west Chelsea in 2008 and closed less than a year later, citing the location and its lack of foot traffic. The new iteration is more modest  despite the nautically themed flotsam and jetsam all over the walls, including two preposterously beautiful aquarium globes above the bar, one holding fish from the Atlantic Ocean, the other from the Pacific. High copper-topped table and marble bars and bar stools have replaced starched linen tablecloths. And there are no entrees on the menu, just small plates followed by desserts  — including a wee though excellent Eccles cake with feathery dough and rich currants, served above a thin slice of pungent Stilton. But the John Dory Oyster Bar is in all a much better restaurant than its forebear, more fully realized in its open, clattering space behind giant windows, with excellent service and a marvelous wine list. It is larger, more welcoming and decidedly less eccentric than the original, and more mature despite its casual air. (Though to be fair: the original took reservations.) The visual chaos Frank Bruni noted in his 2009 review of the John Dory is not present in the John Dory Oyster Bar (perhaps because Mr. Friedman could not mount a stuffed marlin on the window panes that make up the bulk of its wall space). And the food is more sophisticated despite its simplicity: elegant and focused. Ms. Bloomfield is cooking well enough to hold her own against any seafood-centric kitchen in the city. Her food can be astonishing. Take a dish the menu tartly calls chorizo stuffed squid with smoked tomato. (There was a similar item on the menu of the old John Dory.) Ms. Bloomfield buys whole Rhode Island squid and stuffs it  with paella rice she cooks with chorizo, red pepper, onion and saffron. For vinaigrette she smokes her own tomatoes and tosses them with sherry vinegar, salt, olive oil and a bit of palm sugar. A cook sears the squid just long enough to heat the rice through and give its body a faint crust, then places it on a soft bed of tiny white beans cooked in crème fraîche, with a cloak of those smoked tomatoes and a hat of cilantro. It costs $15. It is among the best things you can eat in New York City. (In the $4-and-under division, even counting some Chinatown dumplings, it would be difficult to top Ms. Bloomfield’s toast slathered in a paste of anchovies, parsley and olive oil.) Take, as well, her escarole salad. Ms. Bloomfield constructs the dish out of two forms of the plant: its tender little yellow heart leaves, served raw; and its tougher outer ones, which she pickles then grills into submission. These are all tossed with an anchovy dressing made with egg, grapeseed oil, anchovies, white wine vinegar and Parmesan, then finished with olive oil, lemon and salt, as well as with anchovy fillets and lemony bread crumbs. It is a warm, crunchy, cool salad for the celestial, a Caesar meant for emperors. Ms. Bloomfield is the chef of the Spotted Pig in the West Village, an original Manhattan gastropub, where her burger brought fame (and her gnudi, sighs of pleasure). She is also the chef at the dark and piggish restaurant the Breslin, just across the lobby of the Ace Hotel from this new venture, which glows on the corner of Broadway and 29th Street. She is known as a proponent of fat and offal, of excess and creamy intemperance, a prodigious user of parsley, a friend of salt. (Also of rules: the burger at the Pig comes with Roquefort and that’s that. No substitutions.) But the John Dory shows she is also capable of great gentleness, of cooking that is barely more than a curator’s brief. This is a much more difficult form of cooking, as it happens. Her Nantucket bay scallops arrive on the table barely kissed by olive oil, lemon and sea salt, as if dredged out of Madaket Harbor and served immediately, still dripping, on the boat. (Pair these with a marvelous razor-clam ceviche, or with beautiful hunks of Tasmanian sea trout dressed in crunchy salt.) Twisted little whelks are served unadorned but for their barnacles, with a small fork for pulling their steamed bodies out onto a plate: a fantastic flavor to match with rich melted garlic butter. These are the perfect foil for Peconic oysters that are fat, briny and complex. There is cold poached lobster slathered with tomalley vinaigrette that tastes of simple summer pleasures even as snow drifts down over Broadway beyond the restaurant windows. And an oyster pan roast, held over from the original restaurant’s menu, combines oysters and their liquor, reduced vermouth, cream and tarragon, into a kind of ambrosia. The toast spread with sea urchin that appears with this is sublime and appears obvious, as if the sea produced butter and everyone knew it. The dish is fabulous. All this greatness comes at a cost, which is the time and dignity lost waiting for a table. Perhaps it won’t matter in a decade or so, when the rhythms of the place have sorted themselves out and people know when to go to the restaurant, and for what. In the meantime, though, that tariff rankles. It leads here to exclusivity disguised as populism.

681,Trestle on Tenth,★,20060913,Frank Bruni,Chelsea,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/13/dining/reviews/13rest.html,"AS  a chef on a path to running his own restaurant, Ralf Kuettel did what anyone would expect, spending most of the last two decades in professional kitchens. He cooked at Union Square Cafe in its early years. He cooked at Cena before it closed. But it’s the unexpected thing he did when he stepped away from the stove that had the most important impact on Trestle on Tenth, which he opened in Chelsea about two months ago. From 2001 to 2005, Mr. Kuettel wallowed in wine. He started out as a salesman at the Chelsea Wine Vault. Then he was the buyer and store manager there. His arc matters less than his destination. He became a grape geek of the most fetching, infectious kind. I say this not because I know him (I don’t), but because I know the wine list he has put together for Trestle on Tenth, a principled document that favors small over large producers, spirited over lulling wines, adventure over surefire accessibility. While so many other wine lists seem to have been assembled by a computer program — with France and California meted out in predetermined measure and enough generically velvety pinot noir to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool — this one has a real point of view. On it you’ll find as much cabernet franc as cabernet sauvignon, and you’ll find more Italian lagreins (two) than Chiantis (none). You’ll find a white wine called a savagnin from the Jura region of France, a red wine called a gamaret from Switzerland and other wines that seldom claim attention from wine-producing areas that seldom command adulation. And you’ll have enough confidence in Mr. Kuettel’s judgment to be tempted to order them, because when you do find a wine you know — I spotted and drank a beloved Breton Bourgueil, Clos Sénéchal — you’ll recognize it as a prudent choice. What’s more, you’re likely to feel you can afford to take a chance. Most of the bottles on the list, which encompasses about 75 wines, are around or under $50, in part because Mr. Kuettel tends not to mark his wines up more than about double the retail price. That’s gracious and reasonable, and it’s a reason to single out Trestle on Tenth, an otherwise uneven neighborhood restaurant whose individualism doesn’t work as well when it comes to food. The first part of its name refers to the High Line tracks nearby. The second part refers to the address of the restaurant, which extends the recently formed restaurant row on 10th Avenue a bit farther north. Mr. Kuettel is obviously betting on new development in the area: the low-key, unselfconsciously handsome environment he’s fashioned from what used to be the Chelsea Commons is the kind of warm little hug that beckons those at hand. Diners who live more than a dozen blocks away can probably find these sorts of exposed brick walls, wide-plank wood floors and even a back garden like Trestle’s closer to home. Mr. Kuettel was born and trained in Switzerland, and his menu, like his native country, is stamped with German and French influences. But what’s most striking about it is the force with which it  hits rebelliously hearty notes. It seems to anticipate winter long before the first frost, and it challenges vain, health-conscious New Yorkers to wade into the starchy and dive headlong into the flabby. Cuts of meat came with what must have been the legal limit of fat stippling, striping or skirting them. Each of three pudgy, pale red slices of meltingly tender saddle of lamb, for example, was encircled by a shockingly broad white border. I mention this not in protest but in gratitude, and it’s in that same vein that I salute a bracingly rich crépinette that pulled together pulled pork shoulder, braised Savoy cabbage and an intense pork reduction. As for starchy indulgences, there was a side dish of dumplings called pizokel, pleasantly thickened with Gruyère. A crunchy potato pancake that accompanied sautéed veal kidneys in a Trappist ale sauce was the shape and size of half a Frisbee. It was also an example of the way homey joins hearty as one of the menu’s guiding adjectives. Trestle on Tenth is the kind of restaurant at which, no matter what you ate, you feel as if you had brisket. Sure, there are two salads on the dinner menu, but the good one showered a rich buttermilk dressing and hunks of bacon over butter lettuce. The other salad, a collection of field greens with a sherry vinaigrette, was a wan throwaway. Yes, there’s fish, but it didn’t stand out. And in the cases of both an appetizer of Arctic char gravlax and a salmon entree, there were additional elements — pumpernickel bread for the char, lentils and horseradish for the salmon — that turned the dishes into heavier affairs. In fact too much at Trestle on Tenth didn’t stand out or succeed. A restaurant with a lineup of dishes this peculiar and concise (about eight appetizers and eight entrees) can’t afford to serve an oxtail and pig’s foot terrine as gelatinous and unfocused as the one here. Or a cauliflower soup, sautéed frogs’ legs, a roasted chicken and a sirloin steak as bland. It needs  a stronger finish than it gets from a merely serviceable roster of desserts — the worst being an alarmingly sour chocolate cake. But before that final act, there’s plenty of available pleasure, including the selections on the wine list, commendably tailored to the robustness and pedigree of the food. It’s predominantly European and emphasizes colder climes in its search for wines with more structure and presence than immediate fruitiness. It doesn’t pander by trotting out oak-choked, numbingly buttery California chardonnays, and when I was there (the list changes), there wasn’t a pinot grigio to be had. All in all this list is a model of what a restaurateur can do without tons of money or storage space. He can target affordable discoveries. Coax diners to take chances. And keep secrets from his wife. Mr. Kuettel is married to Juliette Pope, the beverage director for Gramercy Tavern. In a telephone interview, he said that if he happens across two cases of a treasured wine, “I might snag the first case and tell her there’s a second.” “But generally,” he added with a laugh, “I don’t.” Trestle on Tenth * 242 10th Avenue (24th Street), Chelsea; (212) 645-5659. ATMOSPHERE A bar near the entrance, a garden out back, lots of exposed brick and wide-plank wood floors create a warm, casual feel. SOUND LEVEL A very lively buzz. RECOMMENDED DISHES Pork crépinette; butter lettuce with buttermilk; lamb saddle; veal kidneys; pork loin; pizokel with Gruyère; beets; strawberry sundae; walnut and caramel torte.

682,Picholine,Three Stars,20061108,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/reviews/birds-still-soar-and-theyre-not-alone.html,"WHEN Picholine closed in August for a thorough makeover, it wasn't a nanosecond too soon. I know. Just days beforehand I took my sister there for her birthday. I've been apologizing to her ever since. The food lacked luster. The service lacked smarts. When my sister foolishly asked our waiter how old he thought she was, he even more foolishly took the question seriously, hazarding a guess that was two years too many. What a dolt. And what a drag: the frayed olive and beige dining rooms, the glum diners, the funereal hush. It was Picholine, open since 1993, that wore its age badly. It now looks sleeker, shinier and better, but not much. Was a nearby interior décor store having an end-of-summer sale on the colors purple? Picholine has gone with a cloying monochromatic palette: lavender walls, lavender accents, plum carpeting. It's the architectural equivalent of a bridesmaid's dress. But it nonetheless manages to be a winner, arguably the nicest restaurant surprise of this disappointing season, because the biggest changes aren't ones that meet the eye. The chef and owner, Terrance Brennan, has seized the occasion of a cosmetic overhaul to attend to more important matters. Along with his chef de cuisine, Craig Hopson, he has reinvigorated this restaurant's soul. Many dishes are new. Most are fantastic. What Picholine lacks in energy and style -- it's still too quiet and it's sadistically bright -- it more than makes up for in first-rate ingredients and superior execution. Start with the Roquefort parfait. Decadently creamy and rich, it is skirted with sliced endive and pear and placed over a Sauternes jelly: a commingling of tangy, bitter and sweet notes; a communion of wine and cheese at the start of the meal. Or try Mr. Brennan's gooey, salty riff on ""bacon and eggs."" It's printed on the menu that way, with quotation marks, the modern-day restaurant's cheekiness alert. In this case those marks acknowledge that the role of bacon is being played by smoked tuna belly. The role of a slow-cooked egg is, in fact, played by an egg, and there's a crucial cameo by Parmesan-inflected polenta. More quotation marks, more whimsy: for chicken ""Kiev,"" breast meat is molded into a cylinder, cooked sous vide, encrusted with cornflakes, then quickly deep-fried. A server placed it on the table, then produced a silver lance. ""For your safety,"" he deadpanned, piercing the meat gently, so the liquid foie gras at its center oozed onto the plate instead of squirting into someone's eye. Despite its seemingly chromosomal stuffiness, Picholine can actually be fun. Max McCalman directs the cheese course with Tony-worthy exuberance, introducing a sprawling international cast and tapping unlikely metaphors to help you decide what to have and have not. ""This is the Lauren Bacall of cheeses,"" he said of the Beenleigh Blue, an English delicacy made from sheep's milk. ""Circa 'The Big Sleep' or 'The Mirror Has Two Faces'?"" we asked, getting into the spirit. He smiled and forged ahead, explaining that the Beenleigh, like the actress, had elegant and edgy dimensions. We didn't choose it, but we did try the Spanish Monte Enebro after he proclaimed it his favorite goat cheese in the world. No wonder. Its tart finish went on and on. The exceptional cheeses at Picholine are to be expected. Mr. Brennan, who also owns the restaurant Artisanal and a cheese wholesale and education center, is a veritable cheese evangelist. But at least in autumn and much of winter, Picholine has a comparable glory: its game birds. The recent selection included grouse and mallard duck, each with a livery intensity that made a mockery of the farmed squab with which most restaurants content themselves. There were also pheasant, wood pigeon and red-legged partridge, which tasted like impossibly pristine chicken, bathed in a dazzling foie gras and pistachio sauce. American restaurants aren't permitted to sell wild game shot in this country, but they can import it from Scotland. That's what Mr. Brennan does, and the menu carries an intriguing caveat: ""Birdshot may be present."" ""Did you get any?"" he asked me on the telephone. I hadn't. ""Too bad,"" he said. I'm not sure how to take that. But I'm certain of Picholine's charms. The cheese and the birds have long been among them, and now they're not dragged down by a mediocre roster of other dishes. Picholine gets superb lamb from Jamison Farm, and does justice to it by rolling loin meat in dried olives and gorgeously roasting it. For a lesson in balancing flavors and textures, look no further than the sautéed scallops, served with capers, butter, blood orange juice, cauliflower mousseline, slices of caramelized cauliflower and tiny, buttery croutons. The desserts, by the pastry chef, Zachary Miller, compete admirably with Mr. McCalman's charges for your end-of-meal affections. A sheep's milk cheese from Portugal or the caramel and apple brioche? All of life's choices should be so tough. The wine list, like the food, travels around the Mediterranean without ever losing sight of France, and you can receive expert guidance on it. But while service across the board is greatly improved, it could still use more polish, especially at these prices. Four courses at Picholine cost $92, only $3 less than at Jean Georges. Under the restaurant's newly relaxed rules, you can elect fewer courses or one of more than a dozen small à la carte dishes and cheese plates at the bar. Mr. Brennan is after more spontaneity and youth at Picholine, which is near Lincoln Center and received three stars in The Times in 1996. The oversize chandeliers and lavender-striped sconces aren't going to help. The consistently excellent cooking might. When a late-October milestone of my own approached and I surveyed the restaurants in my sights, I decided to celebrate the occasion with the last in a series of visits to Picholine. What a happy birthday I had. What an impressive turnaround Mr. Brennan has accomplished.

687,Saul,★★,20091006,Pete Wells,Prospect Heights,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/dining/reviews/07rest.html,"TEN years is a respectable run for a New York restaurant. Most don’t make it that long, and many of those that do are slowly taking on water. A few may change course by bringing a new chef on board or, more and more frequently these days, trimming their sails and tacking toward cheaper, more casual shores. Saul is a heartening exception. One of the first restaurants to bring a contemporary sensibility to Brooklyn when it appeared on Smith Street in 1999, it has neither faded, nor stood still, nor sought a personality transplant. Instead Saul Bolton, the chef and the owner with his wife, Lisa, has upgraded just about everything in their modest storefront. Saul is the same restaurant, but better. Mr. Bolton stood out in his adopted borough during the Clinton administration for his premium ingredients and the skill with which he prepared them, rather than for any pirouettes of imagination. In a $25 and Under column the year Saul opened, when it was last reviewed in The New York Times, Eric Asimov praised the “strong, clear flavors, bolstered by background harmonies that augment without overshadowing.” Even with foie gras on the menu (for the time-capsule price of $11), the cooking then was relatively unadorned. The dish I remember best from that era was roasted chicken, cooked all the way through but not a moment longer, and given a refined bistro treatment with a concentrated roasted garlic sauce. Good as it was, it did not carve out new territories of flavor the way the best dishes now do. I don’t remember anything on the original menu as eye-opening as the crisp pork terrine, a small grenade of deep-fried deliciousness. The kitchen simmers the head of a pig until it falls apart in shreds, then molds the meat to form the fatty core inside a crunchy panko shell. At this point, cornichons and grainy mustard would seem inevitable. Mr. Bolton has other ideas, namely  a creamy scoop of guacamole, a tart tomatillo and cilantro salsa, and cubes of pickled red pepper. The only thing that surprised me more than this Franco-Mexican liaison was how quickly I was ready for another helping. Squid ink tagliatelle was a more conventional appetizer, but was gone just as quickly. Black handmade noodles supported tender bits of squid and soaked up their wonderful broth (and, no doubt, a good deal of butter) but still held their firm-tender snap. Golden chips of garlic, a poached egg and slivers of unusually sweet and meaty dried tomatoes were on hand for all the extra emphasis the dish needed. With the exception of a striped bass fillet so aggressively seared that the  skin was more carbonized than caramelized, most of what I ate showed the same unwavering handle on technique that set Saul apart from the beginning. A main course of skate wing was sautéed to a beautiful golden finish, and left on the bone (or more precisely, the cartilage), giving it a fuller, more luxurious taste than most restaurants manage. Many calves would die in vain before I learned to pan-roast veal sweetbreads as precisely as Saul did. Even then, I doubt I would dream up the pillowy purée of chickpeas that doubled as a side dish for the sweetbreads and their sauce. The Boltons chose Smith Street in 1999 because they sensed that their neighbors wanted Manhattan-style meals without crossing a bridge. Also, the rents were low. Their dining room made the best of a tight budget: thick plates from Fishs Eddy, sturdy wineglasses, exposed brick. Like couples in a starter apartment, they dressed the place up as the money came in. The food is now served on white Bernardaud china and the wine is poured into Ravenscroft glasses. Such refinements gave Saul the feel of a destination. The first New York Michelin guide ratified this view when it gave Saul a star, a rating that was reaffirmed with the publication of the 2010 edition this week. Mr. Bolton said in a telephone interview that the Michelin star lured visitors from around the country and beyond. But Saul is probably best understood as a neighborhood restaurant, although a very nice one. The Boltons buy their wineglasses from the owner of the company, who happens to be a regular. With another customer, they bartered meals in exchange for the luminous Venetian plaster, which he applied to walls that once held a regular coat of paint and then buffed with beeswax. Classifying Saul as a neighborhood restaurant also keeps expectations in line. A cod main course one night was on the dry side, which might have been all right if it had tasted fresher. A mackerel appetizer with caponata, candied lemon and parsley sounded like September on the Mediterranean, but was as dull as New York in November. One garnish too many gave some preparations a disorderly aspect. The menu has grown bigger and more expensive (even the cheapest main course is more than $25), and it might be better if it were pared back to the inarguable winners, like the knockout roasted breast and confit leg of squab, with cracked green wheat that tasted fresh and earthy at once. Styles change, and Saul now lives among newer Brooklyn restaurants that don’t pretend they’re in Manhattan. Their homespun aesthetic can make the borough feel like  Berkeley East. Their crowd skews young. (The Boltons themselves are about to open a second, more casual place, in Prospect Heights.) At Saul, I saw young women carrying date-night purses sitting beside couples a generation or two older. The restaurant, its music never too loud or too boring and its waiters neither too aloof nor too familiar, seemed to suit them all. For all its changes, it has always been a good neighbor, even if its neighborhood now stretches beyond Brooklyn. Saul ★★ 140 Smith Street (Bergen Street), Boerum Hill, Brooklyn; (718) 935-9844.

688,Cherche Midi,★★,20140930,Pete Wells,Nolita,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/dining/restaurant-review-keith-mcnallys-cherche-midi.html,"We were halfway through appetizers at Cherche Midi, passing the steak tartare and spreading anchovy toasts with softly jiggly Parmesan custard, when one of my guests suddenly tilted his head and listened. He looked like the boy in a tornado movie who notices that the birds have stopped singing. “There’s no music,” he said. “They have speakers all over the dining room, but they’re not using them.” The restaurateur Keith McNally opened Cherche Midi in June on the corner of Houston Street and the Bowery, in a neighborhood where you don’t go out to dinner unless you are prepared to shout over some Pavement song the chef loved in college. But we were talking, with no recorded soundtrack, as if we were in some Continental restaurant off Sutton Place in 1964 eating veal Orloff by candlelight. This is the paradox of Mr. McNally. Food writers who were still eating applesauce through a straw when he opened his first restaurant (the Odeon, 1980) write about him with the same reverence that music writers have for Leonard Cohen. He’s “the king of cool,” the restaurateur who “owns NYC.” Yet when it comes to current dining trends, particularly those in favor downtown, Mr. McNally shows a healthy disregard, verging at times on hostility. Of the six restaurants he operates between 14th Street and Canal Street, Cherche Midi may be his most thorough repudiation of the downtown scene. It isn’t just music that’s missing. There’s almost no view of the street. Tapas, shared plates, tasting menus, wine pairings, “Chef recommends,” two-hour waits for a table the size of a chessboard — no, none of that. Nor did Cherche Midi’s servers try to tell me “how the menu works,” as if it were some complicated and expensive piece of machinery that I was likely to break. In Mr. McNally’s restaurants, chefs are rarely treated like stars. At Cherche Midi, two men, Shane McBride and Daniel Parilla, share the work and the credit. As a result, perhaps, their cooking is almost egoless; it’s not about what they want. It’s about what you want, especially if that happens to be red meat and French wine. The prime rib may be the only dish at Cherche Midi that could be accused of trying to make an impression. The dark, roasted edges had the irresistible intensity of the bark on great barbecued brisket, even on the night they were aggressively salted. Lending this slab of dry-aged beef a bit of finesse is the side dish of pommes soufflées, like inflatable potato chips or, as one guest said, “gluten-free beignets.” The menu gives three more main-course slots to beef. Steak frites does a fine impersonation of a Parisian bistro steak, the kind you don’t mind chewing and chewing between glasses of the house Beaujolais Villages, served at Cherche Midi in an $18 carafe. Filet mignon au poivre is far more tender, of course, with less sacrifice in flavor than usual. The tall, compact, rather lean, drip-free and wholly excellent burger is made from dry-aged prime rib; if you put your nose close enough, you can smell the meat locker right through the aroma of onion-bacon jam. All three dishes come with dark, skinny fries. Cherche Midi is so good with beef that even the best of the other main courses may register as a half step down: a pot of fat, clean mussels with bits of preserved lemon clinging to them; a roast chicken done right; a salade niçoise that pays attention to the last detail, including, in a wonderful departure from tradition, the pile of smashed potato salad at the bottom of the bowl. Here and there, the kitchen tends to overembellish. The decent roasted salmon comes with a lentil salad that tries to do too many things at once, and limp white stewed onions and fennel did not give skate Grenobloise (billed as meunière) anything that it really needed. It would be nice, too, to taste the meat under the aggressive seasoning in the steak tartare appetizer, given the chefs are clearly buying good beef. At least it made a strong impression, which is more than I can say for the $18 heirloom tomato salad. Heirlooms from where, exactly? Food Emporium? Still, unless you are coming to Cherche Midi to commune with the essence of summer, it is a good enough salad. The desserts are much better than that. The floating islands, the mocha pot de crème, the small pink raspberry soufflé hovering above a bed of warm berries — the lineup is one argument after another for bringing back old-fashioned pleasures. After a recent tour of all his restaurants, I think Mr. McNally’s great talent may be knowing which things are worth worrying about and which can get by with being just good enough. At Morandi, the main courses were almost impressive in their mediocrity, but the pasta was just swell, which may be all the place needs to keep its chairs full. The short-rib patty melt was the only good dish on a table full of disappointments at Schiller’s Liquor Bar, but I enjoyed myself more than I have at far better restaurants. There is a limit, though, and Balthazar is approaching it. The cooking, under Mr. McBride, has become utterly mundane, a pretty but flavorless imitation of French food of the kind found at any generic fake bistro. Cherche Midi’s salade niçoise is delicious from start to finish; Balthazar’s is a bowl of ingredients that can’t remember what they’re supposed to taste like. How can the same chef and the same restaurateur be responsible for both? Mr. McNally does worry about service, which at Cherche Midi manages to be everywhere without crossing the line to helicopter waitering. And, of course, he worries about the interiors. Cherche Midi’s is lovely. Outside is a dystopian intersection. You’d never know it in the dining room, which feels intimate, almost private, although of course every face is on display, bathed in light the color of apricot jam. For three decades, Mr. McNally has been rooting around in the same Lego kit: distressed mirrors, chipped subway tiles, bottles backlighted to look like stained glass. In his hands, these well-worn tricks give restaurants the battered nobility of a vintage Saab. When anyone else tries, they end up with a 1986 Ford Escort. Sets and lighting will never be the whole show."
695,West Branch,★,20090113,Frank Bruni,Midtown South,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/14/dining/reviews/14rest.html,"THE West Branch and BarBao opened only about a week and half a dozen blocks apart in late October. Over the next months I never ate dinner at the West Branch when it wasn’t packed. BarBao, on the other hand, had more empty seats than full ones. A fluke of the nights I went? Maybe. But I get the strong sense that one of these Upper West Side newcomers is faring appreciably better than the other.  And I think the discrepancy may say a lot about which types of restaurants this cruel economy is going to be kinder to, which are in for a less merciful and less certain run, and the fact that quality isn’t necessarily the chief determinant. Both the West Branch, a mostly Mediterranean brasserie, and BarBao, which interprets Vietnamese cuisine, deserve to make it. While their kitchens aren’t consistent enough or their menus quite original enough to brand them destination restaurants, they have real talent in their DNA and bring serious food to a patch of Manhattan that, for all its recent strides, could still use more of it. At a different moment, in a different climate, both could probably count on success. But in this one, merit and good intentions aren’t enough. Caution, classics and French fries — these may matter more.  Our next president himself, Barack Obama, perhaps said it best, though back in 2001, when taping a restaurant-related television show in Chicago. “I’m not looking for some fancy presentations or extraordinarily subtle flavors,” Mr. Obama said, defining his epicurean bent. “What I’m looking for is food that tastes good for a good price.” That’s a sensibility perhaps better fed by the West Branch than by BarBao, even though BarBao’s cooking is more exciting and slightly more memorable. An offshoot of the beloved Upper West Side restaurant Ouest, the West Branch has a ready-made clientele in all the grateful diners who consider the chef Tom Valenti, who runs both establishments, a hero for improving their ZIP code’s culinary lot. It maintains Mr. Valenti’s Franco-Italo inclinations and meaty preoccupations while adjusting to a miserable economy by having  lower prices than Ouest’s. About half the entrees are less than $20. It also has a looser spirit,  symbolized by a large TV  playing sports events over the front bar. Beyond the bar are a series of rooms that look instantly weathered and utterly familiar, the dark woods, dark booths and distressed mirrors straight out of the pub-cum-brasserie playbook. Approachability is the guiding ethos, manifest as well in raw bar selections,  crowd-pleasing salads (Caesar, frisée aux lardons, beets with goat cheese),  starchy sides (including, of course, fries) and an overall collection of dishes with an emphasis on comfort foods from the past and present. This emphasis tugs the menu beyond the Mediterranean: for example, to Britain (for an excellent fish and chips) and to the Caribbean (for an even better Cuban pork sandwich). Like Secession most recently, the West Branch opens up the brasserie format to Italy, taking advantage of the popularity (and affordability) of pasta by putting a half dozen such dishes into play. Only two delighted me, the squash and ham tortelli and the shrimp raviolini. Unevenness plagued the whole menu. Among the appetizers a gorgeous lobster salad kept company with an undersauced vitello tonnato, and superb steak tartare was dragged down by insipid duck liver mousse. I enjoyed the choucroute garni that accompanied (and rhymed with!) duck confit and the potato salad with the fried quail. But the star of each of those entrees gave the least commanding performance. Opt instead for the hearty veal stew or the calf’s liver. Know that there are many red wines in the $50-a-bottle range to go with either and that you can finish the night with a generous cookie plate for just $7. BARBAO exhibits price-consciousness as well, with only one main course exceeding $25. It teams the owners of the restaurant Rain  —  whose space has been redesigned in a less gimmicky, classier vein  —  with the chef Michael Bao Huynh, who ran the kitchens at Bao 111, in the East Village, and Mai House, in TriBeCa. Although hardly anonymous, Mr. Huynh has a lower profile than Mr. Valenti and doesn’t have Mr. Valenti’s traction in this part of town. He’s also working in a genre less immediately recognizable to his audience. Sizzling cuttlefish? Daikon duck hash? A diner spotting these on the menu may not be sure what’s in store. And that, coupled with glossy good looks that may tag BarBao as more of a splurge than it is, probably works to its disadvantage. Although the wine list is a bit too expensive  and the specialty  cocktails a bit  too sweet, the food at BarBao is more ambitious and nuanced  than at the West Branch, and it reflects Mr. Huynh’s gift for refracting Asian conceits and ingredients through a contemporary prism. The duck hash, combining cubes of rice cake with shredded duck confit and a poached egg, has one foot in the Far East and the other in fatty, gut-busting Momofuku Manhattan. The cuttlefish defers cunningly to many New York diners’ Mediterranean sensibilities by coming up with a version of salsa verde that adds Vietnamese mint, Thai basil and yuzu to anchovy. It’s an excellent dish, and so is a loup de mer entree that floats morels in an unusually light, luxuriant coconut and green curry emulsion. Afterward try the yucca waffle with sweet corn, peanuts and dulce de leche. I’m not sure how it fits ethnically into everything else, but it has the mix of savory and sweet  —  and the degree of salt  —  that often make a dessert stand out. The argument for BarBao is undercut somewhat by Mr. Huynh’s readiness to repeat himself. He has been cooking more than a few of these dishes, or close approximations, for years. And in the case of the iron pot chicken and the crispy whole red snapper, which was overcooked, he has done them better. But I suspect it’s not dry fish but rather larger forces that are keeping diners away. Although BarBao could certainly improve, it deserves more attention and affection than it’s getting.

705,Irving Mill,★,20080102,Frank Bruni,Union Square,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/02/dining/02rest.html,"SHORT of hayrides from the curb to the coat check, there’s not a whole lot in the way of farmhouse allusions that the new restaurant Irving Mill doesn’t try. I spotted two metal watering cans before I reached the host station, one of them perched near an antique bin brimming with pomegranates. The restaurant’s floors, wainscoting and tables bring to mind barn wood. “What did this used to be?” asked one of my companions, taking in the straw-colored space near Union Square that Irving Mill inhabits. “A stable?” cracked another. The quip shortchanges the polish of the place, which is gussied up with enormous floral arrangements — in muted colors, of course — and bracketed on opposite walls by semicircular booths. Servers wear crisp white shirts under their suspenders. They’re the kind of farmhands you find only below 23rd Street. And Irving Mill, named for its proximity to Irving Place, is the kind of restaurant you find more and more of: an ode to the seasons and the simple life, built, paradoxically, around elaborate décor and dishes that take nature’s bounty and tweak it a bunch. It’s also a self-conscious heir to Gramercy Tavern, which long ago helped to usher in the whole rustically urbane (or is it urbanely rustic?) genre. Irving Mill’s chef, John Schaefer, spent more than a decade cooking there, and Irving Mill’s layout — a casual front section with a prominent bar, a quieter back area with more elbowroom between tables — recalls Gramercy’s. If only it performed at the same level. It’s a pleasant restaurant, make no mistake: comfortable and good-natured, with a selection of about 20 wines by the glass that represent real diversity and reflect real thought, not just the default presentation of a pinot grigio here, a pinot noir there. The equally thoughtful list of bottles has many tempting selections in the $40 to $70 range. In fact prices in general aren’t as steep at Irving Mill as at many restaurants with lesser standards or ambitions. No dinner entree is over $28. A four-course tasting menu, including dessert, is $54. And at Irving Mill’s finest moments, with its finest dishes, it’s decidedly more than pleasant. The grilled quail at the center of one appetizer quickly silenced a quail naysayer at my table, who foresaw a bony, puny bird. This one had plenty of juicy meat, placed over stone-ground grits flavored with Cheddar cheese and dusted with smoked paprika. If you follow that dish with a main course of braised rabbit — served here with pork sausage, salty black olives, roasted shallots and a potato purée — you’re bound for a tremendously satisfying meal. With the rabbit, as with the quail, Mr. Schaefer takes a meat that other kitchens sometimes render stringy and gets tender results. Stringy, however, aptly describes the short ribs I tried on a different night. They reminded me of pro forma pot roast, an association underscored by their unimaginative adornment with carrots and a horseradish cream. Inconsistency dogs Irving Mill, and is perhaps best exemplified by the change in the cauliflower ravioli from one of my visits to the next. The first time out, the gently firm pasta was cooked just as it should have been, and the cauliflower had real presence. The second time, the pasta was limp and the cauliflower a washout, beyond the salvage efforts of the hazelnuts and the capers (too few and too retiring) in the mix. The dinner menu is divided into about 10 appetizers, 8 entrees and 4 sides, including brussels sprouts, the rags-to-riches vegetable story of recent years. At Irving Mill they’re unusually tiny and unusually terrific. Apart from the quail and the ravioli (on their good night), I couldn’t find an appetizer to get too excited about. I enjoyed  chicken liver crostini, but it’s rare that I don’t. Octopus had vaulted past tender to mushy, and a soup made with roasted garlic, white beans, sheep’s milk ricotta and rosemary somehow managed to be boring, not to mention sludgy. This is a menu that reads more flavorful than it tastes. How, for example, did the tangle of wild mushrooms, butternut squash and orecchiette that encircled lamb shoulder — which was braised, like the short ribs and rabbit — manage to make such a weak impression? At least the lamb itself was superb. So were the sea scallops on a tasting menu, and the hen-of-the-woods mushrooms with them had exactly the nutty, earthy charge they were supposed to. It’s hard to get a handle on Irving Mill, because pitch-perfect dishes keep company with off-key ones. Given the meaty predilections of New Yorkers today, it was surprising to find that half the entrees were fish. The standout was Arctic char, served with lentils and Savoy cabbage. Among the desserts, by the pastry chef Colleen Grapes, there weren’t any big disappointments, but there was just one knockout: a rich, tangy Greek yogurt panna cotta with stewed apricots and — most enticing of all — a bevy of toasted pistachios. More in keeping with the restaurant’s countrified soul were a pumpkin and apple strudel and a cranberry and apple crisp with a topping of almonds and oatmeal. The crisp is by far the better choice. A plate of warm cookies comes just before, or with, the check, because that’s the kind of down-home hospitality Irving Mill means to project. But projecting it in a 110-seat space as open and vast as this one — it really could be converted into a barn  — has a somewhat awkward, counterfeit effect. Cultivated rusticity usually works better in a series of smaller rooms, or on a smaller scale. Here it feels forced: “Green Acres” goes to the Greenmarket, with a lilt in its gait but some bramble on its path. Irving Mill * 116 East 16th Street (Irving Place); (212) 254-1600, irvingmill.com.

720,Calliope,★,20121002,Pete Wells,East Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-calliope-in-the-east-village.html,"THE first time I tasted Ginevra Iverson’s cooking, I was sure she was French. At the time, she was running the kitchen at Thirstbaràvin, an overachieving wine bar in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and nothing about her menu felt American. Not its concise take-it-or-leave-it length, nor its obvious faith in the power of sorrel and leeks and butter, nor its sensitive takes on the kinds of classics that are scratched in chalk above a zinc bar. Only someone born in France, I thought, could serve a plate of lamb leg with baked tomatoes that tasted so simple and honest, with no effort to crank the flavors up to American levels. When the wine bar’s owners set me straight (Ms. Iverson is Californian), I learned two lessons. First, that it’s foolish to think that only someone born into a culture can understand its cuisine. Second, and of more immediate interest, that Ms. Iverson was a chef I’d happily follow, wherever she comes from and wherever she goes. In the spring she turned up in the East Village, where she and her husband, Eric Korsh, a chef who was last seen at the Waverly Inn, have taken over a turnkey restaurant formerly called Belcourt. They largely left intact the brasserie bones that New Yorkers living in the Age of McNally call bistro décor: tiles, tin ceilings, scarred mirrors and glass doors. Whether the room is true to the bistro ethos doesn’t matter. The menu is, in a way that the city doesn’t see often enough. You’d have to spend a week in Paris to taste rabbit cooked in as many ways as it is served at Calliope. Rabbit kidneys on toast, a special one night, was so traditional it was almost shocking, in the most pleasant way. They were sautéed to the rare side of medium-rare, the uncouth edge of their bitterness softened by a Cognac-and-chicken-stock sauce with a touch of cream and butter. A wrapping of bacon gave rabbit saddle stuffed with tender leek greens and carrots an American note of smoke, but the heart of the dish, another special, was located across the Atlantic. The star of the cotton-tailed roster, a regular on the menu — and a dish that makes Calliope worth a visit all by itself — is tender braised rabbit legs tossed with pappardelle. All around the city you can find Italian spins on this idea, the sauce a ragù pink with tomatoes and aromatic with rosemary. Calliope’s rabbit is unmistakably Gallic. The sauce is built on white wine and shallots; the herbs are the trusty French quartet of chives, chervil, tarragon and parsley, and there’s not a tomato in sight. That dish and others at Calliope made me wonder why bistro cuisine in New York seems to have largely stopped evolving. For decades after World War II, French cuisine flowered here, from formal dining rooms to neighborhood dives. But somehow, as American tastes began to change, Italian restaurants stole the scene, drawing ideas from lesser-known corners of Italy, from the farmers’ markets and from ever-better imported ingredients. Meanwhile, bistro cuisine has fossilized, as chefs thumb through the same dog-eared recipe cards again and again. Steak frites, poulet rôti, moules marinière, pâté de campagne, crème brûlée: the menus might as well be printed on a mimeograph. Some New Yorkers might believe that these by-the-numbers bistros offer a cheap ticket to the Left Bank, but those who have been to Paris recently know that the bistro tradition, never dormant, has been thoroughly rejuvenated by young chefs. Mr. Korsh and Ms. Iverson don’t go nearly as far as, say, Inaki Aizpitarte at his modern bistro Le Chateaubriand. But those who hunger for the soul of bistro cuisine and not just its greatest hits will want to order a plate of Calliope’s boiled eggs with mayonnaise all the same. The eggs are just barely set in the center, and the mayonnaise is a sunny, yolk-rich yellow, seasoned boldly with vinegar, lemon juice and mustard. Sprinkled around the plate is a tart house-made celery salt of dried celeriac that I’d like to put on every egg salad I eat from this point on. This is how to keep a classic alive. The couple, who met while working at Picholine, share kitchen duties. She is responsible for the excellent beef tongue, shaving it into thin leaves that are folded over sweet white onions and an old-school sauce gribiche that’s even tangier than that mayonnaise. Mr. Korsh knows his way around a pig’s head, and his tête de porc has deep flavor with a textbook funkiness, though I wished it was sliced more thickly to play up the contrast between firm boiled meat and other, more gelatinous stuff. Those weren’t my only misgivings. The room looks pretty, but all those hard surfaces can make conversation an ordeal. The leeks that surrounded poached lobster in a gorgeous slab of a terrine could have been more flavorful, or maybe the dish was served just a few degrees too cold. And while I have no quarrel with the decision to serve ricotta-chard dumplings in browned butter, such nods to Italy having become almost routine in Paris bistros, Calliope’s are dense and flat-footed. In matzo-ball vernacular, these dumplings are sinkers. And the cake that our server one night billed as something like angel food was nearly as earthbound as an emu. I spooned up the apricot-pit ice cream served with the cake, though, as I did almost all the other desserts, now under the care of the talented pastry chef Shuna Lydon. She makes a stunningly simple bowl of vanilla custard under a chilled layer of red plum purée that I’m going to think about all fall and into the winter. And while it can’t be called her invention, the baba au rhum almost made me misty with gratitude each time a server cut the still-hot and yeasty cake neatly in half and doused it with booze from a little pitcher, as the steam lifted the vanilla scent of aged rum into the air. Very few Manhattan restaurants not owned by Alain Ducasse get baba au rhum so right. And Calliope gets many things right, even its two note-perfect chard gratins and a New York strip steak that might sound run of the mill yet is anything but, thanks to an aggressive searing and a small lake of butter and beef fat. The beef isn’t French, but the spirit is, and with bistro cuisine the spirit is what matters."
721,LCB Brasserie Rachou,two stars,20040901,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/01/dining/reviews/a-french-classic-in-a-brasseries-hat.html,"WHAT initially drew our attention was the man's anachronistic attire. ""When,"" said one of my friends, ""was the last time you saw a three-piece suit in this city?"" It had indeed been awhile, and this three-piece suit came with a pressed pocket handkerchief and, above that, an aged and familiar face. We checked with a manager to make sure: our neighbor at LCB Brasserie Rachou was a gentleman of a certain repute. ""He's not exactly famous,"" said the manager, smiling a devilish smile. ""He ran Sotheby's. Alfred Taubman."" The manager paused. ""He spent some time in jail,"" he added. ""He had the à la carte menu."" Whatever his regimen, A. Alfred Taubman, 80, who served a brief prison term for fixing art prices, looked none the worse for it. More to the point, he looked at ease and at home in LCB Brasserie Rachou, which opened two and a half months ago where La Côte Basque had closed early this year. For many of the four and half decades of its existence, La Côte Basque functioned as a richly sauced playpen for the rich and naughty, so evocative of money and mischief that it was where Truman Capote set a vicious roman à clef about the venomous ladies who lunch. LCB Brasserie Rachou tries for a more casual mien and contemporary mood, but not too hard. It has the same owner and chef, Jean-Jacques Rachou, who ran La Côte Basque from the late 1970's until the end, which in fact turned out to be a mere pause. It has much of the same clientele. And it has essentially the same classically Manhattan, classically French, eyelifts-meet-escargot soul. On the night we ate near Mr. Taubman, the median age in the restaurant was perhaps 73. The jewelry was gaudy. The air kissing was vigorous. And both the roasted chicken in a creamy morel and Champagne sauce and the roasted, honey-glazed duck in a cherry Grand Marnier sauce were out of this world. They arrived, along with the rest of the entrees, under silver cloches, which were removed in unison only after the plates touched the white-clothed table. Casual? Not really. Contemporary? No. LCB Brasserie Rachou -- the LCB, as you may have guessed, stands for La Côte Basque -- is the Old World in a new guise, an optical illusion of reinvention. In place of La Côte Basque's sea-scene murals are mirrors and more mirrors, polished brass accents and pumpkin-colored paint, all putatively channeling the brash informality of a brasserie. The menu encompasses brasserie staples: cold seafood plates, steak frites, choucroute garni, quiche Lorraine. But that choucroute is $30, which is not an informal price. That steak keeps company on the menu with more elegant variations of beef, like tournedos in a sauce of foie gras and black truffles. The servers now wear long white kitchen aprons, but they still sport bow ties: yellow instead of black. As the French so memorably observed, the more things change, the more they remain the same. And that is not a bad thing, at least not when it comes to this restaurant's almost uniformly terrific entrees. What is heavy can also be heavenly -- French cuisine taught us nothing if not that. That divine duck, appropriately fatty and thrillingly crisp-skinned, called into question all of those excessively trimmed, denatured and neutered slivers of skinless duck breast around town. That roasted chicken, with its luxuriant sauce, triggered a happy head rush. ""You see,"" said one of my friends after she had taken her first bite of it, ""this is why people live in France."" There are additional reasons, and some of them also appeared on our table that night. Surprisingly tender venison medallions -- seared rare, which is the restaurant's recommendation -- were ennobled by an accompanying reduction of crème de cassis. Dover sole meunière was precisely as moist, lemony and buttery as it should be. Other highlights from other visits included those decadent tournedos, a hearty cassoulet and a roasted rack of lamb, seasoned simply with rosemary and thyme. (When the lamb is the light dish, you know you have gone Gallic.) But LCB Brasserie Rachou stumbled repeatedly with its curtain raisers and curtain calls. It should stop trying to amuse anyone's bouche. One night, it started my friends and me with deep-fried seafood croquettes that resembled something from the frozen goods section of the supermarket. Another night, a crab and monkfish mousse tasted precisely like tuna salad with Russian dressing. A seafood salad appetizer that followed had been subjected to the same cloying treatment. A pike quenelle, a fish soup and a slightly under-seasoned steak tartare were all fine but nothing more. A diner should instead opt for the dependable luxury of foie gras, which is dependably good here. It can be ordered seared or in a luscious terrine with a Sauternes gelée. Desserts were also erratic, ranging from phlegmatic (the raspberry tart) to overzealous (a too-sweet crème brûlée) and from deflating (a too-jammy Grand Marnier soufflé) to inspiring (a luscious chocolate mousse). All of these sweets, like so much of the menu, connote tradition and communicate indulgence, which is the lingua franca of this gilded sanctuary. It remains a retreat for the perpetually pampered, a refuge for those with outsize and outlaw appetites. Several diners at one table were allowed to smoke cigarettes late one night. Mr. Taubman was seated front and center, in the middle of the bar area. Martha Stewart, take note and comfort. There is hospitality and an enormously satisfying frisée aux lardons on the far side of white-collar incarceration. LCB Brasserie Rachou  ** [Rating: two stars]  60 West 55th Street; (212) 688-6525.

732,Bar Artisanal,★,20090630,Frank Bruni,TriBeCa,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/01/dining/reviews/01rest.html,"IN case you hadn’t noticed, Terrance Brennan has a thing for cheese. It’s his instrument, his clay, his calcium-rich currency. Uptown, at Picholine, he awes diners with a cheese cart that’s more cheese museum, a whole history and glossary of milky rapture on wheels. In Midtown, at Artisanal, there’s a counter crammed with a pungent world of cheeses, and the path from the kitchen to the dining room is one rushing, endless river of fondue. With the new restaurant Bar Artisanal, positioned and presented as a casual spinoff of Artisanal, Mr. Brennan has made the journey all the way downtown, to TriBeCa, and his cheese, of course, has traveled with him. Much of it is exhibited at a counter not entirely unlike Artisanal’s, but since that’s old hat for him, it’s not the striking part. What’s more arresting, amusing and in many crucial instances rewarding is the way cheese recurs across Bar Artisanal’s menu, dotting and flecking it, like dill or caraway in a wedge of havarti. You can begin your meal with a cheesy overture — gougères or a Roquefort parfait or little hunks of a grilled cheese sandwich or even “cheese tempura” — and would in fact be wise to. You can segue, less wisely, into one of about a half-dozen pissaladières, which are French flatbreads of a sort, notable not so much for their vapid crusts (at least as rendered at Bar Artisanal) as for the showcase they afford mozzarella, gorgonzola and the like. A straight-ahead macaroni and cheese (including Parmesan, Gruyère and Comté) was among the three pasta selections during a recent visit, and the flavor of the dessert panna cotta was ...  cheese. Cheese animates and dominates Bar Artisanal — and helps give it what modest appeal it has. Take away the cheese and what’s left is a calculating, somewhat cynical operation, connected to the Hilton Garden Inn, that’s not all that reflective of Mr. Brennan, who guides but doesn’t actually own it. Bar Artisanal pillages and repackages current trends with astonishing thoroughness, commanding attention for that alone. If restaurants could be preserved in amber and tucked away for future students of gustatory anthropology, this might be the one to save and label, “New York City, circa 2010.” Those students would be instructed to take note of its name, which indulges the current habit of trying to persuade diners that they’re not committing to anything more expensive or involved than a stool and a drink and just a little bit of food — a nibble, really. Many diners want that assurance, and they want those stools, which Bar Artisanal provides: at the bar; at the marble cheese counter, where you can dine before a spread of robiola and Manchego and cured meats; and at several raised tables up front. Deeper into the restaurant, the seating arrangement becomes more conventional. Many diners also want small plates, which limit the amount of money, hope or percentage of their daily caloric allotment they invest in any one dish, and Bar Artisanal adjusts to that. The longest of the main menu’s many categories is titled “petits plats,” and a tiny starter menu that you’re given first is devoted to even smaller plates, also known as snacks, which represent yet another trend. This menu is on a clipboard, and you check off what you want with a stubby pencil. I grew briefly confused about whether I was ordering food or keeping score in miniature golf. Bar Artisanal doesn’t overlook the upscale, inventive hamburger craze: there are three advertised burgers here, of beef and of lamb and of pork belly, though  the last of these doesn’t bring to mind a burger so much as a pork bun, enabling Bar Artisanal to cash in on that culinary obsession as well. The pissaladières, baked in a wood-burning oven, reach out to the ever more rapacious ranks of pizza hounds, while a smattering of raw seafood plates attempts to give the restaurant crudo cred. I expect ramen to show up shortly, and fried chicken soon after that. Best not to leave any fad unfed. Mr. Brennan’s trajectory over recent years is itself a sign of the times, the fancy Picholine begetting the less fancy Artisanal, which has in turn spawned this casual heir. There’s no dish over $20, and there’s a freewheeling atmosphere in the vast, crowded, achingly loud black-and-white-tiled room, a frenzied chessboard for cheeseboards. Bar Artisanal took over the space (and, with relatively minor adjustments, the décor) from the empty, short-lived restaurant Trigo. The instant turnaround  in business suggests that Mr. Brennan’s blend of populism, pandering and pecorino really works, and it reflects the solid track record he’s trading on. It also speaks to scattered instances of fine work by the kitchen, which is under the nightly stewardship of Bradford Thompson, the chef de cuisine. Bar Artisanal’s versions of chickpea fries and steak tartare, the latter given a cheesy accessory of Parmesan toast, were top-notch. Two out of the three times I had the poussin, cooked on a plancha, it was a marvel of tender meat under crisp skin, and the panzanella salad around it turned this entree into the abundant antithesis of a small plate. But on a menu with mostly French leanings (moules frites; white beans with crumbled merguez sausage; Burgundy snails), there were almost as many ordinary dishes and a few out-and-out duds, the overpopulated “duck” pissaladière — with duck gizzard, duck confit, duck liver and a duck egg — foremost among them. If you’re going the pissaladière route, steer toward cheese, like the sheep’s milk ricotta that joined speck and fava-bean pesto atop my favorite one. The cheese panna cotta and other desserts were satisfying but unremarkable. The wine list is longer and more impressive than at many restaurants this informal, with scores of wines by the glass and half-glass. The restaurant promotes flights of wine-cheese pairings by giving them cutesy names (Melange à Trois, for example, or Pandora’s Box) and identifies one whole group of faintly sweet wines as “cheese chums.” But no riesling or chenin blanc could be chummier with cheese than Mr. Brennan. And at a restaurant so intent on cribbing from others, it’s often the absence or presence of cheese in a dish that determines whether it’s tic or treat.

734,Jewel Bako,One Star,20060621,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/21/dining/reviews/a-sushi-pioneer-gets-a-slinky-little-sister.html,"IN its short life under the fidgety rule of Jack Lamb, the space inhabited by the new restaurant Degustation has been repositioned as frequently as a flailing presidential candidate. Little more than a year ago it was Jewel Bako Robata, a Japanese grill named after its nearby sire, Jewel Bako, the sushi sanctuary that put Mr. Lamb and his wife, Grace, on Manhattan's culinary map. That segued quickly into Grace's Kalbi Bar, which pressed the same oversize sushi-bar configuration -- 16 seats at a U-shaped counter around an open kitchen -- into the service of Korean fare. The poll numbers didn't really improve, so a new message was in order. Goodbye, Asia. Hello, Europe. Degustation takes its cues from Spanish cooking as much as anything else, applying new-wave flourishes and a progressive sensibility to a menu of modestly portioned dishes that recall tapas. The quotation marks around the word tortilla in a description of one of those dishes signaled that something sly was afoot: specifically, poached quail eggs and shallot confit inside pockets of thinly sliced potato. Each of these savory bonbons was best consumed in one bite, which set off a gooey eruption. A roast beef sandwich defied its prosaic tag to assume poetic form: a round pedestal of toasted rye bread with a gossamer tangle of rare meat and a verdant headdress of parsley, cilantro, chervil and dill. To the side, in a graceful swish, lay a foie gras mayonnaise. Both dishes spoke to the creativity that coursed through the concise lineup of dishes at Degustation, which deserves a longer tenancy than its predecessors managed. That creativity was tempered: the 26-year-old chef, Wesley Genovart, a Spaniard who worked at Perry St., knows how to surprise without shocking and make bold impressions while still making sense. For a surf and turf of a different order, he stuffed a bulbous cylinder of grilled squid with braised short ribs, their lusciousness thrown into relief by their firm, bouncy vessel. A salty pile of lentils studded with chorizo and bits of blood sausage rounded out the plate. A seared pair of plump scallops rode a magical carpet with colorful threads of sweetness (wedges of orange), tartness (grapefruit and lemon) and heat (a jalapeño emulsion). Caramelized wedges of grapefruit were unexpected but prudent companions for seared foie gras, whose richness they eloquently offset. The overall experience is idiosyncratic, requiring several caveats. You should not visit Degustation in a group larger than two, because the side-by-side seating would make conversation awkward. You should not go if you're keen on desserts, because Degustation doesn't excel at them. You can easily spend $40 or more to assemble enough modestly priced dishes -- maybe four, maybe even five -- to fill you. And if your reserved seat isn't ready, there's nowhere comfortable to wait. But the peculiarities come with payoffs that suit the temperaments of today's food lovers, who are increasingly interested not only in the pleasure of a meal but also in the process behind it -- who want to be closer to the culinary sorcery, not to mention the sorcerer. Like the great chef Joël Robuchon's multiplying Atelier restaurants, Degustation puts them there, permitting scrutiny of how and when Mr. Genovart and his assistants employ various parts of the compressed kitchen. A plancha is used for shrimp. A gas grill is used for crispy-skin mackerel, served with a fennel and chorizo purée. (Mr. Genovart is big on emulsions and purées, none of which feel tangential or superfluous.) A sous vide bath is used for halibut, placed over red peppers and chorizo and encircled by parsley and garlic oil. And all the while conventional dining yields to a ceremony more adventurous, in some ways more intimate, and laden with intensely pleasurable moments. It's not right for everyone or every occasion, but a restaurant doesn't have to be. Degustation is connected to Jewel Bako, which doubled in size about a year and a half ago, claiming the property that once separated the two spaces and fortifying the Lambs' East Village empire. (They also own Jack's Luxury Oyster Bar and Jewel Bako Makimono.) But while Degustation is carving a distinctive niche, Jewel Bako belongs to a genre more familiar and competitive now than it was in 2001, when the restaurant opened. The number of restaurants serving topnotch sushi and sashimi with the fruits of distant seas has grown large enough that it's easy to imagine Boeing 727's crammed with flying fish, the bluefin tuna up in first class, the mackerel in business, the sardines in coach. It's no longer easy for any one of these restaurants to stand out. In small ways Jewel Bako does. The breadth of its selection -- about three dozen kinds of sushi and sashimi -- remains remarkable. It has wisely resisted any temptation to serve overstuffed, kaleidoscopic sushi rolls. And a few pieces of its sushi -- pike eel with a dab of pickled plum, chopped jack mackerel with baby ginger, scallions and shiso -- are noteworthy. But on recent visits there were too few instances of extreme sushi bliss, even during a $95 omakase menu, even from such usual standouts as o-toro, which had unpleasantly ropy veins, and uni, which was unusually grainy. Among several disappointing appetizers, a wedge of salmon and a scallop were seriously overcooked. The arched, slatted canopies above the tables -- they look like the rib cages of prehistoric beasts -- are as visually amusing as ever. But those tables are tightly packed, the lighting isn't particularly soothing and service can be sluggish, making the prices, lower than at other serious sushi temples, seem less a bargain than a fair enough deal. Eating next door isn't cheaper. But it's actually more comfortable, and it's definitely more exciting. Jewel Bako  * [Rating: One Star]  239 East Fifth Street (Second Avenue), East Village; (212) 979-1012.

736,Except,One Star,20050817,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/17/dining/reviews/the-rich-dished-up-to-the-famous.html,"DURING one of my visits to Bette, a preserve for beautiful people that also happens to serve food, something strange occurred. Something unthinkable. Something that rattled my most fervent convictions about the place and challenged its very calling. I did not spot a single celebrity. Not a singer or an actor. Not a model or even a television news correspondent. I looked and looked -- because I had homed in on Tori Spelling during a previous visit, espied Robert Downey Jr. another night and fielded reports of a Nicole Kidman sighting. But this time: nothing. Except ""Him!"" said a friend in town from Washington, her newly gleaming eyes focused on a nearby banquette. ""Doesn't he look familiar?"" He was gorgeous, well dressed, well hydrated. ""He's somebody,"" I said, trying to be convinced. ""Definitely,"" said my friend, trying harder. But then we noticed that he was assessing other tables even more closely than we were his. The people at those other tables were, in turn, doing their own wishful reconnaissance. In this daisy chain of dauntless gawking, necks craned violently and heads swiveled abruptly. Was Bette a restaurant, or a cunning plot by business-hungry chiropractors? It's an enterprise by Amy Sacco, which means it's an exercise in mass vanity and mutually assured voyeurism: that is, a beloved Manhattan ritual and a guaranteed good time. Ms. Sacco honed a knack for netting stars and their parasites at the lounges Lot 61 and Bungalow 8. At Bette (the name rhymes with confetti and refers to her mom) she adds calories to the mix, garnishing her formula with pasta, steak tartare, beef short ribs and baked Alaska. The results sometimes seem like a cognitively dissonant test of dietary will. Much of Bette's menu is devoted to the kind of hearty food -- crispy chicken liver dumplings, five-cheese ravioli -- that is least likely to be tolerated by the Pilates-toned sashimi set. And the single most addictive item on the menu -- thin, crunchy, salty French fries tossed with white truffle oil -- might as well be served with a pamphlet on liposuction. Then again, Bette is a jumble of paradoxes. Although it pivots on an air of exclusivity, it actually renders itself accessible. It begins booking a given night one week in advance -- as opposed to the standard one month -- and that unexpected measure of time seems to have translated into more ease in getting a table here than at Nobu 57, say, or La Esquina. And when you call you encounter something other than unadulterated attitude. Like humor. ""You have to bear with me,"" said a man who answered one day. ""One reservationist is home sick. The other reservationist is home sick. The other reservationist is home sick. And the other reservationist had to stay home to make a dress."" ""A girl's got to sew,"" I said. ""It's the best of the four excuses,"" he agreed. Although Bette is a place for the here and now, it feels old-fashioned, from its menu of featured cocktails, including a sidecar and a grasshopper, to its gorgeous crystal Art Decoesque lighting fixtures. They gussy up a main dining room, a mezzanine and a bar area separated by smoked glass partitions that teasingly allow you a vague sense, but not really a clear glimpse, of people on the other side, piquing your hunger to see more. They're visual aperitifs. And although Bette clearly means to make a splash, its food isn't remotely splashy. Lobster gazpacho was precisely that: a bowl of fairly ordinary gazpacho with ribbons of white flesh atop it. A wedge of iceberg lettuce with Roquefort dressing hewed to classic and classically unadorned form. Grilled chicken was seasoned simply with thyme. Sure, the chef, Tom Dimarzo, trotted out the white truffle oil, sparingly and successfully in the case of those fries, much less so in the case of a green bean salad, which was overwhelmed and essentially nullified by it. Morels paraded across a sublime fillet of poached cod. Caviar made a cameo, joining smoked salmon and crème fraîche in a satisfying tangle of pasta alla chitarra. But those flourishes of luxury aren't exactly flights of culinary fancy. Depending on your mood or perspective, the cooking at Bette is either refreshingly straightforward or stunningly unimaginative. There are fleeting moments of craftiness, like an appetizer of chilled grilled shrimp, given a zesty dusting of paprika, Parmesan and chili powder and married to a cocktail sauce with a twist: sun-dried tomato pesto. But the lemon vinaigrette that anointed pan-roasted salmon carried the kind of mustardy charge that salmon has received a gazillion times before, and the basil and capers that hugged seared tuna weren't unfamiliar bedfellows. When Bette errs, it's in the direction of blandness, typified by its black bass, red snapper and lobster spaghetti, all uneventfully seasoned and none featuring flesh so sublime that it cried out to be left alone. In continued defiance of its svelte clientele, Bette excels at desserts: that baked Alaska, a cloud of crisp-edged meringue around strawberry gelato; a goat cheese cake with lavender; chocolate pudding that tastes like a consecrated Snack Pack, which is a very blessed thing. In better keeping with its patrons' predilections, Bette has an interesting wine list, on which I found one of my favorite reds, a Domaine Le Briseau made from a low-profile grape, pineau d'Aunis. It's a slightly fizzy wine with a Red Zinger-like zip. But Bette's distinction comes not from what's in the glass or on the plate as from who's sipping and supping (or at least pretending to sup). Even when there are no celebrities around, there are plenty of comely people who could pass for them. In a recent New York magazine cover story on the city's most beautiful denizens, the phrase ""spotted at Bette"" appeared under more than a few of the featured faces. That's what you do at Bette: doggedly spot or angle coyly to be spotted. If you're among the spotters, you're luckier, because you've got more dietary wiggle room for those truffled fries. Bette  * [Rating: One Star]  461 West 23rd Street, Chelsea; (212)366-0404.

760,a 18,One Star,20051221,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/21/dining/reviews/tapas-with-a-disco-beat.html,"YOU walk in, confront a tangle of diners around the host's station, slalom through the bodies to get to your table, and think: Got it. The crowd, chaos and cocktails are the point of Barça 18. The food won't be. Then the tapas begin to come. Big surprise. There's thin, crispy, flaky flat bread -- not quite pizza, not quite pastry -- with sweet ribbons of supple shellfish and a perfectly measured coating of aioli. Lobster and mayo with a crunchy frame instead of a heavy roll: Is this genius or what? Four pieces must be divided three ways. You've seen friendships sundered by lesser hardships. There's a triangular wedge of a Spanish-style omelet, oily to a pleasant degree, dense but not rigid, with an immensely flavorful mix of asparagus, blood sausage, black olives and Manchego cheese. This food is fantastic. You were dead wrong about Barça 18. Except you weren't. The music swells, ominously and monotonously: thump, thump, thump. You survey the generically vast, dark and glossy room and half expect to see a mirrored ball dangling from the ceiling. Is this a disco inferno? And is the hellfire lapping at the entrees? Three of them arrive, and all are overcooked: the chicken by a little, the swordfish by more, the bony rabbit by a whole lot. It's what can happen when a kitchen is rigged for volume. Churn, baby, churn. Barça 18 is a restaurant at war with itself. It wants respect. It also wants hordes of preening young professionals fresh from the office and deep into their stubborn ""Sex and the City"" fantasies. And the mixed signals it sends are matched by the uneven experiences you have, as the exceptional jousts with the banal and one night's appealing paella yields to another night's ordinary one. The explanation for that unevenness may lie in the oddness of the couple who spawned Barça 18: the restaurateur Stephen Hanson, who bankrolled it, and the chef Eric Ripert, who clambered down from the tower of Le Bernardin to develop the menu and tutor the kitchen staff. Mr. Hanson is practiced at identifying countries with fetching culinary traditions and giving their food, or Americanized versions of it, large, loud, flashy Manhattan showcases. He did that with China (Ruby Foo's), Mexico (Dos Caminos) and Italy (Vento Trattoria). Spain was a logical next step, given the American food elite's current fascination with it and the way its culture of tapas dovetails with New Yorkers' affinity for grazing. Mr. Hanson named the restaurant after the city of Barcelona and the closest cross street. He remodeled the old Park Avalon space. He brought Mr. Ripert in as a partner and hired Brian O'Donohoe, who was Mr. Ripert's sous-chef at Le Bernardin, as the executive chef. The remodeling didn't go far enough. Although enormous rectangular lighting fixtures with candle-like bulbs and matte golden shades seem intended to add notes of rusticity, the graft didn't take. The recruitment of Mr. Ripert, a strategy previously employed by the Japanese restaurant Geisha, is like the casting of Vanessa Redgrave in the first ""Mission: Impossible"" movie -- a nod toward artistry, a stab at extra class. But it doesn't change the essential nature of the project. The servers dress in black, including -- egad -- turtlenecks. They tend to speak in the first person plural (""Are we finished with the bread?""). The food runners pause in confusion as they hesitate to ask (but then go ahead and do) who gets which dish, and they seem constantly to be warning of superhot plates. Barça 18 is a second-degree burn waiting to happen. It also produces occasionally dreamy food. That pizza-like lobster dish, called a coca, was a special, but the regular menu had a similar, and similarly terrific, coca with salt cod. Fried potatoes had two sauces, a spicy one with paprika and a cool mayonnaise. Each toyed with, and tamed, the other. These dishes were among about 10 hot tapas on the dinner menu, including croquettes of potato and (barely discernible) ham; fried calamari; salt cod fritters with yet another aioli; and a delicate, intriguing lobster and shrimp soup, bathed tableside in a sherry-infused broth, that seems to belong to another restaurant (maybe Le Bernardin). Barça 18 has almost as many cold tapas, the best of which was that omelet. A shrimp salad with blood orange, capers and watercress delightfully balanced sweet, salty and acidic elements. Another standout: thin, dime-size slices of tender octopus with a confit of sweet peppers. As with so many restaurants, Barça 18 hits more troubled terrain as it turns toward entrees. It has three versions of paella, and while the two straightforward ones worked, the third, made with squid ink, had an utterly vague flavor. Rosemary-scented halibut and striped bass with almonds and a sherry emulsion bore the imprint of Le Bernardin, their flavors nuanced, their textures moist. But that swordfish, with a hood of tomatoes and chorizo, swam in a lesser sea. Braised short ribs and filet mignon were fine and dandy, but no restaurant these days can wring too much distinction from short ribs and filet mignon. (Possible exception: Café Gray, but those are some phenomenal short ribs.) And the desserts included more flops than hits. A warm baked apple was hard and hard to eat -- a pie that never happened; cobbler interruptus. A version of crema catalana, with vanilla foam, vanilla ice cream and caramel, was unbearably sweet. You start a meal at Barça 18 with cause for happiness, at least once you've learned to tune out the jangled cosmos around you. You finish in a state of mild befuddlement. You ultimately don't know what to make of it. Maybe that's because it doesn't know what to make of itself. Barça 18  * [Rating: One Star]  225 Park Avenue South (18th Street); (212) 533-2500.

769,Romera New York,★,20120117,Pete Wells,Chelsea,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/dining/reviews/romera-new-york-nyc-review.html,"THE first thing I ate at Romera New York was a jam of black olives and tomatoes. Sticky, sweet and salty, it made a fine spread for the warm roll that came with it, and it was just as appealing eaten with a spoon. At the rim of the plate were three stripes of green, gold and red, each smaller than a grain of rice and arranged like the flag of Bolivia. I eventually decided the flag had to be a garnish and ate it. Raw bell peppers. Their grassy flavor clashed with the jam. When the next plate arrived, again bearing three filaments of raw pepper, I asked a server about it. “That’s the chef’s little signature,” she said. “Like an artist would sign his paintings.” By the end of my meal, the flag that was both a garnish and a little signature also became an emblem, one that stood for the larger problem posed by Romera New York. A restaurant willing to send out a garnish meant to be interpreted rather than eaten is a restaurant that wants to be admired, not enjoyed. Without question there is much to admire about Dr. Miguel Sánchez Romera, the chef who signed that plate and founded this restaurant. Dr. Romera is a neurologist who took up cooking as a hobby. It grew into a passion so powerful that, without ever having studied in a culinary school or a professional kitchen, he opened a restaurant in Barcelona, L’Esguard. While the rising tide of Spanish gastronomy no doubt lifted Dr. Romera’s boat, he set himself apart. He opposed some of the chemicals being explored in places such as El Bulli, saying that for a doctor to use such synthetic ingredients would be a violation of the Hippocratic oath. Instead, he championed a cassava-based stabilizer that he called Micri. He studied the brain’s interaction with the stomach, which led to another innovation, gastronomic waters, a kind of broth that he claims produces a feeling of fullness to prevent overindulgence during his long multicourse tasting menus. There’s a lot to admire, too, about Romera New York, the restaurant he founded this fall in the Dream Downtown hotel on West 16th Street. Designed by the architect Glen Coben, it is a fluid composition of glass, steel and wood, with living plants, pools of smooth black stones and serpentine curtains of rippling white fabric. It has to be the brightest and airiest restaurant anyone has ever built in a basement. In the kitchen, there is a devotion to doing things the hard way that can make the D.I.Y. fetishists of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, look like Sandra Lee. Coffee beans are roasted in house, and so, even more remarkably, are the cacao beans that Dr. Romera buys from Chiapas, Mexico, and then painstakingly turns into glossy, satiny tablets of dark chocolate that come with the petits fours. And there are the dishes that precede the chocolate, 11 in all if you choose the full $245 tasting menu. Dr. Romera’s plates have a visual style all their own, painterly and handmade. Subtle compositions like a glistening scallop in a shallow pool of unsweetened white chocolate sauce invite quiet contemplation. In a city where not just the restaurants but the cooking are often clamorous, this is food that whispers. Can you tell which marinated salmon egg tastes like soy and which like beets? Is there really cinnamon in the caviar dish? If you give yourself over to the experience, a meal at Romera can refresh your perspective on what’s in front of you, one of the gifts of art. Yet as much as you might admire Dr. Romera, you can’t help feeling that you will never be able to admire him quite as much as you’re supposed to. Upon arrival, you are shown to a waiting room and invited to peruse Dr. Romera’s collection of books about cooking, art and neuroscience. Shipped from Spain, the library may be the first one where “Fat Detection: Taste, Texture and Post Ingestive Effects” is shelved right between Bocuse and Escoffier. Reading matter is provided in the restrooms and on the front staircase, too, which are inscribed with quotations from Dr. Romera like “I am a doctor who cooks, not a cook who doctors food.” The menu also makes references to the doctor’s ideas. Two dishes come on plates in which powdered spices or vegetables have been applied in a tight geometric grid; these are called Romerian mosaics. This wouldn’t be any more becoming if the chef in question were a globally recognized master, but you might grit your teeth and indulge it as one of the prices you pay for magnificent cooking. But to eat at Romera New York is to be told repeatedly that you are in the presence of greatness, while the evidence of your senses tells you that you are in the presence of, at best, okayness. If all went well and the plates hadn’t cooled too much on their short trip from the kitchen, a recurring problem, the food at Romera could be rather pleasant. But it was not pleasurable, in the deep and memorable way that makes you want to book your next reservation and tell your friends. I could never convince myself that the white chocolate brought anything more to the scallop than a sticky blandness. Tiny swirls of vegetable purées in that sauce contributed more color than flavor. Beet juice lent salmon the deep crimson of Chinese lacquer; orange peel and bay leaves infused its marinade. But none of the seasonings could make this fish taste like wild salmon; it never lost the listless texture and flavor of fish raised on a farm. As a place charging this kind of money must, apparently, Romera New York arms its tasting menu with caviar, foie gras and truffles. I’d gladly have traded all of them for carrots and beets that tasted like carrots and beets, instead of the washed-out facsimiles that appeared with one of the Romerian mosaics. The same dish featured raw spinach coated in a yellowish goop of cassava and a slowly creeping sludge of lukewarm vegetable broth. I never finished that dish, not once in three attempts. There was one night when nearly everything was tepid and much of it went back to the kitchen only half eaten. Nobody seemed to care or even notice. The show was in progress, and it wasn’t going to be stopped by the reactions of mere customers."
771,The Oak Room,★,20090203,Frank Bruni,Midtown,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/04/dining/reviews/04rest.html,"DINNER at the Plaza: could any of New York City’s grand promises sound more elegant, timeless and deliciously grown-up? Just say those words and you can see the bubbles in a Champagne glass, hear the tinkling of piano music. You’ll wear a jacket, even if the restaurant does not require it. Tradition and history do. Dinner at the Plaza: it’s a dance into the past, a waltz with legend. Opened more than a century ago, the Plaza was mythic even before Eloise was tucked into it, a pint-size princess tormenting the knights and knaves in Midtown’s unofficial castle. There’s a reason no one speaks of Eloise at the Best Western. Her adventures  required a setting more gilded and storied than that. Dinner at the Plaza: it’s a plausible scenario and sensible option for the first time in a long time. After many years in which the hotel (now a condominium residence, too) lacked a restaurant of real ambition and achievement, its magisterial Oak Room reopened nearly three months ago with the clear intention of being more than just a tarted-up trough for wealthy tourists or a catered diorama of old New York. It has been meticulously and gorgeously restored. An acclaimed French-born chef was recruited to supervise the kitchen. And those developments combined, on the best of the nights when I dined there, to produce a lovely experience of a rarefied sort. My fork sank into tender venison in a classically dark, rich, winy sauce as my eyes traveled up, up, up the sculptured oak walls toward a ceiling more than two stories high. That ceiling was framed by yard upon yard of gold molding and trim. If heaven is wood-paneled, it probably looks something like this. But on other nights I had meals stippled with disappointment. More than a few dishes were clumsily executed or vacuously luxurious. Seldom have I had so many black truffle shavings thrown at me to so little effect. The prices aren’t crazy in the context of such truffling and trappings; in fact, they’re reportedly 25 percent lower than they were slated to be back in the early fall, before the economy deteriorated further. But they remain steep enough  — $34 for cod, $44 for a  double-cut  pork chop  — to build expectations for meals more seamless than the ones I had. I’d recommend the Oak Room for anyone intent on an inimitable atmosphere and  a baronial sense of splurge and who is  willing to risk a forgettable, or even frustrating, meal. (Jackets, by the way, aren’t required but are “definitely preferred,” as a reservationist told me.) There’s the chance of a fine time. There’s a first-rate wine list, put together by Joshua Nadel, who worked at Veritas and Cru, with accessibly priced bottles showcased right up front, where you can’t miss them. And there’s aptly pampering service, including the brisk delivery of dinner rolls whose gamut of temperatures ran from very warm to piping hot. Merely toasty or cool were clearly not countenanced. But for anyone seeking relatively firm assurance that a serious tab will mean serious pleasure, the Oak Room won’t do. It’s more looker than performer. Restoration of this landmark space was mostly confined, by law and logic, to scrubbing and burnishing, so everything shines and the western wall’s frescolike paintings of splendid, spooky hilltop castles are as vivid as ever. But there are also new accents and furnishings, including shimmering lights and plush chairs with bold, wavy stripes. It’s all very Versace-goes-to-Oxford, or maybe to Hogwarts. The menu is somewhat odd, mingling hokey and cheeky, true-blue upscale and  make-believe downscale. Appetizers of chicken noodle soup (precisely that, and vapid) and chicken wings (boneless, splashed with foie gras sauce and accessorized with truffle slices) keep company with a classic entree of beef tenderloin Rossini. The dessert list makes room for both crêpe suzette and carrot cake (of a sort). The  chef, Joël Antunès, seems intent on some middle ground between reverence and mischief, and brings considerable training and experience to the task. His cooking at the  Atlanta restaurant Joël won him wide regard. He brings skill, too; evident in an excellent appetizer of hamachi ceviche with bright, lively currents of pineapple, avocado, rosemary and lime, and in an entree of duck à l’orange for a new era, with a kumquat chutney carrying much of the sweet, citrusy load. The tenderness of the venison was echoed in roasted lamb tenderloin, beautifully presented as rounded columns of meat. But there were letdowns, huge and many. Thanks to overcooked pasta, a lasagna appetizer with a sunchoke purée degenerated into mush  — and pricey mush at that. It was $58, reflecting a bevy of black truffles. But the truffles in this dish, and in many others, had little taste. The  salmon in another appetizer was frigid and hard, and the fish’s flavor was lost among  a literal blizzard of effects, including mustard ice cream. An entree of baked turbot was over-sauced and the pork chop was seriously overcooked, a tough, juiceless mountain of meat. My companions and I didn’t bother to summit it. On that night we enjoyed fewer than half of our dishes, at least until dessert, when our spirits were lifted by the pastry chef Eric Snow’s creamy, intense chocolate mousse and the carrot cake  — served, ingeniously, with gingerbread ice cream and an outstanding, cream-cheese-flavored mousse of its own. The Oak Room isn’t particularly lively, but the Oak Bar, with windows onto Central Park, is. It alone serves food during the day: a $26 burger whose condiment of “tomato confit” was more cloying and intrusive than ketchup; a terrific lobster Cobb salad with enough sweet, supple shellfish to justify its $28 price. But that was lunch at the Plaza. Dinner at the Plaza was what quickened  my pulse, and what didn’t manage to be as joyous in the eating as in the imagining.

786,Botequim,★★,20141223,Pete Wells,Greenwich Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/dining/restaurant-review-botequim-in-the-east-village.html,"Restaurants hide in all kinds of ways. There is the coy, unmarked-door hiding of the neo-speakeasy. There is the romantic hiding of restaurants whose positioning at, say, the end of an alley allows men to seem clever and their dates to seem impressed. There is the snooty hiding of exclusive restaurants that behave like private clubs, an affectation that is going out of style and won’t be missed. Then there is Botequim, a fine new Brazilian restaurant that seems to have been hidden away against its will in the basement of a hotel on Fourth Avenue.  You descend to Botequim in one of two ways. The first is weird. You walk into the Fourth, the street-level all-day restaurant of the Hyatt Union Square New York, past disoriented travelers at the bar, and take the stairs that unwind beneath a dangling helix of children’s beds suspended from the ceiling. The second is weirder. You open a glass door on Fourth Avenue that says Botequim — so far, so good — and descend a staircase that deposits you in a backstage area between the kitchen and the dining room. Taking this route one night, I landed in the middle of a hushed, tense conference between two employees, who fell silent when they saw me. I felt like Lord Grantham stumbling upon a downstairs bitchfest. The hotel’s efforts to keep Botequim out of sight since its September opening may account for the half-full dining room. Once you make it inside, though, things quickly start to look up. Graffiti-style murals zigzag across the walls, samba rhythms ripple all night long, and a glass of cachaça is never more than a few minutes away; the bartenders upstairs will shake it with muddled lime hulls for a classic caipirinha or stir it with a cube of frozen coconut water, a stupefyingly simple drink that I will be copying at home next summer. Most of all, Botequim has Brazilian food, under the direction of the chef Marco Moreira, that is too good to be trapped in a basement.  To start, have a few globes of pão de queijo, Brazilian cheese puffs that are something like gougères crossed with mochi. Springy and lightly chewy from tapioca flour, they are delicious eaten in alternating bites with toothpick-speared lengths of grilled calabresa sausage, spicy and tinged with garlic. Or with a plate of pastelzinhos, wonderfully crisp turnovers whose thin pastry shells are not even a little bit doughy. Some are filled with cubes of unmelted cheese from the state of Minas Gerais, and you may need to come from there yourself to appreciate its squeaky blandness. But the pastelzinhos holding ground beef with tomatoes and olives are instantly lovable. So are the rough and flaky fried croquettes of salt cod, light but not insubstantial. They come with a lemon emulsion, which is to be ignored in favor of a few potent drops of the bright-red hot sauce made on site. It’s terrific stuff. The main courses make it obvious, if it wasn’t already, that Botequim’s kitchen cooks with far more finesse than the remaining restaurants of Manhattan’s Little Brazil or the outposts of those all-the-grilled-meat-you-can-eat chains that turn up every few years and are never as much fun as they sound. Mr. Moreira, who with his wife and business partner, Jo-Ann Makovitzky, owns Botequim along with Tocqueville and 15 East, was raised in São Paulo. The kitchen is in the hands of Jason Hall, his chef de cuisine, but you can tell that Mr. Moreira put considerable care into the recipes. He may have lightened some of Brazil’s more bruisingly rich dishes, but he kept the flavors true. Botequim’s cube of suckling pig plays a recurring role in one of my hungry daydreams, in which I break the thin roof of crackling skin into chips to scoop up swirls of lime-brightened pork, soft enough to serve as a dip. In other idle moments between meals, I flash back to the short rib, roasted in extremely slow motion until a dark and satisfying crust wraps around woozily tender meat. It’s like smokeless barbecue, and once I had tried it, I stopped flashing back to Botequim’s roasted top sirloin, called the Brazilian, a fine steak but ultimately just a steak. My private visions of moqueca may feature a more varied mix of seafood than black sea bass and a single prawn. But the coconut-tomato broth in this Bahian stew would taste a lot like Botequim’s, with every mouthful slicked by a palpable slug of red dendê oil. And when I imagine feijoada, it looks the way it did my first night at Botequim, when it was loaded with smoked pork and sausages and the black beans tasted as if they, too, were on the verge of turning into meat. On a second try, it was more soup than stew, and the beans tasted like beans. Maybe it was just the luck of the ladle. The high point of dessert was always a tres leches-style coconut cake grandly slouching under the weight of all the milk and cream it had soaked up. When I tried anything else, the meal never ended as well. Sonhos, the doughnut holes whose name means “dreams” in Portuguese, had an undreamlike heaviness, though a quick dunk in guava sauce helped. For reasons I can’t imagine, the rice pudding, which was allegedly made with bananas and passion fruit, tasted like stewed onions. And my coffee, which seemed like a sure thing in a Brazilian restaurant, was awful, a thin and watery broth. If you want a drink with dessert, try some sherry from Roger Dagorn’s list, which is strong in all departments, down to the rarely seen Brazilian beers. But weak coffee and iffy desserts can be fixed; they’re no reason to hide Botequim away from people looking for dinner along Fourth Avenue. Mr. Moreira and Ms. Makovitzky also operate the Fourth and a whiskey and wine bar called Singl, both on the street level. I don’t know anything about the hotel business; if I did, maybe I’d understand why hotels have such strange ideas about spelling. But a bar seems like a natural inhabitant for a snug room in the basement. My message to Mr. Moreira: Set the moqueca free! Let the cod fritters come upstairs!"
787,El Rey Coffee Bar & Luncheonette,★,20150728,Pete Wells,Lower East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/dining/restaurant-review-el-rey-coffee-bar-luncheonette-on-the-lower-east-side.html,"Just after I accepted the fact that I was in love with a dish called vegan chicharrones locos, a phrase from Freud ran through my head. The phrase was “the return of the repressed,” and it seemed relevant, somehow, to these fried squares of puffed wheat at El Rey Coffee Bar & Luncheonette on the Lower East Side. Porkless chicharrones would have struck me as sacrilegious a few years ago. At the time, I was busily cheering on the new cult of animal-flesh worship that was burying the joyless orthodoxy of the low-fat diet beneath slabs of pork belly. White meat, steamed vegetables and olive oil were elbowed aside to make room for chicken liver toasts, marrow bones and whipped lard. Chefs and avid eaters scorned anything that might qualify as health food, which by the standards of the time included any vegetable cooked without bacon. But as Freud knew, repressed urges find ways of bobbing to the surface again. Last decade, the return of the repressed looked like an entire pork shoulder torn apart by people who would leave the table with the glazed look of an anaconda that happened across a slow-moving deer. In this decade, it looks like puffed brown rice with raw cauliflower pebbles and kale at Sqirl in Los Angeles. It looks like an Allen Street marquee of Times Square dimensions screaming DIRT CANDY above Amanda Cohen’s vegetable circus-slash-restaurant. It looks like chia pudding with hemp at Dimes on Canal Street, where they put wheat grass in their margaritas. And it looks like vegan chicharrones locos at El Rey. The dish turns a Mexican street snack, chicharrones de harina, into a salad, and turns salad into an event. These mock pork skins are tossed with mint and sticks of raw jicama in a bowl, the vessel of choice for return-of-the-repressed dishes across the country. They are dusted with smoldering Aleppo pepper and lemony ground sumac, strafed by a terrific hot sauce of chiles and pickled pineapple and mellowed with a nondairy cashew cream. Nicholas Morgenstern, the proprietor of GG’s and Morgenstern’s Finest Ice Cream, opened El Rey in 2013 with little more than an espresso machine and some shelves of pastries baked by Gerardo Gonzalez. Luncheonette was appended to the name when Mr. Gonzalez was promoted to chef a few months later. When El Rey was reviewed by Ligaya Mishan in a Hungry City column the following year, it served breakfast and lunch. Friends I trusted kept telling me that I needed to check it out. They said things like “the food is exactly what I feel like eating.” They renewed their calls after February, when the dinner menu sprouted up. All these friends were women, and when I finally took their advice, I noticed that in the dining room, men were always outnumbered by women (they had yoga stomachs, quick eyes and nails as colorful and glossy as a Mini Cooper on the dealer’s lot). I wouldn’t read too much into this observation, but it seems worth mentioning because the voices that brayed most loudly about the virtues of animal fat tended to be male. The pieces of this tiny restaurant fit together like an empty wallet and a new $20 bill. Two high tables are each surrounded by four metal stools. A few more seats crouch beneath a counter that looks onto Stanton Street, and three more face an area the size of a bathtub with a single induction burner. This passes for the kitchen. Neon script on the back wall spells the restaurant’s name in swimming-pool blue. The service is California chill. Ordering is uncomplicated. El Rey has few of the comforts of a larger, more elaborate restaurant, but none of the discomforts, either. Mr. Gonzalez is a native of San Diego. In his short time at El Rey, he has worked out a point of view in the kitchen that is distinctly his own, a blend of California-Mexican cuisine with some of the less punitive flavors from the health-food and vegan disciplines. In these tight quarters, his menu necessarily favors assemblage over cooking, by which I mean dinner will probably feature at least one salad. There is chopped kale that tastes brighter and more refreshing than the routine version. The shaved cauliflower number sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds has more surprises; it softens and picks up flavor as it soaks up the chickpea-tahini vinaigrette and the yolk of a poached egg. Other dishes have more ballast, but nothing will make you feel like an anaconda. Warm, marinated chorizo is essentially a tapas portion with something extra: chopped hazelnuts and threads of orange zest. Octopus, sliced dime-thin and marinated, Cuban style, is mixed with chopped hominy and tomatillo; it sits on white beans that have been puréed with squid ink, garlic oil and black garlic. I was still wondering if I’d ever tasted white beans put to such interesting use as I scraped the last smudges from the plate. Mr. Gonzalez has devised a winning, original tostada: shaved carrots and smoked sardines on a crackerlike corn tortilla on which whipped butter and thick yogurt are spread. Butter and sardines are longtime dance partners, but what sends them trotting off in new directions is the salsa verde of carrot greens. The kitchen has limitations, and not all of them can be blamed on lack of space. The brief menu reaches for the crunch factor of nuts a little too often. Should you eat the papas bravas the same night as the chicharrones locos, you may wish they did not both depend on the pineapple hot sauce and the cashew cream. But if you have them on their own, the crisp skins of little blue potatoes knocking up against pickled chunks of pineapple, you’ll simply wish you had more. To drink, you may have a good oddball wine, or a twist on the michelada rimmed with Aleppo pepper, or white sangria turned green by shiso and cucumber, which gives you the pleasant illusion that you are fortifying your body with nutritious juices and not just knocking back one glass of wine after another. At the end of dinner, there is usually a single dessert in addition to whatever pastries the daytime crowd didn’t make off with. One sultry May night, Mr. Gonzalez had carved up buttery lobes of Champagne mango, spooned mango pickle sauce on top and scooped some mango-passion fruit sorbet on the side. It was exactly what I felt like eating."
791,Bar Americain,Two Stars,20050622,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/22/dining/reviews/not-the-place-to-wear-hot-pink.html,"NEW YORKERS have seen many a thoughtfully designed restaurant, but I'm not sure we've yet seen one where the décor and food are as color-coordinated as at Bar Americain, which finds a union of palette and palate in one bright hue. The lights glow orange. The walls are painted orange. The leather that upholsters some of the seats is orange -- or, to be accurate, caramel, which is just orange in a retiring, pensive mood. And orange or near-orange pops up repeatedly in dishes: cubes of mango in a crab cocktail, a purée of sweet potatoes in a reinterpreted clam chowder, pearls of roe amid a smoked trout salad, a roasted red pepper mayonnaise for the fries. As I dressed for one of my visits here, I found myself putting on the sole orange button-down in my closet. I figured that if the restaurant's chef, Bobby Flay, and designer, David Rockwell, were going this far with chromatic integration, I should do my part. Orange turns out to be more than an omnipresent detail or a curious conceit. It's a key to the sunny soul of Bar Americain and to the unsubtle, upbeat spirit of Mr. Flay's cooking here. As Bar Americain presents and riffs on what it sees as American classics and classically American ingredients -- the barbecued pork inside orange-tinged squash blossoms; the faintly orange grits beside sautéed shrimp -- it strives for and achieves warm, festive, accessible effects. Let other restaurants do pork three ways. This one does it as a hefty, juicy chop with an apple ginger chutney and creamed corn. Let other restaurants dress their fish in minimalist attire. This one drapes its moist red snapper in avocado and mango and its crispy skate in a hailstorm of capers and a blanket of smoked chipotle butter, whose color you will never, ever guess. It's been nearly a dozen years since Mr. Flay, 40, opened a new restaurant in New York, a span of time during which he morphed from acclaimed cook to cottage industry, tracing and acing the modern arc of the celebrity chef. He has books galore, bottled sauces aplenty, television gigs and the requisite presence in Las Vegas, where he recently established an outpost of Mesa Grill, the Southwestern-cuisine whirligig that set him on his heady trajectory. At this juncture Mr. Flay had two options. Like Julia Roberts in ""Closer,"" he could choose a nuanced vehicle, challenge his image and assert the existence of an underappreciated aesthete beneath the megawatt luster. Or he could go with the flow and try to pack people in. He chose the latter, a course pretty much set by the scale and location of Bar Americain, which inherited the space from Judson Grill. To fill some 200 seats in an area of Midtown rife with office towers and mammoth hotels, this restaurant has to please a diverse crowd: business people at lunchtime, tourists before their 8 p.m. curtain, scene-sniffing carbophobes later at night. Mr. Rockwell has provided a crucial assist. By placing a carved wood screen just inside the entrance of the restaurant, a dazzling zinc bar in the center and linen-shaded lighting fixtures well below the celestially high ceiling, he segments the vast dining room and tempers its drama with a cozier air. It's still brash and plenty loud, but it's not nearly as impersonal and overwhelming as it might have been. The restaurant's name comes from the French term for an establishment with a full complement of hard liquor. It's also meant to signal the sensibility of a brasserie. To that end, Mr. Flay has a raw bar of oysters, clams and chilled lobster, along with a lineup of shellfish cocktails. The best of these cocktails unimaginatively pairs lobster with avocado, then jazzes up that partnership with tarragon, red onions, lime juice and Worcestershire sauce. Mr. Flay also has a robust lineup of very fine steaks (rib-eye, strip, filet mignon and hanger), all rubbed with a mix of chili peppers and then thrust in a broiler. That broiler needs better tending. Two of the four steaks I sampled weren't cooked to the requested doneness. The bulk of the menu charts a sweet land of synergy, showcasing regionally evocative dishes that allude to the television show ""FoodNation With Bobby Flay."" The South has a more pronounced presence than the North, manifest in a nifty Vidalia onion soup; in a delightful appetizer sampler of various treatments of artisanal ham, which the restaurant gets from Kentucky and Georgia; in the pecans and dirty wild rice that accessorize a serviceable duck; and in the prevalence of sweet potatoes. There's a sweet potato gratin beside the lamb chops. There's a thin layer of sweet potato biscuit crust atop a rich and rewarding chicken potpie, available only at lunch. And Mr. Flay tweaks New England clam chowder by floating the clams in a broth thickened with sweet potatoes, a terrific invention. As all those sweet potatoes suggest, Mr. Flay is not averse to repeating himself and to taking easy paths -- to pandering, in a sense. Time and again he tethers a peppery jolt to a honeyed calmative or vice versa. That chowder contains chipotle pepper and honey. Those fried squash blossoms are served with a vinaigrette that includes honey and black pepper, a recurring seasoning. The desserts, under the direction of Vicki Wells, are similarly rigged less to intrigue than to satisfy, a goal that most of them, including a blackberry soufflé and chocolate cream pie, handily accomplish. I especially liked the carrot pineapple layer cake, whose color was technically brown but whose spirit was definitely orange. According to my exhaustive semiotic research, by which I mean a few clicks on Google, it's a color that connotes enthusiasm and is ""very effective for promoting food products and toys.""

792,Imperial No. Nine,Fair,20110607,Sam Sifton,SoHo,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/08/dining/reviews/imperial-no-nine-nyc-restaurant-review.html,"CONSISTENCY matters in restaurants. Customers may appreciate a new filling in a favorite ravioli or pie, may enjoy the new pinot noir served at the bar. But mostly what they want is the same dish they had last time. Often it is why they returned. As an object lesson, consider a bowl of cubed raw tuna dressed lightly in mustard oil that sat last week on a table in the center of the elaborately overdecorated greenhouse that is the front dining room of Imperial No. Nine. The restaurant is at the base of the towering new Mondrian hotel in SoHo. The kitchen is run by Sam Talbot, a chef who appeared on the second season of the televised cooking competition “Top Chef.” Previous experience with this tuna dish suggested that it might be Mr. Talbot’s best offering. The dish was an elegant balance of heat and sweet and meat, with the fish set amid delicate little grapefruit sections that set off their bright red hue, everything slick with mustard oil. At earlier meals in the restaurant it had served as a cairn stacked high in the middle of a vast moor of culinary mediocrity, a symbol of excellence catching the occasional ray of hope. And here it was again, glistening and grand. It seemed almost a reward. But on this night the tuna was old. It was not rancid. It was not totally inedible. But it had that spongy funk. It was enough to raise eyebrows. Real life is not television. Food needs to do more than simply look good when it comes out of the kitchen. It needs to be good going onto the plate in the first place, or else it becomes the sort of dish people finish only on bets. You do not want people saying, as they eat your cubed raw tuna dressed lightly in mustard oil, that it tastes “fishy.” It was not the only time in recent weeks that the kitchen at Imperial No. Nine sent out substandard fish. Yes, there was marvelous branzino this night with the tuna, sautéed crisp and served with black garlic, over a healthy splash of dashi, a nice combination of textures, with a salty tang. The shrimp in Mr. Talbot’s shrimp and blue-corn grits were fat and sweet and luscious, a nice date for an accompanying soft-poached egg. On a previous night, though, a plate of raw fluke fell far short of fresh. Clammy in temperature, with a nasty aftertaste, it overpowered the frozen coconut layered on top of it. Octopus legs in a mixture of soy and sofrito danced one evening at the divide between soft and mealy. On another they were decidedly on the far side of the line. They were pillowy in the sense of the word that describes the taste of a pillow. And lobes of dismal-flavored sea urchin served over thick lardo and heavy toast were just dreadful: the eighth band after Nirvana to write loud-soft-loud music and call it new. Not that anyone eating at Imperial No. Nine really appears to care. The vibe of its ficus-filled, chandelier-bedecked, glass-sculpture-bisected greenhouse dining room is more social than cultural or gastronomic. There is a lively bar scene even in the windowless golden-hued annex that plays Siberia to its sparkly St. Petersburg, and a great deal of table-hopping in the main room even though huge wire chairs make sliding your seat out to air-kiss someone difficult at best. At times the din is so great that it can be difficult to hear your table mates, much less a soft-talking server delivering food. It can be awful there, the kind of restaurant where groups of women who might be Real Housewives gather in blowouts and big rings to talk and use their mobile phones, as that guy from “Heroes” who used to be on “Felicity” makes his way out to the lobby and everyone orders a second sweet cocktail before the salad comes out. That salad is quite good, to be fair, and it rises from the wreckage of the tuna dish almost to claim the mantle of Imperial No. Nine’s best: a simple arrangement of pea-shoot greens in a miso vinaigrette. Mondrian guests could eat that with a glass of white wine and head up to their rooms to read scripts and be reasonably happy. Other contenders include a fine stack of elegantly trimmed king crab legs painted with a sweet-and-sour butter, salted with soy and accessorized with sesame seeds and crisp garlic; and creamy fried oysters with bits of ham and a sweet chow-chow relish that nods affectionately to Mr. Talbot’s roots in North Carolina, where he is from, and South Carolina, where he was trained. But that really is about it. Visitors to Mr. Talbot’s elaborate Web page, samtalbot.com, will learn that he was “diagnosed at a young age with juvenile diabetes,” and that he “lives every hour with a profound understanding of the impact of food on life and life on food.” There is little evidence of this on the main menu of Imperial No. Nine. There is none at all on the restaurant’s dessert offerings. Even a plate of just-baked cookies that promise the pleasures of a family meal with an indulgent aunt fails: the cookies are really closer to not-cooked. (If you must tarry late, order the ball of salted caramel ice cream that survives its plating beneath a snowdrift of ground popcorn.) At the original Mondrian in West Hollywood, the restaurant off the lobby is not a business attached to the visage of a television personality. It is instead a branch of Asia de Cuba, the prolific restaurateur Jeffrey Chodorow’s wildly successful Caribbasian fusion restaurant. Critics line up to speak ill of many of Mr. Chodorow’s forays into the restaurant game — his ill-considered attempts at space-ship-themed Basque trattorias, his Rumjungles and Kobe Clubs. But credit where it is due: when a customer slides into an Asia de Cuba and eats food that is slightly salty, slightly sweet, crisp, maybe fiery and generally made better by a huge drink placed on the table by someone attractive, it will likely be as it was the last time and the time before that, running down the years. Guests at the Mondrian on Crosby Street might do well to note the address of the Asia de Cuba in New York: 237 Madison Avenue; (212) 726-7755.   Imperial No. Nine Fair Mondrian SoHo, 9 Crosby Street (Howard Street), SoHo; (212) 389-1000; mondriansoho.com.

797,Elettaria,★,20080604,Frank Bruni,Greenwich Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/04/dining/reviews/04rest.html,"IF a hope chest bloomed into a restaurant, Elettaria might be the outcome. On one side of the hostess stand rises a shrunken staircase, its mock steps to nowhere used  as perches for mementos and other knickknacks, its dimensions evocative of a dollhouse. Throughout the front bar area and the dining room beyond  are pretty little lamps, some with red shades that almost match the color of the antique velvet curtains that hang on brick walls, there not to frame windows but to define a sensibility. Suede,  comma-shaped booths  look as if they were designed for cuddling. The menus come in darling linen booklets that could pass for diaries, and the doors to the two basement restrooms direct gender traffic not with the letters M and W or with masculine and feminine drawings. One door is painted blue, the other pink. It’s whimsical and adorable and reflects significant investments of money, thought and, yes, hope by its principal owners: Akhtar Nawab, who has put together a succinct menu inspired by his Indian ancestry, and Noel Cruz, who watches over the rest of the operation. But Elettaria doesn’t work as well practically as it does visually. A lack of any real division between the dining room and an open kitchen means that you have to step into the kitchen and sometimes even squeeze past a cook to descend  to those restrooms. As you make your apologies, you almost wonder if you should offer to pitch in. Anyone need a hand with the curried rabbit samosas? Some help with the cardamom-scented duck? The ostensibly individual tables bisecting the dining room are essentially  one way-too-long communal table, which makes for odd traffic patterns. And why is  this central and most crucial region of the restaurant so cramped when there’s so much elbowroom and extra space around the bar up front? Elettaria is lovely but awkward, and its awkwardness undercuts Mr. Nawab’s impressively creative cooking. But then his cooking also undercuts itself, some dishes mirroring the setting: seductive in the abstract, less so in actuality. There’s too broad a gap between the best of them, which are excellent, and the rest. I had only one meal that wholly delighted me, while the others were a mix of exciting, intriguing and frustrating moments. Mr. Nawab and Mr. Cruz worked together at Craftbar, and Mr. Nawab subsequently cycled through the kitchen at the E.U. Elettaria strikes me as his most personal effort in terms of food, though he and Mr. Cruz have taken pains to place that food in a context that pays dutiful heed to current fashions. There’s the open kitchen, the reclaimed barn-wood ceiling and above all the cocktails, conceived and mixed by alumni of Freemans and Death & Company. Some are named for movie queens  —  the Rita Hayworth has tequila and pineapple, while the Jane Russell has rye and Grand Marnier  —  and others allude to this Greenwich Village space’s past incarnation as a music club where Jimi Hendrix reputedly performed. Anybody for an Electric Ladyland, made with pisco, rose jam and Champagne? But in an era when every second restaurant calls itself  “market-driven,” Elettaria describes itself as “spice-driven.” (I’m waiting for the restaurant that’s driven by Morgan Freeman.) Its own name is taken from the Latin term for green cardamom, and seasonings prevalent in Indian cooking  —  not just cardamom but also cumin and coriander and turmeric and tamarind — infuse dishes in an often bewitching, irresistible way. Among the starters I loved the crab meat resala, delicate, sweet petals of crab kissed with a turmeric-onion soubise; interspersed with “gnocchi” that are really crisped, crouton-size nuggets of pâte à choux; and  sprinkled with fried cilantro, chervil and parsley. There were succulent pork ribs coated with garam masala, a spice mixture including nutmeg, clove, cumin and cardamom. Quail rarely comes as tender as it did in another terrific appetizer, the meat  fried and dressed with a bacon vinaigrette. And Mr. Nawab’s talent for combining and balancing flavors was apparent in an appetizer of chilled foie gras accented with blood orange, Sichuan pepper and a yogurt mousse with potent currents of vanilla. There were fewer outstanding entrees  —  indeed, fewer entrees in all. Among Elettaria’s nods to the moment is its emphasis on smaller plates. My favorite main course was fluke with a sauce of coconut and tapioca pearls that recalled a gentle, faintly sweet curry. The dish is now being made with halibut, and I bet it’s still a winner. That sauce and an accompanying confit of fingerling potatoes guarantee it a roundness of flavor that I found hugely satisfying. I was also taken with a riff on mattar paneer, an Indian dish made with cubes of bland white cheese and green peas. Correction: I was taken with it once Mr. Nawab tinkered some. In this dish he uses Italian-style ricotta dumplings for the cheese, and at the start they were  large, floppy blobs. Once they’d been harnessed into smaller, tidier presences, the dish came into focus. Other dishes didn’t. The oxtail in a scallop appetizer was playing a part that other chefs have assigned to short rib, but it was doing so in a stringier, murkier, less appealing fashion. The smoked peanuts covering uncooked kona kanpachi overwhelmed it. They’d be too much for almost any fish. The pheasant in an uneventful entree wasn’t treated with the dignity that the quail received  —  it was dry and bland. And the ravioli in a multipart chicken entree were all wrong. The tomato marmalade filling them somehow brought to mind a mass-market pepperoni pizza. And they weren’t entirely warm. Come dessert, my tablemates and I needed a few minutes to pinpoint the flavor of the gelato with fried milk doughnuts  —  survey says: tea  —  but not long at all to realize that we didn’t care much for it. Elettaria closes more weakly than it opens. And its overall performance doesn’t match Mr. Nawab’s considerable promise, though this sporadically compelling restaurant has definite peaks and curiosities, among them the costumes worn by the poignantly obliging waitresses. If Calcutta has  leprechauns, they must look something like this. Elettaria * 33 West Eighth Street (Macdougal Street), Greenwich Village; (212) 677-3833 or elettarianyc.com.

800,Pace,one star,20041027,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/27/dining/familiar-formula-with-an-italian-spin.html,"IN a city where so many restaurateurs vie showily to stand at the top of the culinary heap, Jimmy Bradley and Danny Abrams are refreshingly content with a lower, but just as worthy, patch of ground. They leave the ornate interior design, intricate tasting menus and other high-end high jinks to more vainglorious types. What they do instead is hit the middle and hit it hard, using a simple, prudent formula: a modestly stylish environment, subtly sophisticated food, impeccably welcoming service and prices that seem at least somewhat restrained. If you have been to the Harrison and especially the Red Cat, you have seen and appreciated just how appealingly this formula can work, and you have probably been back three or four times. Mr. Bradley and Mr. Abrams attract satisfied regulars, not bedazzled sycophants. Now comes Pace, the duo's fourth restaurant, following the Mermaid Inn. In many ways, Pace (pronounced PAH-chay) fits the Bradley-Abrams archetype to a T. It does not give diners something new. It gives them a compendium of what they have already indicated they want, in its case channeling inspiration and lifting ideas from the city's most popular Italian restaurants. It feels instantly familiar, abundantly friendly and immediately comfortable. From the moment you walk through the door at Pace, which means peace in Italian, and see all the happy, garrulous people around the long, handsome bar, you find yourself unwinding. But Pace is by far the duo's most ambitious restaurant, as a glance at the menu reveals right away. That menu is divided into 10 categories, not counting dessert, with scores of dishes small and large. It offers salumi, crudi, vegetable antipasti, salads, panini, pasta, risotto, meat entrees, fish entrees and side dishes. Mr. Abrams, who supervises the dining room, and Mr. Bradley, who supervises the kitchen with his executive chef, Joey Campanaro, are juggling a greater volume and array of food than they usually do. They are also tethering themselves for the most part to a given tradition, Italian, instead of working under the more forgiving banner of American or new American, the phrases sometimes used to define the cuisine at the Harrison and Red Cat. Pace represents their greatest challenge. And for now at least the strain of rising to it shows in a few too many unremarkable dishes and a few too many disappointing ones. I would rather focus first on what is good, because you can indeed construct or luck into an extremely enjoyable meal at Pace, and I suspect that many diners will. They will find favorites dishes, return to order them again and make Pace, with its deliberately aged-looking dining room, a casual casa away from casa. Or they will recognize Pace as a terrific destination for a drink and a hearty snack. On my visits, much of what the kitchen did best was from the opening sections of the menu: appetizerlike offerings that would work perfectly with a glass of wine or two at the bar. The salumi, or cured meats, including bresaola, mortadella and prosciutto, hit their soft, salty, gently spicy marks, and a generous sampler, perfect for two or even three people, is $15. For now Pace imports some of its salumi from Italy and gets some locally, but Mr. Bradley said he planned to start curing more and more of it at the restaurant. Almost all of the simply cooked, simply seasoned, lightly oiled antipasti vegetables that fall under the menu heading verdure were knockouts. You can order any combination of three for $12. I recommend the roasted eggplant, the onions and the mushrooms, although a good case can be made for the peppers or the treviso. From the five kinds of risotto, pick the risotto bianco, an uncomplicated dish ennobled by nothing more than Parmesan and butter. Like all of the risottos I tried, it had the right consistency, neither soupy nor gummy. From the half-dozen pasta offerings, try the spaghettini with anchovies, if it is available. It came to vibrant life with a smattering of pickled sweet and hot chili peppers. The cacciucco, an Italian spin on bouillabaisse brimming with scallops, calamari and mussels, was wonderful. The roasted lamb, my favorite among the meat entrees, was impeccably cooked. But many dishes left little impression, seeming to lack an ingredient, flourish or catalyst that would have taken them up a notch. One example was the ziti with yellow squash, Italian sausage and cherry tomatoes, a dish that prompted a friend to say, ""I'd be proud if I made this at home, but I wouldn't rush out for it."" She paused and took another bite. ""It's fine,"" she added, trying to sound cheerful but allowing an unmistakable measure of disappointment into her voice. ""Fine."" That faintly praising adjective popped into my mind when I sampled the risotto with saffron and veal, the wild boar, and the grilled sea bass with a heap of overly salty pasta fagioli by its side. Several of the panini were not fine, because the taste of the meat at their architectural and aesthetic centers had been obscured by other ingredients. A few entrees puzzled me. Wrapping veal sweetbreads in prosciutto for a newfangled saltimbocca is a questionable idea. It was also questionably executed: what arrived on our table was excessively chewy. Chicken cutlets had been recklessly breaded. A side dish of Gorgonzola polenta was as sludgy as wet cement. It seems to me that the length and diversity of the menu are working against Pace, creating weak spots that distract from the restaurant's many strengths. Those virtues include good desserts; a creative, user-friendly all-Italian wine list; and an immensely attractive vibe that manages to be energizing or lulling, depending on your need and mood. In the broadest sense Mr. Abrams and Mr. Bradley know how to feed you. At Pace they simply throw a bit too much on the table.

802,Gwynnett St. ,★★,20120403,Pete Wells,Williamsburg,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/dining/reviews/gwynnett-st-in-williamsburg-brooklyn.html,"THE one-story exterior facing Graham Avenue, in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was totally unornamented except for a cryptic pair of stone lions up on the cornice. The dining room was plain, too, harking back to the days when nothing said hip, contemporary and urban better than exposed brick. At the end of the bar was what looked like, and under the previous ownership was, a pizza oven. Now it was baking miniature loaves of whiskey bread. They cost $5, tasted sweet and old-fashioned, and brought me back to those sprawling family restaurants that serve turkey with hot gravy on Sunday afternoons. Until the first course, in fact, nothing about Gwynnett St. hinted at what the kitchen had in store for me. But now servers had silently flanked the table. The one on my left decanted creamy salsify soup into a bowl dotted with crunchy bits of sweet-and-sour water chestnuts and a dab of shiso oil and fresh shiso leaves. I’d never imagined that the minty, lemony herb would have so much to say to the rich, oystery flavor of salsify. Or that a soup that brought them together could be so seductive. To my right, somebody had just been given a mound of roasted maitakes draped in a glistening sheet of lardo. It looked like a pine cone after an ice storm. Poked, the mushroom fell apart into mouth-size bites ready to be swabbed in a gentle cream of onions and rosemary. Across the table, two planks of brown-butter-roasted carrot lay alongside two strips of slow-cooked lamb breast, crisp and richly melting.  The sauce was thick, saffron-colored yogurt that tasted of carrots.  Crumbled rye toast with caraway and brown butter lent an Eastern European flavor. And what was that grassy herb? A sprig of carrot tops? Like almost everything at Gwynnett St., that lamb breast is not as simple as it looks, but its complications work together to build a marvelous sense of harmony. The restaurant opened in November with Justin Hilbert in charge of the kitchen. Mr. Hilbert worked at Wylie Dufresne’s idea factory, WD-50, after going abroad for a while to peer into the abyss at Mugaritz, the Basque restaurant where diners are routinely antagonized with potatoes inside baked clay, and the like. Back in New York, Mr. Hilbert isn’t antagonizing anybody. He follows Mr. Dufresne’s decentralized approach to cuisine — using modern craftsmanship to build a dish out of separate components that are crunchy, chewy, smooth and so forth — but without Mr. Dufresne’s fondness for tough-love flavors like black licorice and chicory. Mr. Hilbert is after quieter effects, teasing multiple forms and textures out of a few compatible flavors. His smart-wallflower style is best displayed in the Amish chicken with potatoes, beets, rutabagas and hay ash. What the what? All the cool kids are cooking with ashes these days. You didn’t know that? This chicken is soaked in a brine made with ash, then cooked with more ash rubbed into its flesh. The surprise is that it does not taste anything like a chimney. In fact, the chicken has a sweet and salty flavor, like a mild ham, with a dusting of something that tastes a bit like smoked mushrooms. Our table ordered it in a gambling spirit. It turned out to be the dish we all fought over, even more than we did over the long strips of duck breast that looked like flank steak and tasted incredible. Mr. Hilbert’s style of cuisine is not yet common in this pocket of Williamsburg. In fact, cooking this sophisticated would be a find anywhere in New York. And while it is a restaurant in Brooklyn, Gwynnett St. is not really a Brooklyn restaurant. There are no butchers’ tools hanging from reclaimed barn doors. Under the eye of Carl McCoy, the proprietor, the dining room staff is calmly professional, utterly free of pretense and attitude. Nobody is the least bit likely to pull up a chair and offer to show you pictures of the sauerkraut the chef is currently fermenting inside a pair of Red Wing boots. Looking around the attractive but plain-spoken dining room, you get the sense that the pizza oven was left in place largely because tearing it out would have cost too much. The budget seems to have driven many of the other design decisions, down to the single restroom decorated with vintage car-repair manuals and an 1869 map of the neighborhood. (It shows a thoroughfare called Gwinnett Street, later renamed Lorimer Street.) More attention to lighting in the dining room would flatter both the food and the faces, but for the most part Gwynnett St. does quite well by pouring most of its resources into the kitchen. The excellence is on the plate. I can’t think of a similar restaurant, for instance, with a tofu main course that is as thoughtfully and stylishly put together as anything else on the menu. Made from almonds, it has the luxurious texture of a custard rather than the rubbery bounce of bean-curd tofu. Toasted sliced almonds on top let your teeth get in the game, while a green swoosh of puréed lettuce and herbs gives your eyes something to look at. A carnivorous friend thinks this dish wasn’t filling enough to make a main course, but I suspect anybody who embraces tofu won’t have that complaint. In fact, it won’t surprise me if vegans begin marching into restaurants holding up pictures of this tofu and saying, “More like this, please.” When you learn that there is no pastry chef at Gwynnett St., you might start to expect tiramisù and other make-ahead sweets that are to understaffed restaurants what a pint of sorbet is to a last-minute dinner party. You would be so very wrong. Mr. Hilbert’s job at WD-50 was in the pastry kitchen, then under Alex Stupak, and at all times no place for slackers. If anything, the desserts at Gwynnett St. are put together more elaborately than the rest of the meal. Ingredients change shapes. Milk chocolate ganache is made to bend and curl; coconut becomes snow. Even a recent cheese course was a chance for the kitchen to play: a raw sheep’s-milk cheese was sent out with shards of almond and flaxseed brittle and coins of ripe persimmon. None of which is brandished on the menu, of course. Every plate is more complex and more studiously designed than you would ever guess. But Mr. Hilbert’s cooking doesn’t jump up and down in its seat in the front row waving its hand wildly. It sits, patiently, until you notice that it knows all the answers."
813,Sascha,One Star,20060524,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/24/dining/reviews/dont-like-the-ambience-switch-floors.html,"TO: SoOverSalsify@gmail.com  FROM: FrankDining@yahoo.com  SUBJECT: You'll never, ever guess which famished, neglected neighborhood I found myself dining in last night. Ready? Sitting down? Strapped in? The meatpacking district! Just when you thought they couldn't squeeze in another restaurant there, they did. And they didn't even have to squeeze. This one has about 10,000 square feet over three floors: a wine cellar and a private party space below ground; a no-reservations brasserie-style room and separate dessert shop on street level; a more sedate refuge for ostensibly finer dining up a twisting staircase. Sascha: not just a restaurant. A multifaceted epicurean environment. Very Danny Meyer by way of Balthazar. Although perhaps not destined for that kind of success. Ate upstairs. Pretty. Civilized. Exposed brick, windows onto Gansevoort Street, tufted leather booths, tasseled lampshades, white tablecloths. A relief from all the Asian bling-bling nearby. Sascha is to some extent your kind of place. No mâche, no yuzu, no yowza. Three hours whizzed by. That's a stroke and a slap. While I left the restaurant sated (portions are generous), I had to struggle to recall what I ate. Memories do not light the corners of my mind. But there are flickers: of the rack of lamb for two, which was enough for three or four, with flesh that was almost buttery. Of veal tortellini in a sage cream sauce, which was really a sauce, not an ocean in which the pasta struggled furiously to stay afloat. Of fried oysters -- or more accurately the coleslaw beneath them, which was inflected with bacon. It's hard to go wrong when you're inflecting with bacon. But roasted Dover sole meunière, roasted baby chicken -- they came and went, making me wonder what Sascha Lyon, 33, the chef and one of the owners, was doing during those months when the restaurant's opening was delayed and delayed again. He wasn't refining a lineup of inspired recipes. After stints at Daniel and Pastis, where he served as executive chef, he has a restaurant to call his own -- literally -- and how does he shout his name from the downtown rooftops? With a retro menu of American and Continental standard-bearers you might find in a hotel dining room in a small Midwestern city. Maybe it's supposed to be chicly unchic. Or cheekily chichi. To me it was just odd. TO: SoOverSalsify@gmail.com  FROM: FrankDining@yahoo.com  SUBJECT: I did lunch downstairs and was befuddled anew. The menu in this room -- no tasseled shades, no tablecloths -- is the same and different. You can get many of the upstairs dishes and an identical array of raw bar selections and seafood cocktails. You can't get the lamb or sole. In their stead: a knackwurst sandwich, a chicken potpie, a double hamburger. We got a niçoise salad with freshly grilled tuna, which was just that: you'd appreciate it on a low-carb day. We also got a French dip sandwich. You'd appreciate it only if you'd lost your mind. ""Arby's,"" said my companion after a taste of the overcooked, dreary, grayish slices of meat. ""Dinty Moore,"" I countered. Before these we had a lobster cocktail and a jumbo shrimp cocktail, the seafood in both of them plump, succulent and sweet. The lobster was coated with a rich Cognac-flavored mayonnaise. You don't get that kind of old-fashioned Old World indulgence over at Ono. TO: SoOverSalsify@gmail.com  FROM: FrankDining@yahoo.com  SUBJECT: A friend kept saying ""I don't understand this restaurant."" She said it as we sampled an appetizer of shrimp in a shredded phyllo jacket, the kind of snack sent up by room service at the Marriott. She said it after bites of pro forma short ribs; of slightly soggy Wiener schnitzel with vinegary potato salad; of a wedge of red-center tuna, with a cumin and coriander crust, that tasted blandly like something you've eaten 842 times before. She said it perhaps most loudly during dessert, when Sascha goes retro gonzo with a month of sundaes and layers of cakes, most with the densely larded, vaguely flavored effect of confections on hooded pedestals in a diner. We were upstairs, for dinner, and here's the crazy part: we weren't unhappy. That room has real separation between tables, real style. The special cocktails -- especially the Gingerzing, made with vodka, orange Curaçao, lemon juice and puréed ginger -- were fantastic. We had more than a few special cocktails. TO: SoOverSalsify@gmail.com  FROM: FrankDining@yahoo.com  SUBJECT: A steaky night at Sascha was enjoyable. For the most part. With many beef dishes untried, we tried many: a grilled New York strip, which came with a parsley and shallot butter on top and a heap of crunchy, golden fries on the side; a robust roasted rib-eye; chateaubriand for two, which was enough for three or four, with flesh that was almost buttery. But what was up with the soundtrack? The softer side of Michael Jackson, the softer side of George Michael -- I came to fear that the softer side of Michael Bolton was right around the corner. Then I got it: the genius at work. It was high-concept music-food pairing. Easy listening for thoughtless eating. There was no such explanation for sludgy, bitter and slightly cold decaf. Not at a restaurant charging $69 for that chateaubriand. TO: SoOverSalsify@gmail.com  FROM: FrankDining@yahoo.com  SUBJECT: On the right day Sascha can be delightful. Went for another lunch downstairs. Had juicy fried chicken with a crispy batter. Had a juicy double cheeseburger with ripe tomato. It came in an adorable wax sleeve, which helped, because it dribbles all over. That's a stroke, not a slap. The day was sunny. Broad doors stood open between the room and a cluster of outdoor cafe tables. I sipped a chocolate egg cream. I've had better. But like the wax paper sleeve, it made me smile. Might do the same for you. TO: FrankDining@yahoo.com  FROM: SoOverSalsify@gmail.com  SUBJECT:  Meet you at Sascha for lunch before the weather gets too hot. Is 1 o'clock too early for a Gingerzing? For you, I mean. I'll have a martini. Beefeater, not Hendrick's. And I'll pass on dinner. I do a fine rack of lamb of my own. And I like the harder side of Michael Stipe.

835,Blaue Gans,One Star,20060308,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/08/dining/reviews/edelweiss-with-a-dash-of-oompah.html,"Correction Appended THE chef Kurt Gutenbrunner doesn't dawdle. He took possession of the TriBeCa space that would become his new restaurant Blaue Gans in late October, just a month and a half into the life of his new restaurant Thor on the Lower East Side. By early December he was already ladling out goulash and cutting slices of Sacher torte. In the restaurant business, that sort of turnaround isn't just fast; it's borderline unfathomable. Then again, Mr. Gutenbrunner cut himself some breaks. The space belonged to Le Zinc, and the few tweaks he and his collaborators made to its décor -- still defined by a long zinc bar, scores of vintage posters, a curved ceiling and high-backed red banquettes -- are so negligible that you find yourself wondering if he simply changed the locks and the name on the utilities and flicked on the lights. The menu Mr. Gutenbrunner installed is brief, and it returns again and again to the same ideas and ingredients. Sausages have their day, sauerkraut gets a say and horseradish holds sway over a third of the dishes, or so it seems. Blaue Gans (BLAU-eh gahnz), which means blue goose, happened so quickly because it required neither a grand plan nor a lavishly stocked larder. It's as much a land grab as an elaborately imagined restaurant. Mr. Gutenbrunner spotted and snatched a prime patch of real estate near his loft, then put that property to use with a straightforward Austro-German bistro that was virtually ready to go. But as dashed-off as Blaue Gans may be, it perfectly suits a certain casual mood and a certain basic appetite, proving that a restaurant needn't be tremendously significant to be significantly appealing. It's for impulsive diners who haven't taken the time to make reservations, which it doesn't accept. For impatient diners who don't want to pore over dozens of relentlessly inventive options, which it doesn't have. For exhausted diners who don't want to study a lengthy, abstruse wine list. Blaue Gans doesn't have that, either. It has a modest regiment of rieslings and a small posse of grüner veltliners. It has boiled beef shoulder with applesauce and, atop the applesauce, freshly grated horseradish. It has a smoked pork sausage with sauerkraut, mustard and horseradish. It has a pork and beef sausage with the same sidekicks. Blaue Gans lets sexier restaurants canoodle with day-boat lobster and diver scallops. It flirts with trout, which appears twice on the menu. For an excellent appetizer, the fish is smoked and packed into a dense cake, the other layers of which include crème fraîche, red onion, apple and -- get ready for this -- horseradish. For a satisfying entree, a whole brook trout is sautéed, festooned with capers, fringed with carrots and bathed in creamed kohlrabi, a turniplike root vegetable. Mr. Gutenbrunner appears to be something of a trout savant: when I ate at Thor, one of the best entrees was brook trout, presented with creamed spinach and caper berries. The similarity between that dish and the trout entree at Blaue Gans suggests the extent to which Mr. Gutenbrunner is cribbing from himself at his latest restaurant, referencing some of his best bits from previous ventures -- Thor, Wallsé in Greenwich Village and Café Sabarsky on the Upper East Side -- and simplifying or rearranging them. You can almost think of Blaue Gans as a culinary version of Barneys Co-op, its merchandise marked down (though not all that much, and arguably not enough) and its niceties scaled back. Service isn't entirely reliable. When a friend and I went for brunch one weekend, our waiter repeatedly forgot to bring us things we'd asked for: a napkin, her second mimosa, her third mimosa (she'd had a rough week). We couldn't always remind him because we couldn't always find him. Dinners proceeded much more smoothly, perhaps because the gracious young Austrian man who works as a combined sommelier, host and floor manager was there. He also lent the restaurant an aura of authenticity with his pronounced accent and Alpine musings. When I arrived one night, he was raptly watching the winter Olympics on a TV above the bar, discussing the beauty of the mountains and reminiscing about his home country. If ever I felt a hunger for schnitzels and strudels, along with a thirst for raindrops on roses, it was then and there. Of the restaurant's many presentations of sausage, two were especially good. A pale pork and veal sausage, served with sweet mustard and a soft, salty pretzel, had the lightness of mousse. A mash of blood sausage and fingerling potatoes was molded into a circle and placed on a roomy bed of sauerkraut. On the schnitzel front, a respectable pork Wiener schnitzel wore a crisp coat of egg, flour and breadcrumbs and came with a terrific potato salad, which was light on vinegar and heavy on fresh dill, an herb that doesn't get its due these days. But a pork jäger schnitzel was better. The meat had been dusted with flour and cooked with veal stock, cream, button mushrooms and bacon. It came with spaetzle, which the sommelier recommended we drag through the tawny sauce. What a wise, sweet man. The food at Blaue Gans isn't exactly dainty, and when it veers in that direction, it winds up in an unremarkable place. Simple fillets of cod and Arctic char seemed less like fully formed dishes than like menu stretchers and sops to lighter eaters. The restaurant does better with robust fare like venison, a recurring special, and pork belly, a menu fixture. It does wonderfully with desserts, one of the best of which is something called a kaiserschmarren, a spongy pancake sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with an apple compote. In another standout dessert, a compote of huckleberries and lingonberries hides beneath a generous cover of meringue, the undulating shape of which is meant, I learned later, to resemble three peaks surrounding Salzburg. The sommelier glanced longingly at it. Was he reconnecting with his native land? Or just looking forward to a reliably satisfying meal at the end of his shift?

838,August,Two Stars,20060426,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/26/dining/reviews/a-waiting-game-with-savory-rewards.html,"SITTING at a table just inside the restaurant August on a recent night, I was struck by two things. The first was the look on the faces of many of the people who walked in. It was two parts hope, one part dread and one part determination -- the same expression worn by supplicants at Freeman's and Blaue Gans. Like those restaurants, August generally doesn't take reservations. You might zoom to a table; you might confront an hourlong wait. You never know. The second thing that struck me was how many diners had decided that August was worth the gamble. As often as the host said ""welcome"" to a group of new arrivals, he said ""welcome back."" I wasn't surprised, because by the time I noticed that, my friends and I were polishing off the tarte flambée. Like many dishes at August, it had come from the restaurant's wood-burning brick oven, ideal for anything with a pizzalike crust. That oven had given the flatbread a smokiness that offset the sweetness of its thick coat of silky onion. This dish might well be worth a 45-minute wait for a table. We were also working our way through a mash of potato and ham under a hood of melted raclette. It too bore smoky traces from the oven, and its rustic aura was enhanced by its black cast-iron vessel. I'd wait 20 minutes, maybe even 30, to dive anew into this dish, which harbored a sneaky, bracing secret. There were traces of sweet mustard in the mix. August makes demands but also parcels out rewards, especially for anyone with any appetite for urban rusticity, which it pulls off about as well as any restaurant in Manhattan. With that brick oven, those cast-iron serving vessels, a wide-plank wood floor in the front dining room and a cobblestone floor in the back, August layers rustic accent atop rustic accent, to the point where you just might forget you aren't in Provence or Tuscany, at least until a hipster poster girl like the actress Maggie Gyllenhaal strolls in, as she did on that recent night. The distressed plaster walls of the restaurant look like centuries-old stone, and wine bottles are wedged into various crannies, an artful pantomime of artlessness. It all works because it's all of a piece. The absence of ceremony (no reservations) suits the countrified visual details, which in turn complement the full-flavored, straightforward cooking. There's big thought behind this relatively small restaurant, the kind of fairly priced, solidly pleasing, intimate refuge the West Village likes to pretend it's full of but really isn't. It opened in early 2004. Tony Liu, an alumnus of Babbo, is in charge of the kitchen. He's a disciplined craftsman who obviously cares about his ingredients and seldom crowds plates with too many of them. And over time he's moved August from a tight focus on France, Italy and Spain to a broader, looser orientation. He references Scandinavia in such dishes as an appealing shrimp salad, made with smoked cod roe and bits of hardboiled egg and spread on a crisp sheet of rye bread. It had a salty kick, mellowed by a rich housemade mayonnaise. He invokes Eastern Europe. On a visit to August about a year ago, I had a dish of chicken paprikash, made with a whole, succulent baby chicken, and there was ""Hungarian venison goulash"" on a more recent dinner menu, though our server warned us away from it. He said that in his opinion, the venison simply wasn't up to snuff. How often do you come across that kind of candor? Instead we had the mustard-glazed pork belly, fatty and fantastic. We had a moist fillet of slow-roasted halibut, surrounded by yellow and red beets and grapefruit and orange segments. August can do clean, bright dishes like this one, or like a faintly nutty, decidedly sweet white gazpacho, made with almonds and grapes, that comes on and off the menu. But the restaurant's heart seems to be in its heartier dishes, like a stuffed cabbage with kasha, wild mushrooms, ground pork and ground veal, all kissed by a gentle tomato sauce. It was the very definition of humble comfort food. Or like a plump wedge of roasted cod surrounded by cockles, medallions of chorizo, roasted cauliflower and golden croutons. The croutons visually mimicked the cauliflower, and proved essential for sopping up the olive oil at the bottom of its vessel -- yet another piece of black iron cookware straight from the brick oven. Those vessels play a major role during weekend brunch, when the restaurant uses them to bake eggs in the oven. You can have those eggs mixed with various embellishments; we chose bacon, onion and crème fraîche. And we were given sizeable wedges of peasant bread as crunchy sponges for the gooey treasure. If every day began with a meal this indulgent, New York would be a happier city, albeit a flabbier one. August has its limits and disappointments. Some dishes were merely pleasant, and a few were unappealing, including a stringy casserole of salt cod and an overcooked and strangely sour hamburger. Desserts were uneven. Make sure to avoid a grainy, funky ""chestnut truffle honey mousse."" But in compensation, August has that back dining area, a year-round patio with flower boxes and a moveable glass roof that lets in birdsong and breezes during warmer months. It has a thoughtful international wine list with many options under $40 a bottle, and that's not so easy to find. The geographic breadth of its frequently changing menu, on which the prices of most entrees hover just above $20, prevents it from feeling as slight as it otherwise might. And despite the constraints of its space and the crowds during peak hours, it manages a coziness and graciousness that's lacking at other first-come-first-served rolls of the dice, like the Spotted Pig. Besides, you could beat the crowds by supping early or late. You could do lunch, when the menu's a hybrid of dinner and brunch. You could even go at a prime time and get lucky. If that happens and you feel the warmth of August's welcome, you'll be tempted to return, no matter the risks. I say that almost without reservation.

841,Alsace,Two Stars,20060531,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/31/dining/reviews/giving-beer-its-place-at-the-table.html,"""CLOVE?"" I asked, not quite sure I had heard him correctly. ""Clove,"" he answered without hesitation. ""Huh,"" I said, for two reasons. The first was that I was already hoisting the beer to my lips for another sip, so I had to be quick and economical with my syllables. The second: I was flustered. Try as I might to latch onto them, the promised notes of clove in the brew eluded me. But I had hope. The beer sommelier had also foretold currents of orange, and their presence in this Leffe Blonde from Belgium was incontrovertible. He had talked about the ""aromatics"" at work, and there was indeed a citrusy, flowery perfume. Could he be wrong about the clove? I concentrated. I searched my palate for what was behind the orange or maybe in front of the orange or possibly on the side of the orange. No clove, at least not for me. But I was having what I suppose I should describe as a heady time rooting around for it. Café d'Alsace, a new brasserie on the Upper East Side, brings the fetishism and free-association usually reserved for wine to the exaltation of beer. It has more than 110 kinds. It assigns them bin numbers and groups them under different headings: ""wheat,"" ""bock,"" ""lambic."" It pairs them with foods. The Leffe Blonde, in fact, was the beer sommelier's tailored recommendation for an appetizer of warm potato salad with Alsatian Muenster cheese. And if that salad had been forgettable, all of the frothy rigmarole surrounding it and the rest of the menu at Café d'Alsace might have come across as an annoying gimmick meant to distract diners from unremarkable food. But it wasn't. The tender cubes of potato and melted cheese formed an ideal partnership, with or without the fervent orange and fugitive clove in the brew beside them. And this terrific dish kept company with many other winners: a goat cheese tart as sumptuous on the inside and flaky on the outside as you could wish it to be; a plump, moist wedge of fresh salmon smoked to order and surrounded by dark lentils. Subtract the obscure ales at Café d'Alsace and you still have a very appealing restaurant, its cooking accomplished (though inconsistent), its energy infectious. Put them back into the equation and you have something special, a solid neighborhood restaurant with a claim to distinction beyond its neighborhood. I don't think any other New York restaurant combines this many Pilseners with food this sturdy. Café d'Alsace won't just be beer today and gone tomorrow. It's the creation of Simon Oren, who knows a thing or two about successful brasseries. Refusing to cede the city to gnocchi and gnudi, Mr. Oren has made a career of colonizing needy neighborhoods with the likes of steak frites and crème brûlee. He brought Gallic pick-me-up's to the theater district (Marseille) and the Upper West Side (Nice Matin). That left the Upper East Side, where Café d'Alsace opened about three months ago. To run the kitchen Mr. Oren hired Philippe Roussel, who had cooked at Montparnasse and Chelsea Bar and Bistro. Mr. Roussel does justice to his new showcase's name by focusing his mostly French menu on Alsace and its hearty fare. You won't leave hungry, certainly not if you order the pleasant and filling choucroute garnie, which lavished a bevy of meats on sauerkraut that had been cooked with riesling. Along with several kinds of pork sausage there was a pillowy boudin blanc of veal and pork and -- just in case you weren't getting enough protein and fat -- hunks of flabby pork belly. All of the restaurant's sausages were excellent, including a livery duck sausage and an ethereal seafood sausage made with a shrimp, scallop and cod mousse. A follow-the-sausage ordering strategy would be prudent, as would a follow-the-bacon approach, pointing you toward the Alsatian soup, brimming with white beans as well as bacon, and the baeckeoffe, a traditional Alsatian casserole with bacon, lamb, oxtails and no small measure of potatoes. I suppose it's for diners who find the choucroute garnie too dainty. I encountered a few too many dishes, including a wanly flavored veal breast and a gummy beer-braised lamb shank, that weren't really for anyone. I encountered others, like an onion-laden tarte flambée and a heavily sauced hanger steak, that could have been better. But I loved an appetizer of marrow bones. I liked an appetizer of frog's legs. If tuna is the chicken of the sea, frog's legs are the chicken wings of the haute pond, which is to say they're ready, efficient conveyors of whatever they've been coated in or doused with. These conveyed garlic and butter and butter and garlic. Message received, and relished. On visit after visit, I packed away more dessert than I meant to, entering a sort of fugue state upon seeing and tasting the Frisbee-sized apple tart or the bewitchingly salted chocolate tart. I got a buzz from the surroundings: a long zinc bar; a brilliant spectrum of seltzer bottles above it; a diverse mix of smiling, chattering diners at tables positioned close to one another, but not ridiculously so. Let's face it: I also got a buzz from the beers. One night I tried the effervescent Belgian Deus Brut de Flandres, which comes in what looks like a Champagne bottle and is served in Champagne flutes. Another night I ventured into the sour realm of the lambic -- and beat a hasty retreat. And yet another night I heeded the advice of Aviram Turgeman, the beer sommelier (I had to use the phrase just one more time), and started out with the Belgian golden ale Duvel, which he said would ""cleanse the palate and awaken the stomach."" That seemed like a lot of responsibility for a beer. But time and again, we've asked as much of wine. Why not, on occasion, let a lager carry the load?

842,Telepan,Two Stars,20060215,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/15/dining/reviews/a-chef-returns-inspired-by-ingredients.html,"AT many restaurants the food swaggers and preens, not so much inviting attention as demanding it. At Telepan it does the equivalent of idling into view, confident that its moment of regard will come. It shuns trickery and puts its faith in fundamental virtues: its freshness; the pureness or punch of its flavors; the skill with which it's been cooked. Dishes wear prosaic tags like ""winter vegetable-bread soup."" Excited? I can't say I was. I lowered my spoon. Up came potato, rutabaga, carrot, cabbage -- none of it precious but all of it vibrant. Parmesan added a crucial edge to the broth while chunks of ciabatta gave it heft. Down went my spoon again and again. There's little attempt to jettison familiar, comforting players for more exotic ones. Salmon topped a recent list of entrees. Heart beating faster? I can't say mine was. But out came a juicy fillet that tasted of salmon, not of the obliquely salmon-esque richness so prevalent these days. Its pinkness was thrust into relief by a bed of crushed blue potatoes, its lusciousness by nothing showier than a crust of breadcrumbs, lemon juice and lemon zest. To build on the sweetness of Nantucket bay scallops, the kitchen didn't go through some 42-step process requiring a half dozen state-of-the-art kitchen gadgets. It turned to butter, cream and garlic. Hedgehog mushrooms and baby spinach also entered the mix. At Telepan, vegetables were often front and center. An array of different types of roasted cauliflower wasn't a side. It was its own course, for $15.50. This approach to food isn't the kind that provokes wild-eyed ardor (or, for that matter, eye-rolling exasperation). But it does engender deep affection and admiration, both of which the chef Bill Telepan enjoyed at Judson Grill in Midtown, both of which he should enjoy anew at Telepan, his own place, bearing his own name, on the Upper West Side. It opened in December. Judson closed a year and a half ago after 10 years in business. Mr. Telepan had been there for the last six of them. The hell of the New York restaurant business is that top-tier chefs regularly find themselves without a kitchen, often for periods much longer than Mr. Telepan did. The salvation is that they almost always find their way back. And they can apply their talents elsewhere. Mr. Telepan wrote ""Inspired by Ingredients"" (Simon & Schuster, 2004) with Andrew Friedman. Its title is as apt a motto for his cooking as anyone could coin. It's also a good description of his new restaurant, though some additional phrases round out the picture: Entranced by Eggs. There were two egg dishes, one with smoked salmon and another with scrapple, among nine selections labeled ""mid courses"" and listed between appetizers and entrees. Among the appetizers, a poached egg stood ready to run through a tangle of frisée and hen-of-the-woods mushrooms. Bewitched by Blini. There were buckwheat and potato blini with smoked brook trout, one of the best appetizers. Alternating layers of sweet potato blini and spaghetti squash formed the centerpiece of a pleasantly nutty, criminally buttery, altogether splendid middle course that, like the eggs, could easily have passed for breakfast. Clobbered by Color. The restaurant, an oddly configured series of rooms created from the joined first floors of adjacent townhouses, is painted a shade of light green that might be uplifting in a small dose but is slightly oppressive in this large one. Some of the upholstery meant to complement it is brownish with an orange-ish stripe. I think these color combinations were once popular, but I think that was two or three decades ago. In terms of ambience, Telepan feels dated, and that's a special problem on the Upper West Side, where the dining demographic tends not to infuse a restaurant with any more pizazz than it already has. (Color me one of the culprits: I live here.) Telepan has additional drawbacks, including desserts that didn't live up to what preceded them -- one exception was a sherry custard tart with a pecan tuile -- and a menu that provided choices and sowed confusion in equal measure. Were the middle-course selections meant to be oversize appetizers or undersize entrees? Why would braised short ribs or lobster Bolognese be in that hodgepodge category, where the eggs, the cauliflower and the sweet potato blini also resided? Servers, although gracious and otherwise helpful, weren't immediately clear on these points, nor did they always fully explain what bargains a $55 four-course prix fixe and a $65 five-course prix fixe are. Each course can be chosen from any menu category, although the portions are smaller than they would be a la carte. Mr. Telepan's frequently noted devotion to the Greenmarket is a less striking aspect of his restaurant than the way it toggles between Eastern and Western Europe. He nodded to his Hungarian ancestry with dishes like black truffle pirogi and ""monkfish paprikas,"" which put the fish in the company of cabbage and kielbasa. He indulged an interest in Italy with robiola tortellini, which bobbed in a sublime Parmesan broth, and ""pacchetti,"" or little packets, of pasta wrapped around slow-cooked pork shoulder. Other dishes -- like roasted chicken with poppy seeds, slices of sirloin with a wintry oxtail glaze and a medley of pork with cassoulet beans on the side -- had a more ecumenical orientation. And they had a sturdy, unglamorous appeal. Telepan won't turn heads, certainly not in its present attire. But it will warm hearts and sate appetites, more surely and faithfully than vainer, flashier suitors might. Telepan  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  72 West 69th Street (Columbus Avenue); (212) 580-4300. ATMOSPHERE -- The joining of two adjacent townhouses creates a series of rooms with ample space between tables but a questionable color scheme. SOUND LEVEL -- Moderate. RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Smoked trout; bay scallops; vegetable-bread soup; tortellini; pork pachetti; blini with squash; salmon on blue potatoes; lobster-braised halibut; sirloin with oxtail glaze; sherry custard tart; cookie plate.

846,L'Impero,★★,20071031,Frank Bruni,Midtown East,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/31/dining/reviews/31rest.html,"IF restaurants conformed to predictable narratives, you’d be reading something of a dirge right now. It would trace the heady rise of the chef Scott Conant over the last five years. It would puzzle over his abrupt exodus in May from L’Impero and Alto. And then — cue violins, or maybe a mournful oboe — it would survey the wreckage in his wake, pondering New York’s loss. But the madness and thrill of dining out in this city is how often expectations are defied, and the following news comes with an exultant trumpet blast. L’Impero and Alto remain vital restaurants, worthy of the attention of anyone who cares about serious Italian cooking. Alto, in fact, is better than ever. Both restaurants have been entrusted to another accomplished chef, Michael White, from Fiamma Osteria. He has skills and ambitions comparable to Mr. Conant’s but a more straightforward sensibility. And at Alto, that translates into a restaurant unlike the Conant version and much more satisfying than it was in its infancy in 2005, when I gave it two stars in The New York Times. Alto is where Mr. Conant, emboldened by the acclaim for L’Impero, veered in a fastidious, overly conceptual direction, his intricate dishes combining northern Italian and Germanic influences. A typical meal involved precious moments without enough accruing force, without any big, uncomplicated bang. Mr. White doesn’t stray as far outside Italy’s borders and takes a blunter approach, reflected most clearly in the entrees. Instead of following the fashion of the moment and doing lamb two or three ways, he presents a hefty four-chop rack. Instead of finagling some fancy deployment for duck, he roasts a plump bird for two, and has a server display it, its bronze skin veritably glowing, before it returns later as extra-thick slices with an extra-thick rim of fat. This approach can be only as impressive as the ingredients and the care with which they’re cooked. Both are almost faultless — the duck’s skin could be crisper — and that judgment extends to several of the fish entrees, including sea bass swimming in potent flavors: black olives, anchovies, garlic, butter. Alto is now a full-throttle dining experience, no matter where on the menu you turn. Appetizers? There’s a creamy soup of puréed mushrooms — porcini, cremini, hen-of-the-woods — that’s infused with black truffle and so intensely earthy you find yourself taking joy-prolonging pauses between spoonfuls. Pasta dishes? Each of Mr. White’s astonishingly tender agnolotti is stuffed with a flavorful mix of meats —veal, rabbit, prosciutto, mortadella — and coated with a Parmesan fondue. As if that weren’t opulence enough, the dimpled purses of pasta are placed on an intense veal and barbera reduction. Handmade garganelli get not only Piave cheese and speck but also a measure of cream and — for a crucially leavening bitterness — Treviso radicchio. Mr. White brings a less certain hand to several underwhelming risotto dishes. And sweets are a question mark. I trust they’ll improve with a new pastry chef, Deborah Snyder, who worked at Lever House and just refashioned the dessert menus at both Alto and L’Impero, taming the excessive fanciness of Alto’s. But even a middling dessert performance wouldn’t undercut Alto’s formidable pleasures, including a noteworthy wine list and expert guidance through it. And while the restaurant’s look is still a chilly one, the addition of stylish green chairs, along with the warmth of Mr. White’s cooking, has helped significantly. L’Impero is now the restaurant with the more lugubrious air, all of that pleated drapery along the walls evoking the upholstered interior of a very large coffin. A brown and gray-blue color scheme doesn’t provide much spiritual relief. The pasta dishes — nearly as memorable here as at Alto — do. L’Impero’s answer to Alto’s agnolotti is ravioli filled with ground oxtail and glossed with an oxtail jus. In place of Alto’s garganelli are fusilli sauced with a pork shoulder ragù and melted caciocavallo cheese. And the restaurant asserts its southern Italian orientation with exceptional orecchiette in a broccoli rabe pesto, a suitably bitter foil for salty, fatty chunks of pork sausage. Having eaten only twice at L’Impero when Mr. Conant ran the kitchen, I cannot confidently say whether the restaurant has lost ground since its early years. Eric Asimov awarded it three stars in The Times in 2002. But its menu harbors more disappointments than Alto’s, and its kitchen is less polished. A few appetizers — a salt cod fritter skirted by tomato sauce and Manila clams; crispy sweetbreads with pancetta, onions and lentils — were busier than necessary. While grilled big-eye tuna was the perfect degree of rareness (and had the irresistible company of fried cauliflower), grilled swordfish was frighteningly undercooked, its center frigid. Better to stick with the roasted guinea hen, succulent and spoiled rotten by pancetta and Marsala. If you order wisely and with any luck, what you can experience at L’Impero, which also has a terrific wine list, is one of the most affordable great dinners in the city, four courses for $64. At Alto a four-course dinner costs $79, and it’s worth it, because Chris Cannon and the other owners of this restaurant (and L’Impero) have taken the occasion of Mr. Conant’s departure to make necessary fixes. They’ve banished much of Alto’s self-consciousness and, in the process, found it more of a soul. L’Impero ** 45 Tudor City Place (near 42nd Street); (212) 599-5045 or limpero.com.

849,Daniel,★★★,20090120,Frank Bruni,Upper East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/21/dining/reviews/21rest.html,"IF you haven’t dined at Daniel in the last four and a half months, you haven’t dined at Daniel. You may have had food as impressive in its precision  — and as gloriously wanton in its luxuriousness  — as it is today. You may have had Daniel’s charmed and charming service, which at times seems more like sorcery, the attendants swirling in and stealing away almost imperceptibly, set into motion by nothing more than the subtle raising of your eyes (they notice it) or the mere contemplation of craning your neck (they sense it). But you experienced all of this in a tritely romantic setting that was dated from the very instant of the restaurant’s debut in its current location 10 years ago. Pastel, frilly and feminine, the décor at Daniel brought to mind the lining of a prim octogenarian’s underwear drawer. Not anymore. After a late-summer sprucing-up so extensive it was more transplant than lift, Daniel has a swaggering metallic shimmer in place of that simpering rosy glow. The main colors chosen by the chef Daniel Boulud and the designer Adam Tihany, whose firm was also responsible for Per Se’s décor, are more neutral: silvery gray, chocolate brown. The lines are sharper. As a result the neo-Classical bones of the place  — those Greek-style columns and arches that skirt the main dining room, a miniature Parthenon of pleasure  — stand out in a way they didn’t before. Daniel was always fancy; now it’s genuinely gorgeous, too. And that’s almost reason enough to reaffirm the four stars the restaurant was awarded by William Grimes in The New York Times in 2001. But the contemporary French menu and the service make their own contributions, usually measuring up to the extremely high standards the restaurant has established. All in all Daniel remains one of New York’s most sumptuous dining experiences. And while it yields fewer transcendent moments than its four-star brethren and falls prey to more inconsistency, it has a distinctive and important niche in that brood, a special reason to be treasured. Among the handful of elegant restaurants that maintain the rituals once synonymous with superior cuisine and cling to an haute French style, Daniel is the most straightforward, the one with the fewest tics or tweaks. It’s  the truest link to the past. Le Bernardin has its microfocus of seafood. Jean Georges has its mission of lightening French cooking, finding alternatives to cream and reductions. Per Se does its bombastic strut, with discourses on ingredients that are equal parts tutorial and sonnet. Daniel is the least peculiar, the least narrow and the  most universal member of this exalted clan, to the extent that “universal” can be applied to any restaurant charging $105 for three courses. That’s a lot of money, and not just in lean times. But you get a lot for it. In fact there are moments during a meal at Daniel when you may well wonder why it isn’t more expensive, given how much staff is required for service like this; how much pinpoint labor must be lavished on dishes with so many facets and such stunning physical architecture; how much cooking goes into the amuse-bouches alone; how much plotting goes into the ceremony. At restaurants considered much less exclusive, you could spend only $30 less on a similar amount of food, and you wouldn’t get anything approaching Daniel’s bells and whistles. These flourishes make you feel that you’ve slipped into a monarch’s robes, if only for a night, and turn an evening into an event. Take note of the dotted circles, a visual motif woven into the restaurant’s new design. They’re on the welcome mat outside. And on the carpeting inside. And on the china, the cotton damask napkins and even the plush, thick paper hand towels in the restrooms. They tell you just how attentive to detail Daniel is determined to be, and the food immediately underscores that, every dinner commencing with a triptych of amuse-bouches that toy with a single ingredient: sweet potato one night, broccoli another. On my most recent visit the ingredient was beets, and to the left was a Lilliputian beet salad with horseradish and candied walnut. To the right was a domino of beet-cured hamachi with an exquisite texture and a ruby gloss. But it was the intense beet velouté in the middle that made me smile widest, because with it was the tiniest, most delicate grissini I’d ever seen, a nub of duck prosciutto on one end. It looked like a hummingbird’s Q-tip. Dish after dish had visual and gustatory starbursts like that. With a foie gras terrine came a Napoleon of pale almond mousse and dark prune paste. Those layers had not only luster but larger purpose. The mousse echoed almonds encrusting the terrine. Mr. Boulud’s kitchen, with Jean François Bruel as the executive chef for five years, likes to do that: tie together different parts of a dish with overlapping notes. In a trifurcated yellowfin tuna appetizer, chive enlivened both tuna carpaccio and the sliced cucumber on which tuna tartare rested. There was more cucumber in the sauce for the third tuna variation, seared toro. The kitchen sealed the deal with glittering black caviar on the tartare, which would otherwise have been the most timid of the players. Mr. Boulud gives more and better thought than many chefs do to amplifying familiar luxuries. Lamb? In addition to a roasted chop seasoned with vadouvan (like a gentle curry powder), there was roasted loin meat with more vadouvan and a Moroccan-style cigarette of crisp pastry stuffed with braised lamb shoulder. Although grounded in France, Mr. Boulud reaches around the world. Dover sole was crusted with bone marrow, which was also in a sauce of red wine and green pepper. Sea scallops got a crust of shredded pastry, its crunchiness a matter of textural one-upmanship over the usual sear. While the distinction of many dishes is a judicious intricacy, the strength of others is their focus: how intensely they taste of their central ingredient, like the porcini in a velouté with Cognac and braised Scottish hare leg, or the red-legged partridge in a stunning consommé. Achieving such resounding flavors takes serious skill and effort, which make Daniel’s clunker rate  — slightly higher than a restaurant as ambitious as this one’s should be  — puzzling. I had a few entrees, like bacon-wrapped monkfish with tough lobster in the middle, that lacked almost any inspiration or finesse. The kitchen made basic missteps, like overcooking the chop in that beguiling lamb tableau. And yet I never walked out the door feeling less than elated. Maybe that’s because Daniel has the smarts to finish strong, presenting an unusually broad and exceptionally fine dessert selection, about half of it devoted, in a manner you could almost call populist, to chocolate in various forms, with various partners. The other half is fruity, and maybe even better, the pastry chef Dominique Ansel adds brush stroke upon brush stroke to these colorful works of art. Cilantro-poached pineapple was joined by not only coconut ganache and coconut cream but also coconut meringue, a coconut sablé and a piña colada sorbet. It was a Bahamian beach vacation on a plate. The wine list is superb, and not mainly because the snootiest lover of red and white Burgundies will encounter scores of desirable bottles. Less affluent diners will find great choices at lower prices, and can readily get however much direction they seek. I savored Daniel’s cheese selection, too, but no one of the restaurant’s attributes was as persuasive as the way they worked together, covering the full spectrum of indulgence. It’s for coddling this thorough that lovers of fine dining turn to restaurants like Daniel, which safeguards a graciousness that deserves to survive any change in fashions and fortunes.

854,Bar Stuzzichini,★,20070912,Frank Bruni,Flatiron,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/12/dining/reviews/12rest.html,"WITH the exception of most steakhouses, where bigger will probably always be better, upscale restaurants in New York these days don’t sell themselves with the heft of their portions. They compete to see who can feed us less, or at least who can package food in the daintiest, most diminutive manner. It’s what many of us want: a sequence of dishes not supersize but undersize; the broadest array of tastes for the lowest calorie count; second (and third) courses without second (or third) chins. So we’ve become polyglots of the picayune. We ask for mezes in a Middle Eastern or Turkish restaurant, for tapas or pintxos in a Spanish one. And in an Italian osteria or trattoria? A new place just south of Madison Square Park has come along to introduce us to a noun more musical than antipasti for the small rations of seafood, cured meats, cheese and crostini that we crave. It’s called Bar Stuzzichini, and it serves, well, stuzzichini, a word for appetizers that’s derived from the verb stuzzicare, which can mean “to provoke,” “to stimulate” or “to tantalize.” The restaurant’s agents of tantalization include creamy sheep’s milk ricotta seasoned with saffron and drizzled with honey; ethereal buffalo’s milk ricotta stuffing involtini of thinly sliced eggplant; fried meatballs, each consumed in one crunchy, happy bite; and a tangle of astonishingly tender octopus, poached and then grilled, which is a smart way to treat an octopus. On a given night there are some 25 stuzzichini in all, each priced between $5 and $10. Only a fool would order them individually because $22 buys any combination of five, and that’s a deal that gives Bar Stuzzichini something to crow about, a hook in a city and era of determined grazers. Unfortunately, it needs one. I say that not because it’s a deeply troubled restaurant  — it’s only a modestly, intermittently troubled one — but because a place like Bar Stuzzichini, which opened with little fanfare in early June, must struggle to be noticed, more than it should have to. It doesn’t have the ready-made advantages of a scene like Wakiya, tucked in a hotel  — the Gramercy Park  — that has been given a voguish buffing by Ian Schrager. Unlike Gemma, in the Bowery Hotel, it’s not being run by canny impresarios of buzz. What’s more, it’s plying a genre that puts it in the crowded company of Accademia di Vino and Aurora SoHo and Centro Vinoteca and any number of other Italian restaurants that have opened in Manhattan over the last three months or will open over the next three. But it’s an honorable effort worthy of note. Its dishes include more successes than failures, whether they’re stuzzichini, bowls of pasta or conventional entrees, all available here. And the very best dishes redeem the flawed service, which can be distracted or perfunctory; the unflattering lighting; and the vastness of the space the restaurant inhabits, less evocative of a homey trattoria or cozy osteria than a Midtown mess hall. There’s only one alluring cluster of perches: the stools at a white marble counter deep inside. The counter faces a meat slicer, a ready hunk of prosciutto di Parma and a posse of garrulous stuzzichini preparers. I sat there the first time I went. And after relishing the meatballs and the octopus, I noticed, among the selection of pasta dishes, an intriguing mingling of northern and southern Italian influences. From the north: thin noodles of fresh tagliolini, made in-house, and a touch of cream. From the south, this restaurant’s principal reference point: pistachios, used in a pesto with no cheese. Add some lemon zest and you have a vibrant, rich knockout. It persuaded me to return to Bar Stuzzichini and delve deeper into the menu, which permits the construction of a terrific meal but doesn’t ensure one. Rigatoni with a mixed meat ragù was a waste, the meat overcooked, the seasonings indistinct. Grilled tuna should have been rescued from the grill a few minutes sooner. And a lunchtime frittata was bland and somewhat rubbery. The kitchen, supervised by Paul Di Bari, whose pan-ethnic experience includes stints at Wallsé and Balthazar, doesn’t take big risks and may not be capable of them, especially given the restaurant’s scale. But when it’s operating smoothly, the outcomes are impressive: pliant gnocchi in a perky sauce of tomato, red pepper and guanciale; orecchiette mixed with gorgeously caramelized cauliflower, bread crumbs and salty, jagged bits of pecorino; lemony chicken, cooked under a brick, with tender meat under crisp skin. This is straightforward food at sensible prices ($12 for the orecchiette, $17 for the chicken). It’s complemented by an all-Italian wine list, less enterprising than comprehensive, that emphasizes southern Italy and makes about 20 wines available by the quartino at no greater cost than some restaurants charge for a glass. The mostly tradition-conscious desserts  — unremarkable cannoli, an irreproachable affogato  — are done by Carolyn Renny. Along with her husband, Gerard, she is one of the restaurant’s owners. The Rennys also operate Sushi-a-go-go near Lincoln Center and apparently believe in the power of extra syllables. But not of excessive serving sizes, and they’re not alone. Centro Vinoteca serves preappetizer snacks that it calls piccolini, or very small things. Our portions may be shrinking, but our vocabulary only grows.

855,The Orchard,Two Stars,20060222,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/22/dining/reviews/border-jumping-as-a-culinary-sport.html,"JOHN LAFEMINA'S first restaurant, Peasant, romances Italy to the point of presenting a menu entirely in Italian. Servers stand over your table and, item by item, for minutes on end, channel Berlitz instructors. At his second restaurant, Ápizz, a bilingual menu relieves servers and diners of the lengthy tutorials. But the food remains fixed on Italy, and a wood-burning oven, the visual and spiritual cynosure of Peasant, is the focal point of Ápizz as well. Mr. LaFemina's new restaurant, the Orchard, finds him in a much different frame of mind. Its menu sticks to English. The kitchen, without a wood-burning oven, is hidden from view. And while Italy again seems to be his touchstone, he touches down in many other places as well. Along with risotto and agnolotti, he serves a Latin-themed appetizer of lobster empanadas and an Asian-inflected starter of grilled slices of filet mignon wrapped in butter lettuce and paired with a chimichurri pesto and sriracha mayonnaise. In place of the more conventional pizzas at Peasant and Ápizz, he bakes crispy, rectangular sheets for what he labels flatbreads, which have unexpected toppings: a combination of steak tartare and Dijon-flavored potatoes; a mix of braised short ribs and creamy horseradish. His evolution is an interesting one, on its own terms and in a larger sense. The Orchard typifies this culinary moment, when more and more restaurants don't just flit tentatively across a few borders but knock down a whole bunch of them altogether. I don't mean familiar fusions, like Thailand and France, or pan-Asian excursions with stops in Japan, China and India. I'm not referring to those generically ecumenical menus, prevalent in glorified lounges and nondescript hotels, that traffic in alleged spring rolls, nominal quesadillas, beef satay and chicken teriyaki. I'm thinking of new restaurants with serious ambitions and uncommon culinary partnerships. Take Dani, which constructs a bridge between northern Africa and southern Italy. Or Morimoto, where an appetizer ""pizza"" bedecks a tortilla with raw bluefin tuna, an anchovy aioli and jalapeño. It's Asian, Italian, a nod to Nobu, a wink at Taco Bell. The Orchard bops around the globe in a less flamboyant fashion, but it, too, covers great distances. And while the itinerary may not be coherent, the trip is a world of fun. Atmospherically, the restaurant embodies its Lower East Side neighborhood, taking unglamorous materials and applying a moody gloss. Its light maple chairs and tables are basic. The drab brown carpet beneath them better suits an office than a dining room. But Mr. LaFemina has installed lighting that bathes everything in a seductive orange glow, a magical, last-gasp sunset that never ends. He has bound the menus in suede. The little flourishes add up, giving the Orchard real style. The restaurant, which opened in November, bears only a slight resemblance to its forebears. At Peasant, which opened in 2000, the kitchen is under the control of the restaurant's co-owner, Frank DeCarlo. At Ápizz, which came along two years later, Mr. LaFemina runs the whole show and supervises the cooking but doesn't give himself as much license to experiment as he does here. The Orchard's excellent flatbreads, their crusts about as thin and crispy as they can be without disintegrating, provide a case in point. Of the five on the current menu, only one has cheese, wedding robiola to sautéed spinach, bacon and dried cranberries. Appetizers appear in a category on the menu just below the flatbreads, and that's where you'll find the beef wraps and empanadas, both somewhat disappointing, along with several respectable, pro forma salads and a yellowfin tuna tartare that might not jump out at you. Try it, because the tuna is part of an amusing, flavor-building assembly kit. You scoop some of it onto one of many round, deep-fried slices of green plantain, put some guacamole over the tuna and some crème fraîche on top of that. The entrees are more straightforward, and they do a more uniformly successful job of showcasing the strengths and skill of the kitchen. It prepared fish with care, producing succulent halibut and equally fine arctic char, the latter adorned with identically coin-shaped slices of purple potatoes and pickled cucumbers. Lamb tenderloin was pounded into thin sheets; seasoned with shallots, cilantro, parsley, basil and thyme; and then rolled into cylinders before being grilled. A creamy mint orzo beside the meat took a good dish and made it even better. The flavorful risotto brimmed with sautéed langoustines, braised octopus and roasted red, yellow and orange peppers. The daringly sweet, dauntlessly rich agnolotti were filled with a purée of butternut squash and brown sugar and sauced with vin santo, cream and toasted hazelnuts. Among the desserts there was yet another appealing assembly project, custard-filled tarts that needed a final application of fruit. Raspberries and blueberries waited in the wings. The tarts came in a group of five, as did a brightly colored phalanx of carrot cupcakes, some with a cream cheese frosting, others with carrot custard on top. They captured the Orchard's playful spirit. Behind the scenes, that spirit is being challenged by Mr. LaFemina's battle with his local community board. The board has thus far blocked his liquor license, a financial setback for him but a cost-saving opportunity for diners, who can bring their own bottles without incurring a corkage fee. He has a wine list ready to go, and Italy shares space on it with Germany, New Zealand, Chile and Argentina, among other countries. Mr. LaFemina said he doesn't want to be ethnically pigeonholed, when it comes to both drink and food, even though that reluctance leaves him hard-pressed for accurate names and characterizations. He initially identified that filet mignon appetizer as a wrap, then designated it a salad, then went back to wrap. In a telephone conversation he said he still wasn't sure about the tag.

864,or Ahn,One Star,20051109,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/09/dining/reviews/so-ambitious-so-impossibly-thin.html,"A BEWITCHING theater for a new kind of Asian fusion, D'or Ahn isn't a great restaurant, and on its clumsier nights it isn't even a very good one. But it's a terrific example of why anyone who loves eating out has to love New York, a welcome reminder of the optimism and the deep well of ideas that drive the city's dining scene. Look first at D'or Ahn's neighborhood, on the western edge of Chelsea. Where the Red Cat prowled for years without all that many serious competitors, a crowded field has emerged: Tia Pol and its tapas, Bette and its truffled fries, Cookshop and its spit-roasted rabbit. Look next at D'or Ahn's menu. Pickled cabbage consorts with pecorino and pine nuts atop flat bread, adding up to kimchi pizza and underscoring the melting of borders -- the mingling of so many ethnic traditions -- in the city's kitchens. New York's polyglot population once meant Chinese beside Japanese, a falafel shop near a kosher butcher. Now it means Korean and Italian in the same kitchen, or Korean and French, which is the main partnership behind D'or Ahn. The name of the restaurant hitches the French word for gold to the surname of the restaurant's owner, Lannie Ahn. Ms. Ahn, 31, arrived in New York from Seoul, South Korea, when she was a teenager. She later worked in marketing for Coca-Cola, and a few years ago she decided, in the way that food-loving dreamers do, that her calling was to open a restaurant. Casting about for the right location, she found an easily overlooked sliver of a building that used to be an Afghan joint. Casting about for a chef, she found another Korean-American, Rachel Yang, whose résumé included stints at Alain Ducasse at the Essex House and at Per Se. D'or Ahn opened in early September, although you had to keep your eyes peeled. It's a strangely diffident place, especially on the outside, where Ms. Ahn has compounded the building's inconspicuousness by spelling out the restaurant's name in stainless steel against gray concrete. The heavy wood door looks more like a command to stay away than an invitation to come in. Walk through it and you're confounded anew. The restaurant's interior is unexpectedly enchanting: a shrewd, stylish use of a slender space. The tall tables on one side are formed by a union of stools and raised banquettes. The short tables on the other side, for twosomes only, call to mind library carrels. Beyond them is an eye-catching glass-walled storage area for wine. Ms. Ahn flutters about, approaching diners with a spoken introduction to the restaurant that should be more practiced than it is. She talks about French standards, Korean flair, eclecticism. She sometimes repeats herself and resorts to a recitation of dishes. She seems at once ecstatic and slightly pained, inspired and unnerved, all of which may well foreshadow your own reaction to D'or Ahn. It's loaded with charm, rife with frustrations and impossible to pigeonhole. Its Korean bent is obvious in the appearance of kimchi in various forms, on various dishes. Even when kimchi exits the picture, there's often some pickling afoot. But the Korean influence on the cooking here is usually subtler -- the ginseng flavoring of the rice stuffing in roasted poussin, for example -- and sometimes tangential. Obeying the current Manhattan mandate, D'or Ahn devotes one section of its menu to uncooked or lightly cooked fish, concocting rolls and salads that represent its answer to diners' appetites for sushi and crudo. During my visits, there was fluke that had been marinated with kelp and was paired with lemon risotto. Silvery pieces of cured jackfish stippled a tangle of frisée. Arugula coddled rectangles of ""toro prosciutto,"" a concept that does not need to be explored again. Modestly portioned dishes -- a k a small plates -- dominate D'or Ahn's menu, claiming four of the five savory sections (""raw,"" ""cold,"" ""hot"" and ""side""). These dishes included that kimchi pizza, which was too sweet for me; a version of bibimbop, the classic Korean rice dish, its appearance and appeal enhanced by rivulets of black sesame dressing and brush strokes of red chili paste; and thin wedges of cold duck breast, which had been smoked with pine needles and anointed with a foie gras vinaigrette. The most riveting of the small plates, and one of the least small, was thin slices of eye round of beef, which had been dusted with sweet rice flour and seared in oil. These cutlets were more ethereal than I realized fried beef could be -- maybe too ethereal, and thus an illustration of one of the restaurant's frustrations. The kitchen turned out a great deal of food more intriguing than satisfying, with a sense of surprise that wasn't matched by a payoff in flavor. An exception was that terrific poussin, one of a handful of entrees on a section of the menu titled ""more."" But its pairing with a superfluous ""natural jus cappuccino,"" served in a cup and meant to be sipped, exemplified the restaurant's mannered tendencies. Inventiveness and affectation are next-door neighbors, and D'or Ahn leaps frequently over the fence between the two. An oxtail ragout was advertised as an accompaniment for slices of rib-eye, but what and where was it? The answer: A thin, inconsequential layer in the middle of a dry, unappealing mung bean cake, which gave the plate another component and geometric element but no more appeal. D'or Ahn's other major shortcoming is inconsistency. I had that rib-eye on multiple occasions, and it was always different -- in portion size, in tenderness, even, it seemed, in the quality of the meat. Poached black cod was unusually dry one time, wonderfully silken the next. It came with a mustard bread pudding that found D'or Ahn on the desirable side of that fence. But whichever way D'or Ahn leapt, the gesture commanded attention. I wasn't conventionally delighted by the fiery chili ice cream with a Korean pear upside-down cake, but I was transfixed by it. Ms. Ahn and Ms. Yang haven't nailed what they're trying to do at D'or Ahn -- the resounding successes don't outnumber the curiosities yet -- but their effort is an earnest, thoughtful and welcome one. D'or Ahn  * [Rating: One Star]  207 10th Avenue (22nd Street), Chelsea; (212) 627-7777. ATMOSPHERE -- A sexy sliver of a space with dim lighting and about 45 seats. SOUND LEVEL -- Loud when crowded, but not excruciatingly so. RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Duck breast with foie gras vinaigrette; mushroom bibimbop; eye round of beef; stuffed poussin; Korean-style bouillabaisse.

865,Pasta Flyer,★,20180123,Pete Wells,Greenwich Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/dining/pasta-flyer-martina-review.html,"Successful fast food restaurants have to be clean, efficient and consistent. As far as I can tell, though, it’s never been necessary for the people who run them to care about food. How would you even tell? It would be like watching a porn film to assess the work of the dialect coach. Mark Ladner was the chef at Del Posto for a decade, steering it to a four-star review from The New York Times in 2010, and at Lupa for five years before that. Leaving all that behind, in October he opened Pasta Flyer, a restaurant in Greenwich Village where pasta in a compostable sugar-cane-fiber bowl costs between $7 and $8.75 and is cooked in less than a minute while you watch. If you tasted the fusilli with pesto, say, or the fettuccine Alfredo, and didn’t know Mr. Ladner’s history, you probably wouldn’t guess that it had been made by one of the city’s greatest pasta cooks. But you’d be able to tell in a second that it was made by somebody who cared about food. The texture is the first thing most cheap pasta places screw up. Pasta Flyer doesn’t screw it up. The noodles are firm and chewy, with a happy little bounce. Partly this is because they’re not overcooked, but Mr. Ladner is also buying excellent dry pasta from Italy. It’s similar to the imported stuff I like to buy when I cook at home, which costs almost as much by the pound as a bowl does at Pasta Flyer. The rigatoni is made with whole grain and the penne is gluten free; they’re both as supple and smooth as the three shapes made from semolina. The sauces — which can be matched with any pasta — are pesto, beef ragù, Alfredo and marinara, with or without meatballs. You might see that and say, “Ah, classics.” Or you might say, “sounds kind of basic?”, with a rising inflection signifying that “basic” is not a compliment. Your response will mirror your attitude toward Pasta Flyer as a whole. I’m in the classic group. The basil pesto looks a little too glossy, more purée than paste, but it has the advantage of insinuating itself all over the pasta (fusilli is the default shape) and it still tastes like aged cheese and toasted pine nuts. The marinara is lively on its own and an agreeable partner for the meatballs, which are of the fine-ground, spicy, sausagelike school. The ragù is lovely, if a little pale and lean. The Alfredo sauce, sweetly dripping from the fettuccine like rain from a leaf, hit me like a prescription opiate that had been specifically engineered for my opiate receptors. It’s been a long time since I’d had fettuccine Alfredo. Those who expect ingenuity from Mr. Ladner should be happy with the garlic dots. Everybody should be happy with the garlic dots, little fried puffs of choux pastry brushed with garlic butter. Like the browned slices of lasagna that you can eat with your fingers, they’re street-fair food from a more advanced civilization. A few small vegetable sides, like a sweet-and-sour fried cauliflower with golden raisins, can be had, along with crisp little chopped salads. That’s about it. Dessert, in the form of tiramisù cannoli, will shuffle onstage later this week. Once your pasta is sauced and you’ve helped yourself to a fork, a napkin and a tray, you settle the tab — paying is the slowest part of the whole procedure — and look for a table. These were plentiful on my three visits, particularly at night. I learned to avoid the seats directly under the satellite dish that hangs from the ceiling and echoes conversations held under it, disconcertingly. It’s an artifact of Mr. Ladner’s fixation on flying saucers, also seen in the door-handle design and in the doctoring of a blown-up photograph of the Roman Forum that covers one wall. In other words, Pasta Flyer is not where you take somebody you need to impress. For some reason, this is how our culture defines success for chefs: by how well their food performs the task of being impressive to a date, an employer or a fan of restaurant dining. Mr. Ladner, though, is using his skill, knowledge and connections not to make special-occasion fireworks but to make ordinary food that many people can afford. Pasta Flyer isn’t spectacular, but it’s still a major achievement. I’ve eaten a lot of supposedly cheap pasta, and it’s never as good as what Mr. Ladner is serving. There’s precedent for devoting specialized attention to the problems of everyday living among architects and industrial designers, who may toggle between showpiece commissions and small, affordable houses. Lately the idea has begun to occur to chefs, including Daniel Patterson and Roy Choi in California, and Mr. Ladner’s old pastry chef, Brooks Headley. Do enough people in Greenwich Village want $8 rigatoni to make Pasta Flyer a success? In a way, the location would work better if it didn’t have to bear the weight of being the only one in town. As a solitary prototype, the restaurant has an odd, expectant air, as if it’s ready for a crowd that hasn’t shown up.  Nick Anderer and Danny Meyer have been pursuing similar goals in the pizza universe. Martina, which opened in the East Village in the fall, is the less expensive younger sibling to Marta, their Roman pizzeria in NoMad. The prices run from $7.50 to $11.50 for a pizza that will serve one not-too-hungry person. Martina is supposed to be fast, too, although that hasn’t always been my experience. One night my pizza arrived 19 minutes after I’d ordered it — hardly a land-speed record. You do save some time ordering and paying at Martina’s counter, but speed isn’t the real selling point. Martina’s charm is that it is a neighborhood place where nothing is a big deal, but where attention has been paid to all the little deals. If the idea of fagioli al fiasco with pizza appeals to you, the ones at Martina are excellent, as are the arancini, cylindrical fritters of creamy rice cooked with tomatoes. The wine list is a thumbnail version of Marta’s, but the few wines are good ones; as at Marta, you’re encouraged to drink sparkling wine in full or half bottles, kept here in an open refrigerator case facing the dining room. The pizza is in the style of Roman neighborhood joints. The crusts are flat, extremely thin, pale and crisp, but not crunchy. They’re softer than the ones at Marta, which snap like crackers. The crust is merely a vehicle; what interest these pies hold is entirely in their toppings. Covered with mushrooms, say, or pork sausage with broccoli rabe, or grated cheese and shaved brussels sprouts, they can be very good. But the simple margherita is a bore. For dessert, there’s vanilla soft-serve, either over espresso or under simple toppings like olive oil, sea salt, candied hazelnuts or chocolate sauce. Simple as it is, it helps make Martina into a restaurant instead of a pit stop. (Mr. Ladner might take notes here.) Neither Martina nor Pasta Flyer is trying to be a thrill ride. But finding a quick, cheap meal that betrays signs of actual care can be a thrill of its own. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

868,Mercat,★,20070704,Frank Bruni,NoHo,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/04/dining/reviews/04rest.html,"ONE of my dining companions raved about the texture of the patatas bravas, which were all crunchy angles and slopes, as airy as they could be without facing charges of impersonating a potato chip. At least I think he did. Through the roar of noise at Mercat, the newest New York restaurant to pay tribute to the cooking of Catalonia, I could register just two of every five syllables he uttered. The others I had to deduce, or intuit, playing the role of forensic conversationalist. Minutes later, another companion swooned over the slow-blooming richness of the restaurant’s short noodles with squid ink. In her case, too, laudatory words were spoken, and in her case, too, I couldn’t make all of them out. Talking with tablemates at Mercat can be like watching an in-flight movie when you haven’t purchased the earphones. You get the gist of things, but it requires lip-reading, guesswork and faith. Some wonderful food, some clangorous acoustics: these are the defining traits of Mercat, amplifying a familiar but distressingly persistent situation. Throughout the city and especially in downtown neighborhoods like the East Village, where Mercat makes its home, restaurants either engineer, or fail to remedy, a volume of sound that crosses far over the line between pulse-quickening and brain-rattling. At Mercat the din reflects the tradeoffs you have to accept for some serious cooking at moderate prices. You must make peace with a brick-and tile-walled space that becomes less inviting, its darkness more solemn than sexy, as you wade deeper into it; with confusion on the phone when you call for a reservation; with servers of sometimes curious dispositions, including a goofy waiter whose determination to test-drive his phrase-book Spanish prompted him to inquire, before removing one dish, “Finito, señor?” There’s just a short lineup of humdrum desserts, and the decibel count, in certain seats on busy nights, will be a deal breaker for many diners. That’s unfortunate, because the best of the uneven food at Mercat puts it in an esteemed league with slightly less noisy, more polished peers like Casa Mono and Boqueria, restaurants of fairly recent vintage that also recognize New Yorkers’ heightened interest in Spanish cuisine and in dining experiences loosely structured around modestly portioned dishes, whether those dishes qualify strictly as tapas or not. Mercat’s menu doesn’t bother with such divisions as appetizers and entrees, and encourages sampling by keeping the prices of most dishes below $15 and tossing an array of Spanish cheeses and hams into the mix. The restaurant’s layout also contributes to a sense that you can drop in for something less than a full meal. A fair share of the 65 seats on the main floor — there’s a lounge below, with finger food only — are at a long white marble bar up front or at a back counter facing an open kitchen. They’re more appealing than the seats at tables beneath a second-story wine loft. The restaurant’s owner, Jaime Reixach, who grew up in Barcelona and New York, supervised its design. Its cooking is under the control of David Seigal and Ryan Lowder, both of whom have worked  in Spain and, locally, at Jean Georges. Their sound instincts are evident in dishes with the right mix of textures, the right balance of flavors. Once its yolk is broken, the fried egg on top of sautéed mushrooms (honshimeji, oyster, bluefoot, morel) could produce too slick an effect, but shoestring potatoes are scattered about to keep things crisp. Mr. Seigal and Mr. Lowder have a way to make chickpeas more exciting than you’d expect. Add ham to the cooking liquid. Add crumbled blood sausage to the results. Then throw in toasted pine nuts, which also make an appearance, along with golden raisins, in a terrific dish of sautéed pea shoots. Their recurrence is welcome, as is the salty-sweet fencing they do with the fruit. Some of the dishes are straight from the genre playbook: blistered Padrón peppers, which were overcooked; a Spanish omelet, juicy with caramelized onions inside and streaked with a garlic aioli for added oomph; salt cod fritters, too bland on one visit and too oily on another; and those patatas bravas, which get another aioli, spiked with sweet pimentón and chili flakes, that’s applied in audaciously generous measure. Other dishes are more surprising, the short noodles foremost among them. Baked angel-hair pasta is combined with a reduction of seafood, white wine and brandy; squid ink; and nuggets of tender cuttlefish. On top goes a garlic aioli, rounding out the flavors while bathing the noodles in an irresistible creaminess. Mercat isn’t for delicate eaters, and it isn’t for anyone averse to saltiness, so excessive in the case of seared tuna with red peppers that it obliterated the taste of almost everything else. Seared monkfish with a romesco sauce also met too salty a fate, but then monkfish needs embellishment. It also needs not to be on quite so many menus. In general, seafood was less reliable than other fare. Guinea hen left the kitchen’s oft-used plancha — that’s where all the searing happens — with skin as crunchy and flesh as tender as you could desire. It was united with wax beans, English peas and, pivotally, cranberries, whose tart bid for attention gave the dish a sassier personality. The fresh horseradish on top of grilled hanger steak performed a similar function. In keeping with the restaurant’s spirit of freewheeling dining and abbreviated meals, it serves more than a dozen wines from its all-Spanish list by the glass. It also permits you to order a house white or rosé in a bulbous, long-nosed pitcher that looks like the offspring of a decanter and an aardvark. It’s called a porrón, and you hold it high and tilt its spout-snout toward your mouth to drink. As neighboring diners passed one around, wine splashed on them and they hooted uproariously. Around the same time, a stream of liquid from a knocked-over glass, bottle or porrón at another table splashed on me. Mercat can be a little too freewheeling. I’m pretty sure I said as much to my companions. I’m not at all sure they heard me. Mercat * 45 Bond Street (Bowery), East Village; (212) 529-8600. ATMOSPHERE  Informal and lively, courtesy of a long bar up front, an open kitchen, a central carving station for Spanish hams, and walls of white tile and exposed brick.

876,Carla Hall’s Southern Kitchen,★,20161004,Pete Wells,Columbia Street Waterfront District,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/dining/carla-hall-southern-kitchen-review.html,"For a long time, very few people thought there was money to be made selling hot chicken. This is almost certainly because for a long time, very few people outside certain neighborhoods in Nashville knew what hot chicken was. The ones who did know usually lived somewhere near Prince’s Hot Chicken Shack, which was known as Prince’s BBQ Chicken Shack until it was taken over by a member of the family who thought it was time to acknowledge that what the Princes did to chicken had nothing to do with barbecue. Prince’s is and always was a fried-chicken restaurant. The chicken was never cooked in advance. It spattered away in a skillet while the customer who had ordered it waited, and waited. But the thing that made Prince’s famous, to the extent that it was famous, was what happened to the chicken after it came out of the skillet. Still dripping with oil, the legs, thighs and breasts were given a glossy finish with spicy oil. Prince’s kitchen is a restricted area. The family guards the recipe for that oil fiercely. But the seasonings are said to include brown sugar, dried garlic, paprika and, crucially, cayenne. Depending on how much oil is applied, the cayenne can make a hot-chicken eater cry. When Anthony Bourdain was asked about the scariest situations he’d been in while filming his television shows, he named Congo, Libya and Beirut, followed by hot chicken in Nashville. Pain was the point all along. According to the family legend, which fortunately for everybody took shape long before fact-checking became a household phrase in America, Thornton Prince’s girlfriend cooked the first hot chicken for breakfast one morning during the Depression to get back at him for his nocturnal wanderings. Forgetting that revenge is best served cold, she loaded the chicken with spice, only to find that her unfaithful man loved hot chicken, shared hot chicken with his friends and made hot chicken into a business that has lasted more than 70 years. Although Prince’s had local competition from a hot chicken place started by a former cook, it was only in this decade that entrepreneurs began to think that cooking chicken that makes customers cry might be a good way to earn money. In the Nashville area there is Slow Burn, Pepperfire and Hattie B’s, among others. KFC began selling its version of Nashville hot chicken throughout the United States in January. Independent operators have set up across the country from Los Angeles to Cambridge, Mass., to Brooklyn, where Carla Hall opened a tiny Nashville chicken spot in June. Carla Hall’s Southern Kitchen doesn’t lack for branding. Slogans and catchphrases are written all over the menu and the walls, inside and outside on the corner of Kane and Columbia Streets. The place is so clearly positioned to spawn multiple locations that it almost seems pregnant. When you have decided whether you want thighs, drumsticks, breasts, tenders or some combination of these, one of the smiling people working at the counter will ask: “Do you want Southern, Hoot & Honey, Hoot, Hootie Hoot, Hoot-N-Nannie, or Boomshakalaka?” It’s like having a conversation with an owl. Even when you know that Ms. Hall, a host on “The Chew,” has been identified with the phrase “hootie hoo” since her days as a “Top Chef” contestant, this is not an easy question to answer the first time you hear it, or the second or third time, either. Most customers fall back on a number system, one to six. Level one, Southern, gets no hot oil and is easy enough to eat. Like all the chicken, it sits on white bread and has pickle slices pinned on it with toothpicks. Level two is slicked all over with just enough oil to give it a rounder flavor that is sweet, savory and spicy but not cruel. Heat tolerance is of course a personal thing, but at level three I became slightly more aware of my skin; at level four, I became conscious of the passing of time; at level five, I began tearing off chunks of white bread and stuffing them into my mouth. Level six gave me second thoughts, but not serious pain. (If you want to go to the dark side, the chicken for you is the extra hot at Peaches HotHouse in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, although the chile payload is delivered by a spice powder sprinkled over the top; parts of the crust that aren’t powdered just taste like regular fried chicken.) The meat at Carla Hall’s Southern Kitchen tastes natural, which is to say it hasn’t been twisted beyond recognition by aggressive brining of the kind practiced at Root & Bone and other places around town. Ms. Hall seems to have focused her efforts on the crust, and it is excellent, a darkish shell both formidably crunchy and a little chewy. Spice or no spice, this is not a style of fried chicken you often find in New York. The hottest and crunchiest chicken I ate was the one I waited longest for. The least exciting, though it was still well worth eating, was a piece of white meat that came out before I’d moved from a counter to one of the few chairs. This is a small restaurant, not built for lounging, and Ms. Hall may not want hungry crowds hanging out while the chicken sizzles away. But her recipe is good enough to make you wish every piece were cooked to order. The sides and desserts will not draw anybody to Columbia Street, but a few of them are very good. I tend to sigh when I hear that collards were cooked without meat, but Ms. Hall’s are lively and tangy; better, actually, than many pots of collards around town. No reforms have been inflicted on the candied yams, and that is good news. The pimento cheese, punched up with flecks of hot green pepper and served with a waxed-paper bag of Ritz crackers, was exactly what I hoped it would be. I felt the same way about the biscuits, which had a tenderness that tends to elude Northern cooks. The potato salad, on the other hand, needed perking up, and the macaroni and cheese was the opposite of creamy, a hard, bland lattice of noodles. The bread pudding was dried out, too, and something seemed to have gone wrong with the whoopie pies. They were dense and lumpy, as if a distracted baker had left out an ingredient. I can’t imagine why Ms. Hall is bothering with whoopie pies when her banana pudding is (a) charming, with caramelized bananas and a swirl of what looks like whipped cream but turns out to be a version of Marshmallow Fluff; and (b) the only dessert anybody needs after pimento cheese and fried chicken."
879,Lupulo,★★,20150721,Pete Wells,Chelsea,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/dining/restaurant-review-lupulo-in-chelsea.html,"If George Mendes did not have such a strong grip on the flavors and aromas of Portugal, Lupulo might have slipped away from him. It can be a confusing restaurant at first, its messages mixed, its fairly simple concept fuzzed over with complications. But give the place a chance, and you can find clarity in the smells of garlic and wood smoke that fill the dining room; in the way sweet paprika and cilantro sidle up to each other in olive oil; and in the fresh, firm seafood, the grilled sardines and carabineros, red as a lobster, their heads dripping with juices that are as rich and intense as any sauce. The restaurant may be unfocused, but the cooking isn’t. Mr. Mendes’s basic idea for Lupulo, which opened a few blocks south of Herald Square in April, was straightforward enough. The name means “hops,” and the place is his take on the beer-centered Portuguese taverns called cervejarias. The nearest American equivalent is probably a brewpub, which Lupulo resembles with its hard, low wooden chairs, its high ceilings and its U-shaped dining bar stretching off into the distance. The menu gets right into the beery spirit with food that’s left a little rough around the edges. The skin on chicken piri piri is black from the grill, but the meat is juicy right down to the bone. It shows up at the table with skinny French fries and a squeeze bottle of piri piri, the hot sauce that suggests Portuguese people have an advanced understanding of pain’s pleasures. Manila clams steamed open in vinho verde with cilantro and chopped spring garlic are simple and wonderful, especially when you soak some grilled bread in the pan sauce. Purists may be let down to find that Lupulo’s caracois are meaty Burgundian snails lying naked on a plate, not the smaller variety that people suck from their shells one by one on any summer afternoon in Lisbon. But wait until the purists get a taste of the rustic olive oil sauce, spiced with smoked paprika and chopped garlic that is warmed but not tamed. The Portuguese are masters of what Italians call cucina povera, the discipline of squeezing enjoyment out of inexpensive ingredients. Maybe you have wondered why anyone would choose to eat bread porridge? Try Lupulo’s version of açorda — mushy and crunchy at the same time, topped with a few carabineros and saturated with a shrimp-head stock that makes the room reel — and wonder no more. Mr. Mendes works the same humble sorcery on sweet spring peas cooked with choriço. The liquid yolk of a sunny-side-up egg waits to be poked and swirled around until it joins up with the fresh herbs laced into the peas. It has a close cousin, just as satisfying, in the bowl of bright-green favas with crunchy knobs of blood sausage and morels. At other times, the kitchen veers off message, with artsy swooshes and swirls that seem as if they’d be more at home serenely perched on the tablecloths at Mr. Mendes’s other, more formal restaurant, Aldea. You can spot these exiles from Chefville on the menu at a glance: the raw sockeye and darkly glittering caviar in buttermilk froth under radish wheels sliced thin enough to blow away, the grilled asparagus with dried and fresh sea urchin. From a branding standpoint, Mr. Mendes should probably ship these dishes off to Aldea. But I hope he doesn’t, because his forays into fussiness are at least as flavorful as the more broad-shouldered plates. And some, like the raw snapper with the stormy heat of fermented serrano peppers calmed by waves of coconut broth scented with makrut lime, are at least arguably Portuguese in a post-colonial sense, if you care to play those games in the face of inarguable deliciousness. Of course there is Portuguese wine, a short and solid list, but there is more energy and excitement in the beer menu. This document can be disorienting, though, at least on a first visit. Why open a cervejaria and turn over all the taps but two (recently there was one for a Spanish cider, another for the dry, likable Sagres lager from Portugal) to American craft breweries? Mr. Mendes has said in interviews that he features the United States simply because it makes more of the carefully, intelligently made beers he enjoys than Portugal, where small-scale brewing is a newer phenomenon. He gave Ryan Mauban, most recently seen fussing over the bottles and kegs at Torst in Brooklyn, the job of tracking down innovative brews from around the country. His list is short but packs in a lot of stylistic diversity: goses (see Eric Asimov’s Pour column this week) more tart than lemonade, Belgian-style ales with a barely-there hint of Thai basil. With dessert, Mr. Mauban may suggest a South Carolina stout brewed with cocoa, cinnamon and a flicker of habanero. It tastes like chocolate soda that grew up into an alluring stranger with a dark secret. In fact, it had more going for it than some of Alexander Zecena’s sweets, like the sleepy vanilla rice pudding, now off the menu, and the pasteis de nata, bite-size tarts of egg custard that were somehow both floury and not quite firm. But there is no point trying to resist the pudim Molotov, like the child of a flan and a marshmallow, or the eggy sponge cake next to a slice of soft, mildly sour sheep’s milk cheese. The menu, to give this dead horse one last whack, is kind of confusing. It is divided into Small Plates, Fish, Meat and Garden. Simple enough, until you’re told that all but the last four Fish entries are also small plates. That quirk is easier to get used to than the roar of Lupulo’s dining room at full tilt. The wall of traditional blue-and-white Portuguese ceramic tiles is pretty, but combined with the two walls of soaring window panels and all the bare wood, it guarantees that by 8 p.m. everybody will end up talking about how hard it is to talk. Full-tilt dining rooms may not be a problem for long if Lupulo doesn’t get an acoustic adjustment soon. It would be a shame if noise drove the crowds away, because Lupulo gets almost everything else right. On that point, there shouldn’t be any confusion."
881,Fatty Crab,★★,20090512,Frank Bruni,Upper West Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/13/dining/reviews/13rest.html,"IT’S probably self-defeating to begin a review by encouraging readers to step away from it. But if you’re online or can get there easily enough, go to the top of your browser and type in fattycrab.com. Then see — and, more to the point,   hear — what happens next. As a goofy yellow crab comes zooming toward you, a voice trills, “Fatty craaaaaaaab.” And it’s a loopy, mischievous, so-geeky-it’s-hip voice, the voice of someone who maybe just spent some serious time with a bong, the voice not of ironic detachment but of ironic enchantment. Did it make you giggle? Then I think you’ll really like this restaurant. Groan? Maybe you should stay away. In the end it’s not the Malaysian flavors or Manhattan tropes — both present here in the extreme — that will dictate your response to the new Fatty Crab, an upsize Upper West Side spinoff of the scruffy, scrappy downtown   favorite. It’s your sense of play, your appetite for a certain kind of giddy, sloppy abandon. It’s your eagerness to eat with your fingers and to make slurping noises as you mouth-wrestle with slippery noodles and to feel a flush in your cheeks as chilies light up your tongue. It’s your readiness to trade certain niceties of atmosphere and etiquette for the festive distraction of the fatty dog, a pork shoulder  sausage that’s seasoned with XO sauce and tucked into not just a bun but a party: pickled chili, pickled radish, pickled garlic and mayonnaise, all threatening to tumble or ooze onto your shirt. Are you likely to be done with that dog in half the bites and half the time that a truly composed, civilized diner would accord it? And then to wonder if you should have ordered two? That’s the Fatty spirit, the culinary equivalent of a stoner’s foggy contentment. The original Fatty Crab opened more than three and half years ago and affirmed Zak Pelaccio as one of a band of brash young chefs, David Chang also among them, who would perish without pork, who live to pickle and who equate fattiness with godliness. At Fatty Crab he wed this newly voguish sensibility to the fish sauces, fire, coconut and curries of Southeast Asia. Debates ensued about the authenticity of it all, but they missed the point. The food was fun, even irresistible. It remains so, for the most part, at the second Fatty Crab, which has about 70 indoor seats to its forebear’s 30 and — blessedly — takes reservations. These seats are typically full: Mr. Pelaccio and his team gambled correctly that while Upper West Side diners may not be quite as adventurous as their downtown counterparts, they’d spark to high-impact flavors at relatively low-impact prices, made possible in part by all the starchy elements (noodles, rice) afoot. Are its flavors in fact too big, too unrelenting? What qualifies as a bold deployment of chilies and aiolis, and what’s just indiscriminate overkill? Many a meal at Fatty Crab raises those questions and walks a fine line, but pretty much every time I began to doubt the kitchen’s care and skill, something came along to restore my belief. On one visit it was the green mango salad, crunchy with cucumber, vibrant with cilantro, some judiciously scattered crushed peanuts lending just the right oomph without dumbing down the production, the dressing a precise medley of sugary, spicy and tart notes. On other visits it was the kang kong belacan, which is Chinese water spinach cooked in a wok with a sambal of chili peppers and shrimp paste that gives it a prickly heat all its own. Both of those dishes have been served at the downtown Fatty Crab and are being reproduced here. That’s true as well of the pork belly with pickled watermelon, a Fatty signature; of the wickedly enjoyable fatty duck, which is fried and given a few sweet, syrupy accents; and of the gangly, wet heap of Dungeness crab, served in the shell. That last dish seals crab’s status as the mother-in-law in the family  of crustaceans — an enormous amount of labor with an uncertain payoff. I’d advise skipping it but for its  chili-sparked broth, which can be sopped up with hunks of thick toast. The uptown Fatty Crab also has some proprietary fare, including the fatty dog; a whole-fish preparation that changes nightly; and my favorite of the uneven noodle dishes, the hokkien mee, slick with black vinegar and flecked with shrimp, clams and bits of flatiron steak. A few of the dishes that most closely approximated conventional entrees were disappointments, among them a bland poached bass and a stringy brick of short rib that didn’t do justice to its complex sauce. The restaurant puts almost no energy into dessert, providing just one, free of charge: a terrific coconut panna cotta.  That’s no doubt a signal that lingering isn’t appreciated; tables must be turned. Fatty Crab isn’t rigged to relax you. It’s rollicking and sparely decorated, with little catching the eye beyond huge ceiling fans — just the right  tropical touch. But the bar, appealingly situated deep inside the restaurant, is inviting. So are the cocktail list, assembled with ingenuity and inspiration, and the selection of wines, tailored to the spicy cooking. For an especially spirited white,   try the Philippe Bornard Savagnin. At $66 a bottle, it’s a splurge in the context of this accessibly priced list. And if you drop by on a weekend morning, you’ll encounter additional dishes worth trying, like a sandwich with eight slices of bacon, some egg, mayonnaise and pickled ramps. In an e-mail message as illustrative of the Fatty mind-set as that trilling voice on the Web site, Mr. Pelaccio explained that this sandwich was adapted from a snack that one of his cooks threw together one day and was eating “with a guilty smirk on his face.” “I just had to know why,” Mr. Pelaccio wrote. “I grabbed the end of his bun and put it in my mouth (yep) and said, ‘Dude, let’s put this on the brunch menu.’ ” May it stay there for a good long while.

885,Aquavit,★★★,20100720,Sam Sifton,Midtown East,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/21/dining/reviews/21rest.html,"IT has been a Swedish summer here in New York. There seem to be Stieg Larsson novels on every fourth lap on the D train choogling over the Manhattan Bridge, on every third iPad glowing in the dark of the jitney driving east on the Long Island Expressway toward Montauk. Meanwhile, over on East 55th Street, in a series of dining rooms on the ground floor of an ugly skyscraper next door to the Friars Club, a new executive chef, Marcus Jernmark, is settling into his clogs at Aquavit, the Scandinavian restaurant long associated with the celebrity chef Marcus Samuelsson, who formally left the kitchen there in May. Mr. Jernmark, 28, a former head chef for the Swedish consulate in New York, had been the restaurant’s second in command. Aquavit is now 23. It has been in this location since 2005, when it moved east from the Rockefeller Townhouses, across Fifth Avenue. Up front is a bistro serving fairly traditional Swedish food: meatballs and gravlax. In back, past a long bar, is a formal dining room. It is comfortable if slightly shopworn back there, a  company boardroom and meeting space, replete with chic wooden plates and scarred wooden floors.  Mikael Blomkvist, the hero of the Larsson novels, might arrive at any moment to blow smoke in the face of a criminal plutocrat. Gone are the fireworks of the Samuelsson era, the high-wire act of matching Scandinavian food to French technique and the flavors of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. (Ruth Reichl of The New York Times awarded the restaurant three stars in 1995.   William Grimes did so again in 2001;  in 1988, before Mr. Samuelsson’s arrival, the restaurant was given two stars by Bryan Miller.) Aquavit’s dining room can be somewhat lonely  these days, only a little more than half full at peak hours. There is a sour scent to some of the passageways, the sort that flowers cannot battle. But Mr. Jernmark has moved the menu toward a quiet, seasonal intensity that is well worth investigating. Mr. Samuelsson’s cooking used international flair to introduce Scandinavian flavors to Americans who knew only of Midwestern smorgasbords. Mr. Jernmark’s take is at once more modest and difficult, the taste of a Sweden proud of its traditions, its larder and the bounty of its sea, fields and lakes. He smokes sweetbreads in hay, for instance, turning them black and menacing, then serves them as an appetizer alongside a parsnip purée, with fava beans, grilled bread and an apple-cider sauce. A slice reveals a white the color of clouds high over a seaweed-draped shore. The flavors  combine with force and severity, offering sweetness, the crunch of salt, the chalkiness of char. Mr. Jernmark is not quite foraging for the felt of reindeer antlers or serving lye-cured fish cheese  with lingonberry dressing, as if to reinvent Swedish cooking. But he does offer an appetizer of funky venison tartare, with wood sorrel and huckleberries to provide tartness high in the mouth, and capers and a truffle-y mustard vinaigrette to balance it. And if Beau Soleil oysters are not Swedish, they do maintain the spirit of the region, dressed with a little apple, some pickled rhubarb and a dollop of paddlefish caviar. Only a brook trout poached in brown butter with sea urchin roe, English peas and a lemon pearl sago, a sort of tapioca pearl out of Southeast Asia, offers a hint that Mr. Jernmark has not abandoned Mr. Samuelsson’s restless cosmopolitanism entirely. (Nor all his signature dishes. The restaurant’s excellent Arctic Circle dessert, which pairs a goat-cheese parfait with blueberry sorbet, remains.) Naturally there is herring. Mr. Jernmark is a master of the baitfish form. A herring degustation plate should start any meal at the restaurant, served with impossibly sweet boiled peanut potatoes, bits of crispy bread and some hard, salty Vasterbotten cheese. Begin, perhaps, with the creamy horseradish version, pale and fiery, or with a ruddier, plump, mustard-hued fillet. Mr. Jernmark serves herring topped with pickled ramps; with bits of crayfish; wrapped around gherkins; or drizzled with more of that brown butter; with roasted yellow beets, a tiny quail egg, red onion, sour cream. Consumed in the traditional style, with glasses of Carlsberg beer and shots of Linie aquavit from Norway, nutty with caraway and herbs, these little bites make it difficult not to see the wisdom of the restaurant’s new-traditionalist approach. (Though you can easily ditch the beer and aquavits, and signal to a sommelier for help; the restaurant’s wine list spans a few continents, and is reasonably affordable and well paired to the menu.) The entrees continue Mr. Jernmark’s theme, though they are not as successful as the appetizers. He does very well with fish. There is an exceptional dish of seared scallops, fat and sweet, with butter-poached lobster, sauerkraut, quinoa and oyster vinaigrette. (The butter-poached lobster only matters insofar as it sells, and has since Thomas Keller originated the preparation in 1994.) And a seared arctic char, with cauliflower, salted hazelnuts and a feather-light horseradish emulsion, is wildly flavorful if a little overcomplicated in its preparation (the char is fennel-cured) and plating (it looks like a low-rider car). Lamb with mustard greens, a soft artichoke stew and garlic stems, is light and gamy, and notable most for its treatment of the delicate artichoke hearts. But it is a dish that would be better with less meat. A pairing of strip steak and braised short ribs falls into the same camp. The beef falls heavily and short of its accompaniments  —  parsley root and a pile of mushroom duxelles. Better is a duck-breast roulade with potato dumplings known as kroppkakor, along with rainbow Swiss chard, peas and a lingonberry sauce. And a huge fist of pork loin, with a sweet-corn cream, summery succotash and pool of foie gras broth, might have done well at the royal wedding reception, this June, of the Duke and Duchess of Vastergotland. Mr. Jernmark and his staff are cooking and serving excellent food at Aquavit, bold and honest. It is time for the restaurant’s owners  to match their commitment, and to freshen up the dining rooms. “What people call success is only preparation for the next failure,” Strindberg wrote in “A Dream Play.” This is as true of restaurants as anywhere else.

898,Pok Pok Ny,★★,20120626,Pete Wells,Columbia Street Waterfront District,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/27/dining/reviews/pok-pok-ny-brooklyn-restaurant-review.html,"AT first I didn’t notice the green chile paste at the center of the plate. I was in the backyard of a new Thai restaurant in Brooklyn called Pok Pok Ny (rhymes with “rock rock fly”), enjoying a deep communion with a grilled sausage that seemed to be everything anyone could want on a summer night. The sausage was rough-hewed and reddish, with little studs of melting pork fat and traces of galangal and white pepper that were flowery and spicy at the same time. Though this sausage, a favorite in the Thai city of Chiang Mai, needed nothing more than a cold beer, I began dunking it into that chile paste. And then I’d dunk the Frito-size curls of fried pork rinds, and wedges of steamed kabocha squash, and long beans tied into knots. The paste, called naam phrik nuum, was hot but not chokingly so, and had some of the grassy sweetness of a grilled green bell pepper, and one quality that green bell peppers don’t have: I couldn’t get enough of it. As I kept dunking, my perspective underwent a Copernican shift. The sausage had seemed to be the center of the universe, but it turned out that it, and everything else on the plate, revolved around that mesmerizing naam phrik nuum. Altered perceptions come free with the price of dinner at Pok Pok Ny, which was opened by the chef Andy Ricker. Mr. Ricker owns an acclaimed cluster of casual Thai eating and drinking places in Portland, Ore., and a takeout joint for papaya salad and Vietnamese chicken wings on the Lower East Side, Pok Pok Wing. Now he has set up his first sit-down restaurant in the city. New York is already lucky to have Ayada in Elmhurst, Queens, where the chef Duangjai Thammasat brings delicacy and beauty to fiery dishes, and Sripraphai in Woodside, Queens, which Sripraphai Tipmanee, the owner, has made into a beacon for Thais and non-Thais alike. Ms. Thammasat is from Thailand’s central heartland; Ms. Tipmanee is from the south. Zabb Elee, in Jackson Heights, Queens, and in the East Village, offers the electrifying flavors of Isan, the country’s northeast. I’ve heard some New Yorkers insist that they will stick to these established restaurants. If convenience is their priority, they have a point. Sripraphai is about 15 minutes from Pennsylvania Station, and Ayada is about 25; Pok Pok Ny is a 40-minute journey, including a hike from the subway to a stretch of Brooklyn waterfront amputated from Cobble Hill by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. You’ll need to factor in more time if you fail to arrive shortly after Pok Pok Ny opens at 5:30 p.m. The restaurant doesn’t take reservations. Later arrivals are exiled to a bench or wooden chair beneath swirling ceiling fans in a backyard tent. There they sit until a table is free in the tent, in an open-air patio or indoors. This cheerfully ramshackle village seems to have been banged together overnight by somebody who didn’t expect to be there six months from now (and who never ran the numbers on having three dining areas served by a coffin-size bathroom). So yes, by all means go to Ayada and Sripraphai. Everybody should. But don’t tell yourself that you’ll be getting the same stuff, because it isn’t true. The first way Pok Pok Ny shifts your perspective is by offering the food of northern Thailand, which has been largely missing from New York. With a wealth of ingredients and an abundance of pork and firewood, the region developed a cuisine that is less incendiary than other Thai cooking, contains almost no coconut milk and makes great use of the grill. To that end, behind the backyard tent is a remarkable outdoor kitchen with a black-barrel smoker, a vertical charcoal rotisserie, a clay-lined pot and a standard grill or two. That kitchen brings the warm breath of charcoal smoke to the kai yaang, grilled hens that can start the meal with a burst of lemon grass; to little half-moons of soy-glazed pork neck that come with ice-cold raw mustard greens, for crunching between bites of pork; and to long eggplants roasted until they are as soft as pudding and nearly as sweet. You even taste it in a salad of grilled and minced catfish dressed with mint leaves, dried chiles and lime juice. The salad, called laap, comes with stalks of herbs grown in Florida from imported seeds. There are the glossy and sour blades of bai makhok, the Thai olive; spade-shaped leaves of khao tong, with a flavor that earns it the English name fishwort; and deceptively pretty spears of bai sadao. Eaten on its own, sadao is so ferociously bitter that you think about calling a lawyer. Folded into a spoonful of laap, it is no more threatening than basil. Here comes another shift: you could prowl the city for years without finding some of the ingredients in Mr. Ricker’s kitchen. I’d read about black crabs, pests that can fell a rice paddy unless they are scooped up and preserved in salt, but had never encountered one in a green papaya salad before Pok Pok Ny. Pitched into the salad, shells and all, the tiny crabs are hard enough to crack molars, but they are part of Mr. Ricker’s mission of reproducing northern Thai cooking in Oregon or Brooklyn with as much fidelity as he can muster. He is nothing if not obsessed, liable to begin sentences with, “It’s a long story.” If his enthusiasm is contagious, though, not everyone on his Brooklyn staff has caught it. One night we asked our server whether the powerfully refreshing sweet-sour sodas called drinking vinegars were popular in Thailand. “I’m not really sure,” was the answer, and that was that. There are other ways in which Pok Pok Ny hasn’t synchronized its watches yet. An order went missing for ages, then showed up in duplicate. And one night I ran into two or three dishes whose flavors seemed to be napping, including a fried egg salad and even a papaya salad. I left downcast, humming Peggy Lee: Is that all there is? No, it’s not. In my next visits I was thrilled to taste more remarkable dishes than the table could hold: prawns in smoky noodles simmered with soy and ginger in a clay pot; an eggy pancake of juicy, sweet mussels with garlic chives; a stunningly complex pork laap. Compared with other pork laaps I’ve had, this one seemed to have eight or nine extra dimensions. The memory of it will be enough to keep me docile next time I wait for a table."
900,Cabrito,★,20090127,Frank Bruni,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/dining/reviews/28rest.html,"VISITED on its best nights and judged by its best dishes, Cabrito is the Mexican restaurant so many of us dreamed about for so long. It has just enough sophistication and upscale trappings, manifest in the quality of its cocktails and length of its tequila and mezcal list, to be the plausible cynosure of a fun night out, not just a grubby refueling station where the price of dauntless, authentic flavors is a spartan atmosphere. You don’t, in other words, find yourself wanting to eat fast and hurry out the door. And yet it’s not really upscale, with little of the vagueness and few of the generic touches that too often accompany an ambitious ethnic restaurant showcasing cooking that’s neither European nor Japanese. For the most part it doesn’t pull its punches, some of them fierier than you’re accustomed to. The deep pool of red chili sauce in which the short ribs come is ablaze with guajillo and chile de arbol, and it’s spectacular. Cabrito doesn’t lean too hard and too frequently on avocado and doesn’t take the position that enough sour cream can solve any problem, redeem any sin. It sweats the quality of the tortillas (house-made and usually warm), the chorizo (also house-made and juicy), the cilantro (vibrant and abundant) and the toasted pumpkin seeds. Try the shrimp and tamarind ceviche, and marvel at the way those pumpkin seeds, or pepitas, lend the perfect degree of saltiness and the perfect little crunch to a mix of ingredients — including red onion, pineapple, avocado and serrano chilies — with an expert balance of sweet, sour, sharp and soft notes. The kitchen is paying attention and taking care. Much of the time, that is. There’s a qualification in the first sentence up top and a digression right here because Cabrito is afflicted by an inconsistency that’s puzzling, even maddening, in the sense that you don’t want anything challenging the exhilaration you can so easily and rightly feel about this special place. There are dishes that don’t seem, by nature, to rise to the caliber of others, and dishes that aren’t dependable from one visit to the next. Take the namesake dish: the slow-roasted baby goat, hunks and strands of which can be tucked into a tortilla with the restaurant’s intense, riveting salsa borracha, a jammy amalgam of onions, pasilla chilies, tequila and sour orange juice. I’ve had the goat when it was dry and unappealingly gristly, when it was moist and blessedly fatty and when it was somewhere in between. And I know from the reports of others that this unpredictability is par for the Cabrito — and cabrito — course. The service, too, can’t be trusted. At times Cabrito seems woefully understaffed, and you could wind up with a crimp in your neck from all your craning, twisting and swiveling to figure out what’s what and who might be able to help you. At other times, though, the restaurant operates with an efficiency and authority that defy the chaos in the pleasant but cramped room, which has imported Mexican tiles along one wall and, along the other, a bar that seems to go on forever. The bar’s reach and prominence assert the importance of alcohol — and the lack of ceremony — at the very core of Cabrito’s identity. Cabrito, which opened last May, is owned by Zak Pelaccio and the other folks who masterminded the Fatty Crab, which is the restaurant where Cabrito’s chef, David Schuttenberg, last worked. That genealogy shows in the menu he has put together. It owes as much to the urban-glutton tropes of the moment — to the sensibilities of the most self-consciously unpretentious of this city’s gastronomes — as it does to Puebla and other areas of Mexico. There’s a street-food focus in the front-and-center placement of tacos and pizza-esque huaraches, which are available with skirt steak (good), crumbled chorizo (better) and the corn fungus huitlacoche (best). Servers at upscale Mexican restaurants are constantly chattering about the trufflelike properties of huitlacoche, but I usually can’t detect them. At Cabrito I could: it was like ingesting some vegetal pheromone. There’s pork and more pork, fatty and fattier, and there are kinds and cuts of meat beyond the most overexposed and familiar ones. The baby goat isn’t the best example. One taco comes with braised beef tongue, which is sliced thin, seared and folded into one of Cabrito’s thick but tender tortillas, which taste of the corn in them, along with a salsa of avocado, tomatillos, jalapeño, garlic and cilantro. It shouldn’t be missed. The beverage selection has a distinct, felicitous personality: more than three dozen tequilas; a half dozen mezcals; soft drinks made with tropical fruits like mandarin and guava; and fresh watermelon juice, used in several of the well-mixed cocktails. That there’s almost nothing in the way of wine is understandable and forgivable. Wine isn’t really what this food or setting calls for. Less easily overlooked is the number and variety of desserts. There’s one and only one, churros with chocolate sauce, and that sauce is thin and dull. The short shrift Cabrito gives to this last act of a meal has an advantage for the restaurant: diners leave — and the tables turn — more quickly. But it ends the evening on a disappointing note for any diner with a sweet tooth. There are additional disappointments. In a restaurant with porky preoccupations, well exercised in the carnitas, why are the braised spareribs in the pozole so repeatedly dry? Why are citrus notes almost absent from the guacamole? You wonder, but then you take another bite of the rajas con crema — roasted, sliced poblano chilies in a luscious milky bath — and you don’t care about anything else. It’s as satisfying a Mexican dish as any around town, and it makes clear that Cabrito is a whole lot more than the bar-with-food it is sometimes cast as (and sometimes pretends, with strategic coyness, to be). In a city with no surfeit of bold Mexican food but plenty of ways to spend more money with less satisfaction, Cabrito deserves recognition even beyond what it has already received.

903,Wassail,★,20151222,Pete Wells,Lower East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/dining/wassail-review.html,"You can tell when restaurateurs’ choices are based on cold market calculus and when they’re driven by passion. If the passions are good ones, they can become contagious. Wassail is a Lower East Side restaurant that is deeply devoted to hard cider. After circling back again and again since it opened early this spring, I’ve fallen under cider’s spell, and Wassail’s, too. Sometimes I take over a table in the tavernlike back rooms to spend a couple of hours with food in which vegetables get to show off, and there’s always more going on than meets the eye. Sometimes I drop anchor at the long, busy bar and eat fried jalapeño-Gouda balls as if they were popcorn. Always, I drink cider. Hanging out at Wassail is like going to a planet populated by nitrogen-based life-forms; everything is at once recognizable and thoroughly different. The staff plays up the recognizable aspects. Conversations about cider at Wassail often begin with “What kinds of wines do you like?” then a suggestion for a cider with the clean rasp of a sauvignon blanc or the cow-patty funk of rustic natural wines. I could taste a different cider at Wassail every night starting now and not repeat myself until the end of March. This sounds like a wise use of the next three months when I think of how many discoveries I’ve already made: Among many others, I’ve had Hudson Valley ciders that were as round and fleshy as a Degas bather; Spanish ciders as taut and linear as a Giacometti; a spooky, briny cider introduced to seaweed; and a smoky, brooding cider aged in charred whiskey barrels. The roots of Wassail’s idiosyncratic obsessions go back to when one of the owners, Ben Sandler, went on a class trip to a zoo at age 14. He was on acid at the time, which did not prove to be a sound decision. When his mind stopped rippling, he swore off meat and illegal drugs for good. This helps explain why the menu at Wassail, which he opened early this spring with his wife, Jennifer Lim, is fully devoted to vegetables. (Ms. Lim converted after marriage and is now fully devoted to vegetables herself.) How they settled on fermented apple juice as the house intoxicant is a story that starts at the Queens Kickshaw, the couple’s first restaurant. Their original idea, back in 2011, was to sell excellent coffee and grilled cheese sandwiches to their neighbors in Astoria. Cider wasn’t even a gleam in their eyes. Apart from sugary, mass-produced stuff, neither had ever tried it. That year, though, they went to a tasting of French and American ciders. They had the kind of reaction that Mr. Sandler was probably hoping to get from LSD. “It was eye-opening, it was mind-blowing,” Ms. Lim said. “We were clued into something that was incredible and underrated and new and old at the same time.” Cider began to take over the Queens Kickshaw, but things really got going when the couple found a space for Wassail on Orchard Street. (It must have seemed like a sign that the street is named after the fruit-tree grove of an early New York family, the De Lanceys.) Wassail has a dozen ciders on tap and about 100 more in bottles. A number of those bottles are poured by the glass, thanks to trial-and-error adjustments to a carbon dioxide pump designed to keep the fizz inside uncorked Champagne. Apples, pressed and turned into brandy, pommeau and of course cider, are the foundation of most of the cocktails, including a potent and energizing wassail punch of mixed spirits and beet juice. Apples roll through Joseph Buenconsejo’s savory courses and Rebecca Eichenbaum’s desserts as well. Luckily, this is not always obvious. Little about their cooking is. What I noticed about a parsnip-apple soup wasn’t the thematic tie-in but the way caramelized onions and pecans broadened the sweet, creamy flavor of the soup. Grilled butternut squash was buried under smithereens of nuts and seeds, a kind of exploded granola that added a wonderfully sweet and crunchy dimension to the soft squash. I almost always order creamy little potatoes, their red and white skins blistered and blackened over charcoal. Mr. Buenconsejo sends them off in an Eastern European direction with a dill sauce and a lather of tangy goat butter, a treatment that’s both delicate and direct. To a salad of cucumber spears and pearls of dripping-ripe melon, Mr. Buenconsejo adds so many elements — macadamia milk, chopped macadamias, sorrel leaves, borage oil — that it almost spins out of control, but it doesn’t. One dish that got away from him paired hakurei turnips with wild rice in a dashi that was off-puttingly fishy, despite containing no actual fish. He and Ms. Eichenbaum think and cook alike; her desserts flow seamlessly out of his savory courses. She makes a pool of chocolate, softly melting like a candy bar you kept in your pocket, but then reminds you that this is a vegetable restaurant with screaming-pink buttons of beet-buttermilk sherbet and a spill of toasted amaranth grains that pop between your teeth. She can even find the sweetness in celery, churning it into a delicate granita that she scatters around a parsley-root mousse. With all due respect for her interest in the produce bin, though, my favorite Eichenbaum creation was a floral, romantic, early summer assemblage of strawberries, strawberry ice cream and a deeply enchanting rose-petal cream. The menu is supposed to progress from small plates to larger ones, but in practice there isn’t much difference. Mr. Buenconsejo’s compositions tend to stimulate your palate more than they satisfy your appetite. Hunks of lobster mushrooms given a luxurious bath in butter were served over a cauliflower-mushroom purée and a twirl of gingered noodles with a side of foamy curry sauce; I immediately wanted more. This is both a compliment and a minor complaint. The dish is listed as “ginger pasta,” but it isn’t filling the way you expect pasta to be. It’s even harder to feel as if you’ve had a whole meal on nights when the kitchen has trouble getting the food to the tables. One time the wait between courses grew so long that my companions and I were on the verge of playing a game of charades to pass the time. On other nights, service at the tables could be glancing and distracted. I tended to be happiest when I treated Wassail as a bar where the food is surprisingly interesting but cider, doing things I never expected it to do, carries the night. As a destination for exploring the nuances of the apple, Wassail is so exceptional that I don’t mind working around its occasional shortcomings as a restaurant."
908,Wong,★★,20120103,Pete Wells,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/04/dining/wong-greenwich-village-restaurants.html,"IF you want to have some fun, bring friends to Simpson Wong’s new restaurant on Cornelia Street and watch them taste the duck-fat ice cream in a dessert called duck a la plum. First they stop talking. Then they stop moving. Their eyes shut, and just when you’re wondering how long this will last, they pop open again, bright with the pleasure of discovery. It’s been a long time since Asian fusion cooking has promised thrills of this sort. When it makes eyes roll these days, nobody smiles. Witness the lengths that some Manhattan restaurants operating in the Asian fusion or pan-Asian idiom go to avoid those terms. RedFarm has “Chinese cuisine with Greenmarket sensibility,” says the Web site. Kin Shop’s menu is “modern Thai,” and Rouge et Blanc’s is “French-Vietnamese.” At Wong, meanwhile, the euphemism of choice is “Asian locavore.” Maybe the owners of these places should meet to agree on a name that doesn’t evoke 900-seat nightclubs with giant Buddhas, because taken together with the shock troops at Momofuku and a few other places, they offer hope for New Yorkers who hunger for adventure, for something new. Duck tongues, anyone? Say yes, please, because I think you’ll like the way Mr. Wong prepares them, braising them to tenderness, then rolling them into small meatballs with a crunchy fried crust. If Mr. Wong sold them to go, I’d buy them by the bag and eat them like popcorn. The menu bills these tongue meatballs as the supporting players to seared scallops, but really, the two are equal partners on a surf and turf platter that’s as wonderful as it is uncommon. You are a fan of sea cucumbers, too, I hope? You’ll find slippery, crunchy bits of them in Wong’s slightly demented Bolognese. Made with pork and shiitakes, too, and served with fat springy rice noodles, it’s the kind of dish that tastes simply odd at first, but keeps luring you back for another bite. The flavors build as you eat until there’s nothing left. Like the scallops, the rice noodles appear on the menu beside the restaurant’s logo, a sign that it’s a specialty of the house. In general, dishes bearing that mark are roughly twice as delicious as the others, most of which aren’t half bad to begin with. You will eat well enough if you order the wreckfish or the pork plate, but your enjoyment of your dinner may be undone by your envy of everybody else’s. (Though I’d steer well clear of the mystifying crab pizza and the duck meatball, neither of which improves on the Italian original.) Let’s hope that Mr. Wong intends to put his logo next to the entire menu some day. Imagine what this restaurant could be if everything were as compelling as the lobster egg foo young. In any kitchen not owned by Mr. Wong, that dish is a Chinese omelet, usually in brown gravy. Some people like it. Here it’s half a lobster tail and a claw, poached to an angry red and cradled in a cast-iron skillet with a tomato-chili sauce, a dusting of dried shrimp, two fried chicken eggs with liquid yolks and shaved hard yolks from salt-cured duck eggs. The dish comes with a slice of toast. I used it to clean my skillet. The best dishes at Wong have a where-did-that-come-from quality. For some New Yorkers, so will the restaurant. Simpson Wong, the chef and proprietor, has kept a low profile of late, although a previous restaurant of his, Jefferson, was once an address known by car service drivers and executive assistants, especially around 2004, when its sleek minimalist dining room popped up on “Sex and the City.” The next year, Mr. Wong had a heart attack and closed the restaurant. He tried to restart it as Jefferson Grill, with smaller plates and a lower cholesterol count, but its best days were in the past. It was shut in 2006. Mr. Wong retrenched to his first restaurant, Cafe Asean (after 15 years, it is still on West 10th Street, still cheap, still pan-Asian and still over-performing). And he traveled. He flew home to Malaysia, where he was born, and rounded up his mother (who is nearly 80 and gets around in a wheelchair). Together, they went on a series of eating tours across Asia. In Hong Kong, they ate spicy crabs that became a model for the typhoon lobster at Wong. They bought shrimp fritters on the street in Ho Chi Minh City; in Hanoi, they went to Cha Ca La Vong to taste the house specialty, turmeric-scented fish fried with dill stalks, tossed over rice vermicelli and doused with nuoc cham. On Cornelia Street, the dish is renamed cha ca la Wong. The cooking at Jefferson, which was awarded two stars by William Grimes in 2003, often began with Western ideas to which Asian ingredients were introduced. At Wong, he has kept his freewheeling palate and his nuanced instincts for building contrasts, but the starting point tends to be Asia, which means that his cooking at Wong, at its strongest, resembles nothing else in town. That is the reason to go to Wong. The dining room is half Williamsburg, half Salvation Army, with wood salvaged from demolition sites and molded-plywood schoolhouse chairs, the kind with a wire basket under the seat for geometry textbooks. The interior probably won’t be seen in the pages of Architectural Record, as Jefferson’s was. But then Jefferson cost three to four times as much, Mr. Wong said in a telephone interview. These are more sober times, and among chefs more high-minded times as well. Mr. Wong is earnest about his locavore convictions, to the point that he won’t sell bottled water. Those beliefs also helped inspire an all-American and largely sustainable wine list that, unfortunately, simply can’t keep up with the kitchen. Without compromising his principles, Mr. Wong should be able to do better than the dozen lackluster choices. The list doesn’t have to be longer, just stronger. For proof, see the dessert menu put together by Wong’s pastry chef, Judy Chen. There are three choices. Two are first-rate and the third has that ice cream that makes time stop. At 48, Mr. Wong has closed a popular and acclaimed restaurant. He knows what a heart attack feels like. For future reference, if those things happen to you, there are worse ways to react than to invent duck tongue meatballs.

910,Brushstroke,★★,20110712,Sam Sifton,TriBeCa,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/13/dining/reviews/brushstroke-nyc-restaurant-review.html,"THE ingenious gentleman David Bouley has been marching the streets of TriBeCa for more than 25 years. He first tasted fame in 1985 as the chef at Montrachet on West Broadway, then mainlined it two years later with the eponymous Bouley. Other restaurants followed — among them Danube, which was successful, and Secession, which was not — along with other projects in the neighborhood that did well or disastrously, but were always devoted to the same quest for the delicious that has motivated him from the start. Now comes Brushstroke, Mr. Bouley’s collaborative effort with the Tsuji Culinary Institute in Osaka, Japan. The restaurant, in the elegant space on the corner of Hudson Street and Duane Street that held Danube and Secession, is decorated in steel and stone and what might be miles of reclaimed honeyed wood. It evokes the serenity of a dojo along with some of the buzzy excitement of one of those clothing stores that displays very little clothing. It has been in the works for nearly a decade. Mr. Bouley is not really the chef at Brushstroke, though he can sometimes be seen in the large open kitchen or strolling the dining room in a fine dress shirt beneath his crisp chef’s jacket, greeting guests. Instead, the business of preparing the food is given to instructors from the Tsuji academy under the leadership of Isao Yamada, who ran restaurants in Japan and most recently was the chef at Bouley Upstairs. Wags may call Brushstroke the Japanese version of the restaurant, run by students, on the ground floor of the French Culinary Institute in SoHo. There is some truth to the jape, though Brushstroke has considerably more drive. The menus are the product of thousands of hours of research and testing by Mr. Bouley and his partners. The point is art as much as illustration of their expertise. And the result, dutifully prepared, falls directly between the poles. A single bite of cloudlike scallop-and-lobster dumpling in cherrystone-scented soup testifies to the benefits of the process. Its base is dashi, a stock made from kelp and dried bonito flakes that is fundamental to Japanese cuisine, here increased in value by the addition of clam liquor and the faint smokiness of an accompanying bit of grilled lobster. The combination is a jewel box of immense intensity and diminutive size: a flavor haiku, much harder to create than to eat. The dish is something of a showstopper to boot. People look up from eating it, their eyes wide. Here we go! Brushstroke is devoted to a school of Japanese cooking called kaiseki, a series of focused, intricately composed dishes that are meant to balance the taste and appearance of different foods, their texture and color, even their temperature. Intensely seasonal, with each plate composed in the manner of a painting, kaiseki helps illustrate a sophisticated and evolving theory of Japanese cooking that is roughly analogous to Western haute cuisine. Two tasting menus are available ($85 for 8 courses, $135 for 10) along with an à la carte sushi menu for the bar. Pass on the sushi unless starvation for raw fish has brought you to the restaurant’s door. It is not the point of Brushstroke and may get in the way of understanding it. Instead, give way to the process: plates served on a flower-bedecked lacquer tray, one after the other offering surprises and the taste of the now. That is pistachio powder and a watercress sauce accompanying the sesame-marinated grilled black cod with sea urchin: nut and pepper against silk and brine. That is a single giant Pacific oyster cut into bites, served with a slick plum-wine jelly with fresh green seaweed, laid out in its shell like a story. And yes, when you remove the top from a bowl of steamed egg custard, the scent is black truffles, at once funky and pure, over the ocean scent of Dungeness crab. It is a combination that only improves once you start eating it. (O.K., forget kaiseki. We’ll have four more of those, please.) Grilled duck salad with eggplant and a miso-mustard dressing is perfectly executed: a rich, intense taste of French-style cooking with Asian ingredients, a kind of cross-cultural triumph of the sort for which Mr. Bouley is justly lauded. It was followed recently by a pairing of incredibly tender wagyu steak with a garlic-sansho pepper sauce, numbing and bright, and a just-seared wagyu tataki, with an intensely citrusy ponzu sauce. Whether you choose 8 or 10 courses for dinner, the final savory one is always diner’s choice: a rice dish. Some may order chirashi, a bowl of rice topped with sashimi and garnishes. Others may answer to the call of lightly seasoned raw tuna with dashi-steamed rice. There is a traditional sushi course, served with soup. But your way should be clear: either the Dungeness crab or the lobster, steamed with rice and a touch of salmon roe in an earthenware pot. This dish is huge and fantastic in flavor, if slightly run-of-the-mill, even unambitious. It suggests what it would be like to attend a black-tie soirée and discover everyone else in sweats. It is not disappointing (sweats are much more comfortable) so much as surprising and slightly strange. The rice is very good and plentiful. Brushstroke’s wine and sake list offers a great deal to go along with this food, at least if you seek the counsel of Seju Yang, the restaurant’s puckish young sommelier. He matched one recent meal entirely to wine, another to sake, for about what it would cost to bring an additional person to the table for food alone. He did so with patience and good humor, straight through the cups of roasted tea he suggested after a dessert of soy milk panna cotta, along with a litchi and sake sorbet with honey powder. Service is excellent, though there is a great deal of it. There are waiters and captains, servers, runners, water men, third-assistant rice spooners, coat-check dons. You will not go thirsty, or wonder for more than a second where the restrooms are. Mr. Bouley has said that Brushstroke is best considered a work in progress, a project that will take years to develop as he and his partners continue their research and development of ingredients, techniques and preparations. But it is not too shabby now. Those who thrill to quiet, to the intersection of Japanese simplicity and French romance, would do well to book a table.   Brushstroke ★★ 30 Hudson Street (Duane Street), TriBeCa; (212) 791-3771, davidbouley.com.

913,Centrico,One Star,20060104,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/04/dining/reviews/two-approaches-to-mexican-tradition.html,"AARÓN SÁNCHEZ spent his boyhood in the heat and hullabaloo of professional kitchens, tied to his mother's apron strings in an almost literal way. When the school day ended, he would head straight to wherever she cooked. In the mid-1980's, that destination was Café Marimba, where his mother, Zarela Martínez, was the executive chef; beginning in 1987, it was Zarela, which she owns. His maturation was marked by the kind of help he was allowed to give her. Before he was 12, he prettied and plated desserts. His salad days came next. After 13, he was allowed to sauté, a rite of passage as eventful for him as getting a driver's license is for another teenager. Now 29, he runs two kitchens of his own. Last summer, in partnership with the veteran restaurateur Drew Nieporent, he opened Centrico on the TriBeCa street corner that had been home to Layla. Centrico is a flashier, splashier bid for the big time than Mr. Sanchez's first restaurant, Paladar, which arrived on the Lower East Side about four years ago. It also owes a greater debt to his rearing. While Paladar serves pan-Latin American food, Centrico, like Zarela, focuses on Mexico. Mr. Sánchez is braising on his mother's turf. He also happens to be besting her. At Centrico, you can bet on a meal that will be at least somewhat pleasing. Zarela, in contrast, is a crapshoot. But the relative merits of these two restaurants say less about whether a child's talents have outgrown a parent's than about something much less romantic: diligence. They exemplify what can sometimes be the difference between new and old, not in terms of son and mother but in terms of unproven and firmly established. Centrico is a restaurant on its toes, eager to make a good first impression, taking care not to overcook seafood and meat, taking pains to make sure diners don't wait too long before drinks are refilled or dishes delivered. Zarela is complacent, often taking its customers for granted. Its kitchen sent out tough shrimp and dry pork. Its servers routinely ignored tables. A man who answered the phone was borderline mean. When I called to confirm a reservation, which could not be found, that man asked whom I'd made the reservation with, as if a diner would get a reservationist's name. Then he grilled me on whether I had talked to a male or female reservationist, as if anyone would document that, either. Only by refusing to back down did I get him to accommodate me. Among my rewards was a paltry $10.25 portion of guacamole that was dull tasting and suspiciously cold, suggesting it had been languishing in a refrigerator. It was presented with little artistry in half of an avocado shell, which shared a plate with a perfunctory smattering of chips. At Centrico, a generous $11 portion of guacamole came in a wood chalice of sorts, with an aureole of multicolored chips. It was near room temperature and vibrantly seasoned with onion, cilantro and lime. Guacamole provides a handy point of comparison, but Zarela and Centrico are restaurants that take Mexican cuisine far, far beyond guacamole, treating it with the respect and nuance it deserves. Zarela got there first, at a time when such subtlety was rare. And it made Ms. Martínez a culinary star. She wrote cookbooks and popped up on TV. She now has a line of Mexican-theme kitchen, bed and bath products, available at some Wal-Mart stores. But she can still be seen at Zarela. I repeatedly watched her stroll radiantly through the dining room. I wanted to shoo her back into the kitchen, where trouble was afoot. Like less ambitious Mexican restaurants, Zarela prepares flautas and fajitas (the latter terrific), tostadas and tamales. But there is also sautéed shrimp with mint, garlic, jalapeño and shredded coconut. There is braised chicken with olives, raisins and almonds. Perhaps best of all, there is shredded lamb barbacoa, flavored with chilies, cumin, cloves, allspice berries, onion, oregano and more. The meat was moist and mesmerizing, and along with a few other standout dishes, like chilaquiles, a gooey amalgam of corn tortilla strips, shredded chicken, sour cream and white cheddar, it was proof you can have a wonderful meal at Zarela. Or not. I sampled three chicken dishes, including the previously mentioned one; in all cases, the meat was dry. A grouper special didn't taste remotely fresh. Arroz con crema went from luscious one night to lumpy and leaden another. And the restaurant's coziness -- it occupies a narrow two-story space stuffed with colorful bric-a-brac -- was diminished by signs of age and fray. The restrooms in particular could use some cosmetic attention. Centrico has a more dramatic look. It's essentially one enormous room with a high ceiling, two walls of windows and a potential for earsplitting noise, which indeed plagued the restaurant when it opened. Mr. Nieporent has since installed special acoustical panels and taken other measures to tamp down the volume. Those successful efforts reflect the restaurant's earnestness. So does some of what comes out of Mr. Sánchez's kitchen. Like his mother, he hedges his bets with expected fare -- in his case, chicken enchiladas, crab meat tostadas and mushroom quesadillas, none of which were especially memorable. But he also ventures into less predictable territory, exploring and adapting Mexican regional dishes for a Manhattan audience. He marinates pork shoulder in sour orange juice and a slightly bitter achiote paste, made with annatto seeds, then roasts it slowly, shreds it and serves it with tortillas and pickled red onions, so diners can make tacos. I tried it that way and on its own and was equally contented. Braised short ribs, seasoned with ancho chilies and cinnamon, were also distinctive, and a succulent grilled chicken dish was even better. The chicken had been marinated in cilantro, olive oil and garlic, then basted with lime juice and chipotle as it cooked. Other highlights included fish tacos with seared cubes of mahi mahi; seared shrimp with tomato, cilantro and roasted poblano chilies; and sweet plantains filled with cedar-smoked black beans. But truly compelling dishes were the exception at Centrico; sufficiently appealing ones were the norm. Of four ceviches, only one, which bathed scallops in coconut water and coconut milk as well as lime, commanded attention. And desserts disappointed. Mr. Sánchez is abler on the savory front. And he is indeed able, which is no doubt a testament to his mother. She passed on an appreciation of food and equanimity behind the stove. All these years later, her restaurant could take a few lessons from his. Centrico  * [Rating: One Star]  211 West Broadway (Franklin Street), TriBeCa; (212) 431-0700.

919,s,One Star,20060118,Frank Bruni,,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/18/dining/reviews/one-reason-to-stop-resenting-mondays.html,"EVERY Monday night on a stretch of Amsterdam Avenue with the kind of functional restaurants people outside the neighborhood seldom discuss, something remarkable happens. It isn't the kind of thing that those who write about restaurants often notice, because it doesn't involve culinary moxie or mischief and has nothing to do with boldface names. It's a matter of value, pure and simple. For $25, Pair of 8's, a modest new bistro that doesn't feel like a comedown from where you really wanted to go, presents you not only with a two-course meal -- appetizer and entree -- but also with a glass of red or white wine. Pair of 8's permits you to elect a proper, refined meal out over a thrown-together meal in, without digging too deep into your pocket or courting much guilt. It speaks to what many people really want from restaurants, as well as to how they choose where they go. Unless the evening centers around a hot date, an important client or a special occasion, they don't jostle for admission to the place getting the most frequent mention in gossip columns. They're not spending whatever it takes for the most inspired confluence of Asian ingredients and French technique. They're looking, in their own neighborhoods, for a setting more pleasant than home, with dishes they tend not to make so often, or so well. They're looking for a little less work, a little more pampering. At Pair of 8's they find that. At its best, it's a model of the restaurant that's a minor indulgence rather than a major splurge. Several caveats and qualifications are in order. The fixed-price meal of $25 is a Monday-only phenomenon, and it doesn't allow a diner free rein over the menu or, for that matter, the list of wines by the glass. On a recent Monday there were three appetizer choices (beef consommé, escargots and a salad of feta and beets) and three entrée choices (hanger steak, roasted chicken and fillet of sole). On other nights the prices at Pair of 8's are entirely fair in relation to the quality of the ingredients being used, but they're not quite bargains. A duck confit salad costs $11; sautéed skate with tagliatelle and shiitake mushrooms, $19; a braised shoulder of lamb with fava beans, carrots and whipped potatoes, $24. Much of the cooking doesn't snap you to attention, and some of it lulls you to sleep, suggesting a new school of gastronomic thought, devised to dovetail with the pharmacological moment: Ambien cuisine. The chef, Bill Peet, who worked at Lutèce and Café des Artistes, must believe that less is more when it comes to seasoning. It's a religion he should lose, because it yielded whipped potatoes with any potential for joy or flavor whipped out of them; a ""saffron scented"" seafood risotto that needed more scent, more spark and, as with much of the food, more salt; and that consommé, a snooze of a soup, less zippy and peppy than the contents of many a can. But his most successful dishes are several notches above what you usually find at a neighborhood restaurant. Similarly, the dining experience at Pair of 8's has more grace notes and overall polish -- gleaming walnut tables, a black marble bar -- than you might expect. The owner, Ron Didner, has never had his own place before, and the energy he brings to this one shows in an attentiveness to detail that wins you over. You are greeted quickly and cordially when you walk in the door, your coat checked before you know it. You can hear your companions talk, because there have been efforts, including the installation of a big fabric artwork over special acoustical panels, to keep the decibels in check. You are encouraged to have fun with wine. Pair of 8's uses continually changing humorous themes to introduce sequences of three or four wines that you can pair, as tastes or full glasses, with your meal. One night's theme was ""Frankenwine,"" a meditation on grapes crossbred from other grapes and a ""chance to taste the parents and the offspring."" Another night's theme, less high-minded, was wines whose names you can't pronounce. The sorbets and ice creams are made in house, and the sorbets in particular (coconut, lemon, passion fruit) are terrific -- exceptionally smooth, with exceptionally sharp flavors. They get competition from a few other fine desserts, including a tiny round Meyer lemon cheesecake. With luck and some guidance you can take a happy trip through the restaurant's French-inflected American menu. The appetizers I liked best included a cake of crab and scallop that kept the bread crumbs and binding to a minimum. The succulent meat in a seared lamb tenderloin encircled a tangle of watercress with hunks of Stilton cheese. A simple spinach salad had fresh, vibrant greens, a bacon vinaigrette with an assertive but not overbearing personality and thin shavings of pecorino Romano cheese. Fat prawns had been smoked with apple wood before being grilled, which gave them some extra oomph. Roasted chicken tells you as much about the vigilance of a kitchen as any other dish, and both times I had it, it was nicely cooked, not dry in the least. Among other entrees, the standouts were pan-roasted venison loin, generously portioned and juicier than venison often is, and a hefty wedge of grilled salmon with a lemon and caper sauce that, like the prawns, contradicted the kitchen's sometimes soporific inclinations. While there are side dishes for $5, including a fantastic roasted corn succotash with red and green peppers, the entrees themselves have company on the plate like polenta and sautéed spinach. The entrees aren't lone rangers, their isolation a strategy by the restaurant to get diners to order extras at extra charge. Pair of 8's clearly wants to be a straightforward broker. And while it doesn't leave you mightily impressed, it leaves you feeling as if you've been treated with fairness and consideration. There's something to be said for that. Pair of 8's  * [Rating: One Star]  568 Amsterdam Avenue (88th Street), Upper West Side; (212) 874-2742.

921,Japonais,★,20060906,Frank Bruni,Union Square,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/06/dining/reviews/06rest.html,"HAVEN’T I been here before?” a companion asked me one night as we entered Japonais and he took in the candy-colored drinks on the bar, the plush lounges nearby, the sushi bar against a far wall and the vast main dining room with its inevitable design centerpiece, a many-limbed sculpture that looks like the offspring of a supersize bonsai tree and a French poodle. It was a simple question with a complicated answer. No, he hadn’t technically been here. And yes, of course, he had, at least if he’d managed over the last few years to drop by Megu or Morimoto, Ono or Nobu 57. The list goes on, and at a certain point the boundaries of these different restaurants blur. They’re all invariably theatrical, obliquely Asian and ostentatiously huge, inhabiting a Manhattan genre that’s gone in no time flat from plump to morbidly obese. Which doesn’t mean they’re not enjoyable. They’ve proliferated for good reasons. They provide food with visual appeal and a (quickly diminishing) touch of exoticism. They provide settings that stroke many senses at once. They’re full-scale productions, serving not just a meal but a toro-gilded fantasy of what it means to have free time, extra money and an appetite for adventure in a great, sexy metropolis today. And, to be fair, they’re not the only breed of restaurants to traffic in emulation. Brasseries, bistros and trattorias have long hewed to established models, following paces set forth by their forebears. But restaurants like Japonais rely more heavily on a kind of dazzle that has diminishing returns. Your enjoyment of them hinges largely on your degree of exposure. If you’ve been there and done that, you can’t be as impressed as you were the first, second or eleventh time around. Your focus returns to what’s on the plates, and at Japonais that was a mix of pleasing innovations, trustworthy staples, unimpressive curiosities and outright mistakes. Meals at Japonais were usually herky-jerky affairs, veering quickly from elation to exasperation and undercut by odd pacing and off-key service. “Are you hungry tonight?” a server asked my friends and me. “You’ve come to the right place!” That statement struck a clumsy note in a restaurant going for glossy enchantment and charging $58 for slices of smoked wagyu rib-eye. So did a comment by another server, who was steering us away from one of the desserts. “I don’t even know what a panna cotta is,” he said. Several of the desserts he pointed us to, however, were great. They included apple toban yaki, which was like a deconstructed apple pie à la mode, and pumpkin cheesecake, which had a texture more akin to a soufflé’s, along with pineapple foam and an almond cookie crust. It seemed neither Japanese nor French, which are the two principal cuisines being fused at Japonais, but then the rules for restaurants like these aren’t firm. And the rules don’t need to be when results work as well as those desserts or “le quack Japonais,” a riff on Peking duck that brings China into play. It presents fat slices of gorgeous duck breast smoked with maple leaves in place of thin, crunchy slivers that are mostly skin, and they are meant to be combined in wraps with not only cucumber, scallions and hoisin sauce but also a mango chutney. At Japonais you can seldom predict from menu descriptions or general instinct what’s going to be a winner. One of the best appetizers — crab cakes — sounded like they belonged in a different place. They were pan-seared, lightly breaded with panko and served with a soy mustard sauce that managed to be creamy without being rich. Japonais is an offshoot of a restaurant of the same name that opened about three years ago in Chicago. A Las Vegas offshoot is due later this month. The hot dishes are under the supervision of the chef Gene Kato, while cold dishes, including sushi, fall under the purview of the chef Jun Ichikawa. Jeffrey Beers designed the space, creating a moody theater with undulating strips of wood on the ceiling, semicircular booths along one wall and shiny red chairs. A lovely veranda, which allows outdoor dining in warm months, is a special lure. The cocktails aren’t. Most of the ones I tried were too generically sweet. Among the restaurant’s selection of makimono were more that showcased vegetables, including yamagobo (burdock root) and kaiware (daikon sprouts), than you find elsewhere. The “spicy mono” roll, mingling tender octopus with tuna tartare and an eel sauce, balanced spicy and sweet elements in a delightful way, and the quality of the seafood in simpler sushi and sashimi selections was beyond reproach. But there was also plenty of nonsense in the multisegmented stretch of the menu leading up to entrees. Taking snow crab claws, encasing them in shrimp and crab mousse and then deep-frying them produced generically crunchy finger food with little crab flavor. Teriyaki-coated chicken drumettes with a roasted scallion dipping sauce had less appeal than your average Buffalo wings in your average sports bar. Unevenness was the norm. Out came a ceviche with terrific sweet shrimp, bathed in a ginger and yuzu marinade and paired with an enticing avocado mousse. Out came three unadorned colossal shrimp, chewy and tasteless. The meat in a wagyu beef toban yaki (the phrase refers to cooking on a ceramic surface) was too leathery to be redeemed by a wonderful fondue  — made with Kirin beer, shallots, ginger, cream and Brie  — that surrounded it. But the meat in that rib-eye, smoked with a mix of woods including hickory, was fantastic. So was a grilled filet mignon, served with an uni butter sauce that was like an Asian béarnaise. The rib-eye was in front of us one night when two of my friends, sinking into comfortable chairs and letting hypnotic music waft over them, volunteered that they really liked Japonais. Their reaction made sense. We had hit the best dishes. We hadn’t drawn one of the goofy servers. And these friends hadn’t been to many restaurants like this one. For them it had an intrigue that eclipsed its shortcomings."
925,Tailor,★,20071121,Frank Bruni,SoHo,https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/21/dining/reviews/21rest.html,"ALTHOUGH restaurant reviewers often have to divine a chef’s thinking, Sam Mason has spared us the effort. He’s spelled out his mind-set in big letters on a page of the publicity materials for his new restaurant, Tailor. His words appear alongside a photograph of him looking pensive, above both an enormous copy of his signature and a sketch that depicts the piece-by-piece construction of one of Tailor’s avant-garde dishes. They say, “I know I’m not gonna change the way people think about food, but that doesn’t mean I’m gonna let them change the way I think about it.” So there you have it. Mr. Mason’s personal vision trumps your pleasure. His conviction matters more than your response. This, I suppose, is the very definition of artistic integrity. But it’s not the prescription for a great restaurant. Tailor is certainly an ambitious restaurant, and an interesting one. It has the courage to showcase the kind of experimental cooking  — eccentric, provocative flavor combinations; unusual textures like foams, powders and that most appetizing of au courant coinages, “soils”  — that’s been a tough sell in New York. And Mr. Mason, who made his name as the pastry chef at WD-50, belongs to a group of brainy iconoclasts (Will Goldfarb, Pichet Ong) who are challenging the usual segregation of savory and sweet. At Tailor, for example, the ice cream with a rum-braised banana is the flavor of mustard, and not even honey mustard at that. But his infatuation with his own imagination doesn’t leave room enough for a self-appraisal of the results, for dissent from collaborators who might flag the foolhardy creations among the clever. Tailor winds up with an intermittently exhilarating but ultimately frustrating mishmash of the two. Maybe Mr. Mason has been set up to be too self-assured. He’s a darling of in-the-know restaurant enthusiasts, his stature reflected in the decision of one prominent blog, New York magazine’s Grub Street, to have him chronicle the laborious process of opening a restaurant for nine months before Tailor’s debut in September. His reports popped up under such headlines as “Sam Mason Parties Like Rock Star, Gets Meta,”  “Sam Mason Ogles Waitresses, Buys Tiles” and “Sam Mason and the Fabulous Egg Machine,” which sounds like some molecular-gastronomy analogue to “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.” Come to think of it, he does bear a passing resemblance to Johnny Depp. But while these dispatches smacked of posturing, they also captured an attention to detail that’s evident to anyone who enters Tailor. It’s a great-looking place, the lighting just right, the booths against one wall of the 60-seat dining room upholstered in gray and brown striped velvet and twice as spacious as they need to be. Servers wear pinstriped waistcoats and tight-fitting pants custom-made by Lord Willy’s, a tailor trafficking in English panache. The effect is at once precious and amusing, which can also describe the food. The relatively concise menu encompasses five small plates, five large ones and seven desserts. Over recent weeks Mr. Mason has also been serving an eight-course “cocoa tasting menu” that even Charlie might consider an undue obsession with chocolate. (The tasting menu themes will change over time.) Initially, all of Tailor’s dishes were appetizer-size and even a parade of them left you hungry for something more substantial. The menu’s current structure, instituted just this week, is an encouraging sign that Mr. Mason can make alterations if he must and that Tailor may improve. It has plenty of merit to build on. In a city swollen with pork belly, his rendition is among the best. He caresses slices of it with a knockout miso-butterscotch sauce that casts the dish as some honey-baked ham of the gods, and adds braised artichoke and oven-dried apple to temper all that gooey richness. Peekytoe crab is served with a pineapple foam that amplifies its sweetness and a pine nut purée that holds that effect in delicate check. Sometimes Mr. Mason’s sense of balance is dead-on, as it is  with Arctic char that’s poached in tart passion fruit juice and butter and surrounded by earthy mushrooms. And sometimes he’s not so steady. A duck-and-eel terrine in a chocolate consommé tastes like cat food splashed with Yoo-hoo. A fillet of black cod doesn’t take much better to the chocolate-sherry gastrique foisted upon it. A cocoa-caramel sauce nicely flatters a terrine of foie gras and peanut butter, but the dish illustrates an occasional peril of progressive cuisine’s dependence on precise juxtapositions and pinpoint flavor combinations. For each bite to be absolutely right, you need a measure of all of many sparsely represented ingredients. Too much of the raw peanut and too little of the pear with the terrine yields an unpleasantly bitter effect. Mr. Mason’s background creates high expectations for desserts, among which the pairing of cumin ice cream with caramelized apple is pure magic. An equally charmed wedding of smoked vanilla ice cream and sassafras cake brings to mind a root beer float. But mustard with banana? Skip it, and take a pass as well on a “Manchego cheesecake” that’s really a snake of cheese-flavored paste slithering across the plate, presumably on the hunt for the sugar it desperately needs. The most successful stretch of the menu is the long list of special cocktails by Eben Freeman, also from WD-50. They can be enjoyed in a seductive downstairs lounge. And while they, like Mr. Mason’s dishes, include gonzo misfires, your reaction won’t be as negative. Drinks aren’t truly essential  —  humor me here  — so you’ll suffer loopy letdowns in the name of adventure. Food’s the center of a meal, the stuff of survival, so you expect a final balance of basic satisfaction. And like some of his envelope-pushing peers, Mr. Mason may be too invested in his mind games to attend to that. Tailor * 525 Broome Street (Thompson Street), SoHo; (212) 334-5182.

931,Da Silvano,★,20060927,Frank Bruni,Greenwich Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html,"I HAVE a bone to pick with Madonna. With Tom Hanks and Danny DeVito as well. All three have vouched unreservedly for the restaurant Da Silvano, filling its guest book with pithy testimonials, which also made their way into a Da Silvano cookbook. “Bravo!” proclaimed Mr. Hanks. (His exclamation point, not mine.) “Bellissimo!” raved Mr. DeVito. (Again, his exclamation point.) Madonna, in a less exclamatory mood, said, “Yummy yummy.” She’s always been such an eloquent lyricist. Celebrities love Da Silvano. Many regular folks love Da Silvano. Even some self-regarding gastronomes whose opinions I respect love Da Silvano, and I have to wonder if any of them has had anything like the chicken liver crostini I sampled on the first of several recent visits. They tasted like pet food — or, rather, how I imagine it would taste. On that same night I was assaulted by the osso buco, at once overcooked and over-flabby, with nightmarishly liquefied marrow. While the excavation of marrow always calls for a narrow instrument, that instrument shouldn’t have to be a straw. What were Tom, Danny and Madge thinking, or eating? And why was this restaurant so packed? Those questions tugged me back to Da Silvano, and my return visits did indeed yield answers, by which I mean dishes that crossed the yummy threshold and even, in some cases, made me want to exclaim. “A revelation!” That’s an honest description of the plump rabbit, uncommonly tender and perfumed with rosemary, that I had there. “Just like in Italy!” That’s a fair tribute to the buffalo milk mozzarella, among the best in the city. It had a dead-on degree of the oxymoronic sweet sourness that this cheese is all about. It was texturally weepy in the right way — a little, not a lot. And if you order it with Da Silvano’s exemplary prosciutto and make bites that combine a bit of each, you yourself might be moved to tears. Perhaps more than any New York restaurant I know, Da Silvano illustrates the occasional futility of summary judgments, the mind-boggling inconsistency that can exist across the breadth of a menu and a series of visits. Although those of us in the criticism business like to talk in sweeping, definitive terms, many establishments resist such reduction. In particular, many establishments like Da Silvano do. The context of my visits was a mini-survey of Italian restaurants that are neither proudly hokey red-sauce joints nor stylized, self-conscious destinations. I was curious about long-running restaurants that combined classicism or rusticity with lofty prices and currency on Page Six. I went to Il Mulino, where half the food was fantastic, half not. To Il Cantinori — so pleasant in some ways, so forgettable in others. Da Silvano had the craziest full-throttle energy (just try to have a whispery conversation there) and the oddest service, which could truly be called familial, inasmuch as it was equal parts loving and forgetful, teasing and chiding. “This is disgusting,” said a server one night as he swooped in to sweep away all the crumbs I’d created by going bonkers with the nicely salty and crunchy foccacia. I apologized for being and leaving such a mess. “It’s not your fault,” he said. “It’s the bread’s.” Da Silvano, which received two stars in The New York Times from Ruth Reichl in 1998, has been around for more than three decades. Over that time it has evolved from a trailblazing showcase for unadorned Tuscan cooking to something of a downtown Elaine’s, with a proprietor, Silvano Marchetto, practiced at coddling stars and manufacturing his own luster. A cartoon illustration of his face is stamped on the restaurant’s water bottles and pepper grinders. The look of the restaurant never changes all that much. With the rough-surfaced yellow walls in some rooms, the exposed brick in others and the romantic lighting, you can easily imagine yourself in some far-away trattoria. Of course, you’re on a busy stretch of lower Sixth Avenue, but the sidewalk outside Da Silvano is broad enough to permit many appealing outdoor tables that aren’t awash in exhaust fumes. And to my surprise, the servers seemed relatively egalitarian in distributing those tables. The menu never changes much, either. Pasta dishes include such stalwarts as tagliatelle alla Bolognese (the sauce tasted suspiciously off), spaghettini puttanesca (respectable) and penne arrabbiata (ditto). My favorite was taglierini contadina: narrow, flat noodles with crumbled sausage, peas, cream and tomato, coexisting in blissful harmony. Entrees include roasted pork shoulder (flavorful enough to rise above a surfeit of salt), vitello tonnato (hugely flavorful despite leathery meat), a breaded veal chop (too oily), and a variety of seafood (surprisingly good, given fish’s delicacy and the kitchen’s proneness to error). On the strength of the panzanella (a cold bread salad with tomatoes and roasted peppers), the eggplant parmigiana and an antipasti spread of eggplant, asparagus, peppers and the like, I’m tempted to say that Da Silvano offers safe passage to anyone who maintains vegetal bearings. But I can’t forget the bitterness of fava beans, served with pecorino, or the rubbery disgrace of the overcooked broccoli put before a friend who had in fact ordered cauliflower. So just what is Da Silvano? A serious restaurant of simple pleasures, or an atmospheric, adrenaline-charged mill for expensive bistecca alla Fiorentina, which was sadly ordinary? How can the stars gush so unequivocally about it? I reached out. Madonna was working in Japan and unavailable for comment, her publicist said. But Sarah Jessica Parker, who once scribbled her “love” of the food, stood by that statement, saying in an e-mail message that she used to go there weekly and order artichokes, linguine with clams (“never grew bored” of it, she said) and whatever pasta was being served with seasonal truffles. As it happens, the linguine with clams and bottarga that I had at Da Silvano was lovely. The same went for taglierini with cream and summer truffles. So maybe I really don’t have any quibble with the celebs. Maybe they just don’t wander as blindly through as much of the menu as some of the rest of us do. Da Silvano * 260 Avenue of the Americas (Houston Street), Greenwich Village; (212) 982-2343. ATMOSPHERE A rambling series of rustic rooms with brick and rough-surfaced yellow walls, along with a sprawling sidewalk cafe. SOUND LEVEL Out of control.

933,Ciano,★★,20110111,Sam Sifton,Flatiron,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/12/dining/reviews/12rest.html,"THERE are two remarkable things going on at Ciano, the casual, new-style Italian restaurant that Shea Gallante opened a few months ago on East 22nd Street. The first is Mr. Gallante’s food, which is ambitious, beautiful and flavor packed, a kind of Italian home cooking made grand and attractive, rich as Berlusconi, not as oily. It is less precious, less purposefully fancy, less aggressively upscale than what he was putting forth at Cru, where he cooked until 2009 and which closed last year. He isn’t trying so hard. And Ciano is exciting for that. Mr. Gallante cuts rock shrimp into tender little meatballs as an assaggini, a little snack even before the antipasti come, and their sweetness has the capacity to astonish. The taste suggests Key West if it were a town on the Lido. He makes veal meatballs with the texture of down pillows and puts these on melting polenta so that the mind is left spinning: Is this even meat? He roasts baby artichoke hearts and tosses them into a bed of frisée lettuce. There are drifts of ricotta studded with pepperoncini on there as well, bolsters of cherry tomato. Synapses pop and sizzle at the combination. Soft mackerel might follow, tasting of the sea and the saor that accompanies it, a modern American take on the classic Venetian dish made with sardines and sweet and sour onions. Or ravioli with roasted Hubbard squash pressed into its heart, accompanied by a perfect sage-hit brown-butter sauce and a drizzle of aged balsamic vinegar. Or a tangle of pappardelle with heady duck Bolognese, served under a lot of oregano and strong, walnut-y pecorino di noce. A veal chop, salty in crust, sweet in flesh. Lamb chop with lamb belly? Chicken roasted in a sealed pot? Wild striped bass? We get ahead of ourselves so quickly here. Hold a minute before ordering. Instead, take in the fire crackling in the fireplace left over from when Cesare Casella ran this room as Beppe. Eat some of the warm bread pulled from its hearth, accompanied by truffle butter and fruity olive oil, and consider which way the evening may go. For the second remarkable thing about Ciano, named for the Tuscan hill town Montepulciano, is its wine list and, as important, the manner in which its grapes are  served. Sold may be the better verb. You can have a very nice time at Ciano simply ordering off the list of wines by the glass, buying familiar bottles or sticking to water and Negronis or both. But John Slover, Ciano’s antic director of wines, has instituted the same half-bottle policy he uses at the significantly smaller Bar Henry on Houston Street, in which customers may purchase half of any bottle on his list for half its price. The remaining wine is sold by the glass, on the recommendation of Mr. Slover or his well-trained staff. This offers exciting possibilities. It is a tricky business, though, like getting a deal on a car. It does not favor the amateur or the neophyte. Those half bottles sold, after all, lead to half bottles that need to be sold. Diners may get great deals out of this process, and chances to explore areas of winemaking they would not otherwise visit: a white Burgundy you’d never think would appear in an Italian restaurant where a fire crackles; some super-fruit Sardinian mystery juice to follow. You can have an adventure on the cheap. But you may also end up in deeper waters than you intended. It can be expensive to play along with Mr. Slover (a couple glasses of a 1968 Vallana he just happened to have open one night was $148 to the house). Is the experience worth it? Talk to Mr. Slover in detail before buying. Because sometimes the answer is yes. (Oh, man, that old nebbiolo: like sitting fat and happy in a leather chair in a polished wooden room, beside a pile of tobacco leaves, with a bouquet of roses.) It can linger in your mind for days. Entertainment in New York City comes at a cost. At least here you may name your price and take the ride that it brings. “I know what you want,” Mr. Slover said one night at the restaurant, “before you’re aware that you want it.” Mr. Gallante’s partner in Ciano is Stratis Morfogen of Philippe, a former nightclub impresario. The maître d’hôtel is Jonathan Gilbert, who used to run the floor at Per Se, here playing Dwyane Wade to Mr. Slover’s LeBron James. The combination leads to a delightful mix in the dining room and at the tables. There are gastro-tourists in from Los Angeles, and old-guard food freaks with black cars lingering outside. Here are wine nerds with Filson bags clinking with tasting bottles alongside grown-up club kids going soft in the middle, younger ones photographing everything they eat and uploading it to their Tumblrs. The atmosphere recalls the early years of Il Cantinori, on East 10th Street, with a service style that matches the one you used to find at trattorias like Le Madri, in Chelsea, more than those of the more formal Italian dining rooms that have arisen since, most notably the ones the restaurateur Chris Cannon built at Alto and Marea, among other places. Mayor Koch would approve of Ciano. There are wobbles, for this. Ciano is not yet an entirely smooth-running operation, and has some of the dewy awkwardness of a fawn. Waiters and runners struggle to serve all the customers with the grace promised at the door. There can be long delays between courses. Dishes are served to the wrong people sometimes. An entire pasta course went missing once. A huge entree — a beautiful fist of Berkshire pork served under a stream of Barolo vinegar, with Tuscan beans and grilled maitake mushrooms, for instance — was served alongside a portion of striped bass so small as to recall a postage stamp, leading to disappointment in the contrast. Upsells are common — why, you can have truffles shaved on whatever you like! The offer of tap water is not. But a bowl of perfectly cooked tortellini stuffed with braised veal and sweetbreads makes up for a great deal, flavored with a hit of fennel, softened by the nuttiness of fontina cheese. So do Nantucket bay scallops, candy of the sea, smartly paired with hazelnuts, brussels sprouts and more of that Hubbard squash, here cut into mostarda. And Bjoern Boettcher, the pastry chef, did not come to Ciano to loaf. There is an intense pistachio cake on his menu as well as a reconfigured tiramisù with amaretto gelée that manages to reinvent the dish without harming its flavors, rendering old as new, boring as modern. That is Ciano’s challenge as well. It is another new take on the Italian restaurant in a city full of the same, a place that must step into the future as into the past. Tastes good there.   Ciano ★★ 45 East 22nd Street (between Broadway and Park Avenue South), Flatiron district; (212) 982-8422; cianonyc.com.

937,Rouge Tomate,★,20090106,Frank Bruni,Upper East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/07/dining/07rest.html,"YOU’VE no doubt been to restaurants that expanded your French, Italian and Spanish vocabularies. Rouge Tomate does them one better. It goes to work on your Latin. Not with its name, of course. It exhumes a dead language for its philosophy, or what one server called its “charter,” defined by the initials S.P.E. —  “sanitas per escam.” That apparently means “health through food,” at least as Cicero might have said it. And it signals that Rouge Tomate isn’t going to let you carpe any diem if there’s too much cream or butter in the equation, or if it requires grilling (bad for the air) or frying (bad for the arteries). This restaurant is devoted to more than your pleasure and linguistic tutelage. It’s watching over your well-being. In addition to a head chef with obvious talent, it employs a nutritionist, who makes certain that dishes  have optimal ratios of meats to vegetables and fruits to nuts and don’t traffic recklessly in calories or the wrong fats. Rouge Tomate carves out a Zone of its own, championing a gastrointestinal feng shui. And it’s impressive, to a point. What comes out of its kitchen are intricately, gorgeously assembled dishes  that will have diners beyond food bloggers reaching for their cellphone cameras. What goes into its kitchen are top-notch ingredients from relatively local sources (for the most part) with sustainable pedigrees. That kitchen, moreover, is a glowing stage on the lower of two vast levels, formerly the Nicole Farhi store on the Upper East Side, that have been transformed by the architectural firm Bentel & Bentel into one of the prettiest, airiest dining environments this city has seen in some time. One of the most comfortable, too. Rouge Tomate has more than 200 seats and  could wedge twice that number into its roughly 15,000 square feet. Barneys shoppers lured across East 60th Street for a post-spree salad will feel sufficiently pampered. But for all its glimmer and good intentions, Rouge Tomate falters somewhat. While about a quarter of the dishes are knockouts, at least as many are overly calculated and fastidious, suggesting there’s such a thing as too much balance. The same fruity, nutty, seedy notes pop up too often: during one meal I felt tyrannized by pomegranate, antioxidized to a fare-thee-well. Too much of the food lacks punch. Too much of it simply lacks salt. Rouge Tomate is related to  a restaurant in Brussels with the same name and the same (laudable) values, and it presents two menus, one on the ground floor, in what it labels a cafe, and one below, where the main dining room and the kitchen are. The cafe includes a bar where the fresh fruit on display is used for bright-hued alcoholic and non-alcoholic cocktails  — it’s a Jamba Juice for the Prada set. The cafe menu isn’t all that much less expensive than the dining room’s, though neither’s prices seem out of line, given the quality  of the ingredients and the splendor of the surroundings. The chef Jeremy Bearman supervises both domains. He put in time under Daniel Boulud and Joël Robuchon, and his work reflects considerable diligence and, on occasion, real artistry. The best appetizer,  a celery root and almond panna cotta, is a dazzler with grapefruit slices rising like magenta sails from a deck of superb peekytoe crab. The savory panna cotta buttresses and anchors it all, giving an overexposed combination of ingredients an extra dimension and a sumptuous texture. A hash made of five different kinds of potatoes, diced and sautéed with all the seasoning a spud could ask for, has a more basic but no less potent appeal. It also has the right partner: an egg cooked to silky perfection in an immersion circulator. Several entrees rise to the level of these appetizers. The one that sounds least promising, a lettuce and root vegetable cassoulet, is among the most satisfying, coaxing robust flavor from a meatless mix of carrots, sunchokes, turnips, cranberry beans and a generous measure of bread crumbs. Unpronounceable but irresistible, the rabbit fleischnacke rolls chestnut pasta around tender meat. Main courses of duck  “en cocotte” with quince and fregola  and guinea hen are both expertly cooked. For a place fixated on produce, Rouge Tomate often does right by flesh. Often, but not always. The grass-fed beef in an entree salad in the cafe had so little richness or flavor, and held so little interest, that my companions and I lavished more energy on the croutons in a tangle of greens to their side. When cubes of bread trump slices of steak, a dish is in serious trouble. Black cod with kohlrabi, crosnes and a horseradish broth wasn’t just bland but blurry, not a single clear flavor coming into focus. That was a problem with too many dishes, and too often I found myself wishing I could grate some salty cheese or sprinkle some chili flakes on the food. Across several visits I never found a single dessert to love or more than a few to like. And in the absence of more consistent pleasures, I was left to ponder the thoroughness, bordering on parody, with which Rouge Tomate promotes its virtue. The wine list  — a fine one, with a broad range of prices and styles  — denotes certain wines as  biodynamic, others as organic, still others as “practicing biodynamic” and still others as “practicing organic.” If I had more space and less compassion, I’d explain the distinctions, just as a server explained them to me. But that’s between you and Google. I was also left to ponder how oddly the restaurant’s rectitude  squares with a white onyx sink as long as a bowling alley in the unisex bathroom, where there’s a towel-proffering attendant, and how unfortunate the restaurant’s  timing is. There’s a  super-deluxe grandness to its setting that suddenly seems dated in the extreme, a vestige of headier, more hedonistic times. It had a fin de siècle feel, though I shouldn’t turn to French to articulate that. Anyone know the Latin? Rouge Tomate * 10 East 60th Street; (646) 237-8977;  rougetomatenyc.com.

939,SD26,★,20091201,Sam Sifton,Midtown South,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/02/dining/reviews/02rest.html,"THEY really are trying down there at SD26, the old lion Tony May and his indefatigable daughter  Marisa, the two of them working the dining room of their fancy new restaurant as if all that happened to their old one, San Domenico, was a face-lift. They greet customers with handshakes, hugs, smiles. They pull out chairs in this vast theatrical space across the street from Madison Square Park and say: Of course the giant raviolo with soft-cooked egg and truffled butter is on the menu. Odette Fada, who started cooking for the Mays in 1996, is back there running the show. (And of course it’s still delicious.) Welcome back! But what’s happened here is much more than simply a face-lift. The sedate and elegant San Domenico, which opened in 1988, has been kicked to the curb. SD26 is the restaurant equivalent of a second wife: younger, considerably more nervous, dressed in a way that might raise eyebrows in the social circles the original restaurant was opened to serve. San Domenico was, many believed, Manhattan’s best classically Italian restaurant. Some elements of that excellence remain in the cooking at SD26 and in the wine list put together by the affable Jason Ferris, the restaurant’s wine director. Others have been buried beneath attempts to modernize the kind of dining that Mr. May says has gone out of fashion: the elegant Italian cuisine he helped bring to New York. “I cannot impose my will,” Mr. May told The New York Times in advance of the new restaurant’s opening, explaining why he spent $7 million to decorate the space with Italian black-oak flooring and bright red walls, put in private dining alcoves and an open kitchen, a huge bar, and  installations all over the place by the fiber artist Sheila Hicks. “Today, diners don’t want to eat too much,” he said. “They want to be dressed the way they want, they expect great food and yet won’t spend too much. So in SD26 they will be comfortable, just the way they want it.” Certainly there is excellent food at SD26, and in formats — small plates, shared plates, many antipasti — that are welcome to those who wish to spend less in restaurants. But the answer to changing tastes is not perhaps to move to a Flatiron district loft and install a sound system and pinlights in the ceiling. It is not perhaps to court T-shirts and jeans over jackets, ties and dresses, nor to abandon a printed wine list in favor of portable tablet computers that old patrons handle as if they were explosive devices. (It’s better to flag down Mr. Ferris, the tall American in the dining room with the tastevin necklace over his suit: smart in his bling.) Renovation of the original mission may have been a smarter course. A starter plate of cured meats, for instance, brought credible mortadella, prosciutto, salamini, a few marinated mushrooms. Where were they from? The waiter looked confused at the question. “Italy,” he said. “This is all from Italy, imported here by Mr. May.” Which is terrific. But it is a hard truth that in Manhattan in 2009 excellent meats from “Italy” are not what people want. Weird but true: They want salumi out of a basement in Greenpoint, made by some kid with tattoos who dropped out of Wesleyan. Local is the new authentic. But the old authentic matters as well, and thus what the restaurant calls “panzanella” with arugula pesto and marinated anchovies is a disappointment. The quotation marks around the word on the menu evoke images of deconstruction, of a playful interpretation of Italian cooking. But even in the name of whimsy and even with terrific anchovies on top, panzanella is made best with old bread torn into shards. Here, constructed out of small bread dice, it falls apart in the dressing, tastes only of oily sawdust, a bad day at the shop. Hiramasa cured in citrus on a mat of black squid-ink oil, with chervil and radish salad, was almost punishingly salty. “It’s a Pacific fish,” the waiter had said. “White-fleshed and very delicious.” Hiramasa is also known as yellowtail amberjack, a species that has been overfished by the Japanese for years; it’s now a farmed species, which may help explain the use of a cure to give it flavor. It was not a good dish. Nor was an octopus carpaccio with sun-dried tomatoes and fine herbs that, to the good, looked like a Chuck Close painting. (To the bad, it tasted like one.) Baccalà was served three ways: as carpaccio, whipped and baked. The carpaccio version, translucent and interesting, almost worked. The whipped one, though, loaded into a tube and pushed onto the plate in the manner of a cannoli filling, did not: too dense, too acidic. The baked — served with olives in a tomato sauce — was merely bland. And halibut confit in olive oil with chickpeas and a clam ragù made a mockery of the confit process; it was just halibut poached in olive oil, chewy and flavorless. Better bets have included candele — hollow candle-shaped pasta from the artisanal maker Setaro — with cauliflower, saffron, pine nuts and anchovy oil that sits astride the cauliflower-anchovy axis like a king, evoking the very essence of great Italian cooking. For a time there was a wonderful butternut-squash gnocchi dish, drenched in butter, served over sautéed chicken livers and dotted with fried sage. Chitarra, a signature dish of the restaurant, is rough-hewn and cooked perfectly beneath its plain tomato sauce. And a plainer-still dish of spaghetti with butter and Parmesan, with white truffle shaved over the top at $8 a gram, can explain in one bite Ms. Fada’s reputation as one of the best pasta cooks in the country. Her spaghetti with baked cherry tomatoes, pecorino and lobster can explain it in two. Some of the dishes evoke happy sighs: a sticky braise of beef cheeks with onion marmalade; grilled lamb chops with mint couscous, black mission figs and fennel; a special of bollito misto, with soft, fragrant veal tongue and a perfect slice of cotechino sausage. Others, like an insipid beef tartare with lady apple and asparagus, bring grimaces. Desserts are at the moment a shrugworthy detour on the way to the check, though espresso granité will do in a pinch. Then there’s the long walk back through the bar to the street, past slightly stunned old regulars from San Domenico and gastro-tourists wondering what all the fuss was about. Emerging onto 26th Street, the overwhelming feeling a diner is left with is one of exhaustion, the sense that at SD26 we are a long, long way from the kind of restaurant Mr. May has stood for in New York City. It’s a restaurant to make anyone feel old. SD26 ★ 19 East 26th Street (Madison Avenue), Flatiron district; (212) 265-5959; sd26ny.com. ATMOSPHERE Cavernous and awkward.

943,White Gold Butchers,★★,20170207,Pete Wells,Upper West Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/dining/white-gold-butchers-review-april-bloomfield-restaurant.html,"I’ve finally found a new restaurant on the Upper West Side that I want to recommend to people who don’t live there. It has only taken me five years. In my time as critic, I’ve searched the streets between Lincoln Center and Columbia University for good places to eat. I’ve come across some, but I could never convince myself that any of them were worth a special trip. That finally changed after October, when Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield opened White Gold Butchers, a restaurant inside a butcher shop on Amsterdam Avenue. Here’s something strange: In all this time, I’ve never heard from Upper West Side readers either attacking me for ignoring their neighborhood or tipping me off to a gem I’d overlooked. Have they just given up hope after watching the local restaurants they could honestly tell friends were worth traveling for — Picholine, Telepan, Ouest — close one by one? Another odd thing: White Gold is the first Bloomfield-Friedman restaurant where I have never had to wait to be seated. True, one night I showed up ridiculously early, and by the time I left, a small crowd by the door was eyeing my table. But people in the neighborhood tell me it is possible more often than not to walk right in and sit down. This is not typically the case at the Spotted Pig, the Breslin Bar & Dining Room, Salvation Burger or other restaurants run by Ms. Bloomfield and Mr. Friedman. Where is everybody? People, April Bloomfield is cooking meat, one of the things she does best. Two young butchers, Jocelyn Guest and Erika Nakamura, are partners in the restaurant; in their blue aprons and white shirts, they oversee the carving and trimming and sawing and chopping. Looking at the colors in the glass butcher’s case, the plum purple of the raw pork and the marigold yellow of the chicken skin, you know that this meat will cook up so nicely that it can be eaten and enjoyed all by itself. White Gold doesn’t go quite that far, but it comes close. The menu gets right to the point, no small talk: The main courses fall under the heading Plates. There are usually four of them, cooked very simply. A gorgeously juicy and pink length of grilled pork, for example, was flecked with sage salt, and its only garnish was a spoonful of sauce made from apples — not applesauce but a saltier and more complex reduction. Beef heart was served like steak, sliced into small, tender, nearly rare slabs. The spice-and-nut blend dukkah was the seasoning. Probably meant more for the roasted carrots on the same plate, the dukkah was also at home with the heart. A special one night was a portion of pork shoulder cooked in milk at a quiet murmur until the meat had relaxed and the liquid had boiled away and the fat had pulled together in sweet curds the color of peanut butter. It sounds and looks creepy, but it’s wonderful. As good as it felt to lose myself in tender pork and caramelized milk, the high point of that dinner was beef carpaccio. White Gold now makes my favorite version of this classic Italian dish in New York. The toppings are sliced white mushrooms, parsley leaves and pickled broccoli stems. I’d never given much thought to pickled broccoli stems before, but now I think their highest use is with darkly lush sheets of raw beef furred over with fine white horseradish gratings. The raviolo in brodo is Italian, too, up to a point. The broth is beef, deeply brown and sticky on the lips. For the single raviolo, two circles of barely cooked kabocha squash do the work normally done by pasta, sandwiching a creamy core of taleggio that will end up running out and slipping into the broth, no matter how careful you are, flavoring the soup along with red drops of pumpkinseed oil. If none of this has persuaded you to take a train or crosstown bus to the Upper West Side, then it’s time to let the “crispy layered potato” out of its cage. These are little golden boxes made of thin rectangles of potato stacked like Post-it notes, then fried in beef fat. I’m not sure how they stay together. They are crunchy and delicate and impossible to stop eating. White Gold has found a way to multiply the surface area of a fairly small piece of potato so that more potato comes into contact with hot oil. This is a significant advance in the field of applied potato physics. Like Fleishers Craft Butchery, Dickson’s Farmstand Meats and a few other butcher shops, White Gold buys whole animals. In theory, the cooks should be able to get creative with the odds and ends, yet offal isn’t a major feature of the menu. I have to admit that the White Gold of my dreams would serve not just chicken liver mousse but gizzard confit; not just grilled lamb leg but sautéed kidneys; not just pork shoulder but stuffed trotters. In the morning, White Gold is devoted to egg sandwiches. At lunch, you can order a version of the chopped cheese, a late-night specialty of bodegas in Harlem and the Bronx. As the sandwich has started showing up in other neighborhoods, at higher prices, it has become a symbol of cultural appropriation and gentrification. White Gold sells it for $11, roughly twice what it would cost on its home turf. It is also a somewhat odd interpretation, not so much the classic cheese-slicked heap of ground beef as a cheeseburger hacked into chunks. Britain does better than the Bronx on White Gold’s lunch menu. Head straight to the savory-pastry case and get a sausage roll, a stub of golden crust wrapped around pink, coarse breakfast sausages, or a pasty, a hand pie that can be held by its rolled seam, which looks like a fat lip. One pasty is filled with potatoes and fontina; another with beef stew. Both are so good I’d recommend buying an extra to tote around in an empty pocket. One reason White Gold isn’t mobbed at night may be that, for the first time, Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield have built a restaurant without a bar. Wine and beer are available, from Narragansett in a can to (when I was there) a six-year-old bottle of petit verdot from Clendenen Family Vineyards, but there’s nowhere to drink them unless you’re eating. The space doesn’t encourage hanging out with a glass. This may have to do with the bright lighting — butchers need to be able to see to do their work — or the relative starkness of the atmosphere. The wallpaper in the restroom has more energy than the rest of the interior design put together. White Gold reminds me of small, obscure, excellent restaurants I’ve tripped into during vacations, the tapas bar or the trattoria that happened to be close to where I was staying and that I remember better than the places other people had recommended before I left home. White Gold may never be a destination, but in its modest and simple way, it’s memorable."
945,La Promenade Des Anglais ,★★,20120110,Pete Wells,Chelsea,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/dining/reviews/la-promenade-des-anglais-nyc-restaurant-review.html,"WHEN the money that had kept New York aloft went away a few years back, some chefs switched into damage control immediately. They clipped prices. They made their menus and dining rooms more easygoing. They put future projects on hold. Alain Allegretti was not among them. Well into the first year of the recession, he marched forward as planned with a fairly expensive and rather formal restaurant in Chelsea. Allegretti, he called it. There were starchy expanses of white fabric on the tables and service that was somewhat starchy as well. Main courses began around $30 and sailed on from there. This was in the summer of 2008. The end of that story was as predictable as it was unfortunate, because Mr. Allegretti is one of the city’s most adept practitioners of modern French cuisine. But like many people who were knocked back a step or two by the less frenetic economy, Mr. Allegretti studied the city’s new mood, and studied it well. La Promenade des Anglais, a flashy bistro by way of Nice that he opened in Chelsea in September, is almost a point-by-point rebuttal of Allegretti. The tabletops are glossy black, set with dark place mats. The prices top out at $30. The staff is all smiles. And so was I, the minute I ate a small prosciutto and clam croquette. It looked demure enough, primly nestled in a folded linen napkin like a Parker House roll. It was anything but demure. At the first bite, the golden shell gave way to a riotously creamy, molten core that was something like a clam brandade. Sit at the bar with an order of these and a $10 glass of Gerard Bertrand’s Languedoc rosé, and you’re on your way to a grand night. But Mr. Allegretti didn’t labor in Alain Ducasse’s kitchens for four years just to make clam fritters. Even in these times, he can construct harmonious and sophisticated plates on which each ingredient has been treated in a way calculated to coax forth the most flavor. For a convincing demonstration of the power of this approach, consider a main course of striped bass. A gentle green broth of leeks is edged toward luxuriousness with nibs of black truffle, while a bed of braised leeks and a tangle of fried leeks allow other sides of that vegetable to shine. Fingerling potatoes look ordinary enough, but one bite tells you there’s something more going on, something that is explained by a slow braise in chicken stock. And the bass itself falls into radiant white slabs at the merest approach of a fork. In a shrimp tartare appetizer, Mr. Allegretti amplifies the natural sweetness of raw red shrimp with a lightly perfumed swirl of lemon-grass oil and a judiciously dressed celery-root rémoulade. (The tartare is served on freshly fried sliced potatoes, too elegant to be called chips.) He sets tender strips of canned Sicilian tuna belly on handmade quills of trofie pasta in a sweet tomato sauce that brought back the hot sunshine of late summer. Sometimes Mr. Allegretti’s cooking tilts toward the south of France and Liguria, as with those delicious caper- and olive-accented trofie, and sometimes it doesn’t. In either case it is so alluring that I began to think of La Promenade des Anglais as a charming and undiscovered seaside resort that I’d stumbled across. That it sits on the ground floor of the London Terrace apartments did little to splash cold water on this fantasy. At first I was dazzled by everything, from the long white awning that starts right at the curb to the stylized beach umbrellas and palm trees in black and white on the ceiling to the huge brass floor lamps and even the paint on the walls — Côte d’Azur blue. My companions and I were delighted with simple dishes like whipped ricotta with a stack of toast that tasted as if it had been grilled on the beach. We were just as happy with the lamb osso buco, with a marrow spoon jutting out from inside a length of shank bone. As you do when you’re falling for someplace new, I couldn’t wait to return. With a closer look came the inevitable realization that what I had discovered on West 23rd Street fell a little short of paradise. The octopus à la plancha was tender enough, but needed more of a boost in flavor than it got from chorizo and chickpeas. And while I loved the juicy hunk of swordfish, nothing else on the plate did. The quiet taste of the fish had to keep fighting off incursions from pungent eggplant caviar, fat and briny olives and spicy harissa. Travel long enough and sooner or later you turn the wrong corner, trust the wrong stranger. One night it happened to me at La Promenade. The veal medallions, which on an earlier trip had made a strong case for bringing this meat back into fashion, were now lukewarm and floppy. The shaved brussels sprouts and cauliflower purée on the same plate, formerly a hearty and filling mash, were wet and gloppy, like a slaw that sits too long before a picnic. Salt brought an unwelcome sharpness to several plates, including a risotto cake with the scallops; tiny, flower-shaped ratatouille ravioli; and Provençale fish soup, which our server had excitedly billed as one of the chef’s signature dishes. Even the chrome and the Deco curves looked less like a stylish terrace overlooking the beachside avenue in Nice that gave its name to this restaurant, and more like a disco that hasn’t been updated since Bianca Jagger’s last turn on the dance floor. By this point I wondered whether I’d been in the grip of the same kind of hypnosis familiar to vacationers who’ve discovered that a piece of folk art that seems like a masterpiece in the flea market by the port is not quite as masterly on the wall of a Manhattan apartment. A final meal proved that the charms of La Promenade des Anglais are real and abiding. Yes, there are dull spots on the menu. (None are duller than the panisse, sticks of chickpea flour that are as tasty as a mouthful of cotton gauze.) And some dishes that can sparkle don’t always. Then I think back to how adroitly Mr. Allegretti corrected course between his last restaurant and this one. He wasn’t particularly quick to react, but he made up for it in thoroughness. I’ll bet he’ll take the same approach with the handful of things that are awry at La Promenade."
946,Shang,★,20090217,Frank Bruni,Lower East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/18/dining/reviews/18rest.html,"NEW YORKERS with full lives, sensible spending patterns and fantasies that revolve around something other than Convivio’s pecorino potatoes had probably never heard of Susur Lee before early December, when he opened a restaurant on the Lower East Side. The rest of us fell into one of two categories. Either we had eaten in one of Mr. Lee’s Toronto restaurants and haughtily regaled the uninitiated with rapturous accounts. Or we were among the regaled, made to feel provincial and pathetic for our failure to sup at the Lee shrine. If there’s one thing the modern gastronome loves more than pork belly, it’s bragging rights. I fell into the pathetic camp, aware of Mr. Lee’s inventive Chinese cooking but unexposed to it. So it was with great curiosity and an even greater sense of relief that I made my way down to Orchard Street and to Shang, his Manhattan debut. The staircase was the first befuddlement and miscalculation I encountered  — and a clue that the evening and restaurant might not be all I’d hope for. It’s a long, drab, foreboding rise of steps from the sidewalk to the host station, an entrance less inviting than aerobic. I’ve gone on runs that didn’t leave me as winded. At the summit is a dark bar with a familiar aesthetic of fashionable gloom, and beyond that lies the dining room, where there’s at long last some color, but not too much. Shang isn’t one of those Asian extravaganzas that looks as if it were designed by second graders on a Pez high. The dining room is relatively understated, apart from a cluster of circular orange banquettes and a few peachish  lighting fixtures so oddly shaped and unusually textured that my fellow critics have outdone themselves with metaphors, which I’d be a fool to try to improve upon. “Papier-mâché breasts” are what came to one reviewer’s mind. “Rumpled old stockings” popped into another’s. Split the difference and you’ve got the picture. But the more arresting visual flourishes are in Mr. Lee’s dishes themselves, many composed in the most kaleidoscopic, ornamental fashion imaginable. His cucumber salad, for example, is nearly as tall as it is wide, with lotus crisps slanting and rising upward like the spires of a Gaudí church. And there’s more than cucumber beneath those spires. There’s avocado, persimmon, squash. Into what ethnic category does such an assortment of ingredients fall? Mr. Lee calls his food global Chinese, signaling that he’s working not only with Chinese traditions but also with those of countries in which Chinese immigrants have settled over time. That gives him an invitation to Jamaica  — and a reason to put an elegant  version of jerk chicken with Scotch bonnet peppers on Shang’s menu. It allows him to meander across Asia, taking some curry from here, some sashimi from there. It opens up vast continents of flavor, encouraging exploration but perhaps discouraging restraint. Much of the food is busy and unfocused, and I sometimes had a better time gazing than grazing on it. Shang to a certain extent reminded me of some of the glitzier restaurants in Hong Kong.   It has a similar  mood  — the narcotizing club mix oozing from the speakers was the music of international limbo, the soundtrack of everywhere and nowhere  —  and similar flavors, those of an Asian crossroads: Thai, Indian, Japanese and of course Chinese. When he edits them down, the results can be intensely pleasurable. I loved all three of the soups on Shang’s long menu, maybe because a chef can get only so carried away with soup. The best was a curry lobster bisque, made with coconut milk and tomato, that had a skillful balance of fiery and sweet notes. Mr. Lee’s  kitchen  frequently demonstrates real discipline. It sent out lamb chops as juicy as anyone could ask them to be, with a carrot cardamom chutney that wasn’t exactly like any condiment I’d ever had with lamb but that nicely complemented the meat. A sweet-and-sour onion marmalade, meanwhile, was an equally fine partner for “crispy-skinned” chicken that was flawlessly tender but, as it happened, not especially crisp of skin. Why do so many chefs advertise their aims —  “crunchy this-or-that,” “tender braised whatnot”  — in the naming of dishes? If they didn’t, we might not be so aware that they’re missing their mark. Mr. Lee is seldom at a loss for ideas, but there’s a frantic quality to his work. The Singapore slaw, which servers don’t so much recommend as evangelize about, comprised about 20 identifiable ingredients  — nut and noodle, seed and sprout, root and flower  — but lacked the one thing it needed most: a dressing less cloying  and more nuanced than the one applied too liberally to it. The “crispy lobster,” panko-coated tail meat that’s deep-fried, was indeed crisp, but by the time it was paired with duck egg, wrapped in lettuce and blasted with kaffir lime and several kinds of chili pepper, it could have been crispy flounder or, for that matter, crispy tofu. In this dish and others, like kung pao oysters, the central player  — the marquee protein  — got lost. Desserts were less Asian but almost as overworked. The wine list is respectable, with many light-  and medium-bodied whites that go well with the food and did their part in making my evenings at Shang pleasant ones. Pleasant, but inconsistent and uneventful. The magic that Mr. Lee reputedly made in Toronto hasn’t followed him here. Shang * 187 Orchard Street (Houston Street), (212) 260-7900.

948,La Silhouette,★,20120508,Pete Wells,Clinton,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/dining/reviews/a-review-of-la-silhouette-in-hells-kitchen.html,"IF you want to start a fight on the subway, one proven technique is to smile at somebody and say, “Excuse me.” Asking the gentlemen in front of you at the stadium to kindly stay in their seats so you can see the next pitch does not always lead to bonding over what a swell season the Yankees are having. Politeness, in other words, is not always rewarded in New York. This may be one reason La Silhouette, which opened a little more than a year ago in Hell’s Kitchen, is still relatively unknown outside its neighborhood. Almost none of the people I took to La Silhouette had heard of it. By the end of the meal we would all be asking ourselves how a restaurant that works this hard at pleasing customers can be lost in the shuffle while the city showers attention on less comfortable places that are more skilled at boasting and preening. That La Silhouette is on the extremely short list of good French restaurants in walking distance of the Broadway theaters makes its low profile that much more unfortunate. Anybody on their way to watch “Death of a Salesman” at the Ethel Barrymore, for instance, certainly deserves a taste of La Silhouette’s foie gras à la Botero beforehand. The fattened liver, scored and well seared outside but meltingly pink within, is served with ripe plantains and roasted pineapple, the tropical sweetness of the fruit brought back into line by a bracing dab of coffee gel. It is close to an obligatory first course, although it has strong competition from another foie gras dish. This time the liver is the silky filling inside a rustic pâté of duck, pork and pistachios. It is a succinct reminder of why French charcuterie will be around long after we’ve all forgotten the name of Carla Bruni’s husband. La Silhouette’s chef, Matthew Tropeano, ought to know his way around a lobe of foie gras. He spent eight years in the kitchen at La Grenouille, mastering old-guard French dishes that fewer and fewer chefs in New York know how to pronounce. He was the chef there when Sam Sifton awarded the restaurant three stars in a review in The New York Times in 2009. Mr. Tropeano, who turns 33 on Sunday, is too young, however, to spend the rest of his life tending the eternal flame of the pike quenelle. Last year, he was lured to La Silhouette, where he must have more freedom to roam and to keep his menu in tune with the seasons. His technique and orientation are still recognizably French. He does well by the old school, like the coral-colored and lobster-rich sauce Americaine that comes with butter-poached bass and lobster. For admirers of the saucier’s art, tasting it is like hearing a forgotten favorite record on the radio. Every bit as classic, just as nicely handled, is ballotine stuffed with truffled forcemeat, the highlight of the roast chicken that La Silhouette has been serving lately. Yes, the skin on the breast could have been browned more thoroughly, but there’s no need to eat chicken skin when the plate also offers a foie gras sauce that is preposterously, appealingly rich. The chicken skin was symptomatic of a small but pervasive issue: even on very good dishes there was almost always one element that couldn’t keep pace or didn’t belong there in the first place. A generous serving of sweetbreads with a sauce of morels and pine nuts would have been complete on its own. Instead, a single raviolo stuffed with ricotta and nettles had been slipped under the sauce, which did no favors to the sweetbreads or to the raviolo. Next to a suave partnership of lamb chop and shredded braised shank, garlicky stems of broccoli rabe cooked al dente seemed intended for another dish, or perhaps another restaurant. And there was the duck sauce. Yes, it was a sauce that came with duck breast, but it was also reminiscent of the Chinese-takeout condiment. It wasn’t nearly as sweet, being made from rhubarb, but it was just as shiny and as insistently orange. The dish was saved by short, crisp lengths of rhubarb under bits of preserved ginger, a cheerful wink at spring, and by the duck itself. Here and elsewhere, the kitchen’s command of protein cookery tended to overcome any fumbles in the garnishes. And if for some reason that doesn’t do the trick, there is dessert. Jeffrey Sytsma, the pastry chef, seems to have a deep affection for all-American sweets, and he shows it by transforming them into smart, well-built desserts. For his popcorn crème brûlée, Mr. Sytsma strolls along the carnival arcade, making a popcorn-infused custard and serving it with caramel popcorn and slices of candied apple. What he bills as a dark chocolate pot de crème is really that campfire standby, s’mores, dressed up in evening wear: graham-cracker ice cream and a block of hazelnut marshmallow sit beside a chocolate pudding that is encased in a white chocolate shell, making it look a little bit like a marshmallow itself. One of the wonders of La Silhouette is that it manages all of this in a long, low, dark space that is about as inviting a spot for a restaurant as the Holland Tunnel. Handed this Rubik’s cube, the architect Richard Bloch attempted to inject some drama by creating a progression of small interiors. You check in beside the boxy little bar, pass through a small dining room, a slightly larger one, and a landing. Then you descend a few steps, and the restaurant suddenly opens up into a bright main dining room with bold red stripes on one wall and, at last, some windows. If this is your destination, you feel a genuine sense of arrival. Seated in one of the antechambers, you may feel like a traveler whose train has stalled somewhere on the outskirts of town. But outskirts don’t always stay outskirts forever. Not long ago, this stretch of Hell’s Kitchen was nobody’s idea of a dining mecca. Now lights pour from the glass faces of restaurants up and down Ninth Avenue. A block away from La Silhouette, Danji has built a citywide following for its bulgogi sliders. Foie gras and premillennial service are a less fashionable proposition, of course, but La Silhouette is trying very hard to beat the odds. New Yorkers may not always react well to good manners, but they do respond to ambition."
953,SHO Shaun Hergatt,★★,20100420,Sam Sifton,Financial District,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/21/dining/reviews/21rest.html,"SOME restaurants are time machines. SHO Shaun Hergatt, the strange and occasionally terrific restaurant on the second floor of a condominium building in the financial district, even looks like one, down to the elevator that whisks you up from the lobby. Diners enter this simple metal box in 2010, talking about the beating Goldman Sachs took in the markets on Friday. They emerge in the late 1990s, Goldman still privately held,   the economy booming in a city where restaurants reflected the excess. This calls for Champagne! SHO Shaun Hergatt, which opened in June and received a Michelin star in October, is  named for its chef, an Australian who cut his teeth on the Ritz-Carlton circuit and first came to New York as Gabriel Kreuther’s lieutenant at Atelier.   His show is set against a backdrop of muted browns and reds, sparkling glass, Asian motifs, dark tropical woods. To get to the dining room, customers pass through a kind of grape vault, a long corridor of wine behind glass with a low reflecting pool running down its center, from which candles emerge from metal flutes. The atmosphere is hushed, almost luxurious in its anonymity, a good business hotel in Sydney or Zurich, Miami or Bonn. The tables are wide and covered in good linen. They are spaced well apart from one another. In the main dining room, each offers a good view of the kitchen, which bustles professionally behind a thick glass wall, a silent tableau that recalls an operating theater as much as a place where food is prepared. That Champagne begins to seem a little strange, awkward. Who eats like this, now? Menus are proffered. They also seem to have emerged from the time machine. (Indeed, at $69 for three courses, dinner costs only a dollar more than the prix fixe  at Atelier back in 2002.) Mr. Hergatt does not celebrate the  fad for local purveyors, some dirt wizard driving down from Coxsackie with a hatful of ramps. He celebrates the ability to ship anything anywhere, anytime. His is a cuisine of geographical assertion. There is ocean trout from Tasmania. There are frogs’ legs from Florida. There is Japanese escolar, Colorado lamb, Vermont veal. Hiramasa — yellowtail amberjack — comes from Australia. Lobster from Maine. None of these come with certificates of authenticity, of course. Mr. Hergatt said in an e-mail message that the “Long Island striped bass” listed on the dinner menu was indeed from Long Island. But the commercial striped-bass fishery in New York waters closed on Dec. 15 and will not reopen until July 1. And there is bluefin tuna, sitting beneath the hiramasa. The menu lists no source information for it. (In the  message, Mr. Hergatt said it came from Hawaii.) Many believe that the fish is on the leading edge of extinction. The preparations are Asian-inflected, deeply French in theory, architectural in style, gastronomically witty. They are not so much composed as constructed, like dioramas or model airplanes. They’re awkward in the way that big hats at church or at the racetrack are awkward. An appetizer of fresh hearts of palm has white asparagus ice cream piped into the heart of the hearts, and comes alongside a loop of shaved green asparagus that looks like a roller coaster set beneath skyscrapers. Still, the flavors are cool and springlike, soft and exotic, all at once. The asparagus ice cream emerges from the hearts of palm as marrow does from a bone —  not at all sweet. It’s  a relatively successful dish that sounds as if it might taste awful. A loin of rabbit with carrots and cardamom, with a picholine olive sauce, is really a roulade cooked in the sous-vide machine then cut into four cylinders. A slender carrot runs down the center of the plate. It isn’t a carrot, though. It’s a piped carrot purée, its thick sweetness reverberating off the cardamom and the olives, a foil to the soft, flavorful meat. That striped bass, wherever it’s from, is also prepared sous-vide, which concentrates its natural flavor. Served once with roasted langoustine and black truffle, it looked like something you’d see in the showroom at Asprey, and tasted of beautiful excess. More recently, it arrived with crayfish tails, morels, asparagus and a vivid beurre blanc made with vin jaune. The  morels acted as shadow flavors to both proteins. Other delights: those frogs’ legs, tempura-fried and served with a purée of spring garlic and new-onion foam. Sweet peekytoe crab meat with a galangal gelée and tabs of sea urchin on top. A slow-poached egg with sea urchin and caviar. The escolar, with basil seeds, a Thai basil foam and hon shemiji,  a nutty mushroom rich in umami that performs nicely against the oil-rich fish. There are amuse-bouches before this cavalcade begins. There will be petits fours and macarons  at the end, served in a mist of liquid nitrogen, like Sammy Hagar emerging from dry ice to sing. (In between there’s excellent truffle butter to put on your bread.) Mr. Hergatt no longer uses gold leaf on dishes as he did when the restaurant opened last year, but many are finished with single flower petals or tiny leaves arranged in herringbone patterns. One senses that  the gold leaf might have been easier to plate. Desserts, created by Mina Pizarro, an alumna of Per Se and Veritas, are of a piece with the main courses: they look ready for an exhibition at the Whitney. Best are her actors in supporting roles: the pomelo confit that comes with a chocolate and jasmine dish; the crème fraîche sorbet with her Champagne mango tart; the rhubarb with her vanilla crémeux. Service at the restaurant is excellent, with well-trained and attentive waiters who have deep working knowledge of the menu. It’s not because of them that the place feels uncomfortable. And Emilie Garvey, the restaurant’s elegant young wine director, is a marvelous interpreter of her long hallway of wines. Pairing drinks to Mr. Hergatt’s food is not perhaps the easiest task in the world. (Hey, what goes with sous-vide lamb belly with fermented garlic and a riberry jus?) Ms. Garvey handles requests with intelligence and sly good humor. (Why, an unfiltered sake!) Mr. Hergatt is a technically accomplished chef, with a commendable staff. But his restaurant is fussy and exacting in a city that has countered economic malaise with restaurants that are increasingly neither. In the end, sweet as its rabbit may be, SHO Shaun Hergatt is an anachronism. It is not particularly expensive, given the particulars. But couture from past seasons rarely is.

954,Le Caprice,Fair,20100126,Sam Sifton,Upper East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/27/dining/reviews/27rest.html,"IN London, the restaurant  called Le Caprice holds a place somewhere between our Michael’s, the news media hub on East 55th Street, and the Sardi’s of old in the theater district. It is not so much a restaurant as a club. At its best, the British version of Le Caprice is filled with lords and skeevy barristers, hacks and publicists, actors on the make, drooping aristos, pop stars and spectacular women. There is a wonderful story about the punk-rock chieftain Ian Dury crashing through the place, drunk and outstanding on his cane. It ends with Omar Sharif punching him in the face. You don’t hear so much about the food at Le Caprice. But a meal there might be a novel in three courses, or a short story told in gin and diet pills. Not in New York, sad to say. The Manhattan outpost of this  elegant St. James’s institution opened off the lobby of the Pierre hotel in the fall. It  has a menu straight off the plane: mostly nursery food with colonial accents. But the crowd that might offset it, that might offer wit to counter the mushy peas and sticky sauce, doesn’t run to British eccentricity and glamorous conflict. Instead, it’s just plain-Jane American wealth. There are business travelers and older residents of the Upper East Side, a few Eurobankers and the odd plastic-surgery victim. The London restaurant may present a kind of British translation of class-free American culture: a democracy of fame. But the American retranslation of that conceit falls flat. At Le Caprice New York, there’s no lurching about with actors. There’s just a senior vice president having drinks and a salad, then checking the Nikkei before bed. Even to have that meal, however, requires some work. Le Caprice belongs to Richard Caring, a tycoon in the British clothing business who has been building a portfolio of restaurants and clubs since the mid-2000s. (He has the Ivy in the West End as well, along with the esteemed fish house J. Sheekey, also there, and stakes in over a half-dozen more.) Of his first venture in the United States, he told The New York Times last September, “I want buzz.”  And so he has held back tables at the restaurant. Many of them. Despite a dining room that is not precisely crowded with patrons, reservations at Le Caprice are difficult to get. Those taking advantage of online booking systems will discover that the restaurant generally allows customers tables only before 6 p.m. or after 10 p.m. Telephone calls, meanwhile, can lead to holding patterns that rival those of the cable company. A walk-in diner may be told, despite the sparse crowd in attendance, that there is an hour’s wait for a table, and that seats at the bar are “for reservations only.” If you persevere  — the best way to do this is to stay on the telephone, to ask again and again if there isn’t, please, some way to squeeze you in at 7 or 7:30  — you may succeed in securing a table at a decent hour. After all, they do need someone in the room. Le Caprice has its charms. It is sleek, almost deco, like the interior of an imaginary ocean liner or a movie set for one of Fred Astaire’s RKO films. It sees its apogee mostly in the form of David Bailey’s photographs of the young Jean Shrimpton, which line the walls with innocence and desire. There are a few good things to eat. The smoked haddock tart, for instance: rich with egg and the smoky perfection of haddock blended with potato, a rarity in the United States that is worth traveling some distance to try. The béarnaise sauce that accompanies the New York strip steak is copious and addictive, excellent with crisp and golden French fries, themselves salty and delicious enough to set the mayor’s finger wagging. These two make a tremendous pair. Crisp duck and watercress, meanwhile, is Peking duck niblets served over bitter greens, essentially. That is either up your alley or not. Chicken alla Milanese is fried chicken from under a steamroller, and with a splash of lemon is perfectly edible. The fish and chips, served with sweet minted peas and a pungent tartar sauce, aren’t bad at all. But boy, the chopped steak sure is: awful gray, flavorless patties of the sort known in the New York City public schools as murder burgers (best with suicide fries). These are accompanied by a tomato relish of no particular distinction. The dish costs $24. It’s worth none of them. Similarly lame is an appetizer of foie gras served with caramelized apples — a poorly trimmed and simultaneously overseared and undercooked hunk of liver that might have come out of a particularly bibulous duck. The sweet apples served with it are of little help. Bang bang chicken is an English interpretation of Sichuan cooking: cold chicken breast shredded into a spicy peanut butter sauce, with some julienned vegetables. Served by Nigella Lawson in a cottage in the Cotswolds before an afternoon of bed rest and reading, it might record high marks. At a table at the end of a narrow room on 61st Street,  it’s just comfort food for rickshaw riders. Too sweet, too gooey, too cold  — it fails to impress. Salmon fishcakes are bland and more warm than hot; they taste of cafeteria eating and boarding-school shame. A venison loin reminds us what’s been lost in the farming of animals we once  ate only when harvested wild. It’s almost flavorless and, in this, an appropriate partner for a wee grilled veal chop with something that appeared to look like, if not taste of, chanterelles. Enough! There is a credible sticky toffee pudding for dessert, heightened with bananas, and a plausible chocolate pudding soufflé. The staff is perfectly pleasant in an affectless, professional British manner. You can have a fair evening at Le Caprice if you end up there on business, smiling tight in your chair at a client or boss, and stick to steak and those fries. You can do the same if you want to head on over early and have a martini, try out the haddock tart at the bar. Anglophilia is like that. Hear the accent, and we just can’t stop ourselves.

960,Lyon,★,20110118,Sam Sifton,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/19/dining/reviews/19rest.html,"CAN a restaurant succeed without a signature dish? Lyon, in Greenwich Village, is trying. The restaurant is a Manhattan take on a bouchon, itself a Lyonnaise take on a bistro. It serves the salads and snails and sticky bits of pork and beef that are requisite to Lyonnaise cuisine in a beautiful wooden room under yellow light. Some of the food is excellent. Compliments should ring for the rich, heady steam and flavor of the restaurant’s onion soup, thickened with brisket and made silky with a kind of marrow jam, flavored with fontina and a deep bass note of demi-glace. The salad lyonnaise, with thick batons of bacon and a soft poached egg, is likewise remarkable, mustard-flecked, a model of the form. There is a good beet salad to start and a fine St. Marcellin cheese to finish, along with some lovely fried apple slices and a thick caramel sauce. Best of all are the restaurant’s offerings of charcuterie: a dense country pâté; some smoked beef sausage; a roulade of pig trotter; an excellent foie gras and rabbit terrine. To sit at Lyon’s bar eating these, or a mustard-slathered hot dog off a pretzel roll, with just a hint of black truffle alongside a mound of sauerkraut, is to experience bouchon life as it ought to spool out in Manhattan in 2011, neither chic nor sordid, pleasant in the extreme. The entrees need work, however. The drop-off can be severe, if easily remedied. A tasteless hunk of market-priced wagyu, for instance, as soft and wobbly as panna cotta, is dispiriting even under its thin green peppercorn sauce, even with fries that are very good indeed. Replacing it with a rough little bavette or sirloin would do wonders. There is no place for a $45 designer steak in a restaurant like this. And here is the same sautéed ruff of skate you’ll find at any number of restaurants across town, perfectly fine if a little drowsy under its sage- and caper-strewn brown butter sauce. Also a molded steak tartare of middling flavor, to which more fire could be added with ease. There are well-cooked scallops and sweet smashed potatoes. These are soft enough to cushion the blow if you fall asleep in the middle of the meal. Lyon needs a quiet little showstopper instead of these. The poulet rôti you used to be able to get at Quatorze and still can get at Bar Boulud, for instance, would do the trick. Simple food that gets our attention without seeking it, or needing it, is why we go to restaurants of Lyon’s ilk, after all, why bistros boomed, why people treasure the casual roughness of the true bouchon. François Latapie, a former partner at La Goulue on the Upper East Side, opened Lyon last year, in the space that some will recall from its dark, railcar-ish past as Café de Bruxelles. (Chris Leahy is the chef, gamely executing Mr. Latapie’s desires.) The space is beautiful. Roman and Williams, the firm that designed the room, ordered oak panels and detailed trim throughout the dining room, which runs along Greenwich Avenue, and placed enough inset slate boards and custom cabinets within them to have kept a finish carpenter in health insurance for months. The restrooms, downstairs, are papered with classic French cartoons. It is a marvelous place to eat. The tables are set with red-checked napkins, the waiters and waitresses dressed to match. Each one is better looking than the last, worse at English, charming for that. They serve Beaujolais quickly, with gruff friendliness in tough little glasses, cold as a child’s morning cup of milk. The restaurant is warm and welcoming, already more a neighborhood draw than a publicist’s undertaking, with celebrity sightings limited to Michael Moore and a war reporter or two. You might see young professionals crushed into a corner, catching up (“You’re moving to Elkhart? Where is that, Illinois? Indiana?”) or literary people polishing their eyeglasses in pairs as they talk about art. No fewer than three tables one recent night were populated by women eating salad and talking about the economy, everyone slugging down wine. Add the scent of Gauloises, a dog or two under the tables, and we might be down the street from the Hôtel de Ville, and not from poor, dark St. Vincent’s, waiting for its fate. Lyon is that close to soaring. But there need to be a few more things on the menu you’d want to eat again and again, more you’d return for with glee. An appetizer of escargot with garlic sausage and watercress risotto sounds promising enough, it’s true. But it is really watercress risotto (wild and green, tasting of a suburban lawn) with a few bits of snail and sausage. It is a deconstructed idea rather than a classic well made. Preferable would be the actual article, bubbling and garlicky in pale brown shells. A starter plate of tripe with white beans arrives under a cloak of bread crumbs, perfectly cooked but pale of flavor, as if translated out of French and into the flat English of airport announcements and corporate phone trees. It is more texture than taste. And while quenelles de brochet, that classic dish of the region, offers quivering assurance on the plate, the spoonfuls of fish mousse are served in a lobster sauce that ought to be a great deal richer. The dish could use some salt and a run under the broiler. (A bacon-wrapped branzino needs less, served almost mushy with its pairing of sweet leeks and fennel.) There is for all this a passable lamb shank served with a white bean stew. Some fiery merguez sausage livens up the plate, as North African flavors have increasingly done for French cuisine: good. It brings warmth to a winter night. Discs of pig trotter with foie gras, green lentils, spinach and a spray of sherry vinegar make up a dish that does likewise, especially paired with friends and a pot of wine. Restaurants are central to the process by which nature becomes a form of culture. At their best they are where we go to experience, and celebrate, the transformation. Lyon is not that, not yet. But it is so pretty, and the staff is so winning, and the kitchen skilled enough that it is hard not to root for its success. An entree that every third person in the restaurant orders would be a good place to start.   Lyon ★ 118 Greenwich Avenue (West 13th Street), Greenwich Village; (212) 242-5966.

963,Restaurant Charles,Satisfactory,20090414,Frank Bruni,West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/15/dining/reviews/15rest.html,"To: Graydon Carter, grayisgood@vanityfair.com From: Frannie Von Furstinshow, furstinshow@guccipucci.net Graybee baby, I have a confession. Don’t be cross! But I cheated on you. For a while there — and it was just a short while — I thought I’d found something better with Charles. Something cleverer. I’m a fool, I know. But I had my reasons. The Waverly Inn was feeling so familiar. And the Monkey Bar hadn’t gone Gray yet. Now that it has, by the way, maybe it’s you who should beg forgiveness from me, my Gray goose. What were you thinking?? A normal reservations line?!? That anyone and everyone can call!!?? My puzzlement defies punctuation. You had it right when you set up the Waverly: getting a table should mean pleading, plotting or — for the less pitiable among us — an occasional bouquet for your assistant. Speaking of which, did he get the Easter lilies? Not as many and as pretty as last year, I know, but we all have to adjust. That’s what Herbert’s been yammering at me since the bank slashed bonuses. I’ve switched from private Pilates to Physique 57 (it refers to the street, my Grayest of Gardens, the street), and I haven’t been to Dr. Brandt in eight weeks. I thought Charles would be a balm. I thought Charles would make me feel better. I thought — oh, I hate to imagine what you’ll make of me — that Charles would be my new Waverly. It’s just a few blocks away. And your Waverly chef, John DeLucie, helped with the menu when it opened late last year. And it was all so enigmatic: the nonsensical name (it’s not on Charles, or owned by a Charles), the lack of any sign out front. Actually, there was and is a sign, but it’s for the fusty French artifact that used to have the space, Les Deux Gamins. How genius is that? When I went the other night, two people who’d apparently been fans of that restaurant were walking out the door looking exasperated, and they were muttering:  “It’s some totally different place now. Who knew?” I did! And it was at that moment that I thought I just might have to fall in love with it. Frannie ♥ Charles! You know me. The more reclusive the lair, the more I lust for it. But forget Rao’s. I don’t do Harlem, unless you count the Fairway, which of course you shouldn’t because it’s on the way to Rhinebeck. And La Esquina lost me when I realized that the secret “No Admittance” door was only the beginning and I had to teeter through the kitchen to the dining room. I got huitlacoche on my Prada. Charles one-ups them all. While Waverly doesn’t answer its phone, Charles doesn’t even have one, at least not one that’s published. To get a table I would send an e-mail message, and some unseen, unknown, disembodied reservations deity would write back. It was like I was in a “Bourne” movie, arranging a secret meet. I was the Joan Allen character, but with a better colorist. I haven’t yet told you the wildest part, which is the restaurant’s windows — so Salinger, so Garbo. They’re covered in old newspapers and blue tape, as if the space is under construction or even condemned, and they’ve been that way for so long that when I paused on the sidewalk the other night to read the fine print, I learned that Sarah Palin had resuscitated the McCain candidacy. The newspapers are at first funny, then odd, then just sort of sad, maybe because Charles doesn’t have enough else going for it. In the end I couldn’t get around that. I suppose it’s pretty inside, though it’s so dark you can’t tell, so dark that Bitsy and I never could decide if that was Maggie Gyllenhaal two tables away. Thank God for her, or whoever she was, because most of the rest of the crowd was male and under 40, which left me feeling a little too cougar for comfort. The waiters were like yummy chew toys, but tough to stomach in the end. One plunked down my check before I was near ready to go, and another brought me brussels sprouts instead of the potato purée: not a fair trade-off, and maybe even an insult? Note to self: resume spinning. The food wasn’t yummy enough. Oh, some of it was just fine: the smoked trout; the endive with Gorgonzola; the roasted chicken, which was actually more tender than Waverly’s, if I’m to give my silly fling its due. On the night I brought Herbert, I finished my scallops and he polished off his rack of lamb. Then I stole three bites of these adorable biscotti ice cream sandwiches he got for dessert. That’s two more bites than I would usually do, but I chalk it up to spousal altruism, given that he just had two of his suits let out. My dinner with Bitsy was the next week, and when she wasn’t staring at Maggie, she was rolling her eyes. The lamb kebabs should be called tartare. That’s how close to raw they were. The salmon, supposedly pan-seared, was more like pan-spurned, by which I mean it was nearly raw, too. Charles is as stingy with heat as it is with light. Maybe it’s saving on utilities. It shouldn’t have to, given what it charges for wine. On a recent list only two of about 60 reds were under $70, and I couldn’t find a white for under $60 — not that I’m scrimping! It made me wonder: aren’t the newspapers, the blue tape and the unpublished phone number velvet rope enough? And  did I really just say that? It doesn’t sound like me, but then we’re all sounding a little different since the Dow went south, Obama came east and Bernie Madoff went up the river. The old tricks and poses don’t play quite the way they once did. I guess that’s what you’d already realized, my Gray Eminence. Hence the Monkey business. I’ll head up there soon enough to check it out, resigned — in the spirit of the times — to seeing a whole lot of people who never breached the Waverly.

966,La Chine,★★,20160119,Pete Wells,Midtown East,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/dining/la-chine-review.html,"In a nest of dried grass and feathery moss sat an eggshell, its top neatly lopped off. Caviar and a crinkle of gold leaf shone just inside the rim. Underneath were layers of custard and hairy crab, a seasonal freshwater treat from China whose taste is a lot more seductive than its name. The rich, smooth pleasure in each spoonful almost made my head pop. The egg was one of the first things I ate at La Chine, which opened in November inside the Waldorf Astoria, specializing in Chinese food made with finesse and an eye for beauty. This could get interesting, I thought. In fact, the rest of the meal and the two that followed did get interesting, in ways that those of us who love the cuisines of China wish would happen more often in New York. Downtown Manhattan, Flushing in Queens and Sunset Park in Brooklyn are rich in Chinese restaurants. Their cooking can range from filling to thrilling, but it rarely aspires to climb the slopes of creativity. Ingredients are generally good but not stellar, limited as they are by the prices these restaurants can charge. Unlike many cities in Asia, New York has not historically had a broad base of people willing to spend a lot on Chinese food. La Chine costs much more than most of them; lamb loin stir-fried with cumin is $38, about twice as much as the fervently admired Muslim lamb chop at Fu Run in Flushing. If you allow the man they call the “sake ninja” to talk you into a bottle, you could easily drop $100 or more. (This ninja wears a jacket and tie; he must be working undercover.) But at the risk of undermining my populist credentials, I’d suggest New York could use more Chinese restaurants that are as expensive as our most ambitious French and Italian places. Those restaurants could use more ingredients worth splurging on, and restaurateurs determined to lure talented chefs from China. We have Hakkasan, of course, part of a global chain whose crackerjack cooks excel at dim sum but tend to play it safe with other courses. At the two RedFarms, Joe Ng cooks with originality and verve, but the recurring sweetness in the dishes betrays a tailoring of his ideas for perceived American tastes. The cooking at La Chine is something different. The menu was devised by the executive chef, Kong Khai Meng. A native of Singapore, he became a protégé of the acclaimed chef Jereme Leung before setting up restaurants in hotels around Asia. With Mr. Leung, he worked out his ideas for La Chine, which he executes in the kitchen with David Garcelon, the hotel’s culinary director. The restaurant replaces Oscar’s American Brasserie, a glorified coffee shop whose loss did not leave a deep wound in the city’s psyche. The bones of the space have been exposed, the massive pillars and ceiling coffers showing off the hotel’s Art Deco monumentality, though not its Art Deco flourishes. Some tables are set in secluded alcoves at the east end, framed by spidery latticework that evokes carved Chinese screens. A central chandelier, like a huge upside-down wedding cake, shines on vases of orchids whose pinks howl in this room of muted creams and golds. The effect would be more stunning if the lighting weren’t so murky; it hovers in the eternal twilight of surgery recovery rooms where patients slip in and out of consciousness. Each time I was about to go under, though, something from the kitchen would bring me back. Raw seafood always did it. Sliced yellowtail was fanned out in a pinwheel over Sichuan chile oil. Translucent bands of fluke were darkened by black rice vinegar, China’s answer to balsamic, then touched with hot peony oil, which sizzled and whitened the lean fish as it landed. A long rectangle of bigeye tuna tartare seasoned with soy vinegar was strewn with flowers, herbs, pickled shallots and a stripe of caviar. All three dishes took a modern, Japanese approach to Chinese flavors. All three were very good. So was the stack of lightly battered Spanish mackerel delivered under a smoke-filled cloche, like the sturgeon at Eleven Madison Park; the smokiness of the fish was underscored by a smoked soy sauce, appealingly sweet and sticky. Broad-bean-fried prawns were juicy and tender-firm inside a crisp, golden coating that flaked into spicy crumbs I couldn’t help eating off the plate. Cauliflower was stir-fried with thick bacon slices in a very hot wok that caramelized the bumpy surface to a delicious mottled brown. The snow pea shoots with garlic were as simple, classic and good as any I’ve tasted. Everything is served family style except the soups, which ought to be. In individual bowls, they are hard to work into a shared meal, and people may be tempted to skip them. This would be a loss, because they are beautifully made; there’s a clarity to the chicken cloud consommé, vividly seasoned with ginger, and a shellfish-drenched power to the “eight hour golden broth,” thick with lobster, crab and scallops. Before opening, restaurants now routinely put out photographs of one striking dish, like a band releasing a single to build excitement for an album. For La Chine, this was the barbecued duck. And it is an exciting bird, suffused with five-spice powder and ready to be tucked into griddle-blackened crepes with skinny sticks of cucumber, leek and, surprise, cantaloupe. But if anybody had asked, I would have suggested leading with the black-iron tabletop grill that holds a wonderful barbecued collar of Berkshire pork, the meat’s pink edges crackling with a candied honey glaze. (The menu reveals that the honey was secreted by bees who live on the roof, if that appeals to you.) Chicken with cashews may not make a great advertisement for a high-end restaurant, but it’s a great dish, in a kung-pao-style sauce that is keenly balanced between sweet and sour. In fact, most of the main courses show off La Chine’s sophistication apart from some subdued seafood dishes. Sous-vide cod with black bean sauce was flabby and, like the scallops in a long canoe-shaped dish with peppers and onions, not a showpiece of sparkling freshness. The restaurant’s French name is puzzling until the desserts show up; they are very much in a Western mode. The warm chocolate cake, with sesame ganache melting away inside, has a seductive undertow of spice. The most elaborate and prettiest is the vacherin of passion-fruit cream sandwiched by white spirals of meringue; there’s a white chocolate sphere painted with a metallic swirl like a pink pearl, and a marvelous scoop of sorbet made with fresh lychees. La Chine is far from the realm of fortune cookies, and better off for it."
