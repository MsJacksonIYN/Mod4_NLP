0,Hanon,★★,2019-05-21,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/dining/hanon-review.html,Williamsburg,"Hanon, a new udon shop in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was produced by the union of a Tokyo video-production company and a Japanese manufacturer of unusually thin condoms. The condoms became the subject of a series of advertisements on which the production company worked; in one of them, called “Acts of Love,” dancers in London re-enact, with surprising grace and dignity, the mating rituals of blue-footed boobies, fiddler crabs and other animals. Well, kids, when two companies like each other very much, sometimes they decide to create a new company together. That is what happened with the production firm and the prophylactics people when, for reasons that are perhaps best not to question, they hit upon the idea of expanding their product line from condoms into noodles. The restaurant lies across Union Avenue from Kellogg’s Diner. Its door is marked during business hours by the fluttering white noren curtains. It is the second Hanon location. The first is about 6,700 miles away, in the city of Kamakura, which lies south of Tokyo and is known for soba, not udon. This gave Hanon the advantage of not competing against any of Japan’s established udon styles, leaving its chef, Takahiro Yanagisawa, free to come up with his own. Mr. Yanagisawa, who had spent 25 years making sushi before turning to noodles, focused his innovative urges on the dough. He began by adding wheat germ and bran to the white flour that in udon is typically used alone. The resulting noodle is called zenryufun or whole wheat. The bran and germ are Mr. Yanagisawa’s attempts to make a more healthful udon, but they also add flavor, a mottled color and a slightly rough texture that holds on to the dashi-based broth. This dough is also made into a green noodle, called sasauchi, by mixing in powdered barley shoots and leaves of kuma-zasa, a bamboo variety that pandas dote on. To the human palate, or at least this human’s palate, sasa tastes something like green tea. Both the speckled zenryufun and the green sasauchi are flat noodles, resembling fettuccine that has been working out. Avoiding extremes, they are moderately chewy and reasonably springy. Either flavor, or both, can be ordered cold and spread on a bamboo mat for dunking into a sauce, either a peanut-buttery sesame sauce or the traditional dashi-based dipping sauce. For larger or more curious appetites, these dipping noodles, called seiro udon, can be dangled into a hot duck soup in which a few hunks of well-boiled duck meat swim. The cold noodles can also be accessorized with whipped mountain yam or tempura or both. If you had stumbled into Hanon under the impression that it was another generic Williamsburg noodle mill, the tempura would set you straight. The crust is engineered for udon, thick and substantial enough that it will not dissolve and float away in the soup, yet somehow not oily or clunky. The tempura is served with sea salt, which will not only season the fried blowfish tails, shrimp, mushroom and vegetables, but will also do very good things to any noodles it happens to meet. With the hot soups, there is no choice of noodles. All are made with zenryufun. The plain broth, a dashi augmented by white soy sauce, is not so salty or concentrated that I didn’t want to drink it all. It also performs well made into a thick-but-not-sludgy curry soup with thin pink slices of washugyu beef; a shaggy, mossy, salty-sour mass of ume and kombu; and a soup of shaved beef and onions that tastes like a deeper, stronger version of French dip jus and is blitzed by a little grated yuzu peel at the end. A few near-relatives of udon make it to the menu as well. The beef-and-onion combination can also be had over rice. Creamy, slightly spicy cod roe is tossed with zenryufun for an excellent mentaiko pasta that, for once, relies on the roe rather than Kewpie mayonnaise to make an impression. The eventual plan is to sell both colors of noodle to grocery stores and other restaurants — to become, in essence, the Sun Noodle of the udonisphere. This would be a gain for New York, but for the moment Hanon’s udon is found only at Hanon, where the noodles are made fresh each day. Any plan for world domination is not hinted at on the restaurant’s Facebook page, which seems to be its home base online, though nobody has bothered to post a menu there yet. Nor does the dining room suggest a budding global chain. Atmospheric and presumably expensive prints by the photographers Takashi Homma and Nobuyoshi Araki hang over the tables, and a signed Cy Twombly lithograph has been placed by the door to the backyard. The music — torch songs, jazz piano — seems to be coming from a radio tuned to another decade. A lot of this cocktail music will make more sense once the liquor license comes through. Hanon is getting set to offer sake, shochu and wines chosen by Jorge Riera, who built the list at Frenchette and has turned countless New Yorkers on to the fizzy, fuzzy and furry delights of natural wines. The idea of Hanon is not to slurp and slide out, but to stay for a meal: a chilled French red with the fried chicken and Japanese omelet, maybe, and something a bit brawnier with curry soup. Dessert could be a tofu blancmange, smooth and white and somewhat sweet, but there is more satisfaction in the grainy, earthy bricks of red bean paste. The meal might end with tea, to which the restaurant takes the same unhurried approach it applies to everything else. The iced oolong is slowly cold-brewed; a bamboo whisk and ceramic chawan are kept on the dining counter for painstakingly whipping up bowls of matcha; an appliance imported from Taiwan will transform freshly steeped hojicha and ice into a tan froth, a process that takes about five minutes. This foam tea is dairy-free, unlike Taiwan’s infamous cheese tea. It is served in a wine glass, and the experience of drinking it is similar to tackling a pint of Guinness before the head has settled down.","Udon, Innovated for Your Pleasure","['hanon', 'udon',

1,Del Posto,★★★,2019-05-14,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/dining/del-posto-review-pete-wells.html,Chelsea,"More than a year ago, I was on the verge of reviewing Del Posto when the news intervened. The restaurant had changed significantly since the last time it had been evaluated by a Times critic: Sam Sifton promoted it from three stars to four in 2010, when Mark Ladner was the executive chef and Brooks Headley was running the pastry kitchen. First, Mr. Headley had quit this stately, expensive Italian restaurant in Chelsea so he could sell fast, cheap vegetarian burgers. Next, Del Posto had spent about $1 million on crystal candle vases, white leather chairs and other luxurious fittings that made it even more stately and expensive. Finally, Mr. Ladner had left to sell fast, cheap pasta. A fresh review was clearly in order. Before I could write it, though, a number of women who had worked for Mario Batali, one of the owners, started talking about the sexual harassment and abuse that they say he had doled out. Suddenly there seemed to be more important questions than whether the braised-rabbit agnolotti were cooked al dente. Negotiations took more than a year, but Mr. Batali no longer profits from Del Posto, having sold his stake in March to a group led by his former partner, Joe Bastianich. Employees have said that Mr. Bastianich himself helped, at a minimum, to build the sexist and disrespectful environment in which Mr. Batali operated. Mr. Bastianich has apologized, saying that he had heard Mr. Batali speak inappropriately to employees, and that he should have done more to stop the sexual harassment. Some diners will stay away, feeling that Mr. Bastianich has not sufficiently atoned. I understand this, but I am also interested in the way employees may be treated at the restaurant now and in the future. Here, there is reason to hope. Among other human-resources reforms, employees can now report complaints about owners or corporate officers to an independent investigative firm with the power to refer cases to outside counsel. As part of the restructuring, Melissa Rodriguez, who has been the executive chef of Del Posto since 2017, was made a partner in the restaurant, along with Jeff Katz, now the managing partner. A new pastry chef, Georgia Wodder, was appointed last spring. Del Posto is, with the possible exception of Aquavit, the grandest and most expensive restaurant in New York where women are in charge of everything you eat, starting with the miniature saffron waffle rolled like a cannoli and stuffed at one tiny end with taleggio and at the other with fennel pesto, and ending with the prosecco marshmallow tucked into the wooden drawer of a custom-made cheese grater. The cooking is more subdued now. The kitchen is not seen as a beacon of innovation the way it used to be, perhaps because Ms. Rodriguez is less interested than Mr. Ladner was in feats of technical derring-do like 100-layer lasagnas. She gets her effects by following old Italian templates and putting them together so elegantly that they seem to light up from inside. There’s an honesty to her approach — she doesn’t try to shoot out all the lights by supercharging dishes with fat — but it’s not the kind of peasant simplicity people usually mean when they talk about honesty in Italian food. It’s a sophisticated honesty. You know chicken cacciatore, of course. Ms. Rodriguez’s version is made from guinea hen breast, roasted until the skin crackles like parchment. What would be the body of the stew is now a sauce; the tomato, celery and onion in it come through distinctly. Occupying a little sidecar is a pressed puck of braised leg meat under a single, Roman-style gnocco, a small featherbed of semolina held together by eggs, milk and cheese. One side has been broiled so hard it is nearly burned, which seems like a mistake at first, but turns out to supply the bit of campfire that this hunter’s stew needs. It has to be far more complicated to prepare than the cacciatore at your neighborhood Italian restaurant, but it seems simpler, pared to essentials, and wonderful in every bite. I’ve never seen anyone wring as much flavor out of salsify as Ms. Rodriguez does. Sliced transparently thin and fried, it makes crunchy brown chips about half the size of an M&M. These decorate the top of a grilled-salsify pudding that has the refreshing bittersweetness of one of those plant-based Italian aperitifs. If it were not garnished with streaky leaves of radicchio, it could pass for a dessert. The menu structure has not changed, although the prices have. Everything can be had à la carte. Lunch is still a relative bargain, though the price has shimmied up to $59 for three courses. For a blowout $194 dinner, the Captain’s Menu yields eight courses or so. Most people, however, go with the $164, five-course Menu del Posto. The primary argument in favor of this strategy is, to me, an overwhelming one: Two of those five courses are pasta. Del Posto’s pastas are worth doubling up on. They can come in many forms. Delicate conical tortellini have hidden pockets of nettles and spring peas; they are half-submerged in a light spring-vegetable brodo in which Parmigiano-Reggiano rinds once bobbed like bay leaves. This is the spring minestrone. A single, plate-spanning raviolo, called a fazzoletto, is topped with poached mussels and filled with spinach and fresh herbs — not a lawnmower-mulch of greenery but a layer of emulsion as thin and velvety as the dough that envelops it. The sauce of mussel juices, white wine, butter and saffron makes this the only convincing mussel pasta I’ve ever had. The range of flavors Ms. Wodder commands in her pastry kitchen seems unnecessarily limited to me, although I may be unfairly comparing her desserts with Mr. Headley’s, which roamed all over the place. Individually, her desserts are soothing, often showcasing the comforts of dairy. More emphasis, some extra acidity or bitterness, might have brought an assemblage of quince paste, brown-butter gelato and griddled brioche into relief. But I appreciated the way winter squash in the batter modified the sweetness of an olive oil-orange cake, and I enjoyed the moody sulkiness that amaro lent to a citrus salad served with the cake. Del Posto has in recent years picked up a reputation as a restaurant for one-percenters. It rarely gives that impression once you are inside, where servers solemnly accommodate just about anyone. There is a vegan menu at Del Posto. A vegetarian meal can be put together easily, and almost everything can be made without gluten, including the pasta. Yes, the stockpile of Champagnes includes some lock-and-key stuff, and should you require a Barolo costing between $2,000 and $4,000, one will quickly be added to your bill. But among the 3,100 or so Italian labels superintended by Evan Clagnaz, the wine director, are more marked from $60 to $75 than I can count. Piemonte is a place to hunt, and Friuli, and the Valle d’Aosta, for starters. Though the restaurant is not exclusively for rich people, it is explicitly for occasions. Once, when a reservationist called to confirm and asked whether I was celebrating anything special, I said no, and was gently laughed at: “Just a normal Tuesday night at Del Posto?” There is little danger that anyone will mistake a night at Del Posto for normal. If nothing else, the napkins and towels are a tip-off. First, there is a small hot linen napkin scented with tomato-vine oil, to wipe the dust of the outside world from your hands. Then a large white linen napkin, followed just before dessert by a small yellow one. It is given to you, and the white one is taken away, by a server using a large fork and spoon as tongs. When you go to the restrooms, you may encounter an attendant who has just restocked the hand towels from a large basket she carries on one arm, like Heidi out gathering wildflowers for Grandfather. There are little ceremonies like this from start to finish; I don’t know of any other restaurant that performs quite so many tasks whose only real purpose is to draw attention to themselves. And these things are rarely done with a smile; employees seem to have been directed to keep a respectful, formal distance as they carry out your requests and perform other services you’d never think of requesting. They rarely seem comfortable. Their solemnity is underlined by the sepulchral lighting at night, so gloomy it makes the crypt of Grant’s tomb look like a tiki bar. A good deal of the service is the attentive, helpful kind that you really want, but the rest of it seems designed only to give customers the sensation of temporary power over other people. Some people may love this, but it reflects a serious lack of imagination when you think about the ways the service at Blue Hill at Stone Barns or Noma, for instance, is integrated into the experience. Is it stretching a point to ask if enshrining subservience, as Del Posto does, reflects the same twisted sense of priorities that allowed Mr. Batali to get away with abusing his own power for so long? (And is it a coincidence that far more men than women seem to work in the dining room, particularly in the upper ranks?) Now that Ms. Rodriguez owns a piece of the restaurant, perhaps she can lead a reconsideration of priorities in the front of the house, and find a tone that more closely matches her philosophy in the back. She shouldn’t have to clean up the messes men made. But having worked her way to the top of a restaurant that has always aspired to provide luxury, she has a chance to decide what, in New York in 2019, that word might mean.","In Del Posto’s New Era,

2,The Freakin Rican,★,2019-05-07,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/dining/the-freakin-rican-restaurant-review.html,Astoria,"It is true that the bacalaitos at the Freakin Rican in Astoria, Queens, are not quite as big around as the ones you will see browning in veritable caldrons of oil over wood fires at kiosks scattered along the beach road in Piñones, outside San Juan. These flattened cod fritters are the size of pie plates in Puerto Rico, while in Queens they are roughly the diameter of a coffee can. Dimensions aside, they give off all the right signals. They are the color of a corn muffin, with green specks of chopped cilantro under the surface that let you know they are not made from Goya’s mix. They don’t leave your fingertips entirely free of grease, but they come close. They have an exterior crunch that surrenders quickly to the firm, chewy interior of mashed salt cod; the texture is less fried dough than fish taffy. You could start to build a business around bacalaitos like these. That, in fact, has been Derick López’s plan for some time now. Mr. López, who was born in Puerto Rico and raised in the South Bronx, is the Freakin Rican’s chef and, with his husband, Victor Vargas, its owner. About four years ago, armed with picnic coolers and a couple of folding tables, the two men began selling a short menu of Puerto Rican staples at the street fairs that seem to infiltrate a different New York thoroughfare each weekend. As they promoted the Freakin Rican catering operation, the Freakin Rican product line, the Freakin Rican Facebook page and the Freakin Rican YouTube channel, they saved their earnings so they could found the Freakin Rican restaurant. After a false start in another part of Queens, it opened a short distance from the Museum of the Moving Image one year ago this month. The dining room has 19 seats. The banana-plant wallpaper on the left wall is reflected in the mirrors on the right. In between are some metal chickens and bright-green figurines of coquís, the little frogs that chirp from every Puerto Rican tree. Diners sip on tropical-fruit shakes or bottles of Kola Champagne, Coco Rico and Malta India, the Harry, Ron and Hermione of Puerto Rican soft drinks. Héctor Lavoe may be playing over the speakers, or Víctor Manuelle, not so loudly that they can’t be drowned out by the sounds of a small number of employees singing “Happy Birthday” while wielding a tambourine and a pair of maracas. If you have spent any time at all on the trail of chicharrones, mofongo, sancocho and other wonders of the Puerto Rican kitchen, you know that Astoria is not a primary hunting ground for any of them. You also know, though, that blinking-light cuchifritos parlors and family-run cocina criolla luncheonettes have been disappearing from the Bronx, East Harlem and the Lower East Side over the past few decades, along with many of their customers. The Puerto Rican population in New York peaked around 1990, when residents of the old barrios began to flow to the suburbs in large numbers, according to Laird W. Bergad, the director of the Center for Latin American, Caribbean and Latino Studies at City University of New York Graduate Center. Beacons of Puerto Rican cuisine still survive; Casa Adela, for instance, is still busily dispensing chickens from its venerable lemon-yellow rotisserie on Avenue C, despite the death last year of its founder, Adela Fargas. But there are not so many of these places left that we can take an unlimited supply of tostones and mojo de ajo for granted, either. The Freakin Rican developed its act on the street-fair circuit, but it applied the same tactics that succeed at Smorgasburg and similar urban foraging grounds, where the ideal dish can be held in one hand, gets immediate attention, costs under $10 and can serve as a plank in a branding platform. This may explain why appetizers are the strong suit on the Freakin Rican menu. The sorullitos, Puerto Rico’s answer to hush puppies, are an exception; they are dense and dry, as if the cornmeal hadn’t absorbed enough water. Mr. López’s alcapurrias, though, are very good, even if the picadillo that runs down the middle of a tube of mashed fried plantains like the graphite in a pencil could be seasoned a little more forcefully. And his pasteles are exceptional. Pasteles are structured like tamales. Where the masa would be, Mr. López makes a sweet, enjoyably gummy mash of green plantains, taro root and kabocha squash. The filling is a soft, rich vein of stewed pork shoulder with ham, bacon, red peppers and green olives. Rolled up in a banana leaf, these pasteles probably deserve their own float in the Puerto Rican Day Parade. Mr. López fries chicken in two styles. One, the chicharrones de pollo, is traditional. The other, the Freakin Crispy Wings, is not. Each has its rewards. The chicharrones, hacked into three-bite hunks, taste of cider vinegar and garlic powder and have a smooth, achiote-tinted buttermilk crust that breaks open with a pleasing crackle. The Freakin Crispy Wings are spicier, and the shell is thicker and more deeply crevassed. These wings may owe more to Atlanta than to Mayagüez, although you can get them with a guava barbecue sauce that’s reasonably tropical. Leave behind these appetizers, the core of the street-fair business, and the menu can start to appear unsteady. At dinner, the main courses tend to be fairly plain fried or grilled meat. Grilled pork chops splashed with mojo can be dry and dull, and the grilled chicken breasts are not much more interesting. Baked pork ribs in a sweet barbecue sauce are tender enough, but they aren’t very persuasive. On several nights, I found myself gazing longingly at the lunch specials on the back of the menu, wondering why I couldn’t have a brick of pastelón for dinner. (I came back for it one Thursday afternoon, and was glad I did.) Until more long-cooked dishes like it appear at dinnertime, consider a bowl of sancocho. Listed as “vegetable root soup” for $7, it doesn’t sound like much of a meal. But it is a grab bag of a stew with at least two kinds of meat, great hunks of taro and yuca, a couple of inches of corn on the cob and a magical squash broth that has the consistency of heavy cream and the color of very ripe mango. In the unlikely event that you finish it and the bowl of rice that comes with it and then cry out for more, the Freakin Rican has just the thing for you: mofongo. A dome of mashed plantains possessed by garlic, the mofongo is cooked to order to keep the crunchy bits crunchy and the whole thing from getting boggy. You can have it with chicharrones or sliced roast pork, which leaves behind a happy impression of garlic, oregano and salt. If you have come for a birthday, a candle stuck in the meringue icing of a tres leches cake is probably in your future. If not, flan and espresso will do, and a bag of pasteles for tomorrow.",Pasteles and Two Kinds of Fried Chicken at the Freakin Rican,"['true', 'bacalaitos', 'freakin', 'rican', 'astoria', 'queen',

3,Wayan,★★,2019-04-23,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/23/dining/wayan-restaurant-review.html,NoLIta,"If you ate at Spice Market before it closed two years ago, you may experience low-key but persistent flashbacks at Wayan, which set up shop in February on the east end of Spring Street in NoLIta. Again the flavors come from Asia and the methods, generally, from France. Again the far-off tropics are evoked through the play of indirect, dappled light, as if filtered through jungle foliage or a carved wooden screen. Again the presiding culinary sensibility belongs to a Vongerichten. Jean-Georges Vongerichten put together Spice Market in 2004, a confection of teak, silk, vodka, peanut sauce and high heels that brought the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre to its apotheosis. All the earlier examples suddenly seemed fumbling and unsophisticated, and with the possible exception of the Spice Market spinoffs in Qatar and Mexico, the ones that would follow seemed increasingly mindless and out of touch. Interior design that rummages through the musty old trunks of Orientalism doesn’t look as alluring as it did 15 years ago, and cooking that filters Asian flavors through a Western sensibility isn’t automatically met with gales of excitement. Wayan, where Mr. Vongerichten’s son, Cédric, is the chef, avoids both traps, I think. The restaurant is a tribute to Indonesia, the home of his wife and business partner, Ochi Vongerichten, and the site of two restaurants that he opened recently. (He is also the chef of Perry St. in Manhattan, which his father owns.) The scale is more personal and the cultural references are more specific at Wayan than at Spice Market and its kind. The menu is far from encyclopedic, but it is clear that Indonesia’s cuisine has been given more than the quick glance that informs a lot of Asian fusion. Ms. Vongerichten works in the dining room, stopping by tables to offer explanations of the menu and how the cooking differs from that at some other Indonesian restaurants in New York, which she cheerfully calls “more authentic.” More than any other factor, she helps keep Wayan from turning into a junior version of one of her father-in-law’s restaurants — Young Vongerichtenstein. Servers will tell you to start with a stick or two of satay. You can, although the skewers are cooked on a flattop instead of a grill, and inconsistency is an issue. The pork skewers that are so appealingly juicy and savory with sweet soy one week can be scorched and bitter the next time you see them, and just ordinary the following week. (The pickled watermelon radishes on the side, though, are always terrific; they’re brined with lime leaf.) The peanut sauce on chicken satay may hum with red curry and chiles, or may present as a sweet, inert blob. A more promising opening move, and one that will help place Cédric and Ochi Vongerichten’s mental map of Indonesia in perspective, would be the Jimbaran-style clams. This is not a dish that is likely to have been stirred by generations of sainted grandmothers since the dawn of time. It is, in fact, a specialty of the seafood vendors who sprang up on a stretch of Balinese beach where resorts first began to appear sometime around the birth of Taylor Swift. Littlenecks, flavored with soy sauce and garlic paste, are grilled under flakes of coconut, which form the golden crust that would be provided by bread crumbs if these were clams oreganata. A slice of pickled red chile sits on each one, waiting. If you were on vacation, you would order tray after tray of these. Here on Spring Street, other things will keep you distracted. In the hearts-of-palm salad, sweet and sour are carefully pitted against each other by means of a mango vinaigrette, a lime-and-fish-sauce dressing and a neon coat of passion-fruit pulp. The crab cake is, despite its sweet chile sauce, about as Indonesian as Betty White, but it is fresh and fluffy and not worth arguing about. Wayan’s rendition of the street snack bakwan jagung is a golden agglomeration of corn kernels and shallots fried into a flat, crunchy disc. There had better be nasi goreng at any restaurant that is even playing at being Indonesian. There is, the rice fried just until it crackles a bit between your teeth. It has a gentle but genuine spice undercurrent that would be welcome in more of the cooking. Of course there is a gado gado, and this being 2019, of course the main ingredient is avocado; the hard-cooked eggs belong to quail. This time the peanut dressing isn’t cloying or clumpy. As the plates get larger, few dishes really come forward as the kind of knockout that everybody will talk about later. The closest contender must be the lobster and basil with wavy noodles in a sauce containing, among other things, sweet soy and melted butter — a combination that the senior Mr. Vongerichten has used so successfully that it may be his son’s inheritance. Should the calamansi vinaigrette poured over the steamed black sea bass be more sour and spicy? Probably. But if there are few stars on the table, the contrast of flavors, colors, textures and techniques makes the meal into a memorable ensemble piece. The drumsticks in yellow chicken are crunchy, and the thighs are tender; both are mellow with a yellow curry seasoned by lemongrass and ginger. The tomato-chile sambal pressed into the surface of cod “bilindango” is potent enough to carry over to the spears of asparagus and fiddlehead ferns sprawled alongside. All of this looks very come-hither in the dining room, where the  Rockwell Group has abandoned stadium-size props, building atmospheric effects instead out of contrasting textures and light values and the movement of shadows. This is the visual language of expensive tropical resorts, and Wayan seems to give people the feeling they’re on vacation. It is not necessarily a loud restaurant, but New Yorkers are a loud people, and around 10 the noise can start to press down. It is a good time to call for dessert. The purple-yam ice cream with banana cake and caramelized bananas is good if sundaes are your thing. The pandan custard under passion-fruit pulp gets a lot of mileage from just a few flavors. But the one that sounds too boring to bother with (“assorted exotic fruit?”) is worth a second look. Lychee, mango, pineapple and dragon fruit may not be particularly exotic, but a dip or a dunk into a dark, spicy syrup of tamarind and palm sugar will wake them right up.",Tapping a Family Connection

4,Niche,★,2019-04-16,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/dining/niche-review-mazemen.html,Lower East Side,"In 2012 and 2013, when people were lining up at Smorgasburg and then on the second floor of the Houston Street Whole Foods Market for biodegradable bowls of Yuji Haraguchi’s mazemen — noodles that might be dressed with crisped twigs of bacon and a jiggling onsen egg, say, or yuzu-cured salmon and some Camembert soft enough to transform into a sauce — I was sure the crowds would multiply and fan out, demanding more of this strange brothless ramen. And they did, in a sense. Soon Mr. Haraguchi had established his own free-standing establishment, Yuji Ramen in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where he serves that bacon-and-egg mazemen along with his possibly visionary “tunakotsu” ramen. In 2014, when Ivan Orkin came to New York, he brought along his own mazemen recipes. Over the next few years mazemen turned up in other restaurants, too, but all of them remained better known for soup ramen, and sold more of it. It began to look as if mazemen would never be more than a sideshow act, the one-armed ax-catcher of the ramen circus. Then at the start of the year, the chef Shigetoshi Nakamura, who operates an intimate ramen shop on the Lower East Side, opened an annex next door that is dedicated to mazemen. All the seating at this new place, Niche, is at a dozen or so stools arranged around one long, narrow table. When the dining room is fully occupied, the only way to get from one end to the other is to walk sideways while holding your breath and picking up all the coats that you are going to knock off their wall pegs as you go. Not that there is much reason to roam around. Orders are taken from and delivered to the table, and there is no public restroom on the premises. As is the case next door at Nakamura, seats by the window offer a close-up view of the stone walls that support the last few yards of the Williamsburg Bridge before it empties onto Delancey Street. Before he came to New York, Mr. Nakamura was already well known in Tokyo, where he proved to have a theatrical streak. Before filling a bowl with noodles, he would yank them from the boiling water with his left hand and then hold them high in the air for a few seconds, letting them drain while standing completely motionless. Suddenly he would drop his arm and the basket would plunge toward the water again, before stopping just in time and getting one quick, emphatic shake. When Mr. Nakamura was  immortalized as one of four “ramen gods” in a set of Hello Kitty notepads and phone straps, Kitty was posed with her left paw raised high in emulation of the Nakamura Shake. If Mr. Nakamura has been practicing his choreography on the spaghetti-like, crinkly noodles at Niche, I haven’t seen it yet. The Nakamura Shake seems designed to extract cooking water as quickly as possible before the noodles cool, and temperature is not especially critical in mazemen. The idea of noodle soup without the soup has been on the loose in Japan for decades. Broth is the most expensive and labor-intensive part of a bowl of ramen; in the 1950s, a Tokyo noodle shop, in the pitiless logic of the restaurant business, began omitting the broth when ladling out noodles at staff meals, or so the story goes. This “abura soba” — oil noodle, because it was moistened with lard along with the seasoning sauce called tare — wasn’t half bad, so it went on the menu at a discounted price. As an even cheaper version of an already cheap and filling meal, abura soba was quickly embraced, especially by students. As food ideas tend to do in Japan, it evolved rapidly. Today, abura soba tends to refer to dry soups that have more or less the same toppings you’d find in a bowl of normal ramen, while mazemen generally has toppings that are rarely seen in soup and often would not respond well to being submerged in hot liquid. There is Italian-style mazemen, with anchovies, salami, olives and tomatoes. Some mazemen shops specialize in fried beef cutlets. At a Tokyo restaurant called Beefst, the centerpiece of each bowl is sliced roast beef, served rare. Mr. Nakamura has an answer to that: steak mazemen. The steak is rib-eye, in cubes that have been browned with a kitchen torch. When you stir them with the noodles and a smooth, creamy spoonful of something the menu simply calls “pork sauce,” their juices and flecks of char flavor the whole bowl. Plain spinach and fermented bamboo, meanwhile, keep the total effect from being queasy-making. Novel, straightforward, refined, unruly and impure of heart, steak mazemen has the makings of a classic New York dish. So does the duck, a common special. A sliced breast of moulard duck cooked to a deep violet-pink, it is served with a bright, focused sauce built on soy and enough warm duck juices to lubricate the whole-wheat noodles. It is not an austere dish by any means, but it is balanced and restrained. The same cannot be said for another special that is always offered on the same nights: a bowl of liquefied foie gras topped with pistachios and truffle oil. It is not clear what will happen to anyone who tries to eat this with a spoon, but the prognosis does not seem good. Instead, everybody orders it with the duck mazemen and dips the noodles into the foie gras, after which conscious thought tends to stop for a minute or two. When cerebral activity resumes, you might wonder why the sauce doesn’t come with its own noodles. No other mazemen is such a joy ride, but the vaguely Italian one with tomatoes, mushrooms, kombu and an angry red soak of chile oil is not the kind of thing you want to turn your back on. Even the tribute to Russ & Daughters, where the noodles are coated with spicy cod roe and the topping is sliced smoked salmon, can sneak up on you. Niche is one of the few ramen-yas in town where the appetizers are worth noticing. Sea urchin perched on tiny corners of toast is a strange and awkward affair, but the sardines on toast, dressed with chile flakes, are very good, as are the raw scallops with yuzu juice and the avocado salad showered with tempura flakes. Should fries be an appetizer? Maybe not, particularly Niche’s “umami kombu fries,” which have been sprinkled with powdered shio kombu until they are almost subliminally green. Apart from the color, they look like the fries at McDonald’s. The difference is that the shio kombu makes them almost diabolically hard to stop eating. And if you don’t eat them before the mazemen arrives, then when will you? Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.",Ramen Without Broth?

5,Haenyeo,★★,2019-04-09,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/dining/haenyeo-restaurant-review-jenny-kwak.html,Park Slope,"Looking around Haenyeo’s dining room one night in early March, I thought maybe Jenny Kwak’s time has finally come. Her third restaurant, Haenyeo was about three months old and already filled with people who looked as if they’d been going there for years. It sits on a prime corner lot, on a stretch of Fifth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn, that is rich in local minichains serving banh mi, burritos, lobster rolls and so on, to take out or eat in. Intimidating restaurants don’t tend to prosper here. Very few people inside Haenyeo look the least bit intimidated as they lift grilled oysters by the shell to pour the dregs of hot seaweed butter over toast; or carve wedges of zucchini-scallion pancakes fried to a dark and satisfyingly rich brown; or stir mushrooms, squid, bean sprouts, steamed spinach and cabbage kimchi with a just-cracked egg into a bibimbap whose bottom layer of rice is golden and crunchy where it meets the hot stone bowl. The customers at Haenyeo seem to have an easy familiarity with Korean food. Some of them, at least, can probably thank Ms. Kwak for that. In 1992, when she began serving the cuisine in the East Village at her first restaurant, Dok Suni’s, the words tteokbokki and seolleongtang and jajangmyeon did not roll off the tongues of most non-Koreans. But that’s who she wanted to lure in with American music, date-night décor and Western-style service. Once she had them, she would tempt, teach, turn them on to the flavors she’d grown up with. Her mother, Myung Ja Kwak, shared cooking duties. Ms. Kwak’s was not the take-it-or-leave-it approach of 32nd Street, and she kept at it. She wrote “Dok Suni: Recipes From My Mother’s Korean Kitchen,” which was one of the few Korean cookbooks in English when it came out, in 1998. At her second restaurant, Do Hwa, she and her mother led customers deeper into unfamiliar ground. Each of the restaurants stayed open for about two decades, which is a very long time in New York. If you want a metaphor for how effectively Ms. Kwak paved the way for restaurants like Atoboy, Soogil, Danji and others whose chefs weave Korean cuisine into new patterns, consider that one of them, Oiji, moved into its address on First Avenue right after Dok Suni’s moved out. What Ms. Kwak is doing in Park Slope isn’t all that different from what she has done all her career, except that by now South Korean comfort food has become comfort food for New York in general. Haenyeo does pay more attention to seafood than Dok Suni or Do Hwa did, though. Ms. Kwak hasn’t gone pescatarian on us. She still serves impressive pork and beef bulgogis with ssamjang and lettuce, and the pan-fried dumplings are filled with high-fat ground beef seasoned with kimchi, garlic and soy. But her menu’s orientation has shifted slightly toward the ocean. This is good news, because the seafood at Haenyeo has a sparkle and sweetness you don’t always find in the smoke-filled rooms of 32nd Street. A bibimbap variant may be the menu’s sleeper dish, partly because it starts out looking like a lunch bowl from Sweetgreen. It is a version of hwe dup bap. At first you just see raw tuna, shredded romaine and perilla leaves, grated carrots and cucumber, and strips of seaweed. Hidden underneath is warm rice. But there is a pink mound of spicy cod roe in the bowl, too, with cured salmon eggs and a few lobes of sea urchin. Both of them will break apart as you stir, bringing their distinct saltwater intonations to the rice and vegetables. What the menu calls “white fish fillets” — pan-fried cod with rings of scallion showing through their thin gold sheet of egg batter, otherwise known as saeng seon jeon — is so modestly named it might get overlooked; it shouldn’t. The menu plays Don’t Mind Me again with “mackerel, grilled or braised.” Just get the mackerel, because the kitchen knows how to cook it, whether over a flame or in a dark, smoky pan of garlic and gochujang. In truth, the kitchen seems to know how to cook every kind of seafood, although perhaps it could come with a better partner for the fried scallops than the sweet, yellowish tartar sauce with corn in it. The walls are hung with photographs of Korean women in wet suits. These are the haenyeo of Jeju island, who dive up to 30 feet deep for conch, abalone and seaweed while holding their breath for several minutes at a time. The money they made diving is probably the reason parts of Jeju have a matriarchal family structure. Naming the restaurant after them, Ms. Kwak continues a theme started with Dok Suni’s, which means “strong women’s.” One dish that seems out of place is a revival of Dok Suni’s fried chicken. Was the batter always so pasty and airless? That’s not how I remember it, but it’s possible my standards have changed as Korean fried chicken has infiltrated nearly every part of town over the past decade. In any case, there is better chicken to seek out here, not just the home-style dokdoritang stewed in chile sauce but also the wings. Haenyeo double-fries wings that have been dipped in potato starch, then coats them with a fine version of a yangnyeom chile sauce, tangier and a little less sweet than some. When Ms. Kwak detours from the Korean straight and narrow, consider traipsing along behind her. You may wind up having beignets for dessert, buried under a fresh coat of powdered sugar in the best Café du Monde style. (This and the grilled oysters may betray the hand of her business partner, Terrence Segura, who is from New Orleans. He is also her husband.) Or you may follow her all the way to the joyous rice cake fundido, which starts out as tteokbokki in chile sauce and becomes totally atypical through the addition of chorizo, sliced jalapeños and a melted, browned topcoat of Oaxacan cheese that comes up in long, stretchy strings when you pull on it. It is, in all likelihood, the best Tex-Mex dish in New York.

6,Standard Grill,★★,2019-04-02,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/dining/standard-grill-review.html,West Village,"I’m starting to think the American cult of chef worship may really be on the way out. At the very least, it has paused to catch its breath. Since the seven-story food court in Hudson Yards was unveiled last month, the public reaction has been somewhere between shrug and ugh. Attitudes may improve as visitors eat their way to the top floor. So far, though, the response hasn’t come close to matching the greeting bestowed on the restaurants at Time Warner Center in 2004, even though the project represents the same basic idea executed by the same developer with at least one of the same chefs, Thomas Keller. Even more striking has been the low-key reception to Rocco DiSpirito’s return. Late last year Mr. DiSpirito took over the kitchen at Standard Grill in the meatpacking district. At one point, when he was the chef at both Union Pacific and Rocco’s on 22nd while starring in a television show, he was arguably the most famous chef in the country. Then both places closed, and the show was canceled. Mr. DiSpirito has not been in charge of a restaurant since George W. Bush was in the White House. For that matter, it has been some years since Standard Grill itself has done anything noteworthy. In 2009, when it was new and Dan Silverman was the chef, I reviewed it, gave it one star and then lost track of it. In other words, the selection of Mr. DiSpirito did not just come out of left field. It came from the weeds across the street from the parking lot behind left field. For surprise value alone, it should have been one of the year’s most buzzed-about news items. But the trumpets have been muted, and the back handsprings seem to lack a certain bounce. This, at least, is the view from outside the restaurant. Once you’re sitting at one of the tables — newly topped with leather pads in a major retrofitting that has made the dining room look like an expensive cabaret, blue velvet and all — you will hear quite a lot of talk about Mr. DiSpirito, or as they call him here, Chef Rocco. Chef Rocco, you learn, conceived each dish on the menu so that it can be eaten by one person or shared with others. No, I didn’t believe it at first, either, but apparently it’s true: Rocco DiSpirito invented food. There is also something that servers call Chef Rocco’s Game Changing Toast, although sometimes they shorten it to Rocco’s Game Changing or simply Game Changing, as in “Here’s a little more Game Changing for you.” The item in question is a toasted, cracker-thin slice of bread made of nuts, oats, seeds and psyllium-seed husks held together without benefit of wheat flour. Like nearly everything on the menu, it is free of gluten. Being mostly made of browned nuts, it is also delicious. Whether it is truly Rocco’s is up for debate. It seems to strongly resemble the Life-Changing Loaf of Bread recipe that Sarah Britton published on her blog, “My New Roots,” in 2013, and that appeared on another blog two years later, with minor changes, as Game Changing Nut & Seed Bread. It’s one of the items that reflect Mr. DiSpirito’s recent obsession with nutrient-dense dietary supplements, although the way it keeps coming up in the servers’ patter makes you wonder if Mr. DiSpirito spent too much time as a QVC pitchman. Anyway, somebody-or-other’s toast sits under the smoked gravlax, red with beet juice and very silky on its bed of coconut crème fraîche, that Mr. DiSpirito sends out as an amuse. A plate of the toast will also appear if you order the platter of acorn-fed, hand-sliced Ibérico ham or the chilled Maine sea urchins served on the spiky half-shell. Either one will convince you that Mr. DiSpirito knows how to get his hands on raw materials that can stun with almost no assistance. The best things at Standard Grill, and there are quite a lot of them, depend on very good ingredients touched as little as possible. Back in the Union Pacific days, Mr. DiSpirito’s interest in East Asian cuisines came out in the form of complex preparations, arcane ingredients and out-of-nowhere juxtapositions. Now he seems to have moved on to the luxury minimalism of an omakase sushi chef, a style that was foreshadowed by the only Union Pacific dish he’s brought back, bay scallops and sea urchin with a few throat-searing drops of mustard oil. Standard Grill’s ice-cold cubes of bluefin chu-toro stirred with golden osetra caviar, meanwhile, could have come straight out of Masa, while the yellowfin tartare, barely dressed with crushed macadamias and freshly grated wasabi, is like one of the better items at Tetsu. Each night there are half a dozen or so skewers cooked over Japanese charcoal and wheeled to the table on a mini-grill the size of a toaster oven. Speared on a stick might be fantastic small scallops out of Peconic Bay; a feathery mop of maitake mushrooms; buttery chicken livers with barely a hint of bitterness; or firefly squid, a little bigger than a fava bean and grilled whole so they can be swallowed guts and all. Again, the ingredients are exceptional. The skewers look simple enough, but they are all, you learn, brushed with “a little sauce Chef Rocco came up with to complement the charcoal.” The sauce for seafood involves coconut nectar and lemongrass, and what it actually does is put you, vaguely and pleasantly, in mind of Thailand. While I am one of those increasingly stooped and wizened diners who remembers, in detail, Mr. DiSpirito’s cooking at Union Pacific, far more people recall him as the meatball-pushing antihero of “The Restaurant,” an NBC series about Rocco’s on 22nd, an actual (and doomed, it turned out) Italian-American restaurant. The show, which debuted in 2003, was a pioneer in the genre of cooking-focused reality television, although when everybody started suing everybody else, it became clear it was a pioneer in the way the members of the Donner Party were pioneers. The handful of Italian dishes at Standard Grill may be meant for “Restaurant” fans. Neither of the two pastas showed Mr. DiSpirito at his best, but a chewy risotto with red shrimp and what seemed like half a dozen forms of black truffles may make you understand why Ruth Reichl started her 1998 Times review of Union Pacific with a woman moaning at the next table. Standard Grill’s Norwegian salmon on an ivory puddle of vegan cashew sauce won’t inspire the same reaction, but the steaks might; they are dry-aged until ripe, and earn their deep-brown crust over extremely hot Japanese charcoal. Given what Mr. DiSpirito is capable of doing with a piece of halibut and some goose fat, I can’t quite believe that I’m recommending the rib-eye over the seafood, but I am. It may be that Mr. DiSpirito knows exactly what he is doing. Simplicity is the whole point of a grill, which is first cousin to the steakhouse. He has also designed a menu so straightforward that if, after a respectable period of time, he is no longer in the kitchen, the food quality can stay roughly the same as long as the hotel doesn’t argue about ingredient costs. The Standard has not left the restaurant’s fate entirely in his hands, either; besides redecorating, it hired a maître d’hôtel, Michael Cecchi-Azzolina, away from Le Coucou; he is hard at work building an audience every night, handing out old-school business cards to old-school producers, chefs and publishers, sitting down to chat with Brooke Shields and Ms. Reichl. Standard Grill is so much better than it used to be, and so much better than almost any restaurant serving a comparable menu of grilled meats and chilled seafood, that it’s foolish to wish for the return of the same Mr. DiSpirito who gave us Union Pacific. It’s a little bit as if Barbra Streisand had returned to Broadway, and then sang all her songs in a whisper sitting on the edge of the stage. It might not be what you had been waiting for, but you’d watch.

7,Violet,★,2019-03-26,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/dining/violet-pizza-review.html,East Village,"When I left my home state of Rhode Island at 18, it didn’t take long to discover that there was almost nothing about its local food customs that didn’t make outsiders laugh. That small children routinely bought coffee-flavored milk in school cafeterias; that “beer” was not pronounced with an “r” at the end, but pizza was; that a hot dog shortened to about four inches and topped with meat sauce is called a hot wiener, and that a counterman preparing six of them at a time may deploy a maneuver known as “wieners up the arm” — all of this apparently strikes people who grew up more than 20 miles from Providence as very funny. When New Yorkers hear that Violet, a new restaurant in the East Village, serves a style of pizza that comes from Rhode Island, they start to smile, as if getting ready for the punch line. In fact, though, Violet’s pies are a homage not to the whole state but to a specific restaurant, Al Forno, in Providence. If you know one thing about Al Forno, you know that its pizza is not a joke. One of the restaurant’s two founders, George Germon, originated the recipe in the early 1980s, more or less out of desperation. After failing to get an oven hot enough to produce a crust as thin and crunchy as the ones he remembered eating in Italy, he tossed dough on a wood-burning grill and watched in awe as it stiffened to a crisp almost instantly. The pizza he and his wife, Johanne Killeen, would develop and elaborate from there was in a category of its own. The skills required to bake dough in a pizza oven, whether it runs on gas, coal or wood, don’t apply to grilled pizza at all. This makes it an unending source of fascination to pizza technologists including Violet’s chef, Matt Hyland. With his wife and business partner, Emily Hyland, Mr. Hyland paid tribute to wood-fired New Haven and New York pizza at his first place, Emily, then took on Detroit pan pizza at Emmy Squared. They have expanded both restaurants to new locations, including Citi Field, where Emmy Squared is now the “official pizza.” But Mr. Hyland has been a student of the Al Forno school of pizza for years, since going to college in Rhode Island. Violet, which he opened at the start of the year, is dedicated to the style. He has worked allusions to other features of the state’s cuisine into the menu, which makes forays into pasta and small seafood dishes, but the pizza grill is at the center of the action. Anyone who has eaten at Al Forno will recognize the lineage of Violet’s pies. Both are as thin as a saltine all the way to the edge, with parallel lines of grill marks on their undersides. Al Forno puts fontina on its margheritas, as Violet did with all its pizzas until recently, when it began experimenting with havarti. In any case, the cheeses are on the dry side and grated for fast, thin distribution. Sauces are splashed down by the spoonful, quickly, before the crust burns. That’s the template for a pie called the Atwells: a base coat of grated havarti and pecorino under big blots of a garlic-laden pesto made even greener than usual by the inclusion of broccoli and pistachios. While Al Forno tosses raw, slivered scallions on almost every pie, Violet may chop its scallions or grill them. One appealingly eccentric pie that combines a New Haven clam pizza with a Peking duck pancake is finished with fried julienned leeks. Olive oil does give Al Forno’s crust extra crackle and flavor, but Violet’s less lavishly oiled dough, made with a sourdough starter, has more flavor of its own. It’s a little salty, crunchy but not brittle, more substantial than you expect, and highly chewable. Violet gives you a heavy pair of shears to snip the pie into wedges, or any shape you like. Wielding them supplies the palpable thrill of using exactly the right tool for the job, and it’s even better than that because the job is eating pizza. A trip to Providence last weekend, though, turned up more than structural similarities between Violet and Al Forno. Three of the four pizzas on Al Forno’s menu reminded me of pies I’d eaten at Violet. One resembled the Atwells, but its pesto was made with asparagus rather than broccoli. For Violet’s Beech Vibes, a thin layer of duxelles is spread from rim to rim, then topped with tahini, caramelized onions and pickled beech mushrooms. It reminds me of a pissaladière in which the anchovies have been replaced by mushrooms. Al Forno makes a duxelles pizza, too, but tops it with unpickled white mushrooms, and doesn’t use tahini. And, of course, both places do a variation on a Neapolitan margherita, called the margarita in Providence and the Classic in the East Village. The difference between their dough recipes doesn’t quite put to rest the suspicion that Violet should be more conscientious about avoiding overlap even though Al Forno is 180 miles away. Most diners, of course, will just be happy to have a new style of pizza in town. Any of Violet’s pies, eaten before or after the iceberg-wedge salad with blue cheese and a jolt of ranch dressing, or the frisée salad tossed with fried artichokes, would make an ideal fast dinner. Beyond that, the going can get tricky. All the pastas I tried seemed like rough drafts, from the radiatore baked in a very salty vodka sauce to the spaghetti con vongole con dashi, a Japanese-Italian blind date that doesn’t have the right chemistry. The two desserts I had were even stranger. Describing one of them, a cheesecake with banana pudding on it, the server said, “I’m just going to tell you what it is and if you guys want it, you can order it.” If the warning had been any stronger it would have come with liability waivers. If you did want to build a longer meal, some of the seafood appetizers can help. Not the “stuffies,” baked stuffed littlenecks or cherrystones that could use more clam. The smoked mackerel, though, is excellent and comes with some unusually good fresh-fried potato chips. There are also shrimp that have been grilled with their heads and shells on, placed over johnnycakes and splashed with spiced piri-piri sauce. Johnnycakes, which are made of fried cornmeal mush and taste like it, are probably more strongly identified with Rhode Island than any other food. I have never been sure why, because johnnycakes can be found, if you really want to look for them, all along the Atlantic Coast. The only time I’ve seen Rhode Islanders eating them was on a Boy Scout camping trip, and boy scouts will eat anything if you leave them in the woods for a few days. In any case, the johnnycakes that Violet places under the shrimp and the piri-piri sauce are kind of wonderful. The cornmeal has a lush, right-off-the-cob flavor. I’d have them for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Is it possible that the joke has been on me all along?

The first time is about halfway through the meal, when Seong Cheol Byun shows up, shapes half a dozen pieces of sushi and lays them down, one by one, in front of you. Some of his ingredients, kept on wooden trays that he carries from place to place, are typical, like the warm short-grain rice and the dark nikiri that he will brush over certain fish. Others are less typical. The ginger he mounds on your plate is pickled together with sliced lotus root and daikon. On March 1, looking forward to spring, he added cherry leaves to the mix. Mr. Byun, a Korean-American, ferments daikon, cabbage and sesame seeds to make white kimchi, which he wraps inside nori for a tuna roll. You eat it like an ice cream cone, but faster. When Mr. Byun worked at Sushi Nakazawa, much of the seafood he used was flown in from Japan. At Odo, almost all the fish have been caught off the East Coast of North America: Long Island black sea bass, Florida mackerel and North Carolina bluefin tuna, which may be several weeks old before Mr. Byun is ready to serve it. This sushi reflects the American region where it is made, incorporates the Korean background of the chef making it and still has an unmistakably Japanese spirit. This one course, if tripled in length, could be spun off into a separate establishment that would probably be among the top two dozen sushi restaurants in the city. The second time an Odo course is prepared while you watch, it is made in a cocktail shaker and served in a cocktail glass. It is, as you may have guessed, a cocktail, though it is also the first of two desserts, sweetish and not especially boozy. Frank Cisneros, the sommelier, subordinates the alcohol to fresh fruit, in the style of the revered Tokyo bar Gen Yamamoto. Barrel-aged shochu is muddled with one or two sprightly segments of mikan orange, subjected to a calisthenic shake and strained into a delicately etched glass before a shimmer of sparkling wine is laid down on top. Orange juice in cocktails usually tastes diluted and weak; in this drink, it was radiant. I would say that the drinkable dessert course could be expanded into a separate cocktail bar, except that Odo already has one of those. Odo, which opened in December a few minutes’ walk from the Flatiron Building, is entered through a door hidden in the back of a compact den — cafe by day and bar by night — called Hall. This arrangement seems to remind people of a speakeasy, although it would take an especially clueless bootlegger to open a speakeasy inside a bar. So far, Hall has not been fully discovered, but it still gets busy enough at dinner time that you can be stranded by the front door for a few minutes before anyone on staff notices. Some diners on their way to Odo will find this an awkward start to a meal that costs $200 before tax, tip and drinks. But they may also discern that Hall, lined with carved oak panels salvaged from what appears to have been a library or church vestry from around 1900, is one of the neighborhood’s most entrancing rooms; that the corridor, which seems too narrow and definitely climbs on its way toward a too-short brass door with no handle, is perspective-altering in a way a Surrealist would enjoy; and that Odo, a shadowy and windowless space on the far side of that door is an unusually tranquil shelter from crowds, noise and anything else you might want to get away from for a couple of hours. The 14 counter seats face the kitchen and, in the middle of it, a charcoal-gray island. This is where Mr. Odo and his cooks assemble the other courses I promised to tell you about. Duck breast has been grilled over charcoal and positioned between two sauces. One is a black spill of concentrated soy spiced with sansho pepper; the other is an ivory pool of puréed apples and cream. These sauces contrast in every way you can think of, including East versus West, and they come together like opposing poles of a magnet. A springy chunk of truffle-flavored mochi is crisped on the grill and engulfed in a white-miso soup that has grated white truffles floating on the surface. You smell truffles in the air first, get them on the tip of your tongue next and finally taste them everywhere when they’re released from the mochi. A croquette tastes something like an Italian rice ball made from New England clam chowder that has young bamboo shoots in it. This golden, breaded arancino is finished with dots of grated goat cheese. Shaved lamb shoulder, baby harukei turnip and two asparagus stalks as thin as licorice whip are served, still cooking, in a hot broth, a kaiseki version of shabu shabu. Odo — incidentally, the name is pronounced as a set of initials, O.D.O. — pursues local ingredients not just for its sushi course but throughout its menu. The simmered lamb used to gambol in the Hudson Valley, the croquetted topneck clams were raked in off Long Island and so on. Kaiseki’s near-liturgical focus on timeliness almost seems to demand local ingredients, and they have been central to Niki Nakayama’s strategy at n/naka in Los Angeles, but less so for New York’s few kaiseki chefs. Chikara Sono at Kyo Ya, for instance, takes pains to import traditional ingredients from Japan the minute they’re available. Mr. Odo came to New York as the chef of Kajitsu, the extraordinary restaurant on East 39th Street that follows the vegetarian cooking tradition known as shojin ryori, born centuries ago in Zen Buddhist temples. One contribution he made in his five years there was to freshen up the menus with more food grown nearby. In the first and last tastes of his February and March menus, he anchors Odo firmly in the New York region. When you sit down, you are immediately poured a cup of cold sake. It is brewed in Brooklyn, and it is very good, swirling with fresh-fruit aromatics. Then at the end, after the fresh fruit, Mr. Odo serves ice cream made with kasu, the creamy solids left over at the end of sake distillation. The ice cream looks like vanilla and tastes, not surprisingly, like fermented rice. This particular kasu is supplied by the same brewery in Brooklyn that makes the sake. Expanding his range to meat and fish at Odo, he has kept the resourcefulness that limitations encourage. Somewhere along the way Mr. Odo also picked up technical skills in traditions far outside kaiseki. Each night, in the gohan course, Odo offers a choice of three starchy dishes. This is where I encountered a very fine seafood curry over rice; an elegant bowl of short ramen noodles in king crab broth; and fresh soba served with little pieces of pickled vegetables and wasabi blossoms, looking a bit like broccoli florets but tasting like mustard. As with the cocktail and the sushi, each of these dishes could, if Mr. Odo wanted, be leveraged into separate specialized restaurants, or food-hall stands. You could tell yourself that $200 is a large amount of money for a single meal or you could say that for the chance to visit all these different establishments without leaving your seat, it’s a pretty good deal. Either way, you’d be right.

9,Cka Ka Qellu,★★,2019-03-12,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/12/dining/cka-ka-qellu-review.html,Belmont,"The best way to enter the Albanian restaurant Cka Ka Qellu, if not the most direct, starts on Arthur Avenue. Arrive before the fish shops along this famous, not-quite-faded Italian strip in the Bronx take in the iced clams and octopus for the night. Across from Dominick’s, turn into the indoor market that Fiorello La Guardia ordered up. Move on past the hand-rolled cigars and the T-shirts reflecting various tenets of Bronx philosophy. Keep going beyond the scamorza, the soppressata and the ready-to-go heroes, and walk out the door on to Hughes Avenue. Just to the right is a spinning wheel that looks old enough to have been Rumpelstiltskin’s and next to it, another door. Open it, walk inside. The short trip seems to have taken you back in time. The spinning wheel turns out to be just one piece in Cka Ka Qellu’s collection of antique tools, stringed instruments, yokes, brass coffee mills, manual typewriters, dishes of hammered metal and embroidered costumes that the owner, Ramiz Kukaj, brought over from the old country. Some, he says, go back to the 18th century. The floors and walls seem to have been airlifted from an Albanian farmhouse, and the speakers play wistful folk tunes on traditional instruments, not the modern, globally aware wake-up calls of the brass band Fanfara Tirana. The restaurant is soaked in nostalgia. The other reason for the walk from Arthur Avenue is that it recapitulates a pattern that’s repeated throughout this neighborhood, where the signs and menus facing the street are still written in Italian but many of the people in the back rooms, seasoning the sausages and frying the veal cutlets, are Albanian. Here and there, those Albanians have brought a little of their cuisine into those Italian businesses. Cumin-laden suxhuk sausages hang to dry in the salumerias. In some pizzerias, the burek challenges the Jamaican beef patty for outsider meat-pie supremacy. One such place, also owned by Mr. Kukaj, is in the Norwood neighborhood and is called Tradita. (Ligaya Mishan reviewed it in 2017.) But if you want a deep-end Albanian experience, Cka Ka Qellu, pronounced SHA ka chell-OO, is the place to go. The kitchen does not focus on the seafood of Albania’s Adriatic coast, or the more intensely Greek- and Turkish-leaning cuisine of its southern reaches. Instead, it heavily favors the north, which shares many dishes with the former components of Yugoslavia that are its neighbors. In particular there is a strong overlap with Kosovo, home to many ethnic Albanians including, at one time, Mr. Kukaj and his chef, Afrim Kaliqani. In their kitchen, yogurt and cream are everywhere, along with curds of soft fresh cheese and triangles of creamy, unsqueaky feta. A good portion of the menu could be described as things in a creamy white sauce. Another, entirely different portion could be described as creamy white sauce with things in it. Included in the second group are some of the dips that are almost obligatory at the start of your Cka Ka Qellu experience: tarator, tart yogurt with minced cucumbers, garlic and parsley, similar to tzatziki, but nearly as fluffy as whipped cream; cream stirred with bits of suxhuk to give it a pinkish tint and a suggestion of spice; and kajmak, which our server described as “like butter for bread” and I would say was like crème fraîche blended with cream cheese and butter. (In parts of Albania, it would be made by boiling unpasteurized milk from water buffalo.) I found myself dipping sausages, vegetables and just about everything else into the kajmak, but it is exceptionally good with a warm slice of the bread that Cka Ka Qellu bakes in the pizza oven that is the first thing you see when you walk in. When the menu defines kacamak as “cream with polenta,” the cream in question is kajmak, stirred into a fine-grained, nearly white mass of cornmeal that takes on the lightly fluffed quality of really well-made mashed potatoes. Sometimes there is a creamy sauce where you don’t expect one. Each slice of lecenik, a cornbread with spinach and cottage cheese that is so rich it is only a few rungs in the ladder from cheesecake, comes to the table under a spoonful of kajmak. Sometimes there is no creamy sauce where one would do some good. The restaurant’s version of fli, the slow-baked, many-layered pancake, is served as a long, narrow wedge with no accompaniment, although it is somewhat less than fully tender and moist. Luckily it responds immediately to any spare yogurt you can forage from elsewhere on the table. The mantia, baked dumplings filled with ground veal and onions, will seem tough and dry, too, if you order them alone. The same mantia cooked with yogurt in a clay dish will seem perfect. Is there another restaurant in New York that makes as much use of veal, and as little of any other meat, as Cka Ka Qellu? It is the main ingredient in the restaurant’s qofte, ground and mixed with onions and red pepper; and in its qebapa, mild skinless sausages cooked on the grill. (The sausages would be called cevapi in other corners of the Balkans, where they are likely to be made from lamb or beef.) Veal works its way into many of the clay-dish stews, including the veal tava, something like a Mediterranean ratatouille that got itself entangled with a meat-and-potato stew from another part of Europe. Rolled up with cheeses and smoked meat, breaded and fried, veal also serves as the filling for the alluring Skanderbeg. Named after a great patriotic hero of the 15th century, Skanderbeg is generally called Albania’s national dish, although its resemblance to a kayak made from chicken cordon bleu renders it something of an outlier in the cuisine. Ladled along its crunchy, golden length is — please rise and face Hughes Avenue — a creamy white sauce. Eating all of this without a salad is unimaginable and probably unadvisable. Each of Cka Ka Qellu’s several salads seems to consist of cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions and cheese in slightly different arrangements. If the vegetables were any fresher, you’d be embarrassed to eat them in public. Surprise appearances by olives and their ilk provide extra variety. Like the breads, the desserts are baked on site: syrup-soaked baklava, a nut cake called haxhimak, a sugar cookie with nuts pressed into the top whose Albanian name is sheqerpare. I like them best with coffee boiled on the stove in a long-handled brass pitcher and served on a matching tray, both of them engraved with ancient, geometric designs that repeat and repeat.

10,Madame Vo BBQ,★,2019-03-05,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/dining/madame-vo-bbq-review.html,East Village,"The main attraction at Madame Vo BBQ, now two months into its run on Second Avenue in the East Village, is a seven-course dinner on the theme of beef. This is a familiar concept in Vietnam, where it is known as bo bay mon, as well as in San Jose, Calif., Houston and other areas with robust Vietnamese populations. In New York, where the Vietnamese restaurant scene is more anemic, bo bay mon is still a rarity. The rough outlines of the setup at Madame Vo, though, will be familiar to any New Yorker who has gone out for Korean barbecue. New York City bureaucracy is unwelcoming to the tabletop charcoal grills seen in Hanoi, so an electric grill under a metal screen is embedded in each table. Once the grill is switched on and the metal rods down at kneecap level begin to warm up, an array of sauces, condiments and vegetables will arrive. When the rods are red, a server with a pair of tongs will lay some meat down on the screen, return periodically to fiddle with it and eventually decide when it is ready to be eaten. The similarities with, say, Han Joo Chik Naeng Myun & BBQ in Queens end, of course, with the actual food. Yes, both offer lettuce for wrapping, but at Madame Vo BBQ it is part of a Vietnamese table salad, along with fresh herbs; raw cucumbers, pineapple and apple; and pickled carrots and daikon. The restaurant also sets out a nifty caddy that holds circles of rice paper and warm water, in a miniature bathtub, for wetting the paper until it is soft enough to fashion into rolls. Rather than gochujang and sesame oil, there is a classic Vietnamese nuoc cham, an intoxicatingly good version of the pineapple-and-fermented anchovy sauce known as mam nem, and lastly a tamarind sauce, which suggests Madame Vo BBQ can follow or leap over Vietnamese tradition at will. This is about what you’d expect if you’ve eaten at another restaurant, a few blocks north, simply called Madame Vo. Jimmy Ly is the chef in both places; he and his wife, Yen Vo, are the proprietors. Each was raised in the United States by immigrants from Vietnam, and like many children of immigrants they seem to be fluent not just in two languages but in two cultures, enabling them to serve dishes their families might recognize in a setting that outsiders might embrace. The wings at Madame Vo, sticky with caramel and fried garlic, are drive-straight-from-the-airport good. The restaurant produces some of the only pho in Manhattan worth talking about. One of them, in a porcelain bowl the size of a baptismal font, is filled with a potent beef broth, a short rib on the bone and enough other cuts to make a butcher smile. At least one dish at the couple’s new restaurant can stand alongside the wings and the pho at their first: the oxtail congee. Congee, or chao thit bo, is customarily the last course in bo bay mon. It frequently takes the form of a cloudy beef-and-rice soup. Mr. Ly cooks his congee with some chicken stock until it has the consistency of polenta, then spoons over it some sweet and savory braised oxtails in honey, fish sauce and brown butter. Everything about it is wonderful, even the scallion greens on top. The first of the seven beefs is typically boi tai chanh, a raw beef salad, and this is a high point, too. Lean eye of round cut into thin pink sheets is the canvas for an action-painting whirl of fried shallots, raw red onions, chopped peanuts and slivers of fresh mint. Pretty standard stuff so far, but then Mr. Ly bathes the salad in tangerine-lime vinaigrette, which has a positively buoyant effect, and splashes it with a bright-green, lemony pulp of fresh rau ram puréed in oil. In the middle of this $59 menu come the grilled meats, the courses for which the table salad and rice paper wrappers have been waiting. The finest of these might be the relatively straightforward five-spice tongue, although the betel-leaf-wrapped bundles of seasoned ground beef — bo la lot — are soothing and stimulating at once, and the New York strip with marrow butter is a clever way to acknowledge Manhattan’s own beef-eating rituals, even if it would draw blank stares on the streets of Saigon. If you, like me, are naturally skeptical when servers persistently push a big-ticket item, you might be tempted to blaze your own path through Madame Vo BBQ’s menu. But once you’ve tried the bo bay mon you have, by and large, seen the kitchen at its best. Yes, you could get the whole catfish, and if you are not into beef perhaps you should. Despite what the menu says, the catfish is not grilled, but fried and then baked. It was perfectly done the night I had it, and was filleted at the table by a server who knew his way around a fish skeleton. By that time, all that was left to do was to wrap a chunk of fish in lettuce and rice paper with a squeeze of grilled lemon and some of the sautéed shallots, lemongrass and bird chiles that the kitchen had ladled along the snaking curve of the spine. If you are thinking about a vegetable, the skewered and grilled okra pods in soy are crunchy and unslimy. The other appetizers, though, can be tricky. One night, the grilled scallop brushed with duck fat was transporting; on another, it tasted too much like the grill. Spring rolls filled with short rib and bone marrow seemed pointlessly indulgent, and so did their truffle hoisin dipping sauce in which I couldn’t taste the truffles. A few dishes might have been improved if they’d arrived while hot, like the extra-large grilled oysters under caramelized sea urchin mayonnaise or the charred sea urchin, basted in its shell with butter, sake and fish sauce. Grilled prawns brushed with a lovely orange butter were slightly more mushy than two prawns sold for $38 should be. And while the 44-ounce tomahawk steak was more than a fair deal at $90, it would have been helped by a more aggressive sear and more salt. On certain nights, the whole operation had a slack, inattentive feeling that’s rare in new restaurants. The catfish sat on the table, getting cold, while we waited for the table salad to show up. The thick stems of stir-fried morning glory would have been better cut into shorter lengths. Madame Vo BBQ may eventually run as smoothly as its older sibling. While it works out the mechanics, the surest route to happiness is to eat the bo bay mon while sipping cold coconut water through a metal straw out of a whole green coconut that you hold in one hand, like a cup of coffee.

11,Oxalis,★,2019-02-26,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/26/dining/oxalis-restaurant-review.html,Crown Heights,"Part of the fun of eating at a pop-up is the thrill of invading a space after hours, like being locked in the museum at night with the whale and the diamonds. Another part is the sense of being in on a secret, eating at some place that doesn’t have a Yelp entry and may not even have a name, while your friends are waiting in line at Roberta’s. The mismatch between the borrowed space and the borrowers can send off sparks, too. Three years ago, when the Danish chef Bo Bech staged a one-night pop-up in the kitchen at Cosme in Manhattan, using ingredients he’d bought from farmers and shellfishers in Virginia the day before, his Mid-Atlantic-Nordic cooking stood out against the aromas of griddled masa and roasted chiles. When a pop-up settles down into a space of its own, it loses those things. In their place, it takes on the extra weight of proprietorship. The owners have to make decisions that were previously made for them, and those decisions will start to define them. It’s their paint color on the wall, their scented candles in the bathroom, their name on the door. This is the position in which we find the former pop-up Oxalis and its chef, Nico Russell, a veteran of Daniel, in New York, and Mirazur, on the French Riviera. Beginning in 2016, Mr. Russell slalomed through a series of restaurants that would hand him the keys on off nights so he could cook tasting menus of 10 courses or so. First he inhabited Fitzcarraldo, an Italian restaurant whose combination of industrial, nautical, cinematic and Mediterranean elements has made it a frequent wedding site. Later he moved on to Egg, an austerely contemporary temple to breakfast which had begun its own life, more than a decade earlier, as a pop-up. He sold tickets to his Oxalis dinners, enough of them to get a few investors interested. With enough funding to take on a lease in Crown Heights, Oxalis opened in November in a former wine bar within sight of the Brooklyn Museum. Mr. Russell’s vision for Oxalis is the one behind the bistronomie movement in France and its disciples abroad: carefully considered food served without the hoopla that drives up tabs. He slings a lot of vegetables in Oxalis’s four- to six-course set menus, and it’s one sign of his skill that this doesn’t come across as a cost-cutting measure even though it must be, at least in part — dinner is an extremely reasonable $60. Both the price and the understated cooking style reminded me of Contra, which opened with a five-course, $55 menu. The last time I went I ate a dish built around spaghetti-like strands of rutabaga under a warm snowdrift of whipped Alpine fontina. These two mild-tasting ingredients were set in motion by the force of a third, a dark and focused coffee-and-chicory cream sauce. This was a rutabaga that made me smile. Granted, I probably like rutabaga more than the average person, but I suspect that exposure to the rutabaga at Oxalis would make the average person realize that I’m right. Meals begin with a couple of bite-size snacks, one of which tends to be a crisp potato cake dusted with bay-leaf powder and topped with a chip of nori. It looks harmless enough, but can produce powerful emotions, which are easier to understand once you know that the potatoes are stewed in duck fat and then deep-fried. The other snack might be some lightly dehydrated beets brushed with marjoram-infused cream, or tiny grilled carrots that you dip in chamomile sabayon. (This is one of the dishes that suggests the long shadow of Noma, which in its early days famously matched aged carrots with chamomile.) The price seems meant to encourage frequent visits, but if you return often you may experience déjà vu. At meals in December, January and February, I was always served some variation on raw sea scallops with daikon and apple and some version of duck breast, sweet potato and yogurt. The portions in both cases were restrained but the flavors were outsize. The scallops were cured in miso and refrigerated for a few days and came out of it with something like the concentration of flavor that beef gets from dry-aging, but none of the funk. The duck’s flavor was less surprising, but there was some energy in its collision with sweet potato purée and fig-leaf yogurt tart enough to cause double-takes. Like the rest of the menu, desserts are unshowy but can be highly impressive. One worked goat milk up into a thing of beauty: Some of it was made into a simple frozen custard, the rest cooked down into cajeta. The cooking makes it clear why people chased Oxalis around Brooklyn in its various borrowed spaces, but other aspects of the restaurant suggest that it hasn’t quite figured out how to live in a space of its own. A meal there can be a somewhat solemn experience, which doesn’t seem to be what Mr. Russell and his partners are aiming for. The layout seems to work against it. The kitchen is right up front, and the bar is all the way in the back, separated from the dining room by a glass door in a glass wall. I can’t imagine what the wall is for, unless Oxalis is planning to bring back the smoking section. Instead of serving as a street-side welcome and a source of energy for the dining room, the bar feels like a waiting room. And while it takes reservations, the tasting menu isn’t served there. The bar menu is à la carte. The dining room could use a little lift. It’s as plain as a Shaker church, with clamshell-colored wainscoting below white walls unbroken by pictures or anything else. (All the art is in the restroom.) The way the servers have been coached on their lines so far underlines the decorative stiffness. They say stuff like “Moving now into more sweet things …” rather than “Here’s your dessert,” and my neighbor one night was instructed to “sit back and relax,” something that tends to go without saying in most restaurants. Things have loosened up since the liquor license came through. In the first few weeks, the servers were always trying to push a nonalcoholic beverage pairing for $20, and while the bar was mixing sodas that were more interesting than many cocktails around town, I’m not sure they were different enough from one another to justify drinking the whole slate. Now there are also wine pairings, starting at $35. Sometimes I wondered whether it would get the air circulating if the bar popped up in the dining room, or vice versa. There’s probably some simple fix, or a series of them, that would give Oxalis some of its old sense of adventure. You can sense it lying there, waiting, when you taste that cajeta, those scallops, the fantastic little potato cakes.

12,Bistro Pierre Lapin,★,2019-02-19,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/dining/bistro-pierre-lapin-review.html,West Village,"The great Midtown shrines to French cuisine were mourned one by one as they went, often at length and in print. At the same time, another style of French restaurant was dying off, but generally without benefit of a full obituary. This was the small, discreet bistro with forehead-height curtains in the windows, Piaf on the speakers, snails on the menu, chips on the china. They could be found uptown or downtown, almost always on a side street. Unlike Le Pavillon, La Côte Basque and their ilk, and unlike Keith McNally’s immersive brasserie sets, which came later, these bistros were rarely fashionable. They were filled with professors and psychotherapists, Paris Review readers and Film Society of Lincoln Center members. Occasionally a passer-by out walking the dog would stand on tiptoe to peer over the curtain, but paparazzi did not stake out the doors of these establishments. Individually, few were landmarks. Collectively, their quiet continental self-assurance, their indifference to the passage of time, not to mention their crèmes brûlées and blood sausages and Fleuries, helped form the backdrop of the city. You always thought you’d have one within walking distance. Then, one day, you didn’t. Bistro Pierre Lapin, which the chef and restaurateur Harold Moore opened last May in the West Village, is either a very late entry into the genre, or else a homage of impressive intensity. The dining room has the forehead-height curtains — green gingham. It has Piaf on the playlist, and also Pink Martini’s “Sympathique,” which has become the “Vie en Rose” of the Spotify era, for better or worse. Pierre Lapin also throws in some frills that go beyond the basic formula. White tapers burn on every table, wall sconces throw off Cognac-colored light from behind lampshades the size of teacups, a collection of thin flowery china dishes supplements the chunky white bistro ware. Most of all, Pierre Lapin has that rich, creamy, antique cooking — all the stuff nouvelle cuisine tried to kill. As soon as you order, you get a preview of what you’re in for: A length of chewy, substantial baguette arrives with a small mound of cultured butter, a pile of truffled cheese spread and a pink hunk of rustic pork pâté. On a quiet night at home, this could serve as a light dinner. At Pierre Lapin, it is a little snack to stave off hunger before the appetizers. Going back at least as far as his days at Commerce, Mr. Moore has seemed at home with profuse helpings and sauces that settled over them like a goose-down duvet over a sleeping Saint Bernard. After closing that restaurant, he opened an ode to Southern immoderation called Harold’s Meat & Three, now just Harold’s; the most memorable thing I’ve eaten there was a Kentucky hot brown sandwich on which the Mornay sauce flowed freely. He also briefly ran a less focused study of Americana called the Greenwich Grille, where I ate a chicken potpie that I thought had potential. About a week later, I learned that the place had closed. None of Mr. Moore’s previous kitchens went for the gut quite as gleefully as Pierre Lapin’s. Your first course there could well be, and almost certainly will be if you leave the choice to me, an avalanche of mushrooms in cream cascading over the edge of a tall slab of buttered and griddled pain de mie. But it would be a mistake to overlook the Brie au four, roughly half a pound of baked Brie melting among dried figs and walnuts, all served with toasted baguette. I ended up ordering the Brie for the table, which freed somebody else to get the very meaty frogs’ legs in a small lake of parsley, garlic, butter and lemon juice, while another guest tried the “balle de matzo en consommé.” In English, that means a nice bowl of chicken soup with a single matzo ball so densely packed that if you tossed it out of a second-story window it would probably put a dent in a car hood. This is not a bad trait in a matzo ball unless you happen to own the car. The lusty tune begun by the appetizers is picked up by the main courses. There is a fairly classic coq au vin, not too winy-tasting; some hefty sea scallops under toasted almonds, sensibly outfitted with endive and citrus sections; and a grouping of gnocchi, foie gras, sautéed sweetbreads and mushrooms, black truffle shavings and puffy chicken dumplings, all milling around in a Cognac-flamed cream sauce. It sounds insanely overcrowded, but is very rewarding to unpack. We have only scratched the surface of the menu. It goes on, perhaps longer than it should, because some dishes are more appealing than others. A black sea bass “bonne femme” was simply dull instead of simple. The soupy, thin cassoulet could have used more meat and a thicker crust of bread crumbs. The garlic sauce Mr. Moore made for snails tasted less garlicky than run-of-the-mill snail butter; the snails and I never figured out what we were supposed to do with the sunny-side-up egg planted in the middle of the plate. The menu could be trimmed by about a third. The same is most likely true for a few individual dishes, although Mr. Moore’s shambolic, celebratory cooking style is one of the reasons Pierre Lapin works as well as it does. If he tidied everything up he’d be going head-to-head with Le Coucou, a contest that would not play to his strengths. The excess, the untucked shirttails on the dishes, the incomplete thoughts on the menu are part of the restaurant’s charm. That charm does not quite extend to the wine list, which looks like one from four decades ago. It’s almost entirely drawn from Bordeaux, Burgundy and the Rhone, with very few bottles under $75. This seems to be taking the joke a little too far — in 1971, you could still get cheap Bordeaux. I drank well, but I always spent more on it than I meant to, which is the kind of thing that can keep diners from coming back. For dessert there is a coconut cake that has little to do with France. Dense and rich in a homespun American style that some people will love and others will find too leaden, it followed Mr. Moore here from Commerce, where it was a big hit. Other members of the lineup you already know. The chocolate mousse is deliciously dark, though not as airy as it could be. The sugar crust on the crème brûlée is burned to order. Both are overshadowed, though, by a peculiarly likable Pavlova. It is conceived as a tart, with a meringue crust and a whipped-cream topping; once it is sliced into a white wedge, bright yellow passion-fruit curd runs down its sides. Anna Pavlova would not recognize it, but she would have liked its sense of theater.

13,Cherry Point,★★,2019-02-12,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/dining/cherry-point-review.html,Greenpoint,"Cherry Point sits on Manhattan Avenue in Greenpoint, a few steps from the corner where Bedford Avenue, having flowed all the way across Brooklyn from the shores of Sheepshead Bay, suddenly comes to an end. The area is marked by a cluster of restaurants. Some have a washed-up feeling, as if they’d all been drifting along in Bedford’s currents and had been stranded there. A few stand out in the landscape. In the fall, Cherry Point took a decisive turn into the second category when a new chef took over, but not everyone in the neighborhood seems to realize it yet. People still tumble in for happy hour, when servers whose hairstyles take a minute to adjust to will pour three-gulp martinis, manhattans and Rob Roys (due for a revival) in little Nick & Nora glasses for $8 each, and then after happy hour ends at 7 p.m. most of the crowd generally drifts out to find somewhere else for dinner. The space, with its old-timey wainscoting and its central bar, is easy to mistake for a tavern. Let’s say you were among those who stayed put. Contemporaneously with your cocktail, you worked on a few smoked olives, green and warm; swirled a few of the golden, bite-size pig’s head croquettes in a pale-pinkish ketchup made from pears; and became curious about what else this kitchen was up to. At one point you noticed that the dining room suddenly smelled like an herb garden in August, and a minute later Belon oysters on a nest of smoking rosemary branches sailed out of the kitchen opening that lights up the back of the restaurant. You ordered a plate of your own because you wanted to know how the warm oysters would taste under their yellow blankets of smoked rosemary hollandaise. From a short list of charcuterie you chose the squab and pork terrine, with a few prunes embedded into the pink and pleasingly coarse-grained slab. You spread this on toast with creamy whole-grain mustard, apricot-ginger mostarda or some of the pear ketchup, all of them made on the premises, like the pearl onions pickled in beer and the terrine itself. And you might have thought: If these are just the snacks, what is the food going to be like when this kitchen gets down to business? Whatever happens, odds are there will be meat on the table. Cherry Point opened in 2016, taking over what had been a Polish restaurant called Cinamoon. The charcuterie was made on site from the start, but the menu swerved in a more meat-focused and English-leaning direction last fall when Ed Szymanski was hired as the chef. This might have been predicted, if not from Mr. Szymanski’s English upbringing and British citizenship, then from his work history. He has cooked at the Beatrice Inn, where various beasts of air and land are posed on silver platters for their roles in a fall-of-Rome spectacle; the Spotted Pig, in the days when it was still known for burgers basted in Roquefort and toasts buried under chopped chicken livers; and Pitt Cue, a London outpost of the modern, urbanized barbecue genre. For a panoramic tour of Mr. Szymanski’s accumulated meat wisdom, you could call two days ahead and reserve a game-and-beef dinner, $65 for at least four courses along the lines of grilled tongue on watercress. The everyday menu, though, is not exactly made up of grain bowls. On any given night, you can drop in and marvel at the fried lamb ribs, their apple glaze augmented by broken coriander and fennel seeds and raw curls of shallot. The quail will be butterflied, grilled over charcoal and served on toast, with pickled prunes above it and a reduction swirled with port below. The duck breast will be seared down until the skin is a thin brown sheet next to pink and juicy meat. This is served with roasted, puréed celery root and brûléed pears. The plates are marked by a refinement and moderation that is not always achieved by other chefs in the guts-and-fat school of cookery. A creamy pheasant, leek and bacon pie is sealed inside a cast-iron pot by a beauty of a suet crust — lacquered, scored in a starburst and very tender. Care is even lavished on the grilled rib-eye for two, which comes to the table with neatly sawed lengths of bone marrow under a tidy crust of parsley, chives, pickle shallots and buttered bread crumbs. Mr. Szymanski does not gesture toward fish and vegetables very often, but when he does he generally musters some conviction. True, the roasted pumpkin mash with toasted hazelnuts and fresh cheese has an obligatory air, as does the grilled bread with labneh and honey. But the smoked whitefish salad, with caramelized shallots and crème fraîche and a side of saltines, is more energetic than you might guess. Grilled flatbread looks out of place on this menu, but it is a fine canvas for roasted hens-of-the-woods and other wild mushrooms that are fleshy and flavorful enough to get noticed on their own. Skate, a main course, comes with smoked German butterball potatoes and a soaring, fino sherry-laced beurre blanc. The salad of radicchio and other bitter lettuces is as crisp and refreshing as any plate of leaves can be in February. It is also a very good thing to eat with steak, as it happens. Anyone who has not caught on to the English theme so far will get a last chance with the dessert menu, which offers treacle tart, sticky toffee pudding, a posset and three cheeses, all from England. The treacle tart was dry when I had it. The sticky toffee pudding was surprisingly but not unpleasantly cakelike. The posset, though, is a small miracle, an eggless custard of sugar, lemon juice and cream scented with Earl Grey tea, dressed up with Cara Cara orange wedges and a few Earl Grey meringues. There should be more possets around town. There should be possets galore. And by the way, there should be more wine lists like Cherry Point’s. Assembled by Garret Smith, who owns the restaurant with Vincent Mazeau, it consistently favors obscure and surprising over familiar and dull. By the bottle, there are oddities such as apple wine and mead, but also a few things you might have heard of: a cremant d’Alsace from Dirler Cadé, a Sybille Kuntz riesling, an Olga Raffault chinon and a lean, exact pinot noir from Enderle & Moll. Only two bottles, both sparkling wines, are over $100, and most of the others are closer to $50. At these prices, you could just close your eyes and pick something, which is lucky because the servers, though charming and truly unpretentious, haven’t fully internalized the list’s ins and outs. It’s one of the ways in which Cherry Point seems not to have caught up yet with how good it has become. If you treat it like a bar, you might not notice. But if you eat the way I did, ordering half the menu at a time, you could be putting more stress on the infrastructure than it can handle. You might be in for a very slow meal. But it will also be a very good meal.

14,Benno,★★★,2019-01-15,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/dining/benno-restaurant-review.html,NoMad,"Dated was the word one friend used after going to Benno, and if you’ve eaten there, too, you’ll know why. It’s as if the past 15 years in food never happened. The menu seems to be stuck in some time between 1994, when Thomas Keller bought the French Laundry, and 2004, when he opened Per Se with a young Jonathan Benno leading the kitchen. The restaurant will probably be a tough sell to those diners who expect all restaurants to fall on a continuum between Noma and the Salt Bae place. But I prefer it to any number of newer, self-consciously modern restaurants, some of which are so determined to be of the moment that they might as well have a time stamp. Benno is not trying to be contemporary. It’s trying to be delicious. And it is, from start to finish, almost without exception. Benno is the third of three dining operations that Mr. Benno opened last year in the Evelyn Hotel, on East 27th Street. It is the one where the prices, and presumably the stakes, are highest. We know it is a statement restaurant because Mr. Benno has put his name on it, for the first time in his career. Whatever the statement is, it is not forward-looking. Most of the statement is in French (barigoule, mousseline, tête de veau, béarnaise), a significant part is in Italian (carnaroli risotto, garganelli verde, pecorino ginepro) and not one word is in Danish or Mandarin. The statement has a lot to say on the topics of stocks and purées and accurate chopping and patient skimming; it is entirely silent on the subjects of fermented vegetables, or foraging, or immigration, or food deserts, or hashtags. The statement is delivered in a windowless hotel dining room to people sitting comfortably on black-leather chairs or velvet banquettes the color of a pinot noir from the Loire Valley. It takes the form of a fixed number of courses, three or four or five, your choice. One will be dessert and one a main course. None of them is a small plate meant for sharing. None is a large-format plate either, unless you count the veal sirloin chop that arrives on a silver platter in slices that are as pink and delicately shaded as the cheek on any blushing young aristocrat Fragonard ever painted. The presentations are not overly dramatic. They can be disarmingly modest, like the cold slice of fish terrine that appeared before the appetizers one night looking pale and somewhat lost. I barely noticed it. Then I tasted fennel and other bouillabaisse flavors and — excuse me, what was your name again? — I started to pay attention. It is not news that the liquid yolk of an egg tastes good trickled over baby leeks, fingerlings, black-truffle froth and pioppini mushrooms the size of shirt buttons. But just how good it is makes an interesting item. Lamb saddle, with grill marks that could come from a steakhouse, is served with fairytale eggplant and Thumbelina carrots. Each vegetable in this miniature garden is planted in a purée or a reduced essence of itself. Each is very good, and the carrots are fantastic. Alongside them sits lamb breast that has been pressed into a rich little brick coated in bread crumbs. One corner of this brick sits in a dark-green spread that tastes like gremolata. Not one combination of flavors on this plate is original, and it doesn’t matter at all. The Italian food that Mr. Benno made at his last restaurant, Lincoln Ristorante, could be impressive, but I sometimes had the sense that he was cooking from the outside in, trying to unlock the flavors of Italy through process and method. The results didn’t always match the evident effort. I still got a bit of that feeling from his food at Leonelli Taberna, in the back of the Evelyn lobby. It’s supposed to be the hotel’s casual Italian restaurant, and it would be if you didn’t sometimes catch the food trying to relax. Only a lasagna with green noodles below a dark field of browned béchamel seemed completely comfortable with itself. (On the streetside end of the hotel is a pastry shop and bakery selling two-foot-long flatbreads called focaccia that have more in common with Roman pizza al taglio.) The cooking at Benno, overseen by Justin Skribner, the chef de cuisine, doesn’t appear to be plagued by a similar anxiety. The French ideas, like a drum of pig’s trotter under a fried quail egg with flageolets and other beans, or the darkly seared duck breast with melting foie gras and a savory triangle of duck leg, dates and pistachios in brik pastry, have an easy inevitability. Pasta is unlikely to become the thing Benno is known for. Still, when the kitchen stretches to Italy, nice things happen. Lobster fra diavolo, with the bent shells called lumache, is a tribute to an American pop hit made over, in the Thomas Keller tradition, with maximum clarity and precision. Spaghetti made with grano arso, or burned-wheat flour, tasted pleasantly toasted rather than incinerated as it soaked up the liquor of tiny hard-shell clams and a soft mass of very fresh sea urchin roe. Technique never overplayed its hand in these dishes. The only time it came up short was when a drum of steelhead salmon poached in olive oil arrived slightly mushy and underdone. A week later, the fish was cooked more successfully. The scope of the Evelyn’s dining operation is big enough to support a full-time baker (Lisa Kalemkiarian, responsible for Benno’s needle-tipped mini-baguettes, among other items) and pastry chef (Lindsey Bittner, whose desserts include a rosemary flan with candied cranberries that I ordered every time I went, so I could watch other people try it for the first time). You couldn’t call the wine list dated, with its unwashed, uncombed natural types among other groomed, sedate numbers, and some fine values between $50 and $75 tiptoeing among the super-Tuscans and 2005 Bordeaux. All this should persuade some skeptics to give Benno a try. The restaurant’s greatest challenge is that the food seems to come from an era that’s too old to seem fresh but too recent to feel nostalgic about. When pop music is that age, we cringe. When buildings are that age, we knock them down before they can be landmarked. But sometimes one chef cooking what he believes is better than 10 chefs cooking what somebody else believes.

15,Bang Bar,★,2019-01-08,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/dining/momofuku-bang-bar-review.html,Midtown,"The fancy mall in the Time Warner Center known as the Shops at Columbus Circle has a lot to answer for. Its opening, in 2003, may have marked Manhattan’s capitulation to a retail landscape ruled by chains rather than independent, homegrown businesses. For diners, the mall is best known for its eating-and-drinking zone named, with matchless pretentiousness, the Restaurant Collection. This brought us Per Se and Masa, which overnight made the city’s other high-end restaurants seem as affordable as Veselka. It was the start of a new class of restaurants where dinner would be priced like a luxury good, with entry-level meals that today cost $300 or more. Much more, in Masa’s case. The purpose of this exclusivity was to signal to people with money to spend that they would be comfortable spending it in the Shops at Columbus Circle. For the same reason, businesses that were too far down-market were not welcome as tenants. This is why there’s a Whole Foods Market but not a Family Dollar. So those of us who follow David Chang’s mind along its switchbacks and cul-de-sacs have to wonder if he was being subversive when he decided to install Bang Bar, which is essentially a shawarma stand, on the mall’s third floor. Mr. Chang is a close observer of the ways society assigns high status to the food of some cultures and devalues the cooking of others. One of his greatest hits is a riff about New Yorkers who complain about $17 bowls of ramen while paying $30 for spaghetti. If he has a routine about vertical rotisseries I’ve never heard it, but surely he is alive to the associations they conjure, from Greek diners to taco trucks to the Halal Guys carts parked near Columbus Circle. If anybody grasps the cultural implications of bringing $6 street-meat sandwiches indoors where they can perfume the air breathed by consumers of Pink shirts and Floga furs, it is Mr. Chang. Bang Bar might make more sense as a provocation than a business concern. It begins serving at 8:30 a.m. and closes when the food is gone, usually by 1 or 2 p.m. In the weeks after its opening, on Halloween, the lines were worthy of the Department of Motor Vehicles. Employees tried to appease the horde by handing out off-the-menu snacks, like rice porridge with fermented shiitakes, and asking whimsical survey questions. (“Do you keep peanut butter in the fridge?”) After Mr. Chang opened a Momofuku Noodle Bar in the space next door, Bang Bar’s crowds grew somewhat more manageable, and when I showed up for breakfast at the end of December, there was no line at all. Maybe Deutsche Bank employees will keep Bang Bar’s early shift afloat, but right now its success seems to hinge on the lunch rush. There are two rotisseries. After 11 a.m., one spit is buried deep inside a missile of dark chicken marinated with a yakitori-style glaze. The other is at the center of a red, dripping, gochujang-rubbed tower of pork. Ideally, whichever meat you choose will have built up a dark outer bark that can be lopped off with a few knife strokes and stacked on to a disc of griddled flatbread. The bread, thicker than a tortilla and less oily than a roti, will be rolled tight, like a cigarette, then bent in half, with both open ends at the top. This is called, in Bang Bar parlance, a U. The chicken or pork can also be piled over a bowl of rice, but the bread is really very good. A close relative of the flatbread Mr. Chang’s crew originated at Majordomo in Los Angeles, it is perceptibly tangy and salted, without being salty. A couple of condiments — including habanero salsa and the brick-red Ssam Sauce used, in various iterations, to italicize Noodle Bar’s pork buns and a hundred other creations in Mr. Chang’s Momofuku restaurant group — are kept out on a counter alongside the moist towelettes. But they’re hard to apply once a U has been rolled. What I did want was a spoonful or two of raw white onions, some chopped cucumber, maybe parsley or cilantro — the kind of simple salad that is almost always lobbed into a shawarma or a doner kebab. Both the chicken and pork are slightly sweet, and could use a lift. The lunch menu also has two dips — a darkly fascinating, spicy eggplant spread, or whipped chickpeas whose sharp, pecorino-like flavor betrays the presence of Hozon, the fermented chickpea paste invented in a Momofuku laboratory. They are alluring enough, but the real reason to order them is the bread, puffier and softer than the one that wraps the U. A smaller version of this, maybe five inches across, is folded in half like a taco to make a “mini,” which replaces the U at breakfast. It is no great shock that this bread works nicely with smoked salmon and scallion cream cheese blended with just enough soy sauce to make it arguably Asian. It is more flavorful than a bagel and better at holding everything together. But it is somewhat surprising how delicious a freshly griddled mini is with caper-scallion cream cheese, salted cucumber, tomato and fresh dill inside. The whole thing tastes alive in a way that a bagel with a schmear of veggie cream cheese never will. I’ve saved the breakfast mini with mortadella for last, although it’s been the subject of the most rapt online attention. Building logs of mortadella layered with lardo and roasting them on spits is exactly the sort of thing the Momofuku group was put on this earth to do. I am glad this revolving meat torpedo exists. I respect Bang Bar’s cooks — this collaborative effort has no chef, Mr. Chang said in a phone interview — for realizing that the proper garnish for caramelized mortadella shavings is a slice of yellow American cheese and hot mustard. I appreciate the respect the sandwich pays to both fried baloney and Taylor Ham. And if I were in the habit of turning up at Columbus Circle with a hangover in the mornings, I would probably become a regular consumer of mortadella minis with Ssam Sauce. With a clear head and stomach, though, the saltiness can be a little too bracing. At either meal, Bang Bar offers a cinnamon roll modeled on the kkwabaegi, the twisted Korean doughnut stick. It is baked rather than fried, making it a rare example of a Momofuku dish that contains less fat than its inspiration. It is a fine pastry to have with Bang Bar’s Vietnamese coffee, even after you learn that the cream cheese icing contains fermented chickpeas. By the way, bang, or bbang or ppang, depending on how you like your Korean words transliterated, means bread. So this shawarma joint inside a mall is officially a bread bar, which makes sense given how pleasant the bread is. Still, I can’t help wondering how the people in charge of the Restaurant Collection felt about welcoming a place called Bang Bar.

16,Hwaban,★★,2018-12-31,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/dining/hwaban-korean-restaurant-review.html,Chelsea,"Americans who weren’t born into Korean cuisine have discovered it in many ways and many locales over the past decade or two. Bulgogi folded into tortillas has been handed out through the window of a roving truck. Smoked kimchi has been draped over pulled pork between halves of a cheese-glazed doughnut to make an outdoor food-stall sandwich called the Chonut. Hwe, raw fish eaten with condiments that typically spread across an entire table, has been streamlined to one or two bites in a tasting menu administered by servers in sci-fi tunics. The pork belly dish bo ssam has been reimagined as a whole roasted pork shoulder that a gang of hungry people could use in a bonding ritual involving heads of lettuce, a platter of oysters and a pair of tongs. More often than not, the audience for these items is young. Youth, in fact, has been a key part of the story of how kimchi and other dishes spread from immigrants’ kitchens to the Instagram feeds of diners without a single Korean ancestor. You might get a Chonut at Smorgasburg with your roommate, take down a bo ssam at Momofuku Ssam Bar with your friends from college and sit at Atomix’s U-shaped counter to celebrate your first anniversary. Hwaban, which opened in Chelsea in August, is something different. It’s the modern Korean restaurant where you’d take your mother. The dining room is spare, sleek and uncontroversial. The brick walls have a recent coat of white paint, and there is plenty of light by which to read the menus. The banquettes and benches have gentle curves and soothing neutral colors. The only vaguely menacing items in sight are the canteloupe-size eyeballs hanging on the walls, but they turn out to be high-tech speakers, and the cocktail jazz they play never rises above a murmur. Just inside the front door is a lattice of shelves holding simple, geometric bowls and teaware. These give Hwaban the look of a cloistered Parisian salon de thé, which it resembles in other ways as well. Exceptional green tea from South Korea is brewed along with tisanes — made from mulberry leaves, mistletoe stems or dried wild pears — that Korean mothers brew in winter for sneezing and sniffling children. And while some restaurants are saving money by doing without pastry chefs, Hwaban needs two of them to keep up with its obsession with Western-style sweets. One, Ahram Song, is a buttercream specialist who tints and shapes frosting into botanically detailed flower arrangements decorating chocolate or honey-pecan cakes. Another, Lauren Kim, makes the fleecy cheesecake that is carved into slivers the length of a dinner plate; pretty, well-tailored French numbers like a passion-fruit Pavlova or a drum of white cake filled with fresh strawberries and frosted with whipped cream; and the cookies and toffees that are sold by the box, for takeout. The illusion that you’ve wandered into a tearoom somewhere on the Right Bank is extended by the drinks list, which has only two Korean sojus and a handful of Japanese sakes but several pages of wines from France. The rest of the menu is unmistakably Korean, and very often it is based on Korean family cooking. “This is my mother’s recipe,” Mihyun Han, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Key Kim, will say on one of her frequent circuits around the tables. She said it one night about the shaggy white meatball of chicken, tofu and mushrooms — the menu calls it a dumpling — sitting in a warm and transfixing soy-milk broth. Another time, she was talking about what she calls “snowy bibimbap,” a gentle, agreeable wintertime variation on the classic rice dish made with strands of mung bean jelly and shaved burdock, bellflower root, and other vegetables in shades of ivory, cream and bone. The chef, Woong Jang, does very fine work in white. One of Hwaban’s most luxurious dishes is a length of king crab leg with spinach and a poached egg, all surrounded in a rich pine-nut sauce the color of hotel sheets. Like the Manhattan restaurants Atomix and Jungsik, Hwaban de-emphasizes the sweeter and spicier side of the Korean palate so other flavors can come through. Coins of poached pollock roe are sliced over a block of soft tofu in a clear, subtle dried-seafood broth. Soy-braised abalone is served in an anchovy broth that is, if not exactly subtle, at least soft-spoken. One of two pork belly dishes on the menu involves ssamjang, the potent soy-chile paste now sold in supermarkets throughout the land, but the other does not. In that one, you eat a slice of simmered pork belly together with a pickled mushroom and a square of cabbage kimchi. There is, of course, a sharp little kick to the spicy fish stew known as maeun-tang, and a fair amount of chile paste in the daktori-tang, a spin on the classic braised chicken and vegetable dish, both of which Mr. Jang makes very well. But there is also the surprise of tasting ginger and carrots along with the chiles in a bright orange sauce for seared salmon. Ms. Han and Mr. Kim also own Kosaka, a chiaroscuro lair for omakase sushi on West 13th Street. I was a little put off by how active the servers were there; just as I was focusing on the piece of fish in front of me, somebody would dart in at one elbow or the other to ask how I was enjoying it all. The service style is similar at Hwaban, but it plays better there. A meal at Hwaban is also about three times less expensive, at $55 for an appetizer and two main courses. The mains are served at the same time, which Ms. Han says is her attempt to reproduce the abundance of Korean family tables like her mother’s. Her mother also gets credit for the two-sided fritters of minced shrimp pressed against zucchini coins on the short à la carte menu. They’re served with a crisp pair of fried shrimp and little cubes of jelly that melt into dipping sauce on contact with the warm fritters. The same soy jelly accompanies a kimchi-jeon that’s topped with browned mozzarella — in other words, a kimchi pizza. It would fit right in at Smorgasburg.

17,Bluebird London,0 star,2018-12-18,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/dining/bluebird-london-review.html,Midtown,"Something seems to be going wrong at Bluebird London, the busily programmed 10,500-square-foot restaurant that the mall in the Time Warner Center imported from England in September. Maybe the people in charge have been taking management cues from Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, which has approached its Brexit plan like a class of first graders trying to build a working jet airplane out of Lego pieces and a flying-squirrel sock puppet. Or maybe the mess back home has just sapped the restaurant’s spirit. Whatever the cause, what was meant to be a cheerful gift from London has turned into the Bluebird of Unhappiness. Sir Terence Conran opened the original Bluebird in 1997 inside an Art Deco garage built on King’s Road in Chelsea for the Bluebird Motor Company. It was one of his “gastrodomes,” those soaring complexes like Quaglino’s and Bibendum that embedded restaurants within a busy hive of shops, cafes and bars. The gastrodomes’ designs were talked about more often and more enthusiastically than their menus, which aimed for unthreatening familiarity. The current owners, D & D London, have managed to keep the London Bluebird in circulation by changing upholstery and chefs, but it is not at all clear why they or the Time Warner Center believed that a Bluebird clone would play in Manhattan in 2018. True, the retail shop has been dropped. But up front, next to the desk where the hosts have mastered the art of checking reservations without making eye contact, is a cafe-slash-wine bar. A glass case there serves as a temporary prison for aging pastries and tragic snacks. Beyond is a lounge followed by a bar, the centerpiece of which is an enormous plexiglass sculpture of a ponytailed woman’s head that doubles as a shelf for weird liqueurs. Just before the ramp that descends to the main dining room is a console with two turntables which, a note on the website says menacingly, are operated on weekends by “live DJs.” At other times, the restaurant stages such events as a workshop in the art of making “a seriously chic wreath.” The poster-size menus drawn up by Nicolas Houlbert, the chef, cram so much copy onto a single page, and are organized so randomly, that they are best approached as if you were doing a word search, by unfocusing the eyes and waiting until the letters organize themselves into recognizable patterns. Look, here’s butternut squash soup. This must be fluke — no, fluke crudo. Long Island. Burrata. Long Island burrata? When you have finished the puzzle, please savor the warm feeling of accomplishment for a moment, because it goes away once the food arrives. The “crispy shrimp” have the limp, expired quality of tempura that’s been doing laps all night at a conveyor-belt sushi place. Yellowfin tuna poke has been tossed onto a big, damp heap of unseasoned quinoa, which must be there to soak up any seasoning that accidentally attaches itself to the fish. At lunch there is a lobster Cobb salad with lettuce and round, red objects that are probably supposed to be tomatoes. Because you are in an English restaurant, you will be curious about the English food. Because you are in Bluebird London, you will regret this. A prawn and monkfish curry is presented on a thali with mango chutney, basmati rice and paratha, which run the gamut from unnecessarily sweet to ridiculously sweet. The fish half of fish and chips is golden and crisp on the ends but pale and soggy in the middle. At least the minted peas that come with it are crunchy. This is more than can be said for the potato chips that come with an order of beef tartare. They are pale, cobweb-colored, not fresh, and undercooked so they sag and fall apart beneath any amount of beef. The tartare, by the way, is seasoned with ketchup, which is not as wrong as you might think. If something comes with a pastry crust, exercise caution. On top of an allegedly Cornish chicken pie, sealing in dry chicken and mushrooms coated in grease that is trying its best to be mistaken for sauce, is a dome of puff pastry; it doesn’t taste like butter or salt, but it is cooked. The thicker crust around a farmhouse pork terrine, served with a chill that brought out its Spammy qualities, is on its way to being cooked. The very, very thick football of crust encasing beef Wellington is cooked only on the surface; deep inside, where it meets the tenderloin, is a mass of wet, gluey dough. This costs $95 and will serve two people, both of whom had better like the taste of raw flour. All is not doom and gloom in the pastry department, though. The pull-apart cheese straws are thick, puffy and warm, bronzed on top with baked Montgomery’s Cheddar. Most of the sweets are likable, particularly the cube of sticky toffee pudding and the wedge of Bakewell tart with a layer of orange marmalade between the frangipane and the pastry shell. The only real hazard on the dessert menu is the barely congealed Pimm’s jelly at which somebody has hurled fistfuls of chopped cucumbers and strawberries. It’s like a stray plate of salad that you might pick up at a party before you realized that somebody had dumped the warm dregs of a drink into it. The servers seemed eager to oblige, but gave the impression of struggling in the face of unseen enemies. One night, asked “Still or sparkling?,” I chose the sparkling water. My server began to walk away, then turned on his heel and said, “I’m sorry, we’re all out of sparkling.” “That’s fine,” I said. “I’ll just have the BrewDog I.P.A. instead.” “I apologize,” he said. “We don’t have any draft beer.” After the main course was cleared, I asked him for the Chocolate Bluebird. “That is our signature dessert,” he said. I nodded. I had read that this was a chocolate mousse inside a blue-chocolate shell in the shape of a vintage racecar once made by the Bluebird Motor Company. “Unfortunately, we do not have it tonight,” he said. His courtesy went a long way. Ultimately, though, I preferred the blunt approach that one of the bartenders took with one of my guests. Looking over the long list of old and new cocktails, she asked the bartender which he would recommend. “If you want to drink something that tastes good,” he said, “I wouldn’t order anything off our menu.” Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.",What If Brexit Were a Restaurant?,"['something', 'seems', 'going', 'wrong', 'bluebird', 'london', 'busily',

18,The Four Seasons Restaurant,★,2018-12-04,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/dining/four-seasons-review.html,Midtown,"There is a good case to be made for not reviewing the newly relocated Four Seasons Restaurant at all but just leaving it on the slush pile, and that case can be found in court records involving Julian Niccolini. Mr. Niccolini has operated the restaurant with Alex von Bidder since the mid-1990s, first at its original home in the Seagram Building and now, after a two-year hiatus, in a smaller berth on the other side of Park Avenue. Over that time, he has frequently been celebrated for his charm. Less frequently, he has been a defendant in civil and criminal actions arising from things he was accused of having done to women inside the restaurant. In 1991, one of his waitresses sued Mr. Niccolini and the Four Seasons, citing sexual harassment. She claimed that for more than three years he had repeatedly rubbed up against her, told her in vulgar terms about his sexual urges and called her “slut,” “lesbian” and other things. Mr. Niccolini denied the charges. In 2014, a former assistant manager filed suit against Mr. Niccolini, Mr. von Bidder and the Four Seasons, alleging discrimination. The ex-manager said that after she returned from a maternity leave, the restaurant made it difficult for her to pump breast milk during work hours and, about three months later, fired her and replaced her with a man. In a response filed with the court, the defendants denied the allegations. Both suits were settled under terms that have not been divulged. In 2015, Mr. Niccolini was arrested on a felony charge of sexual abuse. According to a prosecutor, he had attacked a woman at the Four Seasons bar “with such force that he ripped her bra open and caused significant scratch marks on her back and bruising on her hip.” After pleading guilty the following year to a reduced charge of misdemeanor assault, Mr. Niccolini was given a “conditional discharge,” avoiding jail. I know people who will never eat at the Four Seasons because they don’t want to give Mr. Niccolini their money. I understand this. I also know people in the food media who think the Four Seasons should not get any coverage as long as Mr. Niccolini owns a piece of it. I understand this, too, but it’s not my view. [Julian Niccolini has since been forced to resign from the restaurant.] Their stance rests, I think, on the idea that writing about powerful men who have been accused of abusing women amounts to condoning the abuse and helping the abusers stay in power. While it’s true that media attention is often like oxygen to restaurants, critics have the power to tell a story other than the one the restaurant is pushing. Even when we’re not writing a pan, a fair assessment often requires weaving shining threads with ugly ones. The ugliest threads at the Four Seasons happen to be ugly enough to make many people stay away. But there is beauty in the fabric, too. The Four Seasons has been a significant force in dining: a pioneer in championing American ingredients and wine; an innovator in bringing contemporary design into the restaurant world; a cultivator of an eclectic scene that treated political power, financial success and creative talent as coequal branches of a high society that was peculiar to New York. Most of this happened some time ago. In its last years in the Seagram Building, the Four Seasons had become a shabby but lovely museum of midcentury architecture and design, with martinis that I didn’t mind overpaying for and food that I did. I was curious about its new incarnation, which opened in August, and curiosity is as good a reason as any for a critic to swing into action. If I were writing the next chapter in a long history, I’d mention how gracefully Diego Garcia has grown into his new job as the restaurant’s chef. I enjoyed Mr. Garcia’s fish cookery at his last restaurant, a small, bare-bones place in Hell’s Kitchen called Gloria, but he seemed limited by the kitchen’s size. He works on a grander scale now, with more expensive ingredients and more delicate treatments that still betray his creative streak. He roasts duck because the Four Seasons is famous for it, and makes fresh pasta and risotto because the captains in their black jackets need some place to shave all those white truffles. For all intents and purposes, though, he has turned the Four Seasons into a seafood restaurant, and a very good one. It’s not hard to believe he was once a sous-chef at Le Bernardin when you taste, say, the raw scallop slivers in citrus juices, elegantly equipped with tart apple and caviar, or the intensely smooth chowder of tiny, just-cooked clams in a New England-style cream broth that’s pale yellow with butterfat. He knows when to show restraint and when to go all in, taking sea-urchin ravioli that are already head-spinningly rich and draping lobes of sea urchin over them. Some of the cooking is boring in the right way. I don’t want surprises in Dover sole à la meunière, and I didn’t get any. It was flawless. The duck will surprise only people who don’t know that duck meat cooked to well-done bastes in its own fat until it is almost a warm confit. Other dishes were boring in the usual sense. The mustard sauce poured around the golden crab cake tasted like cream that was shown a picture of a mustard jar. The chapter would also depict the return of Bill Yosses. Anybody who ate his desserts before he disappeared into the White House won’t be surprised by how good they are here. They do have a slight Rip Van Winkle quality, suggesting that Mr. Yosses allowed several new waves in pastry to pass him by, but that’s no criticism. He makes a better baba au rhum than almost anyone in town, his chocolate tart with a salted stripe of caramel is both powerful and precise, and his hazelnut financier balanced over roasted pears is more delicious than almost any almond financier you can find. He has even improved the restaurant’s signature, the Kate Pierson beehive of cotton candy that sails out to the tables of valued guests. (Apparently I’ve joined that club.) This being the Four Seasons, the history would have to mention the new restaurant’s interior. It reminded me of the old Philip Johnson dining rooms without making me sad to be here instead of there, a trick I had thought was impossible. The bronze bead curtains have transformed into strings of gilded glass baubles; the flatware and glasses pay homage to the vintage designs used at the original restaurant; and the bar is once again a four-sided island in the middle of a lounge. For the first time you can eat a real meal there, while you watch the Grand Central-bound commuters outside and the cotton candy-bound regulars inside, generally a mature group in tightly knotted ties or heels that echo down the corridor to the dining room like the ticking of a grandfather clock. All of this and a generous budget (the prices are as exclusionary as ever) could make for a few hours of celebratory sightseeing of a kind that is quickly disappearing from the city. The Four Seasons offers an escape from the outside world. Escaping from what’s inside, however, takes a mental effort that is beyond me and will probably be beyond many others as well, whether Mr. Niccolini is in sight or not. During my three meals, I never saw him. Restaurants, even grand ones like the Four Seasons, are intimate places; eating is an act that requires trust and a sense of safety. We want to get up from the table feeling restored on all fronts except the financial one. Mr. Niccolini’s actions have done serious damage to his power to provide that feeling, even as he and Mr. von Bidder have made the restaurant better than it has been in years. This review will not be tied up with a bow. All I have are threads. Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.",The Four Seasons Returns.

19,Saint Julivert Fisherie,★,2018-11-27,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/dining/saint-julivert-fisherie-review.html,Cobble Hill,"Alex Raij and Eder Montero met while working in the kitchen of a sprawling, impersonal, gloomy modern-Spanish restaurant that lasted about two years. They went on to get married and, as joint chefs and owners, opened a string of compact, intimate, slinky modern-Spanish restaurants that are still in business. Their one misfire was a small, intimate non-Spanish coffee shop in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. After dusting themselves off, they replaced the cafe tables with taller and longer ones, traded the pastry cases for a bar, installed a stripe of backlighted glass blocks that cast a subaqueous glow on the room, and in September reopened as Saint Julivert Fisherie. And what is a fisherie, you ask, having quickly consulted your French, Spanish and English dictionaries and found no such word? Saint Julivert is my first, but if it is anything to go by, then a fisherie is a seafood establishment that aspires to be more than a raw bar but does not want to be mistaken for a full-bore restaurant. Wines come mostly from coastal regions (and are organized by the nearest body of salt water). Small plates abound. And if you guessed that they are something like the tapas that Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero explore at El Quinto Pino, Txikito and La Vara, but without the running Spanish theme, you are not far off. Not that the menu is entirely un-Spanish. The octopus carpaccio from Txikito makes a special guest appearance at Saint Julivert Fisherie, the way the Fresh Prince once turned up on an episode of “Blossom.” Under marjoram leaves and pinprick grains of Espelette pepper, the carpaccio is as good as you remember; the warm plate halfway melts the fattier bits of octopus into delicious goo. There is another cameo: El Quinto Pino’s very fine combination of pink-fleshed anchovies with cold vanilla butter. The butter soothes the anchovies the way the vermouth in a martini helps the gin settle down. (On a related topic, the short cocktail list includes a deceptively soft-spoken number called the Kanpai Martini. It’s a variation on the Vesper, which itself is the amended martini that Ian Fleming had James Bond order in “Casino Royale.”) At times Saint Julivert reminds me of Cal Pep, in Barcelona, Spain, whose plain, cramped counter looks like the last place in the world where you are going to have an epiphany of the taste buds, right up until the moment the txipirones and thumbtack-size clams knock you off your barstool. Like Cal Pep, and unlike nearly every other New York restaurant, Saint Julivert serves gooseneck barnacles when they’re available, boiling them with bay leaves and salt and mounding them on a cloth napkin before they cool so that when you twist the wrinkled sheath of skin away from the sweet, edible meat inside there is a good chance somebody in the vicinity will get hit with a squirt of hot barnacle juice. Mostly, though, any Spanish-ness in Saint Julivert has more to do with its spirit than its recipes, which come from all over: the deep-fried Puerto Rican cylinders of cornmeal known as sorrullitos; a kanpachi collar whose juicy meat is shockingly white under a black rub of jerk spices; tender slices of warm beef tenderloin on a fist-size roll, known in Portugal as a prego sandwich. There is also the crispy tuna bake, a peculiarly satisfying hybrid that crosses a tuna noodle casserole by way of India with fideuà, the Spanish dish that treats pasta like the rice in paella. The noodles, short ridged tubes, are toasted and cooked with oil-cured tuna in a tomato sauce that is seasoned with turmeric and curry leaves. It is one of the most fearless, not to mention filling, dishes on a menu that could use a little more of both qualities. Although Saint Julivert works with exceptional seafood, and treats it with the care that fans of Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero have come to expect, the menu plays it safe more often than it should. Like all of the couple’s restaurants, Saint Julivert toggles between innovation and tradition. But the other places explore Spanish cuisine, so when they toss off a straight-ahead classic like patatas bravas, there’s a reason. When Saint Julivert serves fluke ceviche or a crab and avocado salad dressed with yuzu juice and trout roe, it can seem to be grasping at ideas that other restaurants are already doing — even when Saint Julivert does them better. The sautéed skate splashed with Manzanilla could not be fresher or more skillfully browned, but do the garlic chips and sliced dried chiles on top make this version of a well-known standard one I’ll remember a month from now? Maybe not, although at the time I was very happy to have it, not least because it was one of the few things on the menu the size of a standard main course. Even if you’re an old hand at navigating the shallow waters of small plates, it can be unnervingly easy to spend more than $100 on food and drinks at Saint Julivert and still wonder whether you’ve actually had dinner. Seafood this good is expensive, but the menu doesn’t stray very far above $20; the result is that portions can seem somewhat airy. When there’s an inexpensive opportunity to pad out a dish, Saint Julivert doesn’t always take it. I understand why I can’t have more than three excellent wild shrimp in a $21 bowl of red pozole, but couldn’t there be more than a spoonful of hominy kernels? Saltines fried in canola oil are served with the ceviche and with a cold and highly appealing bowl of pickled shrimp under pink pickled onions; grilled bread slices accompany the mackerel whipped into a hummus-like orange spread with piri-piri oil. Still, each time I went, somebody at my table asked for more bread. None of Saint Julivert’s issues are insoluble. The lighting could be warmed up so the room looks less like an aquarium. A few more dishes you won’t see anywhere else, like the tuna bake, would make it harder to resist. Another two or three large plates would make it a place you think of when you’re hungry. The excellent $19 prego sandwich is more snack than dinner, until you pay another $7 to have fried oysters tucked into the roll beside the beef, making it into a kind of crunchy carpetbagger. On the other hand, that’s worth doing even if you’re not hungry.

20,Adda Indian Canteen,★★,2018-11-20,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/dining/adda-indian-canteen-review.html,Long Island City,"Something has been missing from New York’s current Indian restaurant scene, but I wasn’t sure what it was until I ate the kaleji masala at Adda Indian Canteen in Long Island City, Queens. Modernization is the theme unifying many of the Indian restaurants that have taken root around the city over the past few years. At the rarefied end of the spectrum, we have Indian Accent bringing the cuisine into line with the intricate techniques and plating that can land restaurants on the itineraries of list-clutching gastrotourists. At the populist end, we’ve seen Indian cooking gastro-pubbed by Babu Ji and other new places that try to make non-desis feel at home with house-party vibes, beer in a self-service fridge, and dishes like naan pizzas and samosa burgers. New York hasn’t seen nearly as many recently opened restaurants devoted to the pure, original stuff that is getting modernized. The snacks pitched together in a blur by hawkers at folding tables and rolling carts by the side of the road; the gravy-soaked stews and sauceless dry curries patiently made from 25 or so vegetables and seasonings, all of them chopped, ground, fried and simmered at home by those keepers of the culinary flame known collectively as the aunties — we’ve seen interpretations of this food, squeezed from eyedroppers and prepared for their photo shoots with edible flowers. But new places cooking the genuine article have been scarce. There is a problem of missing context here; twists on tradition don’t really resonate when tradition is hard to find in its untwisted form. And for anyone who truly loves Indian cooking, there is a more pressing problem of missing flavor. Five dots of tandoori-spice oil just won’t land on the taste buds with the impact of a full plate of charred and steaming tandoori chicken, no matter how evenly spaced those dots are. I hadn’t given much thought to either problem, to tell the truth, until I made it to the out-of-the-way patch of Long Island City where Adda Indian Canteen operates. This is not the part of that neighborhood where high-rise apartments grow overnight and Amazon will soon tiptoe in with 25,000 employees. Adda is east of all that, under a National Guard recruiting office, surrounded by a thicket of railroad tracks and highway overpasses. Unless you are looking for it, you are not likely to end up in the small dining room, in which Indian tabloids have been upcycled as wallpaper. Once I’d found it, one of the first things I ate was the kaleji masala, chicken livers in a dark gravy seasoned with fresh ginger and garam masala. Right away I realized that this was the kind of Indian food the city has been hungry for, or at least the kind that I’d been hungry for: made with care but no pretense; seasoned for people who love the interplay of spices; presented without apology in all its brown, lumpy glory; and complex in ways that demand full attention. Adda (ah DAH) Indian Canteen was opened in September by Roni Mazumdar, who owns it, and Chintan Pandya, who is the chef. The two men already run Rahi, in Greenwich Village, perhaps the best of the casual, modernizing Indian restaurants, where Mr. Pandya serves original notions like tandoori skate and sends almost everything out of the kitchen decorated with edible flowers. They’ve taken another angle at Adda, mining family recipes and the lessons Mr. Pandya absorbed from civilian cooks around India. The menu travels beyond the standard north Indian dishes most New Yorkers already know, but even those dishes, when they appear, are prepared so emphatically that they don’t resemble anything else in town. Adda is a lusty, full-throated defense of traditional cooking. Saag paneer, the grayest of old gray mares in many Indian restaurants, is coltishly energetic at Adda. The cheese is made in the kitchen, and it’s gorgeously soft, while the saag is a tart and peppery mix of wilted arugula, sorrel, spinach and mustard greens. Mr. Pandya does very well by the class of sidewalk treats called chaat. Each delivers the messy riot you’d hope for, busy with crunchy hieroglyphs of fried noodles and splattered with yogurt and tamarind sauce. One chaat is anchored by a big kale fritter, another by several smaller chips of battered, spiced lentil cakes, and a third by fried smashed potatoes and chickpeas. But discerning chaat lovers should probably go directly to the dahi batata puri, soft potato packed into hollow globes of fried dough that you can pick up and eat with your fingers, like chocolates. Anything that passes through Adda’s tandoor is worth investigating. Seekh kebabs, made with lamb that’s coarsely ground by hand, come out of the tandoor juicier and pinker than the usual; Mumbai-style tandoori macchi, a skewered pompano rubbed with ground mustard seeds and cilantro, is lightly charred and smoky after roasting, but still moist; bhatti da murgh, a double-marinated chicken thigh and drumstick, is so thickly crusted with coriander and cumin that it crunches when you bite it. My server expressed an enthusiasm about the poussin — plunged into the tandoor in one piece after marinating in vinegar, yogurt, fresh red chiles and kala namak, the sulfurous black salt of India — that you typically find in new converts to a cult. After tasting it, I was ready to join. He was enthusiastic about almost everything, as it turned out; the service at Adda is nothing if not eager to talk up the food. (Getting your water glass refilled is another story.) Placing a dish of yogurt and pomegranate seeds next to the goat biryani that is steamed under a lid of dough, he said, “This is going to be your best friend when the spice in the biryani starts to hit you.” It was, in fact, one of the fiercest biryanis I’ve ever met, and the yogurt tamed it so that I could taste the tender goat meat and crisp, bittersweet fried onions. Few things on the menu are quite as chile-drenched as the biryani, but Mr. Pandya definitely favors India’s more intense flavors. Adda is not big on soft-spoken cream sauces; the coconut milk in the Malvani prawn curry from the South Konkan coast, for instance, has a pronounced kick. (It’s very good if you get it on a night when the prawns are firm and not spongy.) And while Adda does serve some vegetables, it would not make my list of the 20 best local Indian restaurants for vegetarians. It would, however, be the place I’d send you if you want to know how good Delhi butter chicken can be. Or if you don’t yet believe that rara gosht, chunks of lamb stewed on the bone with spiced minced lamb, is not redundant but luxurious. And Adda is the first restaurant I’d tell you about if you woke up one morning hungry for bheja fry, goat brains cooked with onions, ginger and a considerable number of fresh green chiles. “Like soft scrambled eggs,” our server said, accurately. I might point out that a typical Indian bheja fry is drier, with a higher ratio of brains to sauce. But I would not necessarily mean that as a complaint.

21,Misi,★★★,2018-11-13,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/dining/misi-restaurant-review.html,Williamsburg,"Almost everybody is calling Misi, the latest endeavor from the chef Missy Robbins, a pasta restaurant. That’s not quite right. Yes, Ms. Robbins has given half of her menu over to long noodles and short ones; strands of linguine with chopped garlic and a double dose of fish in the form of chopped anchovies and drizzled colatura; circles filled with ricotta whipped until it is as soft as cream; pinched rings of tortelli stuffed with mascarpone and spinach; the deeply ridged Sardinian shells known as malloreddus; and other Italian marvels of starch formation. True, anybody who has been to Ms. Robbins’s other restaurant, Lilia, also located in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, knows that the pasta there reliably steals the show from everything else on the table. When those people show up at Misi, odds are good that they will not have chosen that day to start a keto diet. Moreover, Misi has a greater variety of pasta than Lilia, so many that the architecture makes space for them. Misi is across the street from the old Domino refinery on the East River, where the cranes used to unload sugar from barges in the open air so that on days when the wind was right you could taste it on your tongue a mile away. Next to the dining room, facing the factory’s remains, is a separate, glassed-in workshop where the temperature and humidity are kept at consistent dough-friendly levels. There, the long noodles, etc., are rolled out and cut long before 5:30 each night, when Misi’s front door is unlocked and the crowd waiting in line for walk-in seats begins to snake eagerly forward. And to be sure, if you watch Ms. Robbins and her kitchen crew at the end of one of two long dining counters, you’ll see the same quick motion over and over: an almost surreptitiously quick trip of hand to mouth, a sharp bite and an appraising chew to decide if that batch of pasta is ready to be pulled from the water. Some chefs show their mastery over pasta by pressing it thinner than a screen protector for an iPhone. Ms. Robbins likes hers to have body and heft, and the chew test is the most reliable way to tell when thick pasta like that is ready. You are very unlikely to get a piece that is undercooked at its core, or one that doesn’t fight back enough to let you know it is still alive. You get this just-in-between texture in the stubs of mezze rigatoni with a simple, glossy, ripe tomato sauce that’s been stewed with whole garlic cloves — 30 to a batch, according to the menu. You get it again in the corzetti, discs about the diameter of a Red Bull can that are pressed with a wooden stamp to give them a target pattern. In October, Misi served these ridged coins with another tomato sauce, this one barely cooked, just some Sungold tomatoes warmed until they broke open and their yellow pulp spilled out. Fresh basil, thyme and chervil were scattered over the top, as good an illustration as any of how Ms. Robbins makes her food stand out without deviating from an Italian reliance on simple, unmanipulated ingredients. But to call Misi a pasta restaurant would be to overlook its highly impressive work with vegetables. They are the subject of the menu’s other half, sneakily headlined “antipasti.” This is where you will find a globe eggplant roasted until it is as soft and easy to spread as cream cheese; the cut surfaces are dressed with Calabrian chiles, and the taste of lemon juice seems to have found its way to the center of the eggplant. There are fleshy and firm chanterelles, too, lightly pickled and preserved in olive oil until they’re brought to the table crisscrossed with rosemary needles. Grilled runner beans with garlic and chiles have been around lately, too, in a big heap that I would have enjoyed more if a few stringy, leathery beans had not gotten past the inspectors in the kitchen. Like the pastas, Misi’s vegetables tend to bring together only a few ingredients, often applied in ways you don’t quite expect. I don’t know where else you will taste pistachios and anchovies combined with skinny, leaf-bud-green leeks marinated in vinegar, or a kind of panzanella made with grilled bread, capers, fresh oregano and chunks of zucchini that are still tender after a quick poaching in olive oil. And though the gently roasted tomatoes won’t come back to the menu until next summer, you can try imagining how their dusting of fennel seeds and cracked coriander seeds responds to a last-minute squirt of spicy honey. There are enough of these vegetables, and enough meatless pastas, that a vegetarian could eat extremely well at Misi just by watching out for things like bottarga and staying away entirely from the creamy pork sugo tossed with strangozzi. (Meat eaters, on the other hand, may find the sugo helps restore chafed nerves.) Although Misi doesn’t let its kitchen range as widely as Lilia’s, it is a more successful restaurant in several ways. The menu has been distilled down to essentials, and the whole enterprise seems more carefully thought through. The restaurant is on the ground floor of a new apartment building by SHoP Architects, who chose to leave a hole in the middle that you could fly a helicopter through. The developer, Two Trees, recruited Ms. Robbins and her business partner, Sean Feeney, and gave them a chance to build the virgin space to their needs. The acoustics are better than at Lilia, and traffic between tables flows more smoothly. The interior is unusually good, with narrow horizontal wall tiles in white and nooks for stacked plates that make them part of the décor. As at Lilia, the wine list practically begs you to take something new for a whirl: a catarratto from Sicily, a Corsican niellucciu, or a croatina-ughetta blend from Lombardy softened with some uva rara. Of course, you could stick to a $45 Lambrusco, or get a $250 Champagne from David Léclapart, after which you can try flying through the hole in the building yourself. If we are striving for total accuracy, though, we need to call Misi a pasta-vegetables-and-gelato restaurant. Its gelato is made in house; there are about six kinds at any given moment. The flavors open up right away, in part because Misi serves them just below the melting point and in part because the ingredients are used prodigally. There are a lot of almonds in the almond, and the espresso could keep you up an extra hour. But even the unflavored fior di latte, made with milk, cream and sugar, comes at you in a rush. There are no desserts other than gelato. The only decision to make at the end of the night is which one you’re going to have.",Misi Is Much More Than a Pasta Restaurant,"['almost', 'everybody', 'calling', 'misi', 'latest', 'endeavor',

22,Mama’s Too,★,2018-11-06,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/06/dining/mamas-too-review.html,Upper West Side,"For most of its time on earth, the New York slice has not been seen as a product that needed tinkering. Yes, pizza in the city has been accessorized with toppings from crayfish (not bad) to Buffalo chicken (hmm) to Caesar salad (no, no, no, no, no). But the foldable, portable triangles of cheese, sauce and dough themselves were generally held to be a natural resource that was perfect as is, much like the soft, unfiltered city tap water claimed to be the source of their excellence. Some pizzerias try to make a better slice. Very few try to make a different slice. Mama’s Too makes a different slice. It combines some of the most appealing elements of a Neapolitan pie with the most satisfying aspects of the archetypal product sold on paper plates from sidewalk windows. It is as if Frank Tuttolomondo, the owner and pie architect of this informal but very serious pizzeria on the Upper West Side, has learned how to genetically modify pizza. The bulge of crust at the edge of what Mama’s Too calls the “house slice” is brown, more rough than smooth and baked to a ferocious crackle. You could tear it off and enjoy it on its own, or maybe with butter or olive oil, just as you can with the best Neapolitans. Yet the flat layer of crust on the bottom is firm, without the soupy center of the Neapolitan style. True to New York form, you can hold it in the air by the curved rim and it will stay flat and parallel to the floor. As they do at Totonno’s and some other brick-oven pizzerias, Mr. Tuttolomondo lays the cheese down before the sauce. Rather than drippy, milky discs of fresh mozzarella, though, he covers the raw dough (after priming it with olive oil) in shreds of a slice-friendly variety that is known in the trade as low-moisture mozzarella and that the rest of us call pizza cheese. Over this, he ladles a few blots of tomato pulp. This helps the crust to bake through without getting soggy, keeps the cheese from sliding off the crust, and most of all lets you taste the tomatoes, which are very good. You could, I suppose, think of the house slice as a white pizza with tomato-sauce topping. After the pie comes out of the oven, Mr. Tuttolomondo sprinkles it with grated two-year-old Parmigiano-Reggiano. Basil leaves are the last to go on. At this point, you can pay, walk out the door and amble toward Broadway and 106th Street cradling your slice in a paper plate and taking bites as you go. In other words, you can have the traditional sidewalk pizza experience, but you will be tasting flavors you normally find only in high-minded sit-down pizzerias like Sorbillo, Ops or Una Pizza Napoletana. Those bloodhounds who follow the city’s melted-mozzarella trail will recognize that Mama’s Too is part of a great reawakening of slice culture. Unlike brick-oven pizza, which came from Europe and relied on preindustrial technology, the New York slice is a lowly American hybrid. It is baked in gas ovens, and the sheer number of places selling it suggests that it requires no special skill. When it is praised, we don’t talk about its artisanal roots; we call it the humble slice, the street-corner slice, the slice of the common man and woman. The ordinary slice and its heftier cousin, the Sicilian-style square, were probably first rehabilitated with superior ingredients and a sophisticated understanding of baking by Best Pizza in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, in 2010. Today, serious pizza hobbyists talk about their favorite slices by reeling off the dough’s rising time and hydration levels. North Brooklyn is still the center of the neoclassical slice movement, with L’Industrie and Williamsburg Pizza and, most recently, Paulie Gee’s Slice Shop in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, but the forward-thinking slice is found in Manhattan, too, at Scarr’s on the Lower East Side and Corner Slice in the Gotham West Market. The goal of the neoclassicists is, essentially, to return to the golden age of New York takeout pizza, which survives at places like Di Fara in Midwood, Brooklyn, one of the holy sites of the neoclassical church. Paulie Gee’s Slice Shop, Scarr’s and other neoclassicist joints cultivate a self-consciously vintage atmosphere, styling their logos and signs and interiors so they look like a place where Johnny Boy and Charlie in “Mean Streets” might have gone for a pepperoni slice and a Coke. Mr. Tuttolomondo does not fetishize the past. Perhaps this is because he lived it. For almost 60 years his family has owned a series of old-school slice joints in the neighborhood. The current incarnation is literally on a street corner, at the intersection of 106th Street and Amsterdam Avenue. It is called Mama’s Pizza. He didn’t open Mama’s Too a block away to outdo his parents; he’s bringing their product into a new era. If the neoclassicists are like the folk revivalists who collected old acoustic 78s, he is Dylan at the Newport Folk Festival in 1965. When Mama’s Too opened in December, it also served housemade pasta. It’s still on the menu board that hangs on one wall, but Mr. Tuttolomondo has stopped serving it to concentrate on pizza. Besides the house slice, he also makes squares that he sees as a marriage of rectangular Sicilian pizza with Roman pizza al taglio. The crust is much taller than the Roman style, and taller than some Sicilians, too, but it is airy and chewy. On the bottom it has the bronze color, the cratered surface and the pan-fried crunch of the bread on a grilled cheese sandwich. The edges, where the dough meets the pan, have a gold fringe of browned cheese, known among students of pizza styles as a “frico crust.” This fringe is, of course, crunchy and delicious. The most impressive square is, I think, the pepperoni. Unlike most of the others, it incorporates tomato sauce. The mozzarella is baked until it begins to brown. The pepperoni slices are small and concave, like contact lenses made of meat. Crunchy around the rims, these little cups are half-filled with spicy red oil. It may sound as if I approached this slice with cool, analytical detachment. The truth is I ripped into it like a pack of hyenas. The other squares tend to be white pies with toppings. Again, tomato sauce is one of the toppings. In one case it’s a thick and creamy layer of vodka sauce, one of the ideas that separates Mama’s Too from the neoclassicists. Mr. Tuttolomondo also makes a cacio e pepe Sicilian pie, essentially a four-cheese pizza in which one of the cheeses is pecorino; the whole slice hums with black pepper. The square topped with Gorgonzola dolce and pears works in a way that combination often doesn’t, although half a slice was enough for me. The shop is small, and if you sit at one of the handful of red counter stools you will share the small tiled floor up front with neighbors waiting for takeout and delivery guys. There are no vintage soda refrigerators or letterboard signs, but there is a small photograph of Robert De Niro eating pizza and a much bigger one of John Travolta in “Saturday Night Fever,” biting into his double-decker slice. The picture is in black and white except for the pizza. Tinted orange and red, it glows like a beacon.","The New York Slice That Slices Through Tradition, at Mama’s Too","['earth', 'slice', 'seen', 'product', 'needed', 'tinkering', 'yes', 'pizza', 'city',

23,Henry at Life Hotel by JJ,★,2018-10-30,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/dining/henry-at-life-hotel-by-jj-review.html,Midtown,"Earlier this year Henry, a new restaurant in the lobby of the Life Hotel on West 31st Street, quietly died. You wouldn’t know it to look around the place on any recent night at 8, when a seamless playlist of hip-hop and R&B unspools as servers carry stacked beef ribs to what seems like every third table. What changed? In August, the chef Joseph Johnson, better known as JJ, was made a partner and assumed control of the kitchen. What he has done is less a makeover than a takeover; his imprint radiates out from his Afrocentric menu to animate the whole enterprise. The playlist, which can run from noon until 8 the next morning without repeating a track, is his. Mr. Johnson’s initials now hang in the front window, flooding the nearby tables with pink neon. The initials have migrated to the restaurant’s website as well, where its name is now given as Henry at Life Hotel by JJ. These are not subtle gestures, but subtlety has rarely saved a restaurant on the brink of failure. Mr. Johnson has been busy hiring new employees for the front and back of the house, and the racial mix he has already achieved is as impressive as it is rare. Diversifying a restaurant’s service staff is one of the surest ways to diversify the audience, and on many nights brown faces and white faces, topknots and braids, headscarves and headbands, sit side by side, giving Henry more the appearance of a restaurant in Harlem than of one just off Herald Square. It was in Harlem, as chef de cuisine at a slinky neighborhood hangout called the Cecil and the history-drenched jazz supper club Minton’s, that Mr. Johnson made his name. Fleshing out a notion suggested by Alexander Smalls, the consulting chef in both places, Mr. Johnson explored the African diaspora, the imprint that Africans have put on cooking around the world. He does something similar at Henry, although his view has grown to embrace flavors from, say, India and Southeast Asia that turn up in Africa and in diasporic countries like Jamaica and Barbados. He calls the menu at Henry “Pan-African.” [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] This is a big story — too big to be told in full by one restaurant, or two for that matter. But it’s an important story, and it certainly beats Henry’s original idea of tying the restaurant to the history of Life magazine, which was once published in the same building, and to Henry Luce, who bought it in 1936, then radically remade it and moved it to other quarters. This concept was so wispy that Henry’s first chef, Michael Vignola, resorted to an all-things-to-all-people menu of foie gras sliders and meatball pizza. Just how vast Mr. Johnson’s scope has become will be clear by the end of the appetizer course. (Here I am assuming that you have chosen a traditional two- or three-course meal rather than eating all 15 items on the menu, in full and in order; this route costs $390 and is called “It Was All a Dream,” after a Notorious B.I.G. lyric.) There are littleneck clams, battered with rice flour and crunchy with shaved fennel and Asian pear. All of this is dotted with a tangerine-colored fluff of piri-piri sauce that is less ferociously spicy than the scalding piri-piris of Angola, Mozambique or South Africa. You are welcome to get a half-dozen, but at my table a full dozen went quickly. Benne seeds, the heirloom variety of sesame brought to North America on slave ships, add a flavor that is something like toasted almonds mixed with coffee beans to tuna tartare. The tuna is topped with a chip of curried peanut brittle and spooned over shiso leaves; you pinch the leaf and pop it in your mouth, where good things start to happen. And as you’re adjusting to this cross-pollination of Africa and Japan, Indo-Caribbean cuisine appears on the horizon: a plate of folded roti with dips. The spinach chutney is a little joyless, but the inky purée of eggplant sweetened with dates is a terrific idea. Why Mr. Johnson puts a fried egg on the roti is unclear. When your meal at Henry is over, you may wish you had been sent home with a world map showing the history of forced African migration and spice-trade routes. While it’s going on, though, you generally flow with the inner logic the way you can get into a hip-hop track without being able to name every last sample. Generally, but not always. I believe I understood some of the reasoning behind chopped collard greens and cashews tossed with a coconut dressing, but I still find raw collards somewhat rough going after the first few mouthfuls. Is the seared salmon with rice noodles, edamame and bok choy a reference to the Vietnamese community in Senegal? To me it tasted, not unpleasantly, like something one of the better Asian fusion restaurants in Manhattan would have served 20 years ago. Henry’s shrimp and pork dumplings, on the other hand, are nondescript little blobs; they sit in an aromatic “Harlem curry,” informed by Bengali cooking, that deserves a better dance partner. You could say the same about the intensely herb-scented seafood broth in a seafood boil that Mr. Johnson calls the Afropot; the clams and king crab legs were very good, but the prawns were unappealingly soft and the mussels not quite fleshy enough. The cooking, though, has been getting tighter over the past month, picking up from a first and somewhat droopy meal on a night when Mr. Johnson was not in the kitchen. Tamarind jerk chicken had no spice to speak of. A parcel of rice supposedly inspired by Dominican concón had as much crunch as if it had been left out on the counter overnight, and the eggplant curry ladled over it tasted more like a halfheartedly seasoned tomato sauce. The second time I tried it, the rice had a golden crackle and the curry was worth paying attention to. Apart from the seared scallops in a remarkably good hominy broth with cilantro pistou, those bone-in ribs are the most rewarding main course. The rewards are not so much the short ribs themselves, though they are flavorful and tender; the thrill of the dish is in the battery of little sides like stir-fried millet, spiced black beans and a hoisin sauce I wanted to take home to keep on hand for Chinese-food emergencies. I also thought about pocketing a Foie Crispy Treat, and I would have gotten away with it because everybody else at the table thought they were too weird. Weird they are, but interesting, too. Maybe you’d be happier with the sweet potato pie in a crisp butter crust, very old school apart from the purple yam in the filling. True, at some point in your meal a hotel guest may decide to march through the dining room with a full set of luggage. But under Mr. Johnson, Henry is under no risk of being capsized by that kind of distraction. He has pulled the restaurant back from the edge of failure, and that’s a rare trick.

24,Hunan Slurp,★★,2018-10-23,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/dining/hunan-slurp-review.html,East Village,"The rise of Sichuan food in New York has made the past decade or two a glorious era for prowlers of Chinese restaurants. Chongqing chicken and mung-bean jelly proliferated as skilled chefs flocked to the city. But while the miles of dan dan noodles and mountains of Sichuan peppercorns have been exhilarating, they have tended to overshadow the cuisine of another great chile-haunted region, Hunan. Part of the problem is nomenclature. The word Hunan on a restaurant’s front window tends to say as much about the actual cooking inside as pandas and bamboo on the sign. At first glance it can be hard to distinguish Hunan Garden, say, from Hunan House until you see the menus and learn that the former name signifies egg rolls while the latter promises the red-braised pork that Mao used to dote on. Fake Hunans outnumber real ones, which is one reason to celebrate the appearance of Hunan Slurp. Operating in the East Village since May, Hunan Slurp lives up to both halves of its name. When people in Hunan get hungry for a bowl of noodles, what they have in mind are mifen: long, white strands made from pounded rice, so smooth they may slither right out of the chopsticks of inexperienced slurpers. Chances for New Yorkers to practice their antiskid chopstick techniques have been limited, generally speaking, to the rice noodles of other parts of Asia. When you could find Hunanese noodles around town, they tended to be tucked away on larger menus with so many other Hunanese opportunities that they were rarely given a chance to slither. Hunan Slurp offers some of those opportunities, too. The chef and proprietor, Chao Wang, comes from Hunan’s second-largest city, Hengyang, and fills the menu with both traditional Hunanese dishes and his own innovations. But noodles are the heart of the restaurant. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] They peek out from underneath slices of beef, tofu and barbecued pork, all fanned out like a hand of poker, in a soup-less wonder called Hometown Lu Fen. The sauce is in the bottom of the bowl, and should absolutely be augmented with some of the chopped pickled red chiles in oil served in a small dish on the side. In the string bean mifen, the noodles weave around a fried egg and a scattering of ground Berkshire pork, stir-fried to a crackle with little rounds of sliced, pickled green beans. There is no slick of chile oil on top, and the pale broth looks harmless enough, but once the soup is stirred together it will take the crease out of a pair of newly pressed trousers. A little red sheaf of dried chile threads bobbing in the wild pepper and beef soup gives you an idea what you are in for, if the name hasn’t already given away the game. But with Hunan Slurp’s noodles, as with Hunanese food generally, heat is part of the message; it’s never the medium. Stock is to the cook what pitch is to the opera singer, goes a Chinese proverb. Hunan Slurp’s soup stocks are rounded and cloudy from long-boiled bones and meat, and they tend to get better the longer they linger with their toppings. (So do the noodles.) A master class in the art of broth subtlety is provided by the two-part soup that goes by the under-promising name fish fillet mifen. Part One is an oversize ceramic bowl of milky white pork-and-fish stock strewn with flower petals, pea shoots, purple basil and other fresh herbs. It arrives on a wooden tray next to Part Two, the noodles, which get their own bowl. The broth’s flavor was elusive at first, more a texture than a taste. Within minutes the steamed fish in the broth, together with the herbs, had transformed it into something splendid. Like many of the new Chinese restaurants that have sprouted in the East Village, Hunan Slurp pays attention to appearances. Under a backlighted logo that spells out SLURP in elongated, noodly letters, a sheet of glass on First Avenue frames the long, tunneled dining room, designed by New Practice Studio. The interior is sheathed in wooden slats that run up one wall, arch their way across the ceiling and fall down the opposite wall. Depending on your frame of mind, eating at Hunan Slurp can feel like sitting under a rack of drying noodles or finding yourself inside the belly of a particularly tidy whale. A glassed-in kitchen lies in the back, its shelves stacked with colorfully glazed modern Chinese plates and bowls that you won’t find in the restaurant-supply shops on the Bowery. Once you leave the noodle section of the menu behind, it is possible to find cooking that doesn’t necessarily live up to the standard set by the crockery. I’m told that the bands of cumin-seasoned beef speared with toothpicks can be crisp and well-browned, but the ones I got were gray and floppy. And the sweet-and-sour spareribs, an appetizer, were far more sweet than sour, and tough, too. On the best available evidence, Mr. Wang’s palate skews a bit sweet. This is unusual in a Hunanese kitchen, but only those spareribs were off-puttingly sugary. A multicolored salad of chilled cherry tomatoes was bright and refreshing despite a fruity marination in plum juice. (A similar dish sometimes turns up at Hao Noodle and Tea by Madam Zhu’s Kitchen, where it is sweeter, and still very enjoyable.) And the hint of sugar in stir-fried chicken did not soften the toothy bite of young ginger, or hide the ginger’s natural sweetness, either. You may not notice the bias toward sweetness anyway, given the kitchen’s open embrace of chiles. An electrical current of heat crackles through the dim-sum-style chicken feet, cooked until they are falling-off-the-toe tender. Bright green chiles animate a stir-fry of julienne potatoes, cooked so fast they’re still stiff. They also bring not just spice but crunch to a classic Hunanese sauté of pork and garlic topped with an egg fried to a ruffled, golden crisp. The chiles knocked around in a very hot wok with sweet, juicy cabbage are small, red, sun-dried and noticeably fruity under their mouth-zapping heat. The spice level is more subdued in the excellent stir-fry of pork and smoked tofu, and it’s almost undetectable in a very likable preparation of skinny eggplant sections topped with discs of bell pepper; the skins are left on the eggplants, which gives the appetizer something of the appearance of tuna maki wrapped with purple seaweed. Meals tend to move quickly. For this you may be thankful on busy nights when those wood slats go from attractive design elements to unnervingly effective sounding boards. As in other Chinese restaurants in the neighborhood, the crowd tends to be young, bright, quick and eager to get on with the rest of the evening. As the dinner rush ends, the howl subsides. Maybe ice cream is on the agenda, or a classic dessert soup of mung beans and barley in syrup. Or maybe a pot of tea, loose-leaf, brewed at the table while you think about chiles and rice and pork and wonder how many more Hunanese chefs can be persuaded to settle down in New York.",Chinese

25,Atomix,★★★,2018-10-16,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/16/dining/atomix-review-korean.html,Murray Hill,"A card is set down in front of you before each new course arrives at Atomix, the tasting-menu restaurant in Murray Hill run by Junghyun Park and his wife, Jeungeun. Each is printed with a boldface transliteration of a Korean word under an abstract design of geometric shapes and lines. They look like flashcards from a school run by progressive graphic designers. “Your first course is guk, which means soup,” a server will say. “This card is for hwe, Korean for raw.” “Jorim is next. Jorim means it’s been braised.” This sounds as if it would get old, but it doesn’t. Very early on, you learn that on the other side of these vocabulary exercises lie dishes of wonderful intricacy, sophistication and beauty. One after another, each of the 10 courses in the $175 meal opens up new ideas about Korean cuisine and culture. In the Atomix pedagogical method, instruction is followed closely by reward. (While we are working on vocabulary: The restaurant’s name is pronounced, somewhat counterintuitively, a-toe-mix.) [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] Many of the rewards are the kind you eat, of course. Guk-which-means-soup is a shimmering broth that Mr. Park, the chef, makes from fermented tomatoes and kelp; chilled and poured over scallop slices layered between slivers of green tomato that have been marinated in Korean fig vinegar, the broth has an electrifying sweet-sour balance. The dish may not scream “Korean cuisine,” but the next one does. This is hwe — Korean for raw, you’ll recall, and also the term for Korean-style sashimi. The fish is striped jack, brushed with plum vinegar sauce. Slices of it are folded around a mild fermented chile, a few drops of sesame oil and bits of kimchi made from cabbage and ramps. Sitting over each slice of jack is a crisp square of gim, which the Japanese call nori. Pinch some fish inside the gim and eat it, and the flavors that unspool are some of those that are brought to the table with Korean sashimi, but they’re put together with a harmony that’s hard to achieve when you swab them yourself under the influence of a few glasses of soju. Inspired by a poem from the Choson era, Mr. Park summoned an entirely different set of flavors for the hwe on Atomix’s opening menu, which ran from late May to early September. Then, the fish was sea bream, firm and chewy, marinated overnight with ginger in a magnificently good tangerine vinegar from the island of Jeju. Eaten with sea urchin, plain spinach, sparkling shards of jelly made from pale young soy sauce, and Chinese-mustard leaves fermented in some wonderful way, it was so deeply harmonic I wouldn’t have minded if Mr. Park had served it over and over for the rest of the meal. Centuries before it became the fashion among American chefs, fermentation was a pillar of Korean cuisine. Atomix exploits it in all kinds of ways. Fermentation bends a mix of juices from Korean pears, green apples and pineapple toward a cidery direction that makes it a thrilling marinade, braising liquid and sauce for exquisitely rich Wagyu strip loin. It’s the foundation for an array of vinegars you won’t find on the average table in Koreatown: cherry blossom, persimmon, mugwort, birch. And, of course, fermentation is behind the restaurant’s arsenal of pickled vegetables, the most interesting of which may be the tart brussels sprouts that Mr. Park serves in banchan format alongside roast duck with a mole sauce that could pass muster in Mexico if Mr. Park did not up the funk level with gochujang. Some of these ingredients were fermented or otherwise preserved in South Korea. Many more were put up for storage at Atoboy, the Parks’ other restaurant, over the past year or more as the Parks prepared to open Atomix. Atoboy’s food is woven around traditional banchan dishes, and while Mr. Park gives himself room to play, the cooking there stays true to the fairly simple origins of banchan. His tasting menus at Atomix make a quantum leap in complexity. It’s like seeing the guy who strums the 12-string guitar on the L platform pick up a conductor’s baton and lead an orchestra through a Mahler symphony. On the back of Atomix’s flashcards he lists the components of each dish, and each of their ingredients — around 20 on average, very few of them ordinary and none of them out of place. Nothing at Atomix tastes confused or overburdened. The dishes are even more elaborate than those at Jungsik, the rarefied Korean-inspired restaurant downtown where Mr. Park was the chef de cuisine before he and his wife struck out on their own. And while Jungsik seems determined to stuff Korean flavors into an outdated French formality, Atomix is warm, contemporary and Korean at just about every turn. The Parks, who were raised in South Korea, hired a Seoul architecture firm, Studio Writers, to remake two floors of a secretive-looking townhouse on East 30th Street. Upstairs is a small bar where you can slither into a pale-leather booth to idle over smartly conceived snacks like soy-marinated scallop jerky; beef tartare, mixed with red and black pepper, and under a snowfall of pecorino; or fried wings stuffed with fried rice and dusted with ground Sichuan peppercorns. Stairs descend to a bright, skylit lounge of upholstered benches where the tasting menu kicks off with a couple of hors d’oeuvres and drinks. The idea must be for you to leave the shuffle of Manhattan behind in stages, but I always spent my few minutes in this way station eyeing the comfortable, dark, wood-clad den a few steps away where the rest of the meal is served at a 14-seat counter. The natural materials and simple lines in the tasting room seem to bow toward Korea’s long Zen tradition, and a kind of purposeful calm reigns there. Servers and cooks all wear flowing, boat-neck shirts in a shimmering pewter color that gives them a slight science-fiction look; they are the work of a Korean-born New York designer, Sungho Ahn. Ms. Park, who goes by Ellia, glides behind the counter, smiling and holding out a cloth case to offer a pair of the Korean-made chopsticks she collects. They’re beautiful objects, and so are the handmade plates and bowls that begin to file out of the kitchen, each made by a potter or glass worker or wood carver in South Korea. These artisans are identified on the menu cards, whose abstract designs are the work of a South Korean artist. Tasting menus can be arid and sterile when a chef doesn’t have much to say. The format comes to life when a restaurant is overflowing with ideas, like Atomix. The way the Parks put Korean culture in the foreground recalls the early days of the Four Seasons, which moved beyond European models of formal dining by hiring an American architect and American industrial designers to go along with the American ingredients and even American wines. The Four Seasons had a Swiss chef, though. Atomix is more thorough: It has the Parks.

26,Manhatta,★,2018-10-09,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/09/dining/manhatta-restaurant-review.html,Financial District,"Shrinking modesty is not the normal attitude for restaurants with a view. The Rainbow Room had Art Deco razzmatazz and its revolving dance floor; Windows on the World, before terrorists destroyed it, served cocktails in a room named the Greatest Bar on Earth. Manhatta, which recently opened on the 60th floor of an International Style tower downtown, doesn’t follow their lead. It is the least show-offy skyscraper restaurant you’ve ever seen. The whole operation is very orderly and well behaved, apart from its refusal to spell its own name correctly. (The reference is to the Lenni Lenape name Manahatta, or Mannahatta, meaning “island of many hills,” but without the second “a” the name just looks incomplete. It’s like a child named Henr.) A dedicated door around the corner from the building’s main entrance brings you into a foyer that, with its sleek chairs and coffee tables, looks like the lobby of one of those 1960s white-brick apartment buildings in the East 40s and 50s. When you get out of the elevator — it goes to just one floor, the top — a short walk leads to another sparsely furnished sitting area, this one looking out the windows toward the harbor and the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge. When the lounge hasn’t been rented out for parties and sealed off, it’s busier than the foyer downstairs, but it still appears to have been designed for people who are waiting for their dates to get back from the restroom. In the other direction are Manhatta’s bar, a longish counter whose seats face uptown, and its dining room, which looks both north and east toward Brooklyn. The color scheme, navy-blue leather and dark wood, might strike the Knickerbocker Club’s board as a little too conservative. An open kitchen has been dropped down into the middle of all this, but the overall design strategy is to sit back and let the windows do the work. Danny Meyer, whose Union Square Hospitality Group runs Manhatta through a management contract with the building’s owner, told The New York Times last year that Manhatta would not be as flamboyant as a typical top-floor restaurant. “Those kinds of places often do not live up to expectations; they try too hard to live up to the view,” he said. “I expect to conceive of it like a ground-floor restaurant, as a place people might want to visit regularly.” You can’t blame Mr. Meyer for not wanting to open a mediocre splashy restaurant, but Manhatta flirts dangerously with being a mediocre unsplashy restaurant. The chef, Jason Pfeifer, doesn’t quite let that happen. His French menu, grounded in seasonal flavors, is fairly priced at $78, including tip, for a three-course prix fixe. A good amount of it is very likable, but there are more spongy patches than there probably should be. At their best, Manhatta’s better appetizers and main courses are fleshed out with fruits and vegetables so ripe and pristine they seem to come from a Greenmarket stall that only Mr. Pfeifer can see. A melon and cucumber salad with fluffy curds of feta was an exploration of melonic potential; each section of fruit was a bit different, some infused with citrus, others dripping with unfiltered garden-patch sweetness, all of them tangy with white balsamic vinegar. An admirably cooked brick of halibut was paired with bittersweet fennel bulbs and a mustard sauce with a gentle but effective bite. Raw nectarine crescents, braised lettuces and tender thin wheels of immature corn on the cob augmenting a main course of chicken were their charming selves, and all the better for their slinky dressing of chicken jus. Sweet black figs stood in for apples in a memorable little tarte Tatin garnished with raw pale-green figs. (Jennifer Bretania and Vanesa Beltran share the pastry duties.) Gently marinated hen-of-the-woods mushrooms made an exquisitely woodsy counterpoint to ruffles of shaved La Marotte sheep cheese. But generous applications of produce don’t always save the food from seeming a bit safe, conservative and slightly dated. Mr. Pfeifer, who spent eight years in the kitchen at Maialino, Mr. Meyer’s Roman-inspired restaurant, is now cooking French food in the post-nouvelle mode that Daniel Boulud has been artfully fomenting for years. Mr. Boulud has earned the right to keep working in that groove as long as he likes, but it’s strange to find a young chef at a new, high-profile destination doing it when others around the city are pushing ahead with contemporary interpretations of French cuisine. And when Manhatta turns to the classics, its use of French idioms seems skin-deep compared with Laetitia Rouabah’s light touch and sophisticated technique at Benoit, or Marie-Aude Rose’s painstaking elevations of cafe cooking at La Mercerie, or Daniel Rose’s intelligent, neoclassical excavations of silver-cloche cuisine at Le Coucou. Where Le Coucou brought back quenelles as helium-light pike dumplings in dizzyingly rich lobster-brandy sauce, Manhatta turns them into quivering balls of pudding distantly scented with seafood. Of all the ways a modern chef might grapple with cassoulet, the sublimely burly Languedocian assault on the digestive system, upending it over a crisp and golden chicken paillard has to be one of the strangest. Manhatta isn’t the first restaurant to update veal blanquette with meat that’s roasted rather than stewed, but the sauce is so blandly milky that it’s hardly there. And while modern desserts can stray into savory territory more than they did in Escoffier’s day, a vanilla soufflé with butterscotch sauce probably shouldn’t taste salty. Some of this was dispiriting, but I never got up from the table in a bad mood. There are grace notes throughout the restaurant, like the dark, shiny little canelés that show up with dessert. This being a Union Square Hospitality production, the servers seem to be trained mind readers. A pair of the mismatched binoculars scattered around the restaurant materialized just when I was trying to locate the clock tower in the Consolidated Edison Building; before I’d had a chance to point out a fruit fly in my wine (did it ride up with me in the elevator?) a sommelier spirited the glass away and brought a fresh one. Mr. Meyer was probably right to take a dialed-down approach to the top-floor restaurant genre. It dates from a more innocent age, when people could look at the financial district’s unblinking grids of lighted windows as the bland face of high-stakes cheating that we’ve come to recognize from “Margin Call” and “Billions.” At the time of the financial crisis, Manhatta’s building was the headquarters of JPMorgan Chase — a relatively minor player in the three-card-monte game of mortgage-backed securities, but a player nonetheless. Ten years have gone by, but it’s still too soon for revolving dance floors.

27,Village Cafe,★★,2018-10-02,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/dining/village-cafe-review-brooklyn.html,Midwood,"During the five years Village Cafe has been open, I must have driven the length of Coney Island Avenue in Brooklyn a dozen times without noticing it. At best I might have spotted the tiny parking lot in Midwood, with tattered red, blue and silver streamers flapping over its 10 or so spaces, giving it the appearance of the world’s smallest used-car dealership. In the back is a wide, single-story structure that looks like the trailer office where you would sit down to discuss loan options with Marty from financing. But that building is an Azerbaijani restaurant that stands out among the dining outposts of former Soviet republics that stretch north from Brighton Beach, and each time I’ve gone inside I was given not a credit check, but a test of my appetite’s limits. This is not just because almost every platter of food that leaves the kitchen at Village Cafe seems intended to feed an actual village. I run into trouble because there are so many things I want to order and so few things I am willing to leave on the table as the meal winds down. There will never be a time when I go to Village Cafe and decide not to have at least one qutab, if not all three. The menu gives the name of this delicate Azerbaijani flatbread, the diameter of a pita but thinner, as kutaby. Either way, it is very good when stuffed with minced, quietly spiced chicken or lamb. It is exceptional when filled with greens: spinach, scallions, and dill and cilantro, two fresh herbs that turn up again and again in Azerbaijani cooking. I will always want the crimped dumplings, the size and shape of chicken drumettes, that the English menu calls ravioli and the servers call pelmeni. Filled with chicken or lamb, these dumplings can be boiled, but the urge to ask for them fried is overwhelming, and the fried ones are better dunked in the tomato-pepper sauce that I would call salsa if I were not in an Azerbaijani restaurant. There will be liver on my table, too. Maybe it will be Turkish style, little fried cubes under a tart purple dusting of ground sumac. Or the liver may be added to bits of lamb hearts, kidney and testicles, and cooked with onions and potato cubes in a fantastically oily hash called djiz biz. Whether I will eat guru hingal will depend on how far in advance I’ve planned my meal, because it generally has to be ordered a day ahead. It is a noodle dish: very thin, wide sheets of pasta under a sauce of onions and ground lamb fried in its own fat until it is magnificently crunchy. If you poured chile oil over guru hingal, it would taste Sichuanese; stew the lamb with tomatoes and you could mistake the sauce for Bolognese. But it’s from Azerbaijan, and it’s good with yogurt. And I will have soup, even if nobody else does, because Village Cafe’s kitchen understands how to make it. The kufta-bozbash is a strong, well-skimmed lamb broth with chickpeas and a single, tender lamb-rice meatball, as big as an apple. The broth for dushbara soup is similar, but the ballast is provided by miniature lamb dumplings about the size of M&Ms. Cilantro and dried mint are added to both soups at the last minute, and the mint is especially helpful. Village Cafe’s hot borscht, strong and decidedly unvegetarian, outperforms some I’ve had in Brighton Beach. Instead of sour cream, it comes with a spoonful of yogurt. The cuisine of Azerbaijan often echoes those of its neighbors Georgia, Armenia and Iran, but other dishes, like borscht, were hauled down from Eastern Europe in the strong arms of Mother Russia. We can also thank Russia for the insane music videos that play on Village Cafe’s two televisions, typically with the volume off while American pop of the ’80s plays on the sound system. You sit at what appear to be varnished picnic tables with chairs instead of benches. The rest of the décor looks like a Brighton Beach yard sale: a mushroom cookie jar, an embroidered peasant smock, a camouflage cap, a samovar or two, a collection of beaded handbags, several ceramic cows, three statues of fat chefs with toques and mustaches, and two giant forks mounted on the wall. For atmosphere, Village Cafe is roundly beaten by my second-favorite Azerbaijani restaurant in Brooklyn, Old Baku in Kensington. Walk past the awning that says “private club,” past the curtained booths in the front dining room, past the open kitchen where chefs scoop burning coals to keep the fire under the kebabs going strong, and you enter a courtyard from another country. Almost everybody at Old Baku is smoking under the arbor of grape vines that weave around strings of white lights. If you go in the fall, you might be brought a plate of purple grapes, newly picked a few feet away. But Village Cafe gains its edge on Old Baku in the kitchen. The stewed fruit ladled over saffron rice in its plov, for instance, is a richer and more varied compilation of dried plums, apricots, chestnuts and deeply browned lamb. The salads are brighter, too, if you can get over some of the names. The menu was evidently written by someone with a weakness for poetry, so the salads are called things like “Journey to Baku,” “Winter Fun” and “Unexpected Guests.” The Journey to Baku is worth taking; it’s a sharply seasoned, smoky eggplant mash with peppers and tomatoes. The kidney beans in a traditional lobio salad are creamy, salty and well-oiled under their topping of chopped walnuts and cilantro. Main course names incline toward the allusive as well, with one chicken cutlet called “Miracle of Village” and another — buried under a white pillow of cheese and cream sauce — that goes by “Mother In Laws Chicken.” But really, the best place to go once all the amenities have been polished off is the kebabs. The quail may be a bit wizened. The grilled testicles with a hint of lemon in their lightly browned surfaces will always be a niche proposition. But the lamb ribs, the marinated lamb chops known as chalahac and the flatbread-wrapped Azerbaijani version of kofte called lulya kebabs (made from chicken or lamb) are extremely good. The vegetable skewer choices begin and end with blistered tomatoes and softly collapsing eggplant. Both are worthwhile. So is the side dish called “homemade potatoes,” if there is any room left on the table. Sliced and fried with onions, they narrowly beat out the pretty good fries. A cup or two of strong dark tea will speed your recovery from this onslaught. Dessert may not. Still, there is something to be said for trying a Napoleon made like baklava and a baklava made like a Napoleon.

28,Kopitiam,★,2018-09-25,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/dining/kopitiam-restaurant-review.html,Chinatown,"Sometimes when I am waiting, and waiting, for a barista to steam milk for my cortado, I like to pass the time by imagining what life would be like if Howard Schultz had boarded the wrong plane in 1981 and flown to Penang instead of Milan. Starbucks, the company he joined after that trip and would eventually lead, might teach its employees the fine arts of Malaysian kopi, brewed by pouring hot water over grounds in the bottom of a sock, rather than show them how to operate an espresso machine. Instead of white-chocolate mocha lattes, we would drink bek-kopi, white coffee, brewed from beans that are lightly roasted in palm oil margarine. Venti would just be Italian for a number, while kopi-C kosong, or strong black coffee with unsweetened condensed milk, would have entered the American lexicon, along with kopi tarik, the same drink made with sweetened condensed milk. There would be no competitions where baristas drew swans and elephants in milk froth, and in their place we would have exhibitions of coffee and tea pulling, the art of cooling the beverage while coaxing the milk in it to form a foamy head by pouring it from one pot to another in long, swooping, steamy cataracts. In other words, the places where we get our caffeine fix might look a lot like Kopitiam, on East Broadway in Chinatown. Kyo Pang founded Kopitiam three years ago as a homage to the coffee and tea parlors of Malaysia, where she grew up. A typical Malaysian kopitiam is a ramshackle hangout where people drop in to read the morning paper, grab breakfast, catch up on neighborhood gossip and do all the other things that classically accompany a cup of tea or coffee. Something of that spirit pervades Kopitiam, too. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The original Kopitiam, reviewed by Ligaya Mishan in a 2015 Hungry City column, was situated around the corner on Canal Street and had just four seats at a single counter. In June, Ms. Pang and her new business partner, Moonlynn Tsai, relocated to a larger, if still fairly intimate, space a few steps above the sidewalk. You order at the counter and receive a number on a metal stand, a kind of promissory note for the food and beverages. If you show up on a weekday in the morning or afternoon, when seats are not hard to come by and the room has a languid, unhurried air, you could get just a cup of bek-kopi and linger over it with a newspaper. You will probably want more than that, though. From 9 a.m., when the doors open, until 10 p.m., when they close, you can get nasi lemak, Malaysia’s national dish and a particular favorite at breakfast. I don’t know another kitchen in the city where the fragrances of coconut and pandan leaf infuse the rice as elegantly, or where the tiny dried fish, which Kopitiam fries with peanuts, form a caramelized crust that erases the distinction between sweet and savory. Or your breakfast could be a bowl of two eggs boiled just long enough to turn the whites opaque while leaving the yolks free to billow into mushroom-soy broth underneath. Or it might be fish ball soup, grape-size globes of ground fish in a cloudy white broth; if the grains of white pepper on the surface aren’t intense enough for you, you can stir in a little fish sauce spiced with bird’s eye chiles. Rice vermicelli can be added, too, but the soup is easier to appreciate in pure liquid form. For mornings when nothing but a cannonball dive into sugar will do, Kopitiam is ready with a sculptural pile of thick-cut French toast battered with Milo malt-chocolate powder, a Malaysian passion, with streams of sweetened condensed milk playing the part that in this country is normally taken by maple syrup. Eat the whole stack and you will know the answer to the musical question posed by the Cramps: How far can too far go? At 10:30 a.m. Ms. Pang, the chef, adds a gang of new dishes to the breakfast crew, and all of them stick around until closing time. There are fresh little oysters embedded in a thin browned omelet, rice noodles in a chilled sesame-oil broth with a growl of chile heat and spicy skate steamed in banana leaves, the classic acoustic version of the dish that Max Ng plays with amplifiers and wah-wah pedals at Momofuku Ssam Bar. Any of these could make a small meal. But one of the most inviting aspects of Kopitiam is Ms. Pang’s fidelity to the Malaysian love of snacks. Pandan leaves wrapped around a kind of chicken sausage; ground five-spice pork rolled inside bean-curd skins and fried; fried strips of mackerel sausage with a curry-leaf sauce — any of them makes a fine appetizer, but each could just as easily be the entire goal of a between-meals stop at Kopitiam. For that matter, so could the small sweets like pulut: triangular, pandan-wrapped bundles of sticky rice tinted with blue morning glory flowers and spread with toasted coconut sugar or house-made coconut jam. Ms. Pang is devoted to cakes as well. You get the sense that if it were physically possible, she’d bake every cake she knows every day, but she settles for one or two in an unpredictable rotation. You may find the caramel-brown honeycomb cake, with its intriguing structure of hollow vertical columns at the bottom, or you may find her coconut cake, or there may be some fresh surprise. Snacks and sweets tend to get edged out of the spotlight in New York restaurants, where there’s always pressure to order something big. This is, after all, a city that turned the casual tapas bar into the peculiar genre known as the tapas restaurant. There is no such pressure inside Kopitiam, at least on weekdays. Weekend brunch is another story, as it often is. The menu is the same, but the crowds thicken. A sign-in sheet is kept outside the door, next to the pink pay phone (25 cents; it works), and hopeful customers sit on ceramic garden stools at the top of the stoop listening for their names. When you’re finally called, you may feel silly getting nothing more than tannic milky tea and a bundle of blue sticky rice. And when demand peaks, chaos can creep in, suggesting that Kopitiam is still figuring out the mechanics of its larger space. Servers may pop by anxiously to ask, “Did you get all your food?” and the answer may be no. Drink orders may stack up. Once the white coffee was off the menu; another time, no coffee at all was being poured; and for a short time one day, both coffee and tea were unavailable, an awkward state of affairs for a coffee and tea parlor. Even with a backlog of tickets, though, the food trickling out of the kitchen is almost unfailingly terrific. Maybe the stir-fried duck tongues I ate last time could have slid from their cartilaginous framework more easily. Then again, maybe I wasn’t in the right mood for duck tongues.

29,Shoji at 69 Leonard Street,★★★,2018-09-18,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/18/dining/shoji-at-69-leonard-street-review.html,TriBeCa,"“People always say summer is not a good time for sushi,” Derek Wilcox said. “I have no idea what they’re talking about.” Early evening, the end of August, and the granite TriBeCa sidewalks outside Shoji at 69 Leonard Street were deserted. The restaurant was empty, too. I sat alone on one side of the counter, and on the other stood Mr. Wilcox, alone, as he usually is even when customers occupy all 12 chairs. Although assistants work in the wings, the restaurant is essentially a one-man show. In the broad view, having the place to myself was unjust. In the year since Mr. Wilcox took over the restaurant — at first his work there was termed a residency or pop-up, but in June the owner, Idan Elkon, announced that he’d put a ring on it and made the arrangement permanent — he has firmly placed it in the top tier of the city’s Japanese restaurants. On the basis of sushi alone, Shoji has few plausible rivals, and for sushi embedded within a longer, kaiseki-derived menu, it has no parallel. There should be no empty seats, no matter how many New Yorkers are off lolling at the beach. Taking a selfish view, though, I wasn’t particularly unhappy to be the only customer. Mr. Wilcox, who grew up in Virginia, cooked at a kaiseki restaurant in Kyoto called Kikunoi for seven years and then spent three more at a traditionalist sushi parlor in the Ginza district of Tokyo. You might think of this as the equivalent of earning a master’s degree followed by a Ph.D. in Japanese cuisine, and one side benefit of a meal across the counter from Mr. Wilcox is the chance to hear what he learned studying abroad. Show some curiosity and you could get a short education in the mineral-rich clay used by potters in the town of Shigaraki, or the various aliases and false names under which a particularly delicious, pink-fleshed fish known as akamutsu in Japan travels under when it is away from home. On this August night, I was about to get a two-hour schooling on the pleasures of summer sushi. Mr. Wilcox’s opening move was a squiggle of what looked like short, thick noodles and turned out to be lengths of chilled eggplant; Mr. Wilcox had given them a cool bath in the light sauce in which icy coils of somen noodles are dipped in summer. Laid over the top were two tongues of bafun sea urchin, a species with the color of a nearly ripe persimmon. With one dish, he had shooed away the heat outside, shown off the uncanny harmony of urchin and eggplant, and introduced a minor theme of the night, the summer urchin harvest in Japan. This overture out of the way, Mr. Wilcox lifted what appeared to be a machete. This was a hamo knife, a heavy swath of sharp steel that can reduce the daggertooth pike conger’s dozens of tiny bones to edible smithereens; before the first one was forged in the 19th century, he explained, the eel had to be fully cooked and separated from its skeleton. This hamo would be quickly scorched on one side and served with a lick of wasabi and puréed salt-cured plums thinned with dashi. Sashimi came next in the form of shioko, or kanpachi caught when it is young and its flavor is leaner and softer than it will get later in the year. This was followed by a local fish that in the spring Mr. Wilcox had told me he didn’t like, striped bass. He had been working with it, though, salting it overnight and then grilling it until the skin crackled. Now I don’t want striped bass cooked any other way. After this was Mr. Wilcox’s nod to the kaiseki tradition known as takiawase, a plate of simmered vegetables and, in this case, seafood: a small potato, some Japanese eggplant, a crisp pink ginger shoot and the most flavorful piece of octopus I have ever put in my mouth. After my first meal at Shoji I learned to hope that chawan mushi, a bowl of steaming-hot tofu custard, was on the menu. In spring Mr. Wilcox made it with spot prawns, but tonight, in homage to clambake season, he was serving lobster chawan mushi. To this point, the menu had faithfully followed kaiseki’s ritualized sequence of courses and its stopwatch-precise attention to seasonality. It was about to veer in a different direction, but it was enough to suggest that Mr. Wilcox could open a kaiseki restaurant that would set a new standard in the city. I’m not sure the city would support it, but it would be spectacular while it lasted. The different direction, of course, was sushi. Accounting for just about half the Shoji menu, the sushi portion is briefer and offers less variety than the full monty at, say, Sushi Amane or Ginza Sushi Onodera. But I’m not sure any competitor outflanks Shoji on the quality of the seafood it does serve, or in the timeliness with which it serves up exactly the specimens most worth tracking down at any given moment. In spring, when bioluminescent firefly squid are spawning in Japanese bays, Mr. Wilcox gets them. In August, when cuttlefish are thumbnail size, unbelievably smooth and as meltingly soft as the thinnest sheet of nova at Russ & Daughters, he will lay three of those over a single finger of rice. He tracks bluefin that has been caught from healthy stocks, like the o-toro from Ireland that he served last spring and that was so seductive it could have been captioned “the guy she told you not to worry about.” While in Japan, Mr. Wilcox learned to make fresh ikura from sacs of salmon roe, a slow process that requires massaging the eggs apart by hand in many changes of water. Normally the roe is then heavily cured with sugar and salt, but the roe he was serving last month was very lightly seasoned before being spooned into a shot glass and served as is — sticky, fatty, sweet and fresh. After the last piece of fish, the kaiseki format kicks in again with a soup, which may be as simple as a classic bowl of miso or may break with tradition, like the extraordinary corn soup I ate in August. There will be something cold and refreshing, maybe a granita made from ginger or matcha, and finally a more substantial dessert. Sometimes this is a sort of tart with seasonal fruit — candied kumquats, maybe, or white peaches and blueberries — arranged in a mochi wafer called monaka. For all this the charge is $252, service included. A shorter menu is available at $190, or a longer one at $295, again with service included. That service is somewhat minimal; lately it has meant a single employee assiduously refilling water glasses and taking orders from a drinks list whose cheapest item is a $12 bottle of beer. Could my server have been more adept at deciphering the wines, sakes, shochus and Haitian rums Mr. Elkon and Mr. Wilcox have put together? Perhaps, but I wouldn’t necessarily want the scene cluttered by a sommelier in full pocket-square-and-cuff-links regalia. More employees hovering at the counter might take away from the bond Mr. Wilcox builds with the people he feeds.

30,Sofreh,★★,2018-09-11,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/11/dining/sofreh-review.html,Prospect Heights,"Considering the history, the influence, the depth and the sophistication of Iranian food, it has always seemed unfair that New York City has so few places to eat it. Unfair to the cuisine and unfair to would-be eaters. If you want a symbol for the state of the cuisine in New York City, Taste of Persia NYC will fit the bill. Until recently I might have called it the city’s most promising Iranian kitchen, if the word kitchen weren’t such a stretch. Taste of Persia is a takeout operation squeezed into the front window of a Chelsea pizzeria, except during the two months when fire damage forced it to take up temporary residence in a holiday market. It does show off some of the pleasures of the Iranian table, but not the table itself. So a new Brooklyn restaurant called Sofreh, which joined the Iranian ranks in June, would have caused a stir even if the cooking weren’t quite as good as it is. The dining room is spare and modern, with exposed rafters, molded plywood chairs and shades of soft white. You have to look carefully to see the breaks with garden-variety minimalism, like the echoes of medieval arches behind the bar and the Persian calligraphy carved into the plaster in the back, where a small deck hangs above a garden. Minimalism surrenders entirely in the bathroom, papered in a pulpy collage of posters from pre-revolutionary Iranian cinema. All summer, Iranian expats and hopeful fans of Iranian cuisine have been filing in, armed with questions: Does the saffron rice stand high in voluminous heaps of discrete grains? Are nigella seeds embedded in the dimpled, golden crusts of the oval loaves of barbari? Do the cold shards of sorbet frozen around threads of noodles in Sofreh’s faloodeh contain just enough rose water to soften the bite of lime syrup? Check, check and check. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The main dining room is on the street level of a Prospect Heights brownstone just off Flatbush Avenue, and the food is largely in a domestic mode. Nasim Alikhani, who owns the restaurant with her husband, Theodore Petroulas, is responsible for the menu. Ms. Alikhani has never worked in a restaurant before. Rather than following the plating fashions of more trend-conscious chefs, she models the cooking after the things she might make when company comes over. Platoons of kebabs dominate the menus of other Iranian restaurants around town, but home kitchens are rarely built with vast indoor grills; Sofreh’s cooking, entrusted to two chefs named Ali Saboor and Soroosh Golbabae, revolves around the oven and stovetop. A loaf of barbari, its crust baked to a Roman-pizza crackle in a revolving oven, is served with many of the appetizers, and it is always gone so soon that I end up ordering one or two more. This flatbread is of course ideal for tearing and swishing into the thick yogurt dips, one mixed with golden raisins and shredded cucumber, another with minced shallots and chives. It is indispensable with the eggplant mash enriched with walnuts, strained yogurt and sweet fried onions. A loaf of barbari is also spread with herbs and feta that is more creamy than briny. Earlier in the summer Sofreh offered an appetizer of dry, underseasoned beef meatballs with sour cherries. One of the only things on the menu that was hard to warm up to, it has been replaced lately by beef kofte, made light and tender by rice and stewed split peas. The kofte sit in a gentle saffron-tomato sauce that is another natural partner for Sofreh’s bread. Ms. Alikhani, 59, grew up in the sprawling desert city Isfahan, and moved to the United States in her early 20s. For years she cooked Iranian dishes from memory, and it would be decades before she traveled back to Iran to learn more about its food in preparation for opening Sofreh. Her version of ash, the herb and whole-wheat noodle stew, stands out on the menu because it stays so close to tradition. Other dishes show the acclimatizing effect of New York. It’s an article of faith for chefs in the city that any dish can be improved by putting a poached egg on it. I’m not so sure that Sofreh’s smoked eggplant halves with their sweet, garlic-drenched tomato sauce need one, though. Is the watermelon feta salad familiar from restaurants that have nothing to do with Iran? Maybe just a bit, but Sofreh’s version stands out for its intriguing sauce of nigella seeds crushed into mint oil. And while the Shiraz salad isn’t chopped to fine bits in the traditional way that makes it something like Iran’s answer to pico de gallo, its sour purple flecks of sumac distinguish it from the herd of tomato-cucumber assemblages. The menu is fairly concise, and occasionally I wished that it plunged into tradition with less restraint. For a dish called “catch of the day,” Ms. Alikhani has adapted ghalieh mahi, a tamarind-soured stew of fish and fresh herbs from southern Iran. In her version, a pan-seared hunk of whitefish — halibut and cod have taken turns in the role — is set over a long-cooked sauce. Dark with caramelized onions and fried cilantro and fresh fenugreek leaves, the sauce is hypnotically complex. Still, a sauce sitting under fish is not the same as one that has been cooked with fish so the flavors can get acquainted. A simple flattened and griddled half chicken, though, is a wonderful foil for a topping of tart barberries and a captivating sauce of dried Persian plums and saffron. And there’s lovely simplicity to the braised lamb shank with roasted garlic and sizzled onions; the turmeric- and cinnamon-scented sauce might have been put on this earth to be spooned over fluffy rice. There is no shame in ending the meal with a goblet of thick yogurt parfait with jam and pistachios. But there are harder-to-find sweets, too, like the rose-water custard, grainy with rice flour, transformed into a sort of tart by a crust of chopped nuts. Saffron and rose-water ice cream is luxuriously rich despite a few stray ice crystals. And the faloodeh, one of the world’s oldest frozen desserts, will put to rest all doubts about the wisdom of embedding sorbet in a nest of vermicelli, if there were any doubts to begin with.

31,Nobu 57,★,2018-08-21,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/dining/nobu-downtown-review-nobu-57.html,Midtown,"There was a time when there was only one Nobu, on Hudson Street in TriBeCa. When it opened in 1994, it was the first restaurant outside Los Angeles to offer Nobuyuki Matsuhisa’s startling new liaison of sushi and other Japanese food with Peruvian flavors. The herds of imitators were still to come. If you wanted to try raw yellowtail in ponzu under a green jalapeño wheel, or fried rock shrimp shimmering with spiced mayonnaise, or broiled black cod in miso so sweet it might have been maple syrup — and for a few years it seemed as if that was all anybody wanted — you either went to Matsuhisa in Beverly Hills, Calif., or you went to Hudson Street. Now you can eat Nobu ceviche in Dubai, Budapest and Cape Town. If you want Nobu sashimi salad for dinner followed by a night in a Nobu hotel, you can do that in Marbella, Manila, Miami or Palo Alto. When the United States Space Force establishes its first lunar base, the generals and majors will no doubt find a Nobu there, with tuna tataki on the menu and a line three-deep at the bar. This is because after the success of Nobu in TriBeCa, Mr. Matsuhisa and his partners made a strategic decision. The food would stay roughly the same — more on this in a minute — but the surroundings would grow bigger, boozier, louder, more theatrical. If Nobu did not exactly invent the Asian Party Temple restaurant genre, it certainly drew the blueprints. At these new Nobus, Mr. Matsuhisa’s food was still a major event, but not necessarily the main event. And the question was not just whether you felt like eating at Nobu but whether you felt like being at Nobu. The Malibu location in particular has a reputation for intense good-time vibes that can drive away customers who merely want to eat. All this was encapsulated for me in two brief scenes from my recent meals at Nobu Downtown and Nobu Fifty Seven. The first episode took place while I was sitting at the sushi bar of Nobu Downtown. This location, inside the old AT&T tower on Lower Broadway, is theoretically the successor to the first Nobu; it opened last year a few weeks after the original closed. The sushi bar was the heart of the TriBeCa restaurant. The chefs behind it prepared or touched at least half the food, and seats there were so coveted that during the 1990s, when even celebrities complained about how hard it was to get in, a mostly sushi restaurant called  Next Door Nobu was opened simply to contain the overflow. (It closed last year, too, and won’t be replaced.) At Nobu Downtown, the upstairs sushi counter is on the far side of the cocktail bar that the design firm Rockwell Group slipped in among the enormous fluted limestone columns that fill the building’s ground floor like a petrified forest. I had just eaten a piece of Japanese scallop sushi with a dangerous streak of wasabi when an animated group of four new arrivals appeared next to me. The sushi chefs eyed them warily, because they appeared to intend to cluster around a single stool, the way people do at a bar. Soon it became apparent that they thought they were at the bar. But the people they mistook for bartenders were all busy slicing raw fish, so eventually the group moved on to look for somebody to make them a drink. Moments like this didn’t tend to happen at the original Nobu, but they do bring Nobu Downtown in line with Nobu Fifty Seven. In business on 57th Street since 2005, Nobu Fifty Seven is another two-story proposition. Between 5 and 7 p.m. its ground-floor lounge acts on young Midtown professionals like the fishing nets evoked by Rockwell Group’s design. At the time the second scene took place, the bartenders looked as if they were struggling not to get caught. My cocktail, a Negroni-esque thing with sake in it that was ferried to my upstairs table from the downstairs bar, was neither shaken nor stirred; it was, in fact, almost hot. While I was waiting for the cocktail to be cooled by its single ice cube, a server was struggling to open a bottle of Champagne for a table of at least 10 men next to me. When the cork came out, he managed to spray the room in a manner usually seen in the Super Bowl champions’ locker room. Everybody nearby got a little wet, including me and my guests, but nobody seemed to notice. Servers at both addresses have the brisk, well-drilled, impersonal and slightly numbed quality that comes of waiting on hundreds of people a day. At Nobu Fifty-Seven, one told me, “Our menu is kaiseki style, so it’s like tapas. Everything is meant for sharing.” I must have looked confused because he added, “Some dishes are going to be bigger than others.” Nobu Fifty-Seven was given three stars in its last New York Times review, by Frank Bruni in 2005. That’s what Ruth Reichl gave the original in 1995. After three recent visits to each location, I decided that, apart from minor menu variations, any qualitative difference in the food between the two branches is too subtle for me to make out. The chefs uptown are Taku Sato and Matt Hoyle. Downtown was led by Ricky Estrellado and Ryo Hasegawa until June, when Mr. Estrellado died suddenly. His successor has not been named. Both kitchens are models of superior ingredient shopping and consistent performance. When those classic Nobu dishes appear, they will be exactly like the last time you had them. In the case of the mayo-bathed fried shrimp, that may not be an entirely good thing. And I still think the flavor of the caviar that crowns tuna, or salmon, or yellowtail tartare gets elbowed out of the way by the wasabi-soy sauce. But the tiradito, slices of yellowtail squirted with lemon and yuzu juice, then dotted with puréed rocoto pepper, is always wonderfully bracing. The candylike black cod is as hard to deny as ever, even if the extra sweetening Mr. Matsuhisa gives this traditional Japanese dish strikes me as somewhat shameless. The sashimi salad and the lobster shiitake salads are both better than any salad from a global chain has the right to be. I don’t know who orders the dishes marked Nobu Now, but I tried a few. Umami Chilean sea bass: not worth it, even for the slightly exotic return of a fish that hasn’t been seen much since the ’90s. Kumamoto shooters: a thrilling series of flavors that will recall the way you felt the first time you ate at Nobu. Michele Goldsmith’s desserts, served both uptown and downtown, are modern and playful and don’t try too hard to follow the theme, whatever that is. Over the years, the Hudson Street Nobu became something unusual, a restaurant that could serve tourists and families from around the corner with equal aplomb. But a meal at Nobu is still among the best, although not the cheapest, ways to introduce children to raw fish. And sitting at the sushi bar can still provide the intimacy that the rest of the place lacks. The chefs behind the counter may not draw the kinmedai cultists who flock to Sushi Zo or Sushi Ginza Onodera, but they know what they’re doing, and they light up when they get a customer who can tell.

32,Le Sia,★,2018-08-14,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/14/dining/le-sia-review.html,East Village,"The rustic little shop held out longer than many other Ukrainian outposts in the East Village. With its shelves of records, tapes, books, newspapers, dyed Easter eggs, the beeswax styluses used to give those eggs their symmetrical patterns, white smocks and blouses with red and black embroidery, and local honey, Surma Book & Music Company had operated on East Seventh Street since 1943. At other addresses, it went back to 1918. Two summers ago, it closed, going the way of Ukrainian butcher shops selling wrinkled sticks of hunter’s sausage, Ukrainian restaurants offering starchy knobs of halusky, and Ukrainian bars where the customers were downing shots of vodka before that was cool, and kept going after it wasn’t. The East Village is a less interesting place without Surma. But the chain-store monoculture that might have seemed inevitable as the Ukrainian community fell away hasn’t been the neighborhood’s fate. Not yet. New Chinese restaurants have sprung up in the area over the past few years faster than the old Eastern European business have died off. In January, one of them moved into Surma’s old address. It’s called Le Sia, and it’s thriving. Walk in any weekend night between 6 and 9, and a small throng will be waiting for seats by the entrance, below the kayaks that are stowed up by the ceiling as if this were the garage of somebody’s summer house. During the week, Le Sia takes reservations, but that doesn’t ease the demand by much. On some nights, the crowd is almost exclusively Chinese people of college age or slightly older, many of them lured out of their nearby New York University dorm rooms for steaming pans of shellfish, especially Le Sia’s specialty, crayfish. Although a server there described the restaurant to me as “Cajun seafood,” Le Sia is not serving Acadiana-style crayfish. Nor is it seasoning crayfish with the magical, butter-drenched combinations of Southeast Asian and Louisiana flavors like Thai basil-tamarind and lemongrass-ginger that were spawned in Vietnamese kitchens along Bellaire Boulevard in Houston. Yang Liu and Tianye Chen, who own the restaurant along with its chef, Zac Zhang, are following a separate, unbuttered Chinese tradition that they enjoyed before moving to the United States. It’s a fairly young one, as Chinese food traditions go. Crayfish, or xiaolongxia, arrived in China sometime in the middle of the 20th century. After regarding the novel ingredient warily for a few decades, cooks built a cuisine around it. Eaters took to it so enthusiastically that by 2016 the Chinese crayfish industry employed five million people and was worth $27 billion. One major farming center is Hubei province, which recently unveiled a 59-foot-long crayfish sculpture that is said to be the world’s largest. Its bright-red pincers are raised victoriously. Le Sia cooks crayfish and other shellfish — lobster, shrimp, and Dungeness and snow crabs — by boiling them first and then clacking them around in a hot wok with one of seven sauces. Each sauce can be further customized to one of four chile-heat levels, from mild to “fire.” Whatever combination of sea animal and seasoning you ask for, it will arrive at the table almost before the words have left your mouth. For many customers the go-to order seems to be “crayfish hot and spicy, spicy.” Hot and spicy sauce, as far as I can make out, is based on soy, miso and garlic; the firepower comes from sliced pickled chiles, but the soy and miso give it a muscular heft. It may be my favorite Le Sia sauce, although it’s a close call between that and its near relative, “numbing and spicy,” which is propelled into tingling ma la territory by Sichuan peppercorns. I’m fascinated by the kimchi-lime sauce, which conforms to no seafood-boil tradition I know of; its flavor is angular, hybridized, invigorating and not as fiery as you might expect. The garlic sauce hits just one note, and there will be no prizes for guessing which one. There is also a sauce called “thirteen special-flavor herbal spices.” I tried it twice, with wildly divergent outcomes. The first time it was a wonderful, nuanced aromatic blend of expected and unexpected Chinese spices. On a second try, it tasted like spiced seawater. The star ingredient can vary, too. Honesty compels me to note that the California crayfish Le Sia has been serving lately have a sweeter, finer flavor than the ones it was getting from Louisiana in the late spring. This will no doubt cost me some friends in New Orleans. On the other hand, those friendships are already on the rocks over my newspaper’s insistence on calling the crustacean in question crayfish, rather than crawfish. Le Sia’s shrimp, in my encounters with it, was bland and powdery. Dungeness crab arrived overcooked, the meat desperately stuck to the shell. Snow crab was much better: sweet and flaky in the legs, although the white bits at the joints were slightly broken down. But every time I ordered lobster it was juicy and sweet. It may be the safest choice, although I haven’t completely given up on the crayfish entirely. At $15 for what looks like a very generous pound, it’s worth taking a chance. As for the risks of eating without a pair of plastic gloves, kept in plentiful supply in sealed pouches on the table, or one of the synthetic-fabric black bibs with their swirling red claw-and-antenna designs, that is up to you. A vast stretch of the menu is taken up by northern-Chinese skewers of vegetables and animal parts of many kinds. These tend to arrive even faster than the other dishes, if that’s possible. They are not bad as quick, casual snacks, particularly the “King of Kings” hot dog, carved into pink lobes that stick out like cat tongues. But other skewers suggest an assembly-line approach that you don’t find among the better street-corner grills in Flushing, Queens. The application of the cumin and red pepper seasoning is often just as heavy on delicate ingredients as full-flavored ones, and the grilling times don’t seem to be monitored closely. Tiny squid legs, lamb kidneys and enoki mushrooms were all dry and overdone. So was a main course of quail, purportedly smoked over lemongrass and pine cones. Wok-fried clams in garlic sauce were delicious, though, as were many of the cold appetizers, like a rose formation of pickled radish slices; smashed cucumbers in garlic sauce; and Harbin sausage. A specialty of northern China, Harbin sausage immigrated there from Eastern Europe. Pink and dense with smoked pork and fat, it is deeply reminiscent of kielbasa. It’s right at home in the East Village.","The Chinese Crayfish Craze Hits the East Village, at Le Sia","['rustic', 'little', 'held', 'longer', 'many', 'ukrainian', 'outpost', 'east', 'village',

33,Gem,★★,2018-08-07,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/07/dining/gem-review-flynn-mcgarry.html,Lower East Side,"Flynn McGarry arrived in New York three years ago as the chef of a pop-up restaurant, Eureka. He was 16 at the time, but he’d been charging money for tasting menus since he was 13, running an early version of Eureka in his mother’s house in the San Fernando Valley in California. Earlier this year he opened a restaurant on the Lower East Side that is meant to be permanent, or as permanent as any business venture in Manhattan can be. This one is called Gem, which if nothing else proves he’s better at choosing names now that he’s 19. I haven’t yet seen the new documentary about him, “Chef Flynn,” but over the past six years my media diet has not been lacking in news about Mr. McGarry’s productive adolescent years. I first learned about him from a brief New Yorker piece written when he was 13, by which time he had made many of the recipes in “The French Laundry Cookbook” and cooked for a week at Eleven Madison Park. He was working several days a week in a Los Angeles restaurant and had apprenticed at Next and Alinea by 15, when he was the subject of a Times Magazine article. When he moved himself and his pop-up to New York at 16, I read that his cooking was influenced by his time in the kitchens of Maaemo in Norway and Geranium in Denmark. Still, as I walked into Gem the first time I was wondering, at some level, whether everyone had been too polite to tell him that his brownies needed more time in the oven. Of course, it would be nice to have the answer to that before you buy advance tickets for the eight- to 12-course meal at $155 a person, the only way to reserve a seat. But it doesn’t take more than a few minutes at Gem to see that the adults weren’t just humoring Mr. McGarry. His cooking is nuanced, his plating is often lyrical and the flavors, at least this spring and summer, have been delicate, subtle and very fresh. The vegetables and fruits he uses in profusion look and taste as if they had dropped off the vine right on to the hand-spun, earth-toned ceramic dishes. My favorite Gem dish so far, delicate and self-assured, was a morsel or two of grilled king crab legs lightly glazed with rose petal miso and set beside soft chamomile-scented potatoes for ballast, red currants for zing and some fluttering rose petals on top for the heck of it. A close rival was the chilled bowl of barely vinegared mackerel interwoven with grilled cucumbers, sliced plums and salty red dabs of mashed fermented plums. The harmonies were right on key, with a Japanese mood that didn’t cross the line into outright imitation. White asparagus, an ingredient that seems to flummox some American kitchens, was subjected to a wonderful treatment, patiently browned and basted in butter, then finished with a reduced chicken jus that had a glimmer of vadouvan in it somewhere. Strewing the plate with tender, pale-green pine needles seemed like an affectation at first, but their flavor lifted and brightened the whole package. Mr. McGarry does fine work with deeper flavors, too. Each menu crescendos in a complicated, multicomponent spread, and the best of these featured lamb: barbecue ribs rubbed with cracked coriander seeds and XO sauce, plus a skewered grilled lamb kebab and a tomato salad. Another night built up to an exhibition of squab. A leg, perfectly cooked and sweetened by a maple jus, was very good, but the high point was a very thin and hearty rye cracker spread with squab liver, cherries and pickled ramps; the fruit’s bright notes were played off against earthier ones so skillfully they almost shimmered. Back in the family home, and at the Eureka pop-up, Mr. McGarry used to make everything himself. Now he works alongside two cooks, bringing the kitchen team at Gem to the same size as that of my neighborhood slice joint. Some small defeats could be attributed to Mr. McGarry’s lack of experience with weather patterns in the Northeast. A warm beet, languorously braised in smoked beet juice until it is soft and sticky like salt water taffy and then basted with a beet-based bordelaise sauce, was impressive in June. In July’s heat wave it was as welcome as a space heater. And maybe he wouldn’t have served starchy grilled peas if he’d known how quickly the summer sun can make them tough. By the way, Mr. McGarry doesn’t make brownies, at least not at Gem. Dessert after each of my three meals was more or less the same thing: bowls of ripe berries, served one night with whipped cream infused with chamomile and rose hips and another time with bay leaf and bee-pollen ice creams. You couldn’t ask for a more refreshing course on a hot summer night, but at the same time it’s clear that he has room to grow as a pastry chef. Dessert is served on low coffee tables in a loungey space called the Living Room, which by day doubles as a cafe selling pastries and sandwiches on housemade bread. Rousting diners from their tables in the dining room (called, aptly enough, the Dining Room), probably seemed like a good idea on paper, but in reality it’s a bit silly. It’s one of several hiccups that keep a meal at Gem from gliding smoothly along. Servers may shoot their cuffs before fiddling with some small detail of the table setting, a fussiness that is not in keeping with the graceful, relaxed tone of the cooking. Wine glasses could sit empty for long stretches and the wines themselves, both whites and reds, were almost always too warm. That Mr. Flynn is more polished as a chef than a restaurateur is understandable. He may need a more experienced partner to straighten out the dining room, and to help him edit the menus, too. With each meal, I had the sense there were at least two superfluous courses, and occasionally Mr. McGarry seems to be straining as he reaches for the sort of razzle-dazzle you’d get at Alinea or Eleven Madison Park. An elaborate lobster course one night looked amazing, but wasn’t. An attempt at eggplant carnitas, with an underseasoned salsa of green strawberries and a charred, papery tortilla, was enough to make you wish Mr. McGarry had eaten more tacos before he left California. At times Mr. McGarry seems like a creative-writing student who fills his pages with footnotes because David Foster Wallace did it. It’s too bad that he came of age in an era when many people believe that tasting menus are the highest form of kitchen artistry. Like the style of “Infinite Jest,” those menus have to be the result of ideas that can’t be contained any other way; they’re not a blank space to be filled in. Mr. McGarry obviously learned a lot from his mentors, but he can cook in his own voice now, and it may be time to leave his idols behind.

34,Coco Pazzo Trattoria,★,2018-07-31,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/dining/coco-pazzo-trattoria-yves-review.html,SoHo,"Coco Pazzo is back. Those of you who did not eat out in Manhattan in the 1990s have no idea what I’m talking about. Those who did may now be having flashbacks to a rustic-chic Tuscan-esque restaurant, Coco Pazzo, which got a three-star Times review from Marian Burros in 1991, and to its three New York siblings, all long gone. A restaurateur’s name may be emerging from the mists of time — the name is Pino Luongo — and linked to it, the names of other vanished restaurants, Le Madri, Mad. 61, Amarcord and Tuscan Square. For readers of tabloid gossip columns, images of pasta-twirling models and executives in Armani suits may be coming into focus, along with bold-face-laden squibs about the social scenes at Mr. Luongo’s establishments in Wainscott, N.Y., and on St. Barts. If you have trouble believing that spaghetti and fettuccine once attracted what The Times critic Bryan Miller, reviewing Le Madri in 1989, called “the hugs-and-kisses-I-love-your-hat-Ciao-baby crowd,” it may be useful to remember that this was an era when pasta was commonly thought to be a health food. Nobody has seen the Ciao-baby crowd in a while. (We’ll have to send out a search party if it’s not back in 10 more years.) So far that is not who goes to Coco Pazzo Trattoria, which is shaping up to be a reliable and fairly priced neighborhood canteen on the SoHo corner that used to house a deliberately unstylish bar called Milady’s. On balance, Mr. Luongo’s version of Tuscan food retrofitted for American appetites may be easier to see for what it is now that it has lost its fashionable gloss. (He is the executive chef; Pedro Cruz is his chef de cuisine.) When you order pappa al pomodoro and taste the juicy olive oil that slicks the warm, basil-flecked, bread-thickened tomato pulp, you’re not earning bragging rights. You’re eating soup, and a very good one. Nobody will think you’re a culinary trailblazer if you get the cacciucco, either, but you can console yourself with the tender shrimp, scallops, cod and clams in the faintly spicy and fennel-scented broth. There are two ways to approach dinner at Coco Pazzo Trattoria. (By day the place is a casual outfit called Coco Pazzo Kitchen.) One is to order what Mr. Luongo calls a piatto unico, a helping of pasta next to a related something-extra on one rectangular plate. Baked littlenecks wobble next to a twirl of linguine and, nice surprise here, ribbons of zucchini soaking in a fine white clam sauce that is made with just the firm, sweet bits. Soft chicken-and-ricotta polpettine sit next to rigatoni in sugo, not on top, so you can have pasta first and meatballs second and tell yourself you’re eating like a real Italian. Alternatively, you might go with the main courses marked “Per La Tavola.” For once these plates really are meant for sharing: a substantial stack of spiced and roasted baby-back ribs under a warm slaw of cucumbers and tomatoes, or a spread of grilled rib-eye slices served with a separate plate of “Tuscan fries,” distinguishable from the regular kind by their fried rosemary needles. Those fries may be awesomely browned one week but ghostly and uncrisp the next. The tagliolini cooked in the cacciucco broth as a second course after all the seafood has been eaten might be 60 seconds away from being al dente. I am not enthusiastic about the slightly tough squid in moist bread crumbs, baked rather than fried, although the dish has a following at Mr. Luongo’s other restaurant, Morso, next to the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge. The soufflés that the servers try to sell halfway through the meal can be a little soupy. But the blueberry crostata is a genuine pleasure, its crust likably sweet and tender. And you’ll appreciate the clean, bright flavors of a shot of Aperol dumped over grapefruit granita if, like me, you veer off-script and follow your piatto unico with a couple of main courses. SPEAKING OF laid-back restaurants where you can enjoy a pleasant and unpretentious summer meal, have you been to Yves? It opened without much of a splash about two years ago, despite occupying a handsome, spare dining room whose white interior makes the most of the afternoon sunlight that hits its TriBeCa corner, opposite the restaurant Locanda Verde. I missed the original chef’s tenure, but lately I’ve been intrigued by the cooking of Alex Baker, who took over in February. She is Paris-trained, having gone to culinary school and worked at Spring and Le Chateaubriand there, before coming to New York to help open Rebelle in 2015. At Yves, she interprets French food with an appealingly relaxed, seasonal attitude. In early June she brought little bright-green favas and sticks of asparagus together with fresh-herb pappardelle, and if you’re wondering what makes that French, the answer is a pistou loaded with tarragon and chervil. There was also a reassuringly gentle navarin of lamb, with a small spring garden in addition to the customary carrots and potatoes: grilled baby leeks and asparagus stalks, and tender chard stems. Pan-fried steelhead trout is on the menu now, with a smooth, pale-green sauce of cucumbers, melons and avocados pooling beneath a jumble of warm young cucumbers. So is a side dish of recently picked pole beans and string beans charred on the grill and dressed with toasted-almond vinaigrette. As interpreted by Ms. Baker, mussels Provençal are not the usual mound of black shells in thin pink liquid with a few slices of baguette; the shells are gone, the mussels are good fat ones and their sauce is more concentrated, augmented with tomato paste and roasted cherry tomatoes and garnished with thick-crusted cubes of toasted bread. The snails are more traditional, parsley-garlic butter sloshing around in their shells. If these land snails wondered what they were doing on a bed of seaweed, they didn’t show it. There is some unevenness in the kitchen to be worked out. The fluke meunière may be sautéed to a textbook golden crackle, or it could arrive looking as pale as a fish belly. The country ham sandwich could use bread that’s easier to chew than the crust-armored baguettes from Bien Cuit. The restaurant is large, and service tends to arrive in rapid bursts separated by long pauses. The wine list is very lopsided in favor of three-figure bottles, an irritating move for a fairly casual spot. But Ms. Baker seems to be making the best of it. It’s hard to be cross with a restaurant that makes its own boursin and brings it out in a dish so big I could never manage to finish it, even with a stack of toasted baguette to smear it on.","A

35,The Bar at Momofuku Ko,★★,2018-07-24,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/dining/momofuku-ko-bar-review.html,East Village,"There isn’t another bar in the city like the one that opened in February as part of the redesign of David Chang’s Momofuku Ko. One thing that sets it apart is that it doesn’t have a name. Credit-card receipts call it “Momofuku Ko,” even though it operates in its own little room with its own entrance. The door, a few steps past Ko’s along the East Village alley known as Extra Place, is marked “Ko.” The menus don’t give a name at all. They don’t look much like menus, either. They’re notebooks in which the items available, presented in a short à la carte list (in contrast to the hourslong tastings offered for $255 at Ko), are handwritten on a fresh page each day, by different employees using different pens. The date is at the top over a list of dishes that you will not find together anywhere else. Lately there has been a lucid, refreshing plate of raw sea scallops, sliced cold and mixed with fresh green shiso and folds of pineapple, red with ground chiles. Lightly cured fillets of sardine made a thrilling appearance last month in a brick-red oil flavored with paprika, cayenne, and other components of tandoori paste. Both were solidly in the tradition of Momofuku small plates that the world has known since Mr. Chang’s Ssam Bar began remixing various Asian ideas after-hours. Both were wonderful. The savory pie stuffed with fresh-made pork sausage patties comes from another place entirely. You could tour the city’s proudest French restaurants without coming across a more skillfully done puff pastry crust, notched like a pinwheel and baked to a deep mahogany. The pie costs $45 and typically serves two, sliced into half-moons. It is plated with a reduction sauce, as classical and French as it gets but with an insistent vein of acidity that somehow makes it modern. Even if you’re used to the signature Momofuku move of white-knuckle bungee jumping from the high end to the low, certain juxtapositions may call for Dramamine. Alongside the masterly pork pie, you can find a $5 sandwich of pickled daikon and cucumber sticks inside a grilled and buttered Martin’s hot dog roll. The pickle sandwich is just the thing to eat with the cold fried chicken that is battered three times, fried four times, brushed with a spicy mirin-yuzu glaze and served nearly at refrigerator temperature. I don’t believe I’ve used that phrase approvingly in a review before, but then I don’t think a restaurant has served me cold fried chicken as good as this before. By flipping through the menu pages you can pinpoint the dates when dishes were first served, and see others that came and went. The idea is for Ko’s executive chef, Sean Gray, to use the bar as a “field for research and development for our culinary team,” according to the website. Ideas are auditioned or refined before they graduate to Ko, which I gave three stars in a 2015 review. Most menus, at least the ones that change over time, are works in progress, but few make that explicit the way the one at Ko’s bar does. The cynical way to look at this is that bar customers are paying to serve as lab rats. This will not be everyone’s idea of a fun night out. One recent evening, the menu was as meat-heavy as at Ssam Bar in the era when its menus still proclaimed, “We do not serve vegetarian-friendly items.” Among the more substantial dishes that night was a mixed-meat sausage stuffed into a chicken neck and grilled. One end of the neck was open. The other was still attached to the chicken’s head. It was a sensational sausage, but it did nothing to make Ko’s bar the kind of place that you’d take your new pescatarian friend. The bar, run collaboratively by Mr. Gray and Su Wong Ruiz, the general manager, works best for diners who don’t need a multitude of choices to be happy. To the extent that it resembles other places, it’s probably most similar to a wine bar, with its tight menu, its casual drop-in-and-stay-awhile air and its carefully considered list of wines by the glass, which it shares with Ko. Anyone who wants a whole bottle can order one from the full Ko list, a virtual who’s who of cult winemakers in certain specialties such as grower Champagne, chenin blanc from the Loire Valley and Burgundy of all stripes. On the notebook page facing the handwritten menu are two more wines that Ambrose Chiang, the beverage director, is pouring by the glass for one day only. Recently I’ve lucked into a precisely shaped Côte-Rôtie from Domaine Jasmin and a Saumur from Romain Guiberteau whose self-assurance I envied. These specials can cost twice as much as the regular by-the-glass pours, which tend to fall between $15 and $25. I can’t figure out why the wine-geek crowd doesn’t bring tents and sleeping bags to camp out at Ko’s bar. And I don’t understand why the place is almost never crowded, despite getting a fair amount of press after it opened. The experimental nature of the menu can’t be keeping people away; people expect that from Momofuku restaurants. The only dish that I thought wasn’t totally successful was the fried zucchini made in the style of the fried chicken, and I was still glad I tried it. The prices are all over the place, but a meal here doesn’t need to be expensive. While you are welcome to spend $100 on a sourdough crepe with 50 grams of white-sturgeon caviar, you can just get the crepe alone for $8. It is excellent: shiny with tangy cave-age butter, speckled with oregano cinders and crunchy from a pass over hot Japanese charcoal. The chicken, meanwhile, is $7 a piece. The only reason I can think of for the empty seats is that the place is so hard to sum up. Try this description, then: Imagine an eccentric, highly polished David Chang restaurant that the world hasn’t heard about yet.

36,Una Pizza Napoletana,★,2018-07-17,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/dining/una-pizza-napoletana-review.html,Lower East Side,"Until the new Una Pizza Napoletana came along, I didn’t think it was possible for a restaurant to fight itself to a draw. In name at least, this is the fourth incarnation of the pizzeria that Anthony Mangieri founded in 1996 in Point Pleasant Beach, N.J. He has never run more than one Una Pizza Napoletana at a time; each time he moves to a new location, he closes the old one. In the East Village (2004-9) and San Francisco (2010-17), he essentially stuck to the routine he had established in New Jersey. At the two-month-old location on the Lower East Side, though, he is in business with two chefs, Jeremiah Stone and Fabián von Hauske Valtierra, whose sensibilities are wildly different from his own. Their two other restaurants, Wildair and Contra, are very contemporary and European in outlook. A meal at either one makes it obvious that Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have carefully studied Copenhagen’s foremost exponents of fermentation and foraging. Nothing about Mr. Mangieri’s rigorously traditional pizza indicates that he could find Copenhagen on a map. The three of them do have common traits. They take their cooking extremely seriously, favor simplicity and aren’t interested in easy ways out. So their collaboration — Mr. Mangieri is the pizza guy, of course, while his new partners handle appetizers, desserts and drinks — might not be doomed, but it isn’t exactly off to a promising start. The problem isn’t the common one of strengths in one area undermined by bad performance in others. Una Pizza Napoletana is almost all strengths, but they’re at war with one another. Mr. Mangieri is a purist’s purist. His dough runs on wild yeast. For each batch, he mixes a lump of starter into Sicilian sea salt, finely ground Italian flour and water. With this he makes a crust that is delicious on its own, a minimum requirement for great pizza. He makes pies in only one size, a wheel about 12 inches across. There are five on the menu most nights. None are topped with more than four ingredients, or six if you count oil and salt. On Friday and Saturday nights a sixth, more complicated pizza is offered. Requests for substitutions or added toppings are not entertained on any night. There is no point asking Mr. Mangieri to put pepperoni on a margherita or Buffalo chicken and blue cheese on a marinara. You would have better luck persuading the driver of the M5 bus to pop a wheelie on Fifth Avenue. The pies are at least as extraordinary as the ones he used to make in the East Village. They may be better. I don’t remember the imported buffalo mozzarella’s giving the pies the flavor of melted cultured butter back then, the way it does now. And did the tomato sauce — pulp, really — always have the same natural, sun-ripened sweetness? Especially on the marinara, unobscured by cheese and seasoned only with dried oregano, fresh basil and raw garlic, it’s almost hypnotic. The Concetta pie, which has four varieties of tomato treated four separate ways, probably would have been beyond his abilities as a chef in the Jersey Shore days. He makes it only on Fridays, which is too bad, because it’s great. The everyday pie called the Filetti, made with buffalo mozzarella and ripe red cherry tomatoes, manages to be surprising while sticking to Mr. Mangieri’s strict principles. It’s a personal creed that achieves transcendence — his “My Way,” to put it in New Jersey terms. I ate one non-transcendent pie at the new Una Pizza Napoletana, a Bianco, which is topped with buffalo mozzarella, raw garlic and basil. It was excellent the next time I had it, and I immediately knew what had been missing: salt. All the pies are $25. That is a lot for pizza. On the other hand, it is only about $2.50 more than what Mr. Mangieri charged when he first came to Manhattan in 2004, once you adjust for inflation. Then again, people said he charged a lot for pizza in 2004. Mr. Mangieri and his wood-fueled oven are located at the back of the dining room, enclosed by glass on three sides. No doubt this helps keep the wood fire from wilting the customers like basil leaves, but it’s hard not to see it as a metaphor for the restaurant. Mr. Mangieri’s pizzas leave the glass box, but his sensibility doesn’t. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have put their own point of view on everything else, and it’s not the point of view of a pizzeria. Everybody knows how to eat in a pizzeria; most of us have been doing it since we were kids. The choices are few and relatively predictable. Even when the pizzas are topped with weird stuff, you basically know what you’re getting. At the new Una Pizza Napoletana, only the pizzas are predictable. What are bland chunks of white asparagus under a yellow powder of cured egg yolk and bottarga doing here? Not making new friends, I promise you. There’s a fine, tender panna cotta with fresh fruit for dessert. One night the strawberry syrup spooned over it was essentially strawberry vinegar; on another night, its sweet-sour ratio was back in alignment. The other desserts I tried — a bittersweet tiramisù with a welcome crackle of caramel hidden in its layers, and some pure-tasting, impossibly smooth, eggless ice creams, including a pistachio flavor that has to be tasted to be believed — won me over from the beginning. None of the other appetizers were as charmless as the white asparagus. A freshly shucked sea scallop seasoned with translucent strips of lemon peel and individual dots of couscous was exceptional. And raw lobster surrounded by chickpeas was wonderfully jittery with an Italian citrus-chile paste. But the chefs serve it in a form — a chopped mass of unidentifiable goo — that can’t help but look off-putting. That dish would fit right in at Wildair; here, among the tomatoes and mozzarella, it seems to be trying too hard. The same goes for the wine list. As they have done in their other places, Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske focus on natural wines. These wines can be mercurial, and the way the list is written only adds to the confusion. Almost no varietals are named, and you can’t tell much from the Italian regions, which include such major hubs as Irpinia and Solicchiata. When, helplessly, you accept a server’s offer of assistance, you’ll be asked what you intend to eat with your wine. Are there any people other than sommeliers who want to talk at length about pairing particular wines with particular pizzas? I’ve never met them and if I do, I’m sending them off to be deprogrammed. Discussing the list, tasting a few samples, trying to find something that fits your idea of a good pizza wine (yes, for some reason there are wines on the brief list that don’t taste especially good with any pizza) — all this slows down the pace, which isn’t especially brisk to begin with. By the end of the night, your meal can last twice as long and cost twice as much as it would at almost any other pizzeria in town. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske aren’t doing bad stuff at Una Pizza Napoletana, but often they’re doing the wrong stuff. They and Mr. Mangieri have taken one of the most accessible styles of restaurant dining and made it complicated and a little intimidating. Una Pizza Napoletana doesn’t need to be predictable. But it could be more intuitive.

37,Frenchette,★★★,2018-07-10,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/10/dining/frenchette-review-restaurant-tribeca.html,TriBeCa,"Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson named their new restaurant after a David Johansen song from 1978, “Frenchette.” The first line is, “You call that love in French, but it’s just Frenchette,” and later when he rhymes that with “naturalette” and “leatherette” you know the suffix isn’t diminutive, it’s dismissive. The song is about what you do once you figure out that you’re not going to get the real thing, and Mr. Johansen’s answer is simple enough. “Let’s just dance,” he sings. Never mind love. Frenchette, which opened in TriBeCa in April, isn’t fake French, but it isn’t the real thing, either. Since 1997, when Keith McNally hired them as the opening chefs at Balthazar, Mr. Nasr and Mr. Hanson have cooked side by side, building a kind of brasserie-steakhouse hybrid out of standards from both genres. Mr. McNally kept loading them up with new restaurants, giving them joint command of Pastis, Schiller’s Liquor Bar and Minetta Tavern, none of which could really be called chef-driven. Frenchette, their own place and their first without Mr. McNally, takes some liberties with the formula, but not enough to get them recognized as visionaries on the level of Pierre Gagnaire. Frenchette says: Never mind art, let’s just cook. The restaurant is divided into two chambers. In front and on display to the street is a lounge with Art Deco curves, where bartenders percussively clack shakers behind a long river of zinc. If you have a seat, this room is the height of metropolitan civility. If you are waiting for one, as many people are on any given night, it’s purgatorial. The dining room is in back, behind a pair of arches and up a step so slight that its only conceivable purpose is to raise the insurance premiums; every time I approached it a worried server materialized to tell me to look out. The small tables are too small and the big ones, encircled by red-leather banquettes the size of living-room sofas, give you enough space to spread out a map while you eat. The room is grandly scaled and conspicuously underdesigned, a simplification of the brasserie archetype that doesn’t try to reproduce every chipped tile and nicotine stain. It’s a room for people who have outgrown illusions. That must describe half the people in New York, judging by the number of times I’ve been asked how to get a reservation at Frenchette at an hour when an adult might reasonably be in the mood for dinner. Even well-placed magazine editors with highly resourceful assistants can end up eating at 6 or 10 p.m., as I did. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] In the brasserie mode, the menu rambles. It goes on too long; not everything on it is worth rambling about. But once you sort it out, it’s full of dishes worth planning a night around. Some of them don’t look wildly impressive unless you know how they’re made. For each order of brouillade, a pan of eggs has to be stirred constantly over a small flame for a long time, until they look like grits. (There’s a reason you don’t see brouillade on many menus.) Dropped on top are a few excellent snails in parsley and garlic, a buttery garnish for very buttery scrambled eggs. Calf’s liver was sweet and custardy, the goal in cooking it, and one that’s not often reached. Sweetbreads with creamy white insides were fried to a pale, crinkled gold, then served with a brown, French, lovely and anachronistic sauce made from veal jus and crayfish. Lobster was roasted on a rotisserie, sending some of the shell’s flavor into the meat, which was then given a very luxurious bath in curry butter. The entire roast chicken is juicy without tasting of brine, a rare thing these days. Hidden under the drumsticks and thighs are rafts of baguette that sat under the rotisserie, imbibing every drop that fell from the bird. Some diners might say bread wet with drippings is too homespun for a dish that costs $68. They don’t know what they’re talking about. The menu is full of things that take years of practice to get right. Duck breast with a side of fries sounds ridiculously simple, but look at the crackle on that duck skin, and listen to that echoing crunch on the fries. If these chefs learned anything from Mr. McNally, it’s that people will overlook many lapses if you feed them great French fries. At Frenchette, they overlook the peculiar steak knife brought out with the duck; its sharp side is straight and its dull side is curved, and everybody who picks one up makes a joke about slicing open a finger. That would be one way to turn tables faster, but I never saw any casualties. The kitchen is at its most sure-footed with big pieces of animals, whether they’re classed as appetizers or main courses. (The guinea hen terrine appetizer is a chunky pink brick that could serve as dinner.) All those meats, combined with the chefs’ fondness for fat-enhanced sauces that cling to your lips, give the menu a wintry feel, something that the recent proliferation of peas and artichokes on the plates here doesn’t quite hide. So far, Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr have responded to the hot weather by changing ingredients but not the menu’s spirit. Green celtuce stems can be a nice crisp side dish for summer, but Frenchette serves them in a steaming-hot gratin, slick with bone marrow; it’s perfect for January. The blood sausage slab on top of a buckwheat galette that surfaced at the end of June was as seasonal as earmuffs. Reversing the natural order of the universe, the appetizers and the smaller “amuses” often seem more tentative than the main courses. Blowfish tails brushed with mustard and spice-bearing bread crumbs are terrific when they’re available, and the chefs should get some kind of award from the French government for serving iced oysters Burgundy-style, with peppery finger-length chipolata sausages. But gumball-size smoked eel beignets with a crème-fraîche ranch dressing called “Franchette” didn’t taste much like eel; pig-foot croquettes were a washout; and a bowl of oily whole-wheat spaghetti with bottarga needed to be slapped with more lemon and salt. With desserts, Frenchette tries the blunt approach that works so well for its main courses, and comes up short. Not very short, but enough to make you wish more attention were being paid. The mille-feuille doesn’t shatter on impact like the ones at Le Coq Rico or Benoit, and the pastry crust under the long band of cooked fruit in the apple tart needs to be crisper or more buttery. One of the more clever moves Mr. Hanson and Mr. Nasr made is hiring Jorge Riera to shepherd a list of natural, biodynamic and organic wines. Not every sommelier who has become infatuated with these labels knows where to find the good stuff, but he does. This means, though, that you will probably not end up drinking what you thought you wanted to drink. There are few safe harbors of familiarity; even if you just want sparkling water, you have a choice of Vichy Catalan or Mondariz. You’d have to be delusional to wager money on the longevity of a restaurant in New York, but Frenchette is the closest thing to a safe bet that I’ve seen in years. Mr. Nasr and Mr. Hanson seem to be in it for the long haul; if one of them hasn’t held the other’s head down in a pot of French onion soup by now, it’s probably never going to happen. More than that, they know how to flatter New Yorkers with food that doesn’t scream for attention but that smiles back when you notice it.

38,Restaurant Nippon,★,2018-07-03,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/dining/restaurant-nippon-review.html,Midtown,"Remember sukiyaki? The details were hazy in my mind until a few weeks ago, when a woman sheathed in a kimono carried a pot of it to my table at Restaurant Nippon on East 52nd Street. There it was: the onions, shiitake caps, bok choi stems, tofu blocks and the frizzy mop of noodles under a cloud of steam. The thin slices of beef going from red to pale pink. The hot broth that is based on soy and mirin but that strangely, magically tastes like French onion soup. The raw egg that, thanks to some long-forgotten cook’s flash of greatness, serves as a dipping sauce. This refresher course would have been unnecessary if I’d made myself a regular at Nippon years ago. The restaurant opened in August 1963, a few doors west of its current address, and has offered sukiyaki since the beginning. That summer radios across the country were playing “Sukiyaki,” Kyu Sakamoto’s oblique protest song that sounded like a love song but was, in the United States, renamed after beef stew for the simple reason that it was one of the few Japanese words almost all Americans knew. The dish was that popular. For modern New Yorkers who chase Japanese thrills at Shuko, Uchu, Tetsu and other restaurants that look and act like cocktail bars, Restaurant Nippon might seem anachronistic — Kyu Sakamoto in a Cardi B world. Over the years, though, it has served as an unofficial cultural ambassador, using its dining room and its menu to make a case for the Japanese way. The restaurant is designed in the shoin style of a traditional Japanese house. Surrounding a main dining room with Western tables and chairs are the private zashiki rooms where shoes are left outside, floors are hidden under tatami mats and servers materialize at the sliding doors with the push of a button. Many details, like the wallpaper that evokes the opulently stylized folding screens painted by Ogata Korin, are lovely. A few, like the drop ceilings, could use attention. Nippon introduced or championed so many dishes that today the menu preserves the recent history of Japanese food in the United States, the way the rocks of certain canyons in the West record the history of the prehistoric world. Tora fugu, the potentially toxic tiger puffer fish, made its first regular appearance outside Japan at Nippon in 1989, when the owner, Noboyushi Kuraoka, finally prevailed in his yearslong campaign lobbying the Japanese and American governments to allow importation of the fish. Mr. Kuraoka died in January; now the restaurant is in the hands of Yasuhiro Makoshi, the manager for more than 40 years, and Akira Azuma, who has been the chef for almost that long, and it probably remains the best place in town to try fugu. As sashimi, fanned out in transparently thin slices, it is lean and very firm, like fluke but slightly richer. Nippon sends it out with chives and a spicy daikon mash, which complement its quiet flavor, and cooked fragments of fugu, which don’t. The least expensive serving, what is called a “half portion” for $70, is just big enough to give four people a couple of bites each. If I were going to spend money on fugu again, though, I would make a beeline for the sperm sacs, or shirako. Barely broiled, either plain with salt crystals or brushed with a miso glaze, Nippon’s shirako is as smooth and thick as fudge, with a flavor that recalls buttered crab meat, among other things. Many firsts have been claimed by or on behalf of Nippon. Some of them may be true. Did it have the first sushi counter in New York? I am not convinced. In a 1963 Times review, Craig Claiborne wrote that Nippon had a tempura counter where sushi, “the traditional service of raw fish,” was also available. Today the sushi is respectable, if not on its own a reason to visit. Is it a fact that no other New York restaurant was making soba noodles in 1988, when Nippon began to do so? Certainly few places have gone to the same lengths in pursuit of soba as Nippon, which imported not just buckwheat seeds but also a buckwheat farmer from Japan, and planted both in a field outside Montreal. (For years the farm also supplied a sister restaurant, Soba Nippon, now closed.) Restaurant Nippon’s soba noodles are nutty, bouncy, springy, slightly rough and very good. I like them chilled, dunked in ponzu. Against my better judgment I even like the odd, Americanized soba salads, with a pile of noodles and meat or tofu on a platter with a fistful of lettuce. The custom-farmed buckwheat also goes into an astoundingly good thing called soba miso that comes smeared on a small wooden paddle. A black sludge of fermented buckwheat studded with buckwheat kernels, it looks like brownie batter and tastes a little like chocolate, too, as well as roasted nuts and espresso and cooked mushrooms. Whether negimaki was invented at Nippon or simply made its first United States appearance there, it’s hard to see why tough beef wrapped around undercooked scallions captured America’s imagination. More intriguing is another original, beef oroshi, essentially shabu shabu except that it is cooked offstage and you get nothing but meat and broth with some spicy grated daikon. This is also the birthplace of agedashi mozzarella. If you have ever wondered what fried cheese in dashi would taste like, you will find the answer here. The backbone of the menu, though, is traditional Japanese food, nearly all of it good and some of it better than that. There is fluke for those who won’t pay up for fugu, and it is just what you’d want it to be. Broiled eel over rice makes a wonderfully soothing meal. The kamonabe is a duck hot pot cooked over a burner set on the table. The duck may not be entirely tender, but it is flavorful. The broth is a symphony. For scale, theatricality and deeply reassuring flavor, its only rival is the sukiyaki, but the kamonabe comes with a dividend: a bowl of rice cooked in the leftover broth as a second course.

39,The Islands,★,2018-06-26,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/dining/the-islands-review.html,Crown Heights,"The Islands used to be a two-story restaurant on the Crown Heights side of Washington Avenue in Brooklyn, near the top of the hill, within sight of the Brooklyn Museum. Upstairs was a cramped, angular, shadowy dining room with a few tables under a ceiling so low it made tall people stoop. Downstairs was a cramped, angular, shadowy kitchen where oxtails, goat curry and other Jamaican dishes were cooked and sold. To the right of the door, behind a counter, was the restaurant’s single stove. It had three burners that were almost always going. No matter when I went there it seemed that about a quarter of the things on the menu had not finished cooking, but complaining would have been cloddish, both because the limitations on capacity were obvious and because whatever was finished was bound to be both nuanced and powerful. The whole operation was one of those precarious marvels of adaptive survival, like a pine growing from a crack in the side of a cliff. So the outlook was grim when news came two summers ago that the structures housing the Islands and another business were being torn down so a new apartment building could be constructed. This neighborhood and the ones to the south between Flatbush and Ralph Avenues owe much of their character to black- and immigrant-owned businesses, including a large swath of Caribbean restaurants such as the Islands. With developers sniffing at this part of Brooklyn, many of them are at risk. Marilyn Reid, who owns the Islands with Shuon Letchford, had other ideas. She had had other ideas since 2001, when she opened the restaurant. “We were always looking because we had outgrown it by the second day,” she said in a phone interview. “We knew.” Before closing the original space in March 2017, she and Ms. Letchford had found a much bigger one downhill on Washington Avenue. Preparing it took a few months more than she had hoped, but the second incarnation of the Islands has been up and running since January. [Read about some of the best new restaurants in New York City (for now).] The new kitchen has two stoves and 10 burners. Nevertheless, what’s available when I’ve gone has always been several dishes shy of the complete menu. The stewed okra with cod is especially hard to pin down. At the same time, the comfort of the bigger dining room and the table service, an impossibility in the first space, have encouraged me to branch out beyond my usual favorites. The Islands is best known for long-simmered stews but the kitchen also knows a thing or two about frying. The flattened fritters of salt cod seasoned with fresh hot chiles, known as stamp and go, were crunchy and golden. Some Caribbean cooks deep-fry fish escovitch to oblivion, on the theory that spicy vinegar heals all wounds. The escovitch I had at the Islands was a whole red snapper, obviously fresh and fried just until firm. The vinegar dressing, meanwhile, was seasoned with not just hot chiles but pickled bell peppers, carrots and cucumbers, making this escovitch more interesting than usual. From the old days, I knew the curried goat would be very tender and richly seasoned, although like most of the cooking at the Islands, it was never scalp-piercingly spicy. Now I’ve found a new standby in the curried vegetables — a very different thing, of course, but the golden raisins, turmeric and allspice may do even more for cabbage and carrots than they do for goat meat. Barbecue chicken was ordered in a rush verging on panic because whatever I’d first wanted wasn’t ready yet. The sauce is nothing like the ketchup-based sludge I’d imagined. Made with raisins and allspice, it tastes more like a glaze for a holiday ham, and it’s lovely. I prefer it to the jerk chicken, which will sound like heresy to some customers. Like barbecue, jerk can describe either a sauce or a process, and the process needs to involve wood smoke. The Islands bakes its jerk chicken in the oven, and while I like its sauce, when I want jerk chicken I will cross Eastern Parkway and keep the windows down until I smell burning allspice logs. But I have no quarrel with the jerk shrimp or leg of lamb at the Islands — there’s no place to get an allspice-smoked version of either, as far as I know. The lamb is especially alluring, stuffed with jerk spices and slowly roasted until its outer crust falls, upon slicing, into a dark rubble that in New Orleans would be called debris. Rice and peas, fried plantains and stewed cabbage, slippery with coconut oil, are all mandatory in my book. Others insist on baked macaroni and cheese, served in a brick the size of a pound of butter. When I taste the bread crumbs on top, and wonder if they’ve been seasoned with dried onions, I think those people may have a point. All of this food is brought to the table on oval platters that could hold a small Thanksgiving turkey. Since opening in January, the new dining room has been embellished bit by bit. The walls are painted in watermelon and aquamarine. Small hurricane lamps decorate the tables. A couple of weeks ago, plaid cloth napkins made their debut in the middle of dinner service. Menus, which used to be kept inside a clear plastic sheath, are now presented inside folders made of textured handmade paper, held in place with stickers of bumblebees and butterflies. The bar, across the dining room from the kitchen, is still unoccupied while Ms. Reid waits for a liquor license to come through. A rumored roof deck has not materialized, either. In the meantime there is an excellent limeade sweetened with demerara sugar and a dark purple, fruity sorrel punch, which can give the impression it has been lightly spiked with rum. Credit for the food at the Islands is shared. There are two chefs, Delroy Henry and Ronald Porter. Most of the recipes, though, are Ms. Letchford’s, and she does a lot of the cooking. Like Ms. Reid, all of them were raised in Jamaica before moving to New York, but only Ms. Letchford did any professional cooking there. Ms. Reid is often in the kitchen too. “I do the light stuff,” she said. “I tend to stay with salads, seafood.” Is the food as good as before? I used to be impressed that anything at all could be cooked at the old Islands. That so much of it was actively delicious seemed like a miracle. It’s less astonishing now that the kitchen has 10 burners and room to turn around. But I suspect the only thing that’s changed is me. And when I’m in the mood for something miraculous, I’ll just remind myself that the Islands is still in business. You can’t stop gentrification, but sometimes you can fool it while it’s looking the other way.

40,Legacy Records,★★,2018-06-19,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/dining/legacy-records-review.html,Hudson Yards,"Real estate developers used to wait for restaurants to illuminate the sidewalks before they’d start investing in a neighborhood. They don’t wait anymore. If there’s no Florent or Schiller’s Liquor Bar around, they simply have one built, synchronizing the opening with the move-in date of the first new apartments. This is the tactic being used by Hudson Yards, the glass-and-steel mountain range rising above a one-time dining wasteland where soon not just restaurants but an entire “restaurant collection” will flourish, including new projects from David Chang, José Andrés and others, all “curated” by Thomas Keller. And it is the approach taken by Henry Hall, a tower of rental apartments just north of Hudson Yards on West 38th Street. To give the place the atmosphere and the hangout opportunities of a boutique hotel, Henry Hall has turned its first two floors over to a wine shop, a cocktail lounge, a private dining room and a restaurant. I am telling you all this because that restaurant, Legacy Records, is unusually good and very popular and if somebody invites you there, you should know why you are having dinner down the street from the Javits Convention Center and a stable where Central Park carriage horses go to be hosed down at night. And you will also know why Legacy Records seems eager to suggest that it has local roots — so eager that it has essentially ginned up a history for itself that brings together sloppy research with a superficial tribute to black culture. It’s not a combination that will appeal to everybody. Like the bar and the wine store, Legacy Records is run by Delicious Hospitality, the company behind Pasquale Jones and Charlie Bird. The menu, as it is in those two restaurants, is essentially Italian, but less rustic and more expensive. This is the first time the group has routinely charged more than $30, and as much as $46, for main courses. (The prices, like the ones at Pasquale Jones but not Charlie Bird, include service.) I don’t know for sure whether Ryan Hardy, the chef and one of the three partners, has upgraded to better purveyors, but I do know I was taken aback, often, by the quality of the raw ingredients at Legacy Records. There was the raw sea scallop, so intensely fresh that its slices clung together stickily; Mr. Hardy had dressed it with dots of yogurt, tiny oval basil leaves, toasted almonds and tart little pink cells of finger lime. There was chilled Dungeness crab, a few pristine white chunks under sea urchin foam, to be spooned from a shot glass. And tiles of yellowfin tuna belly, not as fatty as bluefin but very rich all the same, under bits of salted lemon peel and a splash of colatura, the Italian fish sauce. Again with the main courses, I stopped and wondered: Where did Mr. Hardy find lamb (with snap peas and smoked cream) that tasted as if it had never eaten anything but fresh herbs? How did he find a rib-eye that’s so tender and deeply flavorful without being flabby? Mr. Hardy has been quick to make the most of what the market says is the first month of spring and the calendar says is the last. Creamy new-crop potatoes deserve a little appreciation before they’re sent off to root cellars, and Mr. Hardy built a fine appetizer around them with leggy broccoli sprouts and melting chunks of fresh mozzarella spiked with anchovy. Charred snap peas made a tangy salad together with ramps in a peppery buttermilk dressing. But sweet English peas were swallowed up by a too-sharp risotto; seasoned with prosciutto, the rice took on more of the ham’s saltiness than its sweetness. Legacy Records doesn’t say anything particularly original, but it has a finesse that’s new for this restaurant group. There’s an exceptional plate of grilled pigeon, neatly carved and served with swooshes of nettle purée. It is at least as impressive as the dish that’s becoming a breakout star for the restaurant: a duck breast, its skin rubbed with pepper, chiles, honey and fennel and then roasted until it has a deep, crusty bark that a Texas pitmaster would be proud of. Ordering wine is an event in itself. Robert Bohr and Grant Reynolds, who are Mr. Hardy’s partners and the resident wine soothsayers, have seen to it that cultists can rub elbows with the Agraparts, Raveneaus and Gajas, while the rest of us will still find a few bottles under $100 from some of the most expensive arable land on earth. Oddly enough, the wine list makes less of an impression than the ones at Charlie Bird and Pasquale Jones, simply because you’d expect an ambitious cellar in a restaurant this expensive. Then again you might also expect a smart, artful dessert menu; if so, you’re out of luck. There is ice cream with strawberries, a dark chocolate meringue and a selection of gelati, served in a cone; all perfectly pleasant, but there’s more wit and creativity in the excellent cocktail roster administered by Jeff Bell. I’m sure there are people who are reluctant to go to Legacy Records because of how relentlessly noisy this team’s downtown restaurants are. But they seem to have sent the acoustics to obedience school, because all the sound waves do what they’re told: Conversations stay at their own tables, while the music stays in the background. Ken Fulk, who designed all the public spaces in the building, covered some wall panels with grasscloth, put glove-soft leather on the tabletops, and found other ways to dampen the noise. Legacy Records certainly doesn’t look like any other restaurant; Mr. Fulk went to extremes, using some motifs from the 1980s — emphatic grids, metallic finishes, whites and country-club greens — that not everybody is ready to see resurrected. Hanging in the bar is a 2006 photograph by the artist Mickalene Thomas of a black woman with an Afro and a giraffe-print shirt posed in front of albums by Stevie Wonder and Diana Ross. It has a counterpart on the second floor, a mural behind the bar based on the Ernie Barnes painting seen on Marvin Gaye’s album “I Want You.” Along with the constant hip-hop and vintage soul soundtrack and the restaurant’s name — taken, we are told, from a recording studio that once stood on this site — Legacy Records tries to present itself as a homage to another era in music. If Legacy Recording Studios had been used by Mr. Gaye, Mr. Wonder and Ms. Ross, that homage might make sense. But it didn’t. Lasting just from 2001 to 2009, the studio was built for and mostly used by orchestras, Broadway cast recordings and commercials. Legacy Records has taken this shred of history and turned it into a fantasy of black American music. Exhibited in a museum or gallery, Ms. Thomas’s photo might be taken as a comment on the different postures and personas available to black women. Hanging it next to the counter where pastries and coffee are sold by day strips out some of its meaning; it looks like an attempt to buy a personality for a restaurant that doesn’t have one of its own. If anyone gets to decide who can use black culture for what purposes, it surely isn’t me. But Legacy Records uses it in a gratuitous and offhanded way that made me uncomfortable. Stevie Wonder will always be cool, but a restaurant dreamed up by real estate developers doesn’t automatically become cool by putting him on the wall.

41,Shabushabu Macoron,★★,2018-06-12,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/dining/shabushabu-macoron-review.html,Lower East Side,"At some fateful moment in the 13th century when Kublai Khan was preparing to lead the Mongol hordes into battle, hunger struck. With no time to make a roast or stew, the legend goes, the Great Khan’s chef carved very thin slices of raw mutton and plunged them into hot broth for a few seconds. Besides serving as an inspiration to those of us who believe there is always time to eat, the chef’s impromptu recipe is said to have given China its ancient and delicious hot pot tradition. Hot pots did not jump to Japan until shortly after World War II, when kelp joined the broth and the name was changed, onomatopoetically, to shabu shabu. But like hot pots in China, shabu shabu is a do-it-yourself bash where everybody around the table gets to dunk and swish the ingredients they like best. Chefs are not required. Then on Delancey Street last fall, a new shabu shabu restaurant appeared where a chef standing behind a counter does all the cooking for no more than eight people at a time. Her name is Mako Okano. Out of a style of dining that has always been a big, informal free-for-all, she has built a quiet, refined, intimate spot called Shabushabu Macoron. Usually backed up by two other women, but occasionally working solo, Ms. Okano moves deliberately. She will gesture to the place mat, where the night’s eight or 10 courses are written out in Japanese, right to left, and then to another slip of paper with the same courses printed in English, again right to left. The price is $128. There are no choices to be made. Ms. Okano has modeled her restaurant on omakase sushi bars, where the chef calls the tune. When I first arrived, I admit that I couldn’t see the point of having a chef do the cooking when I was perfectly able to do my own dunking and swishing. Ms. Okano quickly poured two or three mouthfuls of yeasty, warm unfiltered sake into a little saucer. This arrived with a snack — cured salmon and salmon roe seasoned with fermented rice — that artfully underscored the sake’s flavor. Then she turned and quietly addressed a sauté pan over the stove. When she turned around again she had cooked an omelet and flicked it into a roll in the Japanese style. Served in a bowl of hot, clear dashi, the egg was as tender and delicate as its garnish, a tiny piece of mitsuba stem tied into a knot. Next she poached two pieces of abalone for a few seconds each in abalone broth. One she dabbed with a small, intense blip of the Japanese spice paste yuzu kosho. Over the other she spooned a sauce made from the abalone’s liver. I ate them both, and was flooded first with pleasure then with embarrassment that I’d thought simmered food wasn’t worth a chef’s time. By the time I’d eaten a small tongue of sea urchin combined with silky rags of yuba still dripping with soy milk, I was on board for anything Ms. Okano wanted to cook. For some time the bubbles in an iron pot of dashi set over a countertop burner had been getting bigger and faster. Thin strips of Wagyu beef, streaked with so much fat they looked like stained glass, were stretched out on black slate with pinkish bands of pork belly. Raw vegetables — cabbage, lettuce, enoki and shiitake mushrooms, half a brussels sprout and a cherry tomato on a wooden spear — waited on a nearby plate. Before I knew it she had cooked the first piece of beef — was it the A5 from Miyazaki or the A4 from Kagoshima? The flesh had twisted itself around, and now dusk-gray outer curls hid inner curves of faded pink. The flavors moved in rapid waves: first a few clinging, savory drops of dashi, then some already-melted beef fat, followed by the flavor of the lean meat itself, sweet and refined. Finally came a second helping of fat, freshly melted now. When Ms. Okano fished out a piece of beef, she would suggest seasoning it with one or more of an almost comically large assortment of condiments and purées that she makes herself. She seemed to favor her ponzu, and so do I; it’s more radiant with yuzu than any I’ve had before. I also liked the sweet soy once I learned to doctor it with a few drops of what Ms. Okano calls “gravy sauce,” a dark liquid that makes meat taste meatier. Many dismal meals would be saved if I carried an eyedropper of gravy sauce around with me. Swabbing the pork belly in the sticky, thick sesame paste with toasted sesame seeds produces an effect similar to, but more subtle than, the combination of peanut butter and bacon. It’s even better with a smear of salted plum, or a few drops of the yuzu-olive oil sauce that seems to have jetted in from Italy. The vegetables were spotless and fresh. A meal without them would be off kilter, perhaps to a degree that would cause grumbling from the digestive system, but on their own they are not a reason to go to Shabushabu Macoron. The chicken meatballs are, though. So are the green tea soba noodles that Ms. Okano somehow manages to cook in between everything else without seeming to leave the few square feet behind the counter. Soba is not standard with shabu shabu, but it is something she has experience making from her time in the kitchen at Cocoron, a soba-ya across Delancey Street. When she began talking about her dream of opening what she hoped would be the world’s first omakase shabu shabu restaurant, Cocoron’s owners listened. When she came back from a dunk-and-swish tour of Japan, they signed on as her partners. At times, it seems as if Ms. Okano can’t believe it all worked out. After she’d cooked me three nearly identical meals, I wondered if she’d still be as giddy a year from now. Will she be able to change the menu with the seasons to keep things interesting? Can she stash surprise ingredients below the counter for repeat customers, the way sushi chefs do? None of these questions occurred to me the first two times I ate at her restaurant. I just sat there in something like a state of wonder while she cooked for me. This is, bizarrely, a rare experience at tasting counters, where chefs are often intent on intricacies of plating. The physical setting of Shabushabu Macoron strongly suggests a shoestring budget — the paper towel roll in the restroom hangs from what may be an actual shoestring — but sitting there while Ms. Okano stands a few inches away and makes your dinner is one of the most luxurious experiences this city currently offers.

42,Don Angie,★★,2018-05-29,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/dining/don-angie-review.html,West Village,"Ever since Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone began rehabilitating chicken Parm and Neapolitan cookies around 2010, I’ve been waiting for other restaurants to carry the torch of Italian-American food boldly into the future. This is a major branch of American cuisine, too important for its fate to be left to the Olive Garden. For the most part, though, the torch has gone uncarried. I have been told that Palizzi Social Club, in Philadelphia, may qualify, but because Palizzi is a veritable club — members and guests only, no new applications accepted — I don’t expect to eat there before the nation’s tricentennial. Then in October, a place opened in the West Village that seemed to hit all the right tropes. It’s called Don Angie. Two chefs share the kitchen — Angela Rito and her husband, Scott Tacinelli — and they make versions of chicken scarpariello, antipasto salad and braciole. The dining room brings back the high-glitz Italian restaurant décor of the 1970s and ’80s, the period when Formica and oil paintings of the Bay of Naples went out and mirrors with gold pinstripes came in. The floor is a black-and-white checkerboard. The bar is made of polished marble the color of beef carpaccio. There is a house Chianti, and it comes in a straw-covered bottle. There is hope for a red-sauce renaissance, after all. Unfortunately, more or less from the day it opened, having dinner at Don Angie has been only marginally less difficult than eating at a private club. That has something to do with Ms. Rito’s and Mr. Tacinelli’s knack for cooking things that Instagram can’t resist. The two spent three years running the kitchen at Quality Italian in Midtown, where they engineered, among other pieces of shutterbait, a chicken Parm that looked like a pizza. There was some wonderful stuff at Quality Italian and some less wonderful stuff, and almost all of it either arrived on trolleys or was prepared at tableside or set on fire while you watched. The restaurant group behind Quality Italian, Quality Branded, is also backing Don Angie. So as I resigned myself to eating at Don Angie close to 5:30 p.m., when I managed to get an unreserved table, I also braced for a dose of abracadabra. It arrived right on schedule with my first drink, which a server strained into a glass through a coffee filter cone lined with espresso ice. It was called Americano, Americano, and combined at least three meanings of the word: a highball, an Italian aperitif wine and a diluted shot of espresso. The Americano highball, so simple that just about any bartender can make it, doesn’t need much improvement. But I have to admit that the coffee did give it some ballast. I’m also happy to report that this was one of the last bits of stagecraft I saw at Don Angie. Ms. Rito and Mr. Tacinelli have a few tricks up their sleeves, but they save them for the kitchen. The result is food that is creative in a more interesting and more consistently successful way than it was at Quality Italian. And it arrives at the table without the aid of trolleys. When you get a Caesar salad, the server doesn’t whip together the dressing on the spot. It’s been done in the kitchen, where the chefs replaced romaine with tender chrysanthemum leaves that taste like some newly discovered herb. (The feathery leaves firmly grip the dressing and the fluffy rasped cheese, too.) I can’t remember seeing chrysanthemum in an Italian restaurant before, and it shows the chefs’ skill for cross-pollinating with other cuisines, especially Asian ones. While the Torrisi-Carbone axis is generally faithful to Italian-American standards, using more expensive ingredients and more modern techniques but leaving the basic ideas intact, the Rito-Tacinelli approach is more radical. They trample on tradition when they feel like it. Prosciutto and honeydew melon are tossed with candied hazelnuts and mint leaves in a lime, tamarind and fish-sauce dressing. This very good salad, which obviously glances toward Southeast Asia, is a smart way to handle an antipasto standby that is usually pointless except when melons are in season. Their garlic bread turns out to be a very thin disc with garlic chives and melted cheese inside and sesame seeds on top. Lightweight, salty and irresistible, it’s modeled on Ligurian focaccia di recco, but it may also bring to mind Turkish gozleme, Azeri kutab or even a Chinese scallion pancake. There’s China again, in the pepperoni fried rice served under barbecued squid. Ignore the squid unless you like it leathery, and just focus on the rice, stirring it with labneh when the heat starts to rise. The dish everybody has seen on Instagram is the pasta called caramelle. In Italian it means caramel, as in candy, but the shape will remind most Americans of an elongated Tootsie Roll, with twists at either end of a drum that’s filled with buffalo ricotta. Cameras come out because the dough is striped, with black sesame-flour bands alternating with ordinary egg pasta. The sesame barely registers; the fun of the dish is the sauce, a peppered, pickled cantaloupe that tastes like it’s still percolating. But the dish that could be Don Angie’s lasting contribution to the pasta sciences is the garganelli with meatball ragù. The central problem of red-sauce restaurants is this: Pasta and meatballs are always served together, but they remain stubbornly separate. Ms. Rito and Mr. Tacinelli have found a way out of this conundrum by crushing meatballs into a tomato-guanciale ragù. It’s not quite as simple as I’ve made it sound, but you don’t know that when you’re eating it; you just think you’re magically eating meatballs and pasta at the same time. They’ve also tried to salvage chicken scarpariello, a dish that is almost always overcooked. Their solution is to make a kind of pie with chicken meat pressed down into a kind of crust made of sausage. The flavors are accurate, and for once it’s not dry, but it’s not as engaging as other main courses, like the veal cutlet with speck and pickled mustard seeds, or the grilled fillet of orata next to herbed fregola, with buttermilk as the sauce. Reworking tiramisù almost never improves it, but as a change of pace I did like how the one at Don Angie shifted the emphasis from espresso to bittersweet cocoa. There’s a delicious, if more conventional, plate of tender, light zeppole with tangy whipped robiola under an Andy Warhol mop of spun sugar that people go wild for. I was charmed by a smaller, quieter dessert: a mochi cake stuffed with fior di latte ice cream, with sea salt and a fragrant scribble of olive oil. It’s like eating a mozzarella ball that wanted to become a dessert when it grew up, and did.

43,Wokuni,★,2018-05-22,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/dining/wokuni-sushi-japanese-restaurant.html,Midtown,"Can anybody who has to think about the price of groceries still keep up with the sushi scene in New York? Just in the past year we’ve gotten at least five omakase-only sanctuaries — Sushi Noz, Sushi Amane, Noda, Shoji at 69 Leonard Street and Ichimura at Uchu — where the price of a meal, before drinks and tax, is somewhere between $250 and $300. If you were already inclined to think that the Japanese seafood game, like so many other things in Manhattan, is rigged in favor of the robber barons, these restaurants won’t change your mind. But the next time you despair of ever tasting another slice of yellowtail, I’d suggest dropping into an izakaya called Wokuni for lunch or dinner. A short detour from Grand Central Terminal, it has been in business since October. So far it has not drawn much attention to itself. Given the mixed messages it sends out, this is understandable. It has soaring ceilings, a backlit bar with shelves so high the topmost bottles can be reached only by a gymnast, an undulating wall of overlapping tiles that suggests Frank Gehry in his fish-scale period, and a constant dance beat in the background that won’t stop no matter how hard you cry. In other words, it looks like the Asian fusion restaurant in the lobby of a W hotel built around 1999. The menu sings another tune, though. It is full of traditional izakaya dishes like tofu agedashi and chicken karaage, rounded out by sashimi and grilled skewers. There is one twist, though: Wokuni is much, much more interested in seafood than the average izakaya. As a rule, the fish at Wokuni is exceptionally good and almost bizarrely fresh, shipped daily from the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo or from a fish farm in Nagasaki owned by the restaurant’s parent company, Tokyo Ichiban Foods. (Its admirable motto: “We are changing the dietary culture in Japan with persistence.”) Raw or cooked, the seafood at Wokuni sets it apart from other izakayas in New York, best seen as embassies of Japanese drinking culture in which the food plays the role of the ambassador’s chauffeur. Sushi is rare at standard izakayas, but it is made and sold at Wokuni, at very moderate prices. While many omakase chefs age their fish to make it supple and relaxed, the sushi at Wokuni is almost insolently fresh. And if you merely get a few $5 pieces of king yellowtail sushi, or $6 pieces of sea bream sushi, and maybe a slice or two of golden-eye snapper sushi at $9 each, you won’t regret it. The fish will be shiny. It will probably be chewy. The pinks and reds and ivories and whites in its flesh will be as distinct as if they’d been painted on with a nail-polish brush. But sushi is not the highest use of Wokuni’s seafood. What the place lacks are the seasonal fish that can make a sushi excursion really memorable: gizzard shad, striped jack, firefly squid. When it comes to sashimi, though, this is not much of a liability, and the firmness of Wokuni’s fish becomes a point in its favor. Before ordering sashimi — or, in fact, anything else — check the daily specials posted by the chef, Kuniaki Yoshizawa. They will almost always include several cuts of bluefin from farm-raised fish. If you come very early for lunch and manage to get the Wokuni don, a special that centers on a sashimi rice bowl and shrimp tempura, it will strike you as an incredible bargain at $24. The kitchen makes only five Wokuni-dons a day, though, so chances are you will have to content yourself with the kaisen-don, and chances are that even though it doesn’t include tempura, the $18 you pay will still seem like one of the best raw-fish deals in town. Things get even more intriguing when Wokuni’s seafood comes into contact with heat. Again, the specials should be your starting point. There may well be a grilled yellowtail collar. If you are in the habit of ordering this at your favorite izakaya, it is a good bet that you will be surprised by how much cleaner and sweeter it tastes here. Bluefin collars and jaws are not served often enough for anybody to get into the habit of ordering them. The grilled collar at Wokuni one recent night was one of the greatest pieces of cooked fish I’ve had in a long time, every bit of it worth chasing into the hollows of bone, skin and cartilage where it hid. It is not always available, but the grilled bluefin tail is, carved into a steak with the backbone sliced open so you can get at the teaspoonful of hot, clear jelly inside the spine. Mr. Yoshizawa has had the surprising idea of treating the angles and corners of the sea bream’s body like chicken wings. Tucked into triangles, fried until crunchy and served with lemon, they are meant to be gnawned on between sips of sake. On the other hand, ei hire, a frequent special of cured, dried skate fin cut into squares, makes a chewy and likable sidekick to beer. Fish and chips, of course, will go with either — the fish species changes from night to night, but it tends to be extremely fresh, crunchy and light on batter. The chips, made from the Japanese mountain yam, were never crunchy and always needed more salt. Sometimes salt came with them, and sometimes it didn’t. Those yam fries are an example of what happens once you venture away from seafood at Wokuni: The ingredients aren’t doing the heavy lifting anymore, and everything tastes sort of, well, ordinary. Certain things are on the right side of ordinary, like the fried tofu in dashi; the warm rolled omelet, particularly when topped with grilled freshwater eel; and the tender, ghost-white baby sardines with grated daikon. Others are on the wrong side, like the grilled scallops in butter and the monkfish liver that strongly recalled canned cat food. If I worked in the neighborhood, I would eagerly return at least once a week, sticking as closely as possible to the fish specials. I doubt I’d get bored, but I would keep my eye out for something that Wokuni could put on the menu, but so far hasn’t. The parent company runs a farm that raises tiger blowfish, and about 50 restaurants in Japan that serve it. Tiger blowfish is supposed to be the most delicious kind of fugu. I think New York could make it feel appreciated on Lexington Avenue.

44,Simon & the Whale,★★,2018-05-15,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/dining/simon-and-the-whale-restaurant-review-flatiron.html,Flatiron,"I was drinking gin and pineapple juice at the bar of Gabriel Stulman’s newest restaurant, Simon & the Whale, and tasting folds of tongue pastrami laid over caramelized cauliflower, a combination that paid off against long odds, when applause broke out by the entrance. I hadn’t heard anyone drop a glass or sing “Happy Birthday,” so I asked the woman next to me, who had eaten there three or four times already, if she knew what the sudden ovation was about. “Have you been to Gabe’s other places?” she asked. “They like to clap for people.” I hadn’t noticed that, but there were other Stulman touches that had been transferred from Bar Sardine, Jeffrey’s Grocery, Fedora and Joseph Leonard to Simon & the Whale when it opened in February. Case studies in how to maximize miniature spaces, they are intimate neighborhood hangouts with elevator-size kitchens where the food and cocktails are more interesting than ought to be achievable under such conditions. It’s a genre Mr. Stulman understands as well as anybody in the city. With 76 seats in the new Freehand hotel on East 23rd Street, Simon & the Whale isn’t one of those. It’s an Army mess hall by the standards of Mr. Stulman’s Happy Cooking Hospitality group. But the design firm Roman and Williams has styled it like a California Craftsman house and subdivided it into niches and corners with open cabinets. It doesn’t display its size the way Upland, another Roman and Williams project a few blocks north, does. Even the bar is personably scaled; it’s configured like a horseshoe. Extensive personal research suggests this is the best possible shape a bar can have. Like all of Mr. Stulman’s places, Simon & the Whale is thick with high-volume conversations when it is full, which is pretty much all night long. Like Jeffrey’s Grocery and Joseph Leonard, its name comes from a relative — in this case, Mr. Stulman’s 6-year-old son, who apparently received an impressive collection of whale-decorated baby gifts. Also familiar to Mr. Stulman’s regulars will be the style of the servers. They’re young, talkative, fresh-faced, enthusiastic, as if they are new to the city and haven’t yet grown the protective exoskeleton of the hardened New Yorker. Our waiter one night showered us with recommendations for dishes, all of which he loved. We asked him about things he hadn’t mentioned. He loved those, too. He loved the cocktails, a Happy Cooking strong suit, and was especially keen on one made with mezcal. “Mezcal never hurt anybody,” he said brightly. Extensive personal research suggests this is untrue. One place where Simon & the Whale allows itself to spread out beyond the normal boundaries of the Stulman kingdom is breads and desserts. The restaurant shares a baker, Zoe Kanan, and a pastry chef, Charmaine McFarlane, with the hotel’s second-floor cafe, Studio, also run by Happy Cooking. Both are very good at their jobs. Ms. Kanan makes the black, thick-crusted barley-rye bread flecked with anise seeds that comes with a halfhearted taramosalata and, more excitingly, a swipe of butter creamed with seaweed powder. The long thin toast, crackling with grains and seeds that sits under cured and smoked Arctic char and smoked sour cream? Hers. The poppy-seed torpedo roll that helps lift the fish sandwich with carrot-squash slaw above the ordinary? Also hers, although to be fair the long, flat fries also do their part. And if your spirits have been sunk, as mine have, by the skimpy and uninspired dessert choices around town these days, Ms. McFarlane will be an answered prayer. No mere afterthought, her panna cotta sits on a low base of semolina cake and is decked out with pink grapefruit fillets and grapefruit marmalade spiced with red juniper berries. A cooling evergreen moat of pine ice surrounds an earthy rye pudding that’s enriched with brown butter; pears fried in honey are splayed out on top, and some acerbic cranberries prevent the whole thing from cloying. I defy you to eat it without smiling. I can’t say I’m as taken with crunchy knotweed-rhubarb compote as a topping for a buckwheat cake as Ms. McFarlane seems to be, but the same dessert offers one of the most astonishing ice creams around. Made with beeswax, it is as deeply aromatic as honey but not as sweet, and its texture is intensely creamy but not at all waxy. The rest of the menu is in the hands of Matt Griffin, until recently in charge of the food at Fedora and Bar Sardine. He does a neat balancing trick here, giving his adventurous side free rein at times while more often using it to add interest to the standards a hotel restaurant probably needs. A winningly over-the-top recent special was a custard-soaked pain perdu under bacon jus, pickled cabbage and speck, like some kind of demented Reuben-croque monsieur hybrid. Liver and onions turned out to be a less thrilling snack: pickled onions with deep-fried and overcooked chicken livers. Until it swam off the menu, there was an intriguing sideways version of squid ink risotto that had beech mushrooms and very tender squid confit over a black porridge of barley. Now there are spring peas, swirled with mint into a sauce for just-firm shrimp; the combination suggested pasta, but I was glad to have it without any starch getting in the way of the clear, sweet flavors. If it’s pasta you want, Mr. Griffin has a glossy, chile-speckled bowl of spaghetti acqua pazza with littleneck clams and cherry tomatoes, and while the sauce is thicker and glossier than a normal acqua pazza, it is very good. What he calls a pork-collar Milanese is maybe a few millimeters too thick for the name, but I’ll take it. The cut is more flavorful than a normal cutlet, and the apricot mostarda makes a pungent and welcome counterpoint. If you can’t finish the whole thing, it will be taken away and replaced by a plastic action figure of a New York sports hero. This is your claim check. Mine was Don Mattingly, and I wondered if maybe the applause was for him. No, Mr. Stulman said on the phone a few days later. The woman he bought Fedora from, who has since died, was 89 when she sold it and was still showing up each night. When she entered, people clapped. “We turned that into clapping for our friends,” he said.

45,Soogil,★★,2018-05-08,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/08/dining/soogil-review-east-village.html,East Village,"A little skepticism is in order when you hear about the work history of a chef running a kitchen for the first time. As frequent diners know from sad experience, it is, in fact, possible to cook in an acclaimed restaurant without picking up any of the qualities that it’s acclaimed for. Even when actual skills have been learned, they are not always obvious. Or, occasionally, they’re all too obvious, and you’ll catch somebody in a two-person kitchen trying to replicate dishes originally assembled by a team of 40. One interesting thing about Soogil Lim is that you can almost draw a straight line from his résumé to what’s on the table at his four-month-old restaurant in the East Village, Soogil. It’s easy to spot the imprint of Hooni Kim’s Hanjan, where he was the executive chef for four years. Mr. Lim lived in South Korea until he was 28, so what he learned at Hanjan was not how to make the country’s traditional food but how to rework it into appealing, contemporary small plates. Daniel, where he spent seven years and reached the rank of sous-chef, turns up in the French techniques Mr. Lim leans on, in the crisp presentations that carry an echo of nouvelle cuisine, in the tender braised short rib, in his fondness for foie gras and in his preference for skillfully modulating flavors rather than tossing umami grenades. It’s also apparent, when you look around the dining room, that in his earlier jobs Mr. Lim spent most of his time in the kitchen; the lineage you taste in his cooking doesn’t show up in the design. Soogil (SOO-gil) doesn’t evoke a rambunctious Korean pub the way Hanjan does. Nor is it a carpeted and tableclothed luxury liner, like Daniel. Under the guidance of Mr. Lim’s wife, Sasook Youn, the dining room has been done in what we now recognize as the all-purpose Modern Asian style — a long banquette of blond wood against one wall, a dining counter facing another wall, and a long communal table with benches running down the middle, all of them sitting on a plank floor. A few framed prints by Suzy Taekyung Kim, a New York artist from South Korea, are suspended over the banquettes. French windows on the street can be thrown open if the weather ever cooperates. Hanging in the back is a curtain. Once in a while it parts just wide enough for Mr. Lim’s face to appear while he scans the tables. Sometimes they are full. They should be full all the time, because cooking like this does not just sprout up through every crack in the sidewalk, particularly at prices that, with one or two exceptions, don’t go over $20. A good window into Mr. Lim’s mind is the bindaetteok appetizer. Usually these mung bean pancakes present as flat, starchy discs whose golden surfaces hint at crunchiness without actually delivering it. The ones at Soogil, fried in pork fat, have golden crusts like veal cutlets; by the time you’ve speared a piece with some chopped kimchi and dunked it in the traditional dipping sauce, you have all the expected flavors, plus a formidable crunch to sweeten the deal. He tinkers with the glass noodle dish called japchae in less radical fashion. The noodles themselves, shaped into a swirl with crisp shreds of vegetables and oyster mushrooms, have drunk in more soy and sesame flavor than they typically do. And Mr. Lim seems to have tripled, at least, the amount of bulgogi, a point he emphasizes by mounding the meat over the noodles so it looks like a sloppy Joe missing its top bun. The care the kitchen pays to technique is obvious in the seafood dishes; I’ve never had one that wasn’t perfectly cooked. Monkfish, which can come off as a rubber replica of some part of the anatomy I’d rather not think about, gets wrapped in a cabbage or lettuce leaf, gently poached, and sliced into neat little wheels. Arranged over stir-fried vegetables in a sea of fermented chile sauce, it’s terrific, and about as French as Korean cooking should be allowed to get. An almost silky consistency marks the mackerel that Soogil serves, nigiri-style, over wads of rice that have been seasoned with ssamjang (standing in for wasabi?) and wrapped in chard leaves. The tender Manila clams, squid and shrimp in the spicy tofu-seafood stew kept more of their natural juiciness than usual, although very firm shellfish isn’t necessarily a defect in that dish. Mr. Lim herds all the soft tofu into a flan at the bottom of the bowl, rather than letting cubes of it fend for themselves in the broth — a move that nicely heightens the contrast of tofu and chiles. The least Korean thing on the menu must be the foie gras terrine, and it’s also one of the only disappointments, with its crumbly Melba toasts and washed-out green-plum jelly. A dish called nurungji gras is something else entirely: a fine seared hunk of foie gras laid over spinach and pickled mushrooms on a springy, crunchy sizzled rice cake. Slabs of pork belly are braised until the fat streaks are nearly liquid. Then they’re given a meaningful sear and served alongside a stripe of a sauce I’ve never had before, made with fermented shrimp and green plums and fresh red peppers: spicy, salty, sour and hot. The dish that breaks the $20 barrier is the short rib. If you’ve had Daniel’s braised short ribs, the tenderness and concentration will be familiar to you, although Soogil’s version is pointedly suffused with soy rather than red wine. Underlining the French connection, this block of beef is served with carrots, potatoes and winter squash. If you eat it by yourself, you could make dinner of it. After which you should probably investigate something that goes by the name Jenga Tower. Cigarettes of fried dough, chewy like rice sticks, are stacked like a log cabin, then dusted with sugar and misugaru, the powdered grain and bean blend Koreans use as an instant breakfast drink. You pull out a stick at the time until the tower falls and brings down the scoop of honey-and-chestnut gelato balanced on top. The dining room could take a few lessons in balance from that dessert. The lights could be dimmed by a few clicks. The pop music, while not actively awful, is just odd enough to be subliminally distracting. Soogil can’t seem to find the right tone for service, either. Some nights it’s very familiar and on others, peculiarly fussy — a server insisted on giving the book I’d brought a chair of its own. These are minor snags, but sorting them out is tricky, especially for first-time restaurateurs. Somewhere in the middle is a relaxed, confident style that will match the spirit of Mr. Lim’s cooking.

46,La Mercerie,★★,2018-05-01,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/01/dining/la-mercerie-review-soho.html,SoHo,"The classic cafes of Parisian boulevards — rattan chairs and their occupants facing the sun in all but the nastiest weather, waiters stepping nimbly over small dogs — are central to the city’s street culture, but they’re pretty marginal to its eating and drinking culture now. Cafes may have been known for their namesake drink in Voltaire’s day, but since then their coffee has become internationally notorious. Today the Parisian love of caffeine is more likely to be consummated over flat whites, cortados or, most un-French of all, filtered coffee at a third-wave espresso shop. Meanwhile the pillars of the cafe menu, those blunt salads and trusty omelets and utilitarian ham sandwiches, are not exactly drawing crowds like the shakshukas, pancakes, avocado toasts and acai bowls found at younger cafes like Ob-La-Di and Holybelly. With some searching, you can probably find cafes in France that produce the standards with conviction. Or you can go to La Mercerie, in SoHo, for simple, determinedly old-school French cooking with every detail in place. The chef, Marie-Aude Rose, does not make toasts, but she makes toast soldiers: sticks of white bread with butter smeared along their browned surfaces, but otherwise naked so they can drink up the orange yolk of a soft-cooked egg on a ceramic pedestal. For the past four months, Ms. Rose has been cooking as if the fate of the planet depended on the tenderness of her cheese omelets, the judiciousness of her vinaigrettes, the airy spaces in her croissants and the crackle of the buckwheat in her savory crepes. If those feats were as easy as they sound, La Mercerie’s breakfast-through-dinner menu wouldn’t be a major addition to the city’s restaurant scene. But they aren’t, and it is, and some of the thanks goes to Ms. Rose’s hard-core training when she was embedded in the unforgiving kitchens of Guy Savoy and Pierre Gagnaire. Then, like a lot of aspiring chefs of her generation, she heard the call of the bistronomie movement, and went looking for a less cloistered restaurant. What she found was Spring, a new, relaxed, seasonally attentive place where an American named Daniel Rose was doing all the cooking himself. After she turned up, something clicked and the restaurant began to get attention around Paris and abroad. Her sensibilities overlapped with Mr. Rose’s in other ways; the two started dating and later married, opening additional places along the way. The Roses moved to New York about two years ago when Daniel opened Le Coucou, his tribute to the Le and La restaurants of old. La Mercerie, three blocks west, was not in their plans until Le Coucou’s chief owner, Stephen Starr, was brought on to operate a cafe inside a furniture and housewares store being planned by Le Coucou’s design firm, Roman and Williams. La Mercerie sits at the junction of two mighty rivers of contemporary eating trends: the redundantly, if catchily, named all-day-cafe movement and the restaurant-as-shopping-catalog approach pursued by Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s places inside ABC Carpet & Home. When you sit down for breakfast (or lunch, or dinner — see, all day) at La Mercerie, you will get, in addition to a menu, a card printed with small line drawings of every piece of tableware in the cafe, and its price. If you are very taken by the “rustic washed linen napkins” you can buy a set for $104. For $275, there is a small teapot from a Danish potter who has supplied Noma. If this is outside your budget, you can still use them at La Mercerie for an hour or two before you have to give them back, like a rented tux of rustic washed linen. As borrowed lifestyles go, it’s a pretty nice one. Many of the servers are dressed in high-waisted, loose-legged trousers and flowing white dress shirts, as if they were in costume for a Fred Astaire movie. Meanwhile, the customers never seem to be rushed or out of sorts, and I started to wonder if they were all extras being paid to sit there looking serene. Or maybe eating next to a room full of expensive vases, Swedish sheepskins, enormous woven baskets and antique tables makes everybody feel as if they are one of the exhibits in a small museum. The theme of the merchandise is craft — it’s all handmade — and Ms. Rose has taken this to heart in her kitchen. La Mercerie’s chicken bouillon is simmered and skimmed just the way it should be. Marked by balance and brightness, it is oolong tea to bone broth’s double espresso. Also in the bowl are an egg with a liquid yolk and, down at the bottom, a flock of herb-pasta butterflies, each one the size of the tip of your pinkie. Ms. Rose’s pastries are already some of the finest in the city. Croissants have crisp whorls on top that you can count like tree rings; the savory ones are filled with ham and Comté, or broccoli and cherry tomatoes in custard, which may not sound good but is. More exotic is the tourteau fromagé, a palm-size cheesecake with a blackened, domed top. Born in Poitou-Charentes, it looks something like a Boston cream doughnut, but its interior is a moist, fine-crumbed cake that tastes, just barely, of fresh goat cheese. Ms. Rose serves it with a poached apricot in star-anise syrup. If you are a serious pastry watcher, you will want to add it to your life list. Having recently run up against a crème brûlée that seemed to contain no eggs and a plate of profiteroles allowed to get soggy at a purportedly French restaurant nearby, I was relieved to sink into the yolk-rich crème caramel and crisp choux puffs under bittersweet chocolate sauce at La Mercerie. A devout and often disappointed Francophile I ate with eyed the crepes au sucre warily. “The sugar had better be crunchy,” she said. It was, of course. The menu changes once a day, at noon. The soft-cooked egg goes away, replaced by the omelet. Four main courses arrive, including a very nice piece of roasted salmon with red-wine sauce. Salads appear. It is almost impossible to rave convincingly about salads, so please trust me that La Mercerie’s are great, particularly the niçoise, with tuna preserved in oil on the premises and anchovies cured in oil at the source, the Cantabrian Sea. The same anchovies, swimming on the same plate as a wedge of vanilla butter, make an appetizer that you probably won’t believe until you’ve tasted it. (The butter amplifies the richness of the fish while tamping down its sharpness.) The man who churns La Mercerie’s butter, Jean-Yves Bordier, does not sell his stuff to just anybody, and the fat slices of his buckwheat and lemon-olive oil butters are worth the $7 you pay. Most things are so precisely as they should be that it is hard to find fault. But I am not sure that a sheet of Calvados-poached apple is of much use to a wedge of Camembert, and I wish that the boeuf bourguignon’s dark and lovely sauce did not slide so easily off the smooth macaroni Ms. Rose sets under the stew. Maybe the buckwheat crepe curled above the creamed chicken reminded me a bit too much of a dosa. But the one around ham, Comté and a fried egg is reassuringly folded like an envelope. The wine list is full of the amenably drinkable bottles you want with this food. As for the coffee, it too is drinkable — one of the rare departures from French cafe tradition.

47,Claro,★★,2018-04-03,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/dining/claro-review-brooklyn-oaxacan.html,Gowanus,"If you love Oaxacan food and live in New York City, it helps to be mobile. About half a million Mexican-Americans live here, too, and while more have been arriving from Oaxaca in recent years, very few have opened restaurants. The hunting is better north of town. On a free day, you could head upriver to Poughkeepsie, N.Y., the capital of the Hudson Valley’s Oaxacan community. My own favorite destination until this winter was even farther away, a trim, bright little spot in Kingston called Just For You. Last summer I had a memorable bowl of thick crema de elote and hunks of goat stewed with guajillo chiles. But one of the owners had moved to the United States illegally in 1999 and had recently moved back to Mexico under threat of deportation; the restaurant has closed for now. Closer to home, you can make your way to La Morada, in the South Bronx, hoping the elusive mole blanco will be simmering in the kitchen that day, and ready to settle for one of the more easily spotted moles if it is not. You might go to central Brooklyn for the tamal steamed in a banana leaf, or the little fried masa pockets called tetelas, at La Loba Cantina, in Kensington. In September, a new choice appeared on Third Avenue in Brooklyn, between the verdant shores of the Gowanus Canal and the foothills of Park Slope. Called Claro, it is run by one of the owners of Freek’s Mill, a nearby restaurant where the servers wear gingham shirts and talk up the virtues of the wine list made up almost entirely of gamay and chenin blanc. His partner is also the chef, T. J. Steele, a veteran of Union Square Cafe and Tía Pol who has the word TACO tattooed on the fingers of his right hand and MASA on those of his left. Those two related themes are continued in ink drawings that run up his arms, across his torso and down to his feet. Claro, in other words, is not where you go for Oaxacan recipes that have been passed down from generation to generation. Home-style soups and stews are rare. So is cooked fish. On the other hand, Mr. Steele has given himself liberty to work with ingredients that might furrow the average Mexican grandmother’s brow, like kale and sunchokes. Although he has lived part-time in Oaxaca City for more than a decade, he still thinks like a New York chef. But as his head-to-toe artwork suggests, Mr. Steele has a tendency to go all in. This is, as it happens, the only way to make the moles that are the pride of Oaxaca. The moles at Claro are riveting: The ground nuts and dried spices, the garlic and onions all seem to bring out the personalities of the chiles — sometimes fruity, sometimes vegetal — while tamping down their heat. He keeps their bitterness in check, too. Pork cheek was stewed in a mole rojo that has just enough chocolate to make you smile; the mole negro, in which marbled short ribs were cooked to extreme tenderness, was so balanced that no one ingredient ever seemed to be in the lead. Chichilo, not one of your everyday moles, was the brightest and most outgoing of the three, and a big pool of it made an exciting foil for a chile relleno filled with shredded, spiced duck. Mr. Steele also goes all in on masa, which is stone-ground and nixtamalized on site from strains of blue and yellow corn native to Oaxaca. Ten years ago you couldn’t talk about the state of masa in New York without experiencing early signs of depression; now Claro is among a handful of local restaurants whose masa is worth getting excited about. It provides the ground floor of about half the things you will eat. Pressed and griddled — in good weather, this is done outside on a domed comal set over a fire — the masa becomes the small warm tortillas that are folded into shrimp tacos with an unusually complex chipotle sauce. Larger fried tortillas are the foundation of tostadas, which can be quite the productions here: turkey in salsa with a flicker of heat soothed by crema and mashed avocados; raw yellowfin tuna with blood oranges and puffs of fried pork skin and a whiff of smoke from Oaxacan pasilla chiles. Thicker, softer wheels of masa with raised rims make up the base of memelas, the Oaxacan version of sopes and huaraches. The one with goat-cheese crema and wild mushrooms has a meaty intensity, without any meat; another, spread with an unexpectedly fluffy hash of chorizo and potatoes, is topped with house-made queso fresco to calm the chorizo’s burn. Occasionally, it can be hard to tell Claro’s memelas from its tostadas. Because together they make up a substantial chunk of the menu, if you don’t order carefully you can end up with a long, unbroken run of masa discs. (This is not the worst fate on earth.) The flavors at Claro tend to be finely tuned, so when a dish was out of alignment, I noticed. Beef tongue tacos would have needed a heavier glug of salsa to make up for meat that was as salty as country ham. And when the pickled-pepper sauce binding the bacon-and-octopus tostada was too sharp and sour, what had been the high point of one dinner became the low point of another — a vinegar tostada. Claro is filled with evidence of the connections Mr. Steele has made over the years in Oaxaca. The bar stocks a smoky but approachable mezcal that he imports, called El Buho. The tiles under the bar and the charcoal-toned plates and dishes are made by ceramists he met there. It’s all pretty restrained; you don’t get the sense he has turned the restaurant into a warehouse for crafts he bought, drunk on the exchange rate, at the artisan’s market. On the wall is a mural of three goats surrounding a woman who seems to be having a bad day; she is in a caldron over a fire, and the goats look hungry. If you want to turn the tables, try to go to Claro on a night when barbecued goat is on the menu. Served with blue and yellow tortillas, red and green salsas, and a bowl of consommé, it is more than enough to make a meal of. I ate it with one eye on the back door, thinking about what else Claro might serve when the weather is warm enough to start cooking on the wood grill every night.

48,Chez Ma Tante,★★,2018-03-27,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/dining/chez-ma-tante-review-brookyn.html,Greenpoint,"All the things I love about the pancakes at Chez Ma Tante, near the Greenpoint waterfront in Brooklyn, are things that normal chefs would try to fix. They are a little too tall and too big around. The outside is nearly black in parts, and crunchy, which American pancakes almost never are. What they most closely resemble are the pancakes I’ve made on camping trips, from a mix, with about a quarter-stick of melted butter in a smoking-hot pan over a fire. Each one is the size of Frisbee because too many people are waiting for breakfast for any space in the pan to be wasted. Assuming my campfire pancakes were to catch a chef’s eye, the standard way of turning them into a brunch dish would be to refine them. The heat would come down so they’d cook to an even golden-brown. My quantity of butter would seem insane in a professional kitchen, so it would be cut. The batter would probably be thinned to make the pancakes shorter and more elegantly rounded. Rounding out the rough edges is, in a broad sense, one of the main things chefs do. They may not always do it consciously, any more than a copy editor consciously corrects typos. It’s supposed to become a reflex, which is the point of the sign on the kitchen wall at Eleven Madison Park: MAKE IT NICE. This is just what the chef Aidan O’Neal at Chez Ma Tante does not do to the pancakes. Rising up from a small flood of maple syrup, they look and taste as if they’d been made in the woods. I will gladly admit they’re better than mine. At weekend brunch, they are on virtually every table. Mr. O’Neal and his chef de cuisine, Jake Leiber, do not lack skill in the kitchen, but they know when to resist cheflike impulses and think like hungry campers. Their healthy disregard for refinement spills over to the dinner menu, which recently expanded to seven nights a week from five, just as the restaurant is approaching its first birthday. To start, you might smear a gob of chicken liver pâté on a tangy slice of miche charred over the grill, or some head cheese, a spreadable pink composite of meat not quite held together by drippy pork goo. The most rustic thing you can eat there at night, though, has to be the thick steak carved out of a pork shoulder, rubbed with mustard and maple syrup, and striped with wide, dark grill marks. Smeared over the top is a salsa verde made from fresh parsley and other herbs that were whole about three or four slashes of a knife ago. Stewed Puy lentils spill across the rest of the plate. The look may say it was thrown together, but the full, lasting flavors tell you it wasn’t. It is hard to say exactly what kind of food Chez Ma Tante serves, apart from the consistently good kind. The website calls it “food that can only be described as European.” This isn’t particularly helpful or specific; I’ve never eaten anything there that seemed Finnish, say, or Bulgarian. If the menu has a theme, you won’t guess it from the dining room. A collection of brown chairs and black tables on a black floor in an undecorated white room, it is as austere as a Shaker chapel, although one with a long, well-populated bar against the wall. No hints are forthcoming from the cocktail list, either, which plays it close to the vest with daiquiris, Negronis, Cosmopolitans and so on. It is the first cocktail list I’ve seen in a long time on which I recognized every drink. Other writers have described Chez Ma Tante as a neighborhood spot, a homage to certain well-known London restaurants, a gastro pub and a “French-Canadian bistro.” This last must be a reference to Mr. O’Neal. Raised in Vancouver, British Columbia, he cooked at Au Pied de Cochon in Montreal under Martin Picard, the grinning scoutmaster of the hungry-camper troop, before moving to New York to work at the berserk Québécois outpost M. Wells, in Long Island City, Queens. (He met Mr. Leiber a few years later when they worked together at Café Altro Paradiso in SoHo.) The name Chez Ma Tante was borrowed from a stainless-steel slot of a place in Montreal known for its steamé, a steamed hot dog in a steamed bun. An “all dressed” steamé, meaning it’s loaded up with mustard and coleslaw, is a new feature on the brunch menu in Greenpoint. Apart from that and a recurring maple motif — the jugs of syrup on a shelf outside the kitchen are not just for show — the Québécois influence is minimal. A minor British theme seems undeniable. First off, the French fries are unmistakably English chips: twice-fried wedges that are steamy and starchy on the inside. If I were from England myself, I’d probably call them “proper chips,” even though they come with a little cup of aioli on the side. Whether Chez Ma Tante’s kedgeree is a proper kedgeree I don’t know. It is, essentially, white rice dyed yellow with curry powder and mixed with hard-cooked egg and flaked cod. A fair amount of butter seems to be involved. On top is a crunchy salad of celery stalks and leaves. Somehow it’s rich and refreshing and soothing and exciting at the same time. How did falafel, fried to a crackle and served over hummus and harissa with pickle wheels, get here? Not sure, but it is a great improvement over most of the vegetarian options you meet around town. Salads, too, are better than usual: shavings of kohlrabi and apples imbued with lemon; roasted almonds and raisins over white shreds of stracciatella cheese; a Caesar whose romaine leaves are small and tender, and whose croutons are closer to fried crumbs. The night ends with straightforward bistro desserts. Maple returns one more time in a crème brûlée; its torched sugar crust is repeated, in a lighter form, on the surface of a lemon tart wedge; the tarte Tatin is classic, although the caramel one night was a little more bitter than it needed to be. Like King in SoHo, which could be this restaurant’s older sister after a junior year abroad, Chez Ma Tante offers sorbet with a shot of vodka meant to be poured over the top. Because this is Greenpoint, the vodka is Polish. Presumably for the same reason, most customers don’t bother pouring it over the sorbet; they just toss it back in one gulp.

49,JuneBaby,★★★,2018-03-15,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/dining/junebaby-review-seattle-black-southern-food.html,Ravenna,"SEATTLE — As great restaurants will do, JuneBaby pulled me in from more than one direction. The first of course was the sheer pleasure of the cooking. (Without that, the others wouldn’t matter.) The food is Southern, which I was primed to like before I walked through JuneBaby’s Dutch doors in this city’s Ravenna neighborhood. And whenever Edouardo Jordan’s menu offered a dish I’d expect to see at a Southern restaurant, he gave me something better than I’d imagined. Fried catfish over grits can be better in theory than reality. At JuneBaby, the fish, from an Idaho farm, is firm, tight, fresh and free of bottom-feeder muddiness. The crust is semolina, which stays crisp and unsoggy. The grits are fluffy, yellow, full of corn flavor. Ringing the grits is an orange circle of shrimp bisque. Strictly speaking, shrimp bisque has no business on fish and grits, but if you see the bisque as a tamer, richer stand-in for hot sauce it makes a delicious kind of sense. This is the tactic — find superior ingredients and bring some fancy kitchen tricks to bear on them — favored by most of the South’s prominent restaurants. If that were all Mr. Jordan had in mind, I would still think JuneBaby is a very good restaurant. But on the menu of this nearly year-old establishment are dishes that I wasn’t expecting, that many of those other restaurants don’t serve, that pulled me in deeper. Like any good Southern chef, Mr. Jordan loves his pork. But I paid closer attention when I noticed which parts of the pig he’s cooking. He will boil ham hocks with collard greens until the leaves are soft and velvety and wonderfully smoky. He stews pigs’ ears until they surrender their ornery stiffness, then slices and fries them into irresistible, crunchy sticks. He seasons okra and tomatoes with a North African spice mix and stews them with hog maw, otherwise known as the outer wall of the stomach. “Almost nobody likes it,” Josh Ozersky wrote of hog maw in Esquire in 2014, a year before he died. “It’s tough and tasteless, like the chitterlings to which it is attached.” Mr. Jordan would disagree. By the way, he cooks chitterlings, too. These are the cuts that enslaved black people on plantations were allowed to keep when hogs were killed; after Emancipation, these were the cuts they might have had the money to afford and the skills to make into something memorable. Their healthy representation on the menu tells you that JuneBaby is not just a Southern restaurant but, specifically, a black Southern restaurant. Of course, much of the huge edifice of Southern food was built by black farmers and black cooks: as enslaved people in plantation kitchens and in their own families’ cabins; later, as domestic servants, hotel chefs, railroad cooks, restaurateurs and entrepreneurs. Mr. Jordan is interested in all of it, but he particularly wants to introduce customers to the food of his family. He was raised in St. Petersburg, Fla., where the surrounding culture wasn’t particularly Southern but his mother’s table was. “The food she cooked was the only food she knew,” Mr. Jordan said in a phone interview. “That’s where I got my experience of fried fish, fried chicken, braised meats, offals, bread pudding.” JuneBaby’s oxtails are a tribute to one of her mainstays. Mr. Jordan deepens the flavor of the beef by roasting it before braising. He focuses the broth by clarifying it with egg whites, as he would have done in culinary school and in kitchens where he’s worked, such as the French Laundry in California and Per Se and Lincoln Ristorante in New York. But he doesn’t try to prettify what the menu calls Momma Jordan’s Oxtails, serving them whole, with cubes of turnip and rutabaga, the hunks of beef barely hanging onto tailbones whose wide, white wings flare out like propeller blades. The chitterlings are essentially his paternal grandmother’s recipe, stewed with onions, carrots and garlic. Instead of water, he might use some chicken stock, or the collagen-rich liquid thrown off by the pigs’ ears. Rather than use a pot on the stove, he softens them in a pressure cooker. This both speeds the process by several hours and allows him to welcome the customers who line up each night waiting for the doors to open into a dining room that does not smell like intestines. As variety meats go, intestines are not at the top of my list. Out of strong curiosity, I’ve eaten them packed into andouillettes in France, fried and kept under heat lamps in a gas station in Mississippi, and grilled over charcoal in the backyard of a Korean restaurant in Queens. I liked them best at JuneBaby. “My grandmother’s chitterlings were a thing I loved, but never talked about,” Mr. Jordan said, a thought that will sound familiar to immigrants and other people whose families’ food veers from the mainstream American diet. “You tell your friends as a kid you eat chitterlings, they run away from you.” Eventually he ran away from them, too, until he began to prepare a follow-up to his first restaurant as both chef and owner, Salare, down the street. The menu at Salare, he has said, expresses what he has learned in his career, centering on the Italian and French food he made in other people’s restaurants. JuneBaby, though, “speaks on who I am as an individual soul and as an African-American male.” And to do that he realized he would need to go back to “these ingredients that we don’t want to talk about” and start to show them off. Junebaby’s chitterlings never come off the menu. They are not a huge revenue center for the restaurant but they may be, in a cultural sense, a loss leader. The dining room has a welcoming, domestic atmosphere; somehow it always feels as if a warm breeze were blowing through the screens, even in winter with the windows shut. For all the braised and simmered and stewed dishes, the kitchen glides easily into lighter territory. Vegetables keep their crunch. Bright green broccoli is tossed with grated Cheddar, almonds, apples and very delicate puffs of pork skin, all of them sharpened by preserved-lemon vinaigrette. The buttermilk biscuits and raised dinner rolls, known here as Antebellum Wheat Buns, are made with a light, practiced hand under the direction of Margaryta Karagodina, the pastry chef. Red-flint cornbread, baked in an iron skillet, gets its minerally sweetness from sorghum. Some of the desserts are slices of church-supper favorites, like a rich brick of bread pudding, interspersed with dark chocolate and soft apricots, sitting on crème anglaise. The Black Forest cake was the kind you rarely see anymore, three chocolate-cake layers frosted with cocoa-dusted whipped cream. Alongside one of these, it’s a good idea to let Mr. Jordan take you all the way back to the beginning of his career and have a flip. This is frozen fruit juice — pineapple the night I had it — in a paper cup, a tribute to the homemade Popsicles Mr. Jordan used to whip up out of powdered drink mix and sell when he was a boy in St. Petersburg. If the word flip doesn’t ring a bell, one of its other names might: huckabuck, hucklebuck, frozen cup, freeze cup, cool cup. If you’re still in the dark, a definition can be found in the JuneBaby encyclopedia. This still-growing document, found on the restaurant’s website, defines menu terms and concepts in Southern cuisine from Aunt Jemima to yams (“Most common African staple that fed enslaved Africans on board ships.”). The encyclopedia is another way JuneBaby drew me in. It nudged me to consider what I was eating. And it situated Mr. Jordan’s family recipes in a centuries-long arc of American history. Many restaurants start with a chef’s personal story. JuneBaby traces that story back to where it meets the country’s.

50,DaDong,0 star,2018-03-06,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/06/dining/dadong-review-midtown-chinese-peking-duck.html,Midtown,"Every so often, I’ll wake up to an inbox full of friendly emails from people volunteering to help me do my job. The specific assistance they are offering is to meet me at some forthcoming restaurant, their stomachs empty and ready to contain at least half the menu. When I get three or four of these volunteers on the same morning, it invariably means that while I was sleeping other people were reading the advance press on an incipient opening that sounds both unusually enticing and intimidatingly expensive. The most recent rush of volunteers, it turned out, was inspired by the arrival in December of a Manhattan branch of the Beijing-based restaurant DaDong. While the Beijingese have excelled at the art of duck roasting for centuries, DaDong, I learned, is a relative newcomer, founded in the 1990s by the chef Dong Zhenxiang. At the restaurants — there are 10 in Beijing and six in other Chinese cities, not counting casual spinoffs — the birds revolve, a dozen at a time, inside a circular wood-fueled oven that Mr. Dong has patented. The result is what some people consider Beijing’s best Peking duck. This is a magical combination of words. “Beijing’s best Peking duck” suggests a mandatory eating experience in a way that, say, “Russia’s best Russian dressing” does not. It took me and my first corps of volunteers some time to find one another because the restaurant’s address, 3 Bryant Park, implied that the entrance would be somewhere around Bryant Park. DaDong is inside a stack of glass-and-steel blocks that has somehow been plunked down west of the park between 42nd and 41st Streets, beside a pocket plaza that was new to me, although the skateboarders seemed to know all about it. Inside the front door was a lobby where a host stood by herself behind a desk made out of a rock. I gave her the name and she gestured toward the elevators, sending me up to the dining room on the second floor. This space, designed by the hotel specialist George Wong, is the latest manifestation of modern China in Manhattan, a soothing study in straight lines and neutral tones with random outbreaks of contemporary Chinese art. A wraparound bar sits in the middle of the room under a hanging sculpture that looks like a flock of gold paper-towel tubes learning to fly. In this room, it is not exactly shocking to learn that the usual Peking duck garnishes may be supplemented with 10 grams of caviar for $42. In lieu of toast points, servers recommend a shard of skin. If you skip the fish eggs, they will tell you there are three ways to eat the duck: wrapped in one of the very thin and tender pancakes with scallions and a smear of sweet soy-black bean sauce (great stuff); poked into a round sesame puff with julienned cucumber and melon, raw garlic paste and the black bean sauce; and finally, dipped in a small pile of sugar, recommended for the skin alone. This kept everybody busy for some time. The bird was precisely carved, as if by a laser. None of us had seen crisper skin — you could bounce a quarter off it. The dip didn’t improve it, but it is always nice to find a new use for sugar. The meat didn’t make as firm an impression. It made very little impression at all, apart from my strong sense that there ought to have been more of it. Tasted on its own, it reminded me a bit of the lean, whitish, noncommittal supermarket pork chops I grew up on. Slowly, gradually, with great mental resistance but still inexorably, it dawned on me that I had paid $98 for a duck with almost no flavor. It was dry, too. New York City being a lush jungle of regulations, DaDong was forced to convert its wood-burning ovens to gas. Smoke might have added some flavor, but something seems to be lacking in the birds themselves, members of the Pekin breed raised on a farm in Indiana with special instructions to keep them lean, the way Mr. Dong prefers them. Unfortunately, DaDong’s problems don’t end with the duck. The menu in New York has been trimmed down considerably from the 280-page book presented to diners in Beijing, but it is still rife with dishes that are dead on arrival. Kung pao shrimp with beet coins and raw mushrooms tasted like ketchup. Sweet-and-sour pork ribs with preserved plums were as sweet as if they’d been stewed in Dr Pepper, and a dusting of powdered sugar at the table didn’t help. Little teepees of Ibérico ham came wrapped around cold, dry wads of sticky rice. Champagne-glazed tomatoes were sweet enough to serve for dessert, and the “crispy mushroom salad” they were stuffed with wasn’t crisp and didn’t particularly taste like mushrooms. Shiny and red as candied apples, the tomatoes were at least pretty to look at. Nearly everything I ate at DaDong was. The kitchen, led by Andy Xu, a veteran of Atlantic Grill and Blue Fin, certainly shows attention to the details of presentation. Occasionally, it sends out something that lives up to its appearance. A perfectly clear globe of ice, to be cracked with a spoon, kept soy-marinated ribbons of geoduck deliciously cold. Braised sea cucumber in a glossy soy-based sauce hit all the right sticky and soft marks. My favorite dish may be the seafood variation on the Sichuan classic Chongqing chicken called Hot and Spicy Lobster: a cut-up lobster stir-fried with nearly enough dried chiles to fill a pillowcase. A close second is the baby cabbage, sliced into threads and braised with chestnuts in saffron sauce. Whatever is causing the kitchen’s reach-grasp ratio to break down doesn’t seem to have affected the desserts. There is a fine plate of Beijing snacks, dense little half-sweet cakes made of lotus root, red beans, yellow split peas and so on. I enjoyed popping tiny seashells of white chocolate into my mouth to find out what each was filled with: Nutmeg? Tangerine? Wasabi? The simplest, though, the ice cream with an alluringly bitter edge of dried tangerine peel, was also the most rewarding. Servers sometimes seemed to be reading dish descriptions from a teleprompter, but they made up for that with a care and attentiveness that felt unforced. The sommeliers were particularly good at interpreting the wine list, which is well-rounded and can be quite reasonable. This list would get your attention almost anywhere, but in a Chinese restaurant in New York, it’s a treasure. But even the most gently priced bottle can go only so far to smooth over the potholes on the menu, and the suspicion that the best Peking duck in Beijing has turned into something that would struggle to stand out in Parsippany.

51,L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon,★★,2018-02-27,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/dining/latelier-de-joel-robuchon-review.html,Chelsea,"L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon may be the world’s most expensive restaurant chain. Each time I ate in the newest one, which opened across 10th Avenue from Chelsea Market in November, I listened to people around me compare notes on which of the 11 other locations they’d visited. Tokyo was popular, as were Las Vegas and, of course, the original in Paris. As they reeled off their Atelier achievements, these people always sounded contented. And it must be soothing to know that as you travel the world you will find an Atelier waiting for you to climb up on a comfortable red leather stool, watch the cooks dressed in what look like black pajamas, admire the slightly supernatural colors of the vegetables and fruits submerged in water inside glass vases, recline into a menu filled with Robuchon classics and small variations on the same key ingredients (eggplant, quail, squab, lobster), all at prices that most people can’t afford, but you can. Lulling familiarity was not Joël Robuchon’s aim when he built the first Atelier almost 15 years ago. Having won just about every honor the French gastronomic world offers at his first restaurant, he had officially retired, and when he came back it was only to knock the whole system on its side. His idea was a restaurant where the food, made to his excruciatingly precise standards, would be served not at tables but at a U-shaped counter. The format may have been borrowed from Japan or Spain, but in France the effect was radical, as were the late-night closing hours and no-reservations policy. The proof of L’Atelier’s success is how un-shocking this sounds today. Early on, as R.W. Apple reported in The New York Times, the prices could be modest “if you avoid caviar and foie gras.” This was less true by the time of L’Atelier de Joël Robuchon’s initial New York run, at the Four Seasons Hotel in Midtown from 2006 to 2012, where Frank Bruni awarded it three stars. I remember feeling distinct pain there each time I paid the check. I also remember a stunned awareness that I’d do it again. I had had no idea anything could taste as good as the simple combination of a langoustine and a basil leaf inside a see-through wrapper of fried brik pastry, or the far more complex glass of sea urchin suspended in lobster jelly under a quarter-inch of cauliflower cream that was like an insanely luxurious Jell-O salad. Nothing on the menu at the new Atelier spun my senses around like those two dishes, not even the langoustine, which is on the menu there, too, but seems to have lost the juicy sweetness I remembered. The kitchen, directed by Christophe Bellanca, shows impressive discipline. (It serves not just L’Atelier but a second restaurant, Le Grill de Joël Robuchon, which sits up front overlooking 10th Avenue.) Not one dot of sauce, and there are many, is out of place. But some crucial connection has been lost, the spontaneity and directness that was, I think, the point of the Atelier experiment. Out of three dinners, my first was the most patchy. A $44 pair of mini-burgers topped with foie gras were more like an expensive caterer’s trick than a Robuchon brain wave. A vaguely spiced mush of eggplant under a runny boiled egg, for $32, was so unappealing I couldn’t finish it. Things got better from there, and sometimes much better, though rarely much cheaper. Those two dishes were what the menu calls “small tasting portions,” and as you’d imagine, the appetizers and main courses come with higher prices. Three tasting menus, from $145 to $325, are not particular bargains. (Taking some of the edge off, service is included.) Mr. Bellanca and his crew are at their best with careful refinements of classic French cooking. Slabs of roasted duck breast with cracked pepper and kumquat preserves, which I had in a main-course portion for $64, did everything you’d want canard à l’orange to do, and did it with style and confidence. There was a handsomely improved $42 blanquette of veal cheeks with tender-crisp vegetables and a little disc of buttered rice pilaf. The beef tartare is chopped to little pieces but not beyond, smoothed with egg yolk, dressed with enough mustard to make it stand out in a crowd, and served with the fries that McDonald’s sells only in my dreams. It comes close to being a model of the form in every way except the price, $52. The $34 beet salad was full of adventure, starting with a throat-catching scoop of green-mustard sorbet and continuing with some of those famous Robuchon dots, each of which turned out to be a perfectly delicious sauce made from, say, green apples or avocado. But not many other dishes seemed interested in startling anyone. The most spectacular thing I ate did not come from the kitchen but from the bakery downstairs. Tetsuya Yamaguchi, who has been tending yeast in Mr. Robuchon’s empire for two decades, is now stationed in the basement on 10th Avenue. His masterpiece is called the escargot, a swirl of savory brioche dough with olive oil between its many warm and flaky layers. He also bakes baguettes that seem to be shrunken versions of full-scale ones; at that size they could be all crust, but somehow he keeps the crust in proportion with the rest, and they are a joy to eat. Meanwhile the pastry chef, Salvatore Martone, is making some of the finest and airiest chocolate soufflés in the city, like dark-chocolate vapor tricked into solid form. He disguises a tarte Tatin as a shiny red Snow White apple; in another optical illusion, he fashions a replica of a lemon out of blown sugar, then fills it with lemon sorbet, and while I wished it tasted as much like lemon as it looked, it was a good dessert. Those are Mr. Martone’s excellent chocolates that show up around the same time as the check, and his kugelhopf that will be waiting for you in a Robuchon shopping bag by the coat check in case you want to start the next day with a custard cake, and why wouldn’t you? The service strikes a rare balance of charm and formality that was missing from the uptown location. There will be smiles when you get there, and smiles later when you whisk your kugelhopf off to wherever it is you go with your kugelhopfs. Whether this is a restaurant for you is first of all a question of money; there is no way to eat a satisfying meal at L’Atelier without spending a lot of it. If the prices don’t bother you, then neither should my nagging sense that the cooking is not as exciting as it could be. Nobody goes to chains, even expensive ones, for new sensations.

52,Tetsu,★★,2018-02-20,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/dining/tetsu-review-tribeca-masayoshi-takayama.html,TriBeCa,"When word went around almost six years ago that Masayoshi Takayama was going to bring one of his Las Vegas restaurants, Tetsu, to TriBeCa, I can’t say that my heart began to pound to the bongo beat of “Viva Las Vegas.” In fact, I braced for the worst. Eating in that city can be a wild ride, but the dining rooms often have an oversize, mall-like scale and the menus a safe, something-for-everyone vagueness — qualities that, transplanted to New York, can be real buzzkills. As far as restaurants go, what happens in Vegas should usually stay in Vegas. But a lot has happened in the past six years. Some is too painful to recount, but luckily not the story of the Tetsu on Leonard Street, which finally opened in November. It has little in common with the Nevada iteration, which will close in April. The animating idea there was teppanyaki, sizzled on flattop steel grills set into big half-moon tables that cooks stood behind, like blackjack dealers. But Mr. Takayama dropped that notion in Manhattan; now his menu is dominated by food prepared on robata grills operated behind a dining counter, supplemented widely by other techniques: raw seafood, soups, slaws, fried stuff. The roomy, half-empty white-and-beige interior of the casino Tetsu looks nothing like the shadowy and thickly settled Leonard Street Tetsu. Iron columns, steel seats, brick walls and wood floorboards give the place the look of an after-hours downtown lounge from a few years ago, before Industrial got self-conscious and became Steampunk. The prices are also much lower than they were in Las Vegas, or in a sample menu Mr. Takayama floated for TriBeCa in 2012. Only a handful of items on the two-page dinner menu cost more than $20. Can this be the same chef who collects $595 a person, before tax, for dinner at Masa? Who sells a bowl of chopped tuna belly with caviar for $68 next door at BarMasa and $78 at Kappo Masa, across town? One and the same. True, Tetsu specializes in small plates, but then none of Mr. Takayama’s other restaurants are particularly known for supersizing. What Tetsu does differently is to put away the luxury ingredients that are so central to Masa’s experience and image. At last, New York has a chance to see just how good Mr. Takayama is when he isn’t hiding behind truffles and caviar. He can, in fact, make less expensive seafood taste as precious as sturgeon roe. During the bay scallop season, which has an annoying habit of ending before I have eaten enough of them, Tetsu seared them with skinny lengths of asparagus and sent them out with garlic-anchovy oil and lime juice, simmering in a hot bowl. I will be marking this on the calendar so I don’t miss it next winter. For now there is a similar dish that operates on the same principle: tender, palm-size whole octopus sizzled in butter and lime with garlic, chopped cilantro and strands of a green Korean chile. The biggest surprise was how much I liked the salads. The menu calls them slaws, which goes a long way toward repairing some of the injuries that word has absorbed over the decades. There is a superb one with fresh kale and fried burdock in an unexpectedly Southeast Asian lemongrass dressing, and another of cabbage and roasted duck stirred with, yes, mayonnaise. (No supermarket mayo, it’s flavored with fresh orange juice and sherry vinegar.) If there was yuzu in the yuzu-daikon slaw, though, it had walked off the job the night I tried it. Items from the robata, supposedly the heart of the restaurant, were more variable than you would hope. My table went quietly wild for the soy-marinated quail eggs and the pink pork sausage with flecks of yellow and green Thai chiles. Skewered coconut shrimp received polite nods. When you get the menu, though, your eyes will automatically go straight to the raw seafood, and they probably should. It appears twice, the first time in chilled appetizers that can share some of Masa’s delicacy and subtle use of spice. Speckles of finely minced jalapeños dot little pearly pink bites of hamachi; in a more ordinary case, wasabi has been quickly grated over hunks of yellowfin tuna with a spoonful of simple guacamole. Raw seafood reappears at the end of the menu as hand rolls and nigiri. Here I have a confession to make: Almost all of my outer-stratosphere moments at Masa happened before the barrage of sushi that ends the meal. Near the end of the game comes a mesmerizing hand roll stuffed with meltingly fatty tuna belly, but the nigiri on its own it would probably not land Masa in my top tier of sushi destinations. That is roughly my feeling about the sushi at Tetsu. Although the contrast there is less extreme, its nigiri can be inconsistent and is best employed as a short and satisfying last stop, not as the main event. Should you forge on to dessert, you’ll find that the pastry chef (Matthew O’Haver, who doubles as the service director) does outstanding work: a plate-wide slice of grilled olive oil cake next to a thick stripe of tangy mascarpone; a brownielike chocolate cake made with black-sesame paste and topped with a powerfully appealing miso-caramel sauce; a green-peppercorn ice cream that clamps fire and ice together in a single rich scoop. At lunch, the menu is snipped from two pages to one. A little bit is subtracted from each category and two new ones are added: burgers and bowls of squiggly yellow ramen. The ramens are a little smaller and more refined than usual, which may not be top priorities for the average ramen fiend. But given how low in salt and fat they were, relatively speaking, I was impressed by how much flavor made its way into the miso ramen with chashu and the shoyu ramen with very, very good braised short rib. Tetsu’s burgers are cooked in a heated metal contraption with spikes that pierce the meat. Mr. Takayama designed it. I have not seen it, but it sounds like an iron maiden for the stovetop. The spikes are supposed to heat the interior, but the two burgers I’ve had were very rare with a notably dark sear. But the results were very different. I had an immediate, lingering, intensely positive reaction to the lamb burger under melted taleggio, but I would not order the underseasoned and pulpy beef burger with Cheddar again. The kitchen may also need more practice on the skinny fries — “Tetsu fries”. Once they were gold and cooked to a fine crackle; another time they were ghostly pale and limp. The lunch service is new and still fairly quiet. Dinner, though, can be a racket. If it’s just you, or you and a friend, sitting at the long counter made from a single plank of bubinga wood offers the best shot at privacy. Placed at one of the communal tables in back one night, I ended up next to a group that kept rowdily showing off its expensive wines.

53,Hwa Yuan Szechuan,★★,2018-02-13,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/dining/hwa-yuan-szechuan-review-chinese-food.html,Chinatown,"I had eaten approximately 300 miles of cold sesame noodles before I knew they had a story. If I’d thought about them at all, I would have reflected that everything has a story, but I didn’t. Back in the 1980s, when I came to New York, they were simply a thing you had to order with Chinese takeout because somebody always wanted them, even though they usually tasted like leftover spaghetti with Skippy. Before this, though, cold sesame noodles in New York were the specialty of one particular Sichuan-born chef, Yu Fa Tang. Called Shorty by everybody, Tang came here in the early ’60s after working for more than a decade in Taiwan. By 1967 he had his own restaurant on East Broadway, Hwa Yuan Szechuan Inn, where among other renditions of Sichuanese food he made cold sesame noodles that would lodge themselves in the memories of generations of New Yorkers and be imitated, lamentably, by takeout cooks all over town. At its peak it reportedly went through 500 pounds of noodles a day. For more details on the background of the dish and its life after the restaurant closed, I refer you to a 2007 treatise that Sam Sifton wrote in The New York Times Magazine. For a taste of the original and unexpurgated recipe, I refer you to the very good new restaurant that opened on the site of the original in October. Its name now shortened to Hwa Yuan Szechuan, it is worth visiting for reasons that go well beyond nostalgia. Hwa Yuan is an imposing restaurant, built by Shorty’s son Chien Lieh Tang and his grandson James Tang to plant the family name solidly in this century. To the left of the entrance is a lounge where translucent backlit panels cast everything in a streaked-marmalade glow. Straight ahead is the first dining room, and there are more up the stairs to the right. The tables sit under white cloths, and the places are set with white china traced with gold. To the right of the plates are two pairs of chopsticks on a white-china rest, one for serving and the other for eating. Needless to say, the cold sesame noodles are mandatory, at least on a first visit. They are, for one thing, truly cold. Not left-out-on-the-counter cold, but trickling-mountain-spring cold. The temperature accentuates their smooth surface and, like the slivers of cucumber, makes the small zap of chile oil call out more clearly. The first time I ate them the sauce needed a little more salt and vinegar, but the next time it had a finely balanced tension. If you know only the sugary peanut-butter imitation, tasting Hwa Yuan’s original must be like hearing Van Morrison for the first time when you’ve grown up on Ed Sheeran. Chien Lieh Tang is the chef at the resurrected Hwa Yuan, and although his cooking is not hard to appreciate, a little orientation may help. First, a warning: Those who believe that the only good Sichuan food makes you weep, sniffle, moan, call 911 or crawl under the table will need to adjust their standards. Hwa Yuan serves many family recipes that reflect an earlier stage of Sichuan cooking and Shorty Tang’s time in Taiwan. While chiles are often present, they rarely dominate. Nor does the kitchen try to lard extra umami into every dish. The best food at Hwa Yuan tries to impress through charm, not arm-twisting. Family pride being the point here, dishes that carry the names Tang or Hwa Yuan tend to be excellent. Not, I’m afraid, the Hwa Yuan dry-aged shell steak, which got impressive flavor from basting with marrow but was knotted with tough membranes when I tried it. But Tang’s Amazing Spicy Wine Chicken was a treat, very tender hunks of dark meat in a delicate sauce of Shaoxing rice wine, bean paste and chile oil. Tang’s Amazing Tofu was a minor discovery, seared squares of pressed tofu with fresh green chiles in a sauce that’s more interesting than you’d guess from its pale tan color. Hot Tang Tang noodles may sound like cold sesame noodles run through the microwave; they are something completely different, short strands of noodle in a steaming cup of sour-and-spicy broth that has a businesslike edge of roasted dried chiles. And Whole Fish with Hot Bean Sauce, Tang Family Creation is a bona fide star, the dish I know I’ll order again even if I’m not in the mood for cold noodles. It had a devoted following at the original restaurant, where it was made with carp. Now it is barramundi, precisely cooked and resting in a rusty mash of chile oil, fermented soybeans and chopped scallions. It’s a forceful dish that’s still noteworthy for its balance. As for the Hwa Yuan crab cake, I have no idea whether it lives up to the name. The kitchen was always out of it, along with such other intrigues as duck liver pâté and foie gras with fruit. The other major warning: My Peking duck did not deserve the fanfare it gets on the menu, where it is called Beijing duck. I phoned ahead to reserve a duck and a half for a large group, was told on arrival that the half duck wasn’t available, settled for the whole duck, and found that it wasn’t worth ordering in advance, or the $65 it cost. The carving was imprecise enough to make me glad it was only a roast duck under the knife and not a heart-surgery patient, and while the meat was juicy, pink and flavorful, the skin was flabby and as crisp as boiled spinach. Less heralded menu entries warrant a look, though. There is no reason to believe that soup dumplings, which arrived in New York by way of Shanghai long after Shorty Tang’s heyday, will be any good at Hwa Yuan. They are. So are the thick and juicy pan-fried dumplings. I can never resist snow-pea shoots, and have never come across any as delicious as Hwa Yuan’s. The dry-sautéed string beans are about average, but stir-fried brussels sprouts with bacon is a rewarding variation on Sichuanese cabbage with pork. Sichuan cooks seem to have a special understanding of potatoes, which may explain why the little marble-size ones here, cooked kung pao style with peanuts and dried chiles, are so unusually good. I hope to fake my way into reproducing the dish at home, which would make me the latest in a long line of Hwa Yuan imitators.

54,"The Aviary NYC, The Office NYC",★★,2018-02-06,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/dining/grant-achatz-office-aviary-review.html,Upper West Side,"Among his other innovations, Grant Achatz is a pioneer in menu typography. At Alinea, in Chicago, courses on his tasting menus used to be printed in a long, snaking column; sweeter dishes drifted out to the right margin and more savory ones swayed left. At the Aviary, the willfully atypical cocktail lounge he founded in Chicago in 2011, the name of each drink is preceded by a bird silhouette like the ones on the endpapers of Roger Tory Peterson’s field guides. The nearer the silhouette is to the name, the more the cocktail will resemble something Nick and Nora Charles would have recognized. The farther away the bird, the weirder the drink. During my first flight at the Aviary’s new Manhattan incarnation, my server pointed to the entry for Bring Another Smurf, a mezcal and coconut drink. “If you look over here,” he said, sliding his finger left, “the bird is all the way out.” Is a cocktail improved when its bird is all the way out? The question pecked at me each time the elevator let me out on the 35th floor of the Mandarin Oriental New York, site of the Aviary NYC and its quieter, shadow-filled sibling, the Office NYC. It also is originally from Chicago, where Mr. Achatz and his partner, Nick Kokonas, have built one superb, genre-bending establishment after another. For years they have flirted with New York. It took a hotel deal to get them here. The cloned Aviary and Office are undeniably expressions of Mr. Achatz’s aesthetic, with his fondness for Rube Goldberg devices, audience participation, old ideas tilted off their usual axis and novel ideas launched into orbit. The wildest notions are reserved for drinks in the Aviary. Mr. Achatz’s food plays second fiddle in both rooms, and plays it beautifully. Yet neither space really shows off his full powers. In this perch above Central Park, the bird is half out — or, if you look at a different way, half in. Like many Aviary drinks, the one called Science A.F. (ostensibly a reference to the microbiologist Alexander Fleming) is made at the table. A small blue flame compels Scotch and other ingredients in the lower chamber of a vacuum coffee maker to ascend to an upper chamber filled with fruit tea, as dry-ice fog carpets the table. This took about five minutes and produced something that tasted like the fruit punch that might be served at a convention for designated drivers. It does not quite give you your bird’s worth, I think. On the other hand, I admired the balance and complexity of the Wake and Bake, a mutant rye manhattan made with coffee- and orange-flavored vermouth. What I can’t imagine ever loving is being asked by a server to stick my head inside the inflated plastic bag in which it is served, to see that it really did smell like an everything bagel. It did, but it was one of several moments when I felt like a parent helping the Aviary staff to complete a project for the science fair. After a round or two, the alert drinker may become gun-shy. A friend I’d invited for lunch gamely sipped a Boom Goes the Dynamite, which had never cooled below tepid despite having fumed vigorously from the dry ice inside its laboratory flask. Leaving a third undrunk, she asked for a Bloody Mary. “Our Bloody Mary is very unique,” our server said brightly. “It takes about 15, 20 minutes to make.” “Is it served ... cold?” my friend asked, hope flickering weakly in her voice. It was. A few minutes later, a relatively traditional Bloody was poured over many tiny ice marbles inside the bowl of what looked like a small spittoon. Around the spittoon’s broad brim were arranged five garnishes, or side dishes, or condiments, including chopped razor clam with celery sorbet and a little pillbox of horseradish jelly. When we were alone again, she sighed and said, “I was hoping for a glass.” The Aviary’s Bloody Mary, by the way, costs $38.  We had come to try the daytime menu the Aviary recently introduced after two months or so of nighttime-only business. While the drinks gave us a bumpy ride, all was smooth once we embarked on the three-course, $45 lunch, starting with a roasted squash soup and a salad. Both had pieces of fruit and vegetable that had somehow been talked into tasting like more than they were. Finally there was a sandwich of fried, buttermilk- and yuzu-brined chicken thigh with pickles and shredded iceberg lettuce on a bun with more sesame seeds to the square inch than I’ve ever seen. The dressing was a toasted sesame sauce, and, like everything else about the sandwich, it was excellent. Apart from a fried pork rind the size of a dish towel, the items on the evening menu are generally wispy: a single, wonderful tempura shrimp with slices of yuzu-scented pear; an octopus croquette under streamers of bonito. There is one of Mr. Achatz’s earliest inventions, the raviolo filled to the bursting point with black-truffle broth. It is still a marvel. There was only one dish I did not like, but boy, did I not like it: cold pork belly in a bland goo of banana curry, sandwiched between flat discs of iceberg lettuce. These plates run from $11 to $29. Two or three would make for an interesting postcard from the inside of Mr. Achatz’s head. Ordering the whole roster would leave you a couple hundred dollars poorer and no wiser, though. The menu is not designed for that kind of eating. Neither is the Aviary, although it’s hard to say just what it is designed for. Deals between chefs and hotels invariably entail compromise, but Mr. Achatz and Mr. Kokonas may have given up too much here. Sunk a few steps below the hotel lobby and dominated by a view of the Central Park skyline, the space is an awkward combination of destination and waiting room. Achatz devotees who paid for their spots weeks earlier through Mr. Kokonas’s reservations and guest-tracking service, Tock, may find themselves at curved leather lounge chairs next to hotel guests taking phone calls between meetings. There’s no sense of arrival, nothing to suggest you’re entering the domain of a restaurant group that has always refused to do things the usual way.  You do get that sense when you enter the Office. The Chicago Office is downstairs from the Aviary; in New York it is behind a wooden door just past the Aviary’s cocktail-assembly station. Suddenly faceless hotel luxury gives way to a den of leather club chairs, parquet floors, clothbound books, manual typewriters, contemporary art, eccentric antiques. The two Offices are usually called speakeasies. This one looks to me more like the library of stately Wayne Manor. The theme is tradition. This being an Achatz project, the theme is pushed to its limits and beyond. Micah Melton, the beverage director of both lounges (in both cities), scours auctions and private sales for old bottles of spirits. Some of the older ones go here for $500 an ounce or more, straight up. Others are mixed into what the menu calls “dusty bottle cocktails.” As a way to get rid of money, this is both alluring and appalling. I couldn’t bring myself to order a $475 old-fashioned stirred from bourbon bottled in 1969. But I couldn’t resist learning what happens when 75 grams of shaved truffle soak in a bottle of Chartreuse. (It’s fascinating, but not more delicious than untruffled Chartreuse.) The short food menu appears to have been printed by letterpress. On it are a number of time-honored plutocratic pleasures, such as cold oysters, foie gras terrine, and a really fine and forcefully seasoned tartare of ivory-veined rib-eye. Steamed mussels in cream with leeks and bacon are $35. If any pot of mussels is worth that much money, this is it. Vegetable crudités may sound like nothing. They’re very much something, a miniature forest of fruits and vegetables treated this way and that, then set on chipped ice with a dip — a harmonious, understated vadouvan-squash cream the last time I went. The contortions that Mr. Melton and Mr. Achatz put liquor through at the Aviary are as imaginative as cuisine gets; they probably have more freedom than they would if the place were a restaurant. But rather than asking how a Bloody Mary, say, can be improved, or what its essence is, they seem to ask: How would the Aviary serve it? The answer always seems to require equipment. The bird-all-the-way-out drinks especially are like elaborate magic tricks with metal boxes into which the beautiful assistant will vanish. Somehow, the boxes upstage the assistant. The cocktails at the Office are more like close-up card tricks. My favorite is: Mix me a drink and I’ll make it disappear.

55,The Lobster Club,★,2018-01-30,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/dining/the-lobster-club-review.html,Midtown East,"One thing that sets Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone apart from other very talented chefs is how happy they seem to be creating restaurants that are not about them, or even primarily about cooking. While their peers were putting their kitchen skill front and center, through tasting menus or through restaurants where decoration was minimal and amenities were pared back until there was almost nothing left but the plates, they went in the opposite direction. From their first restaurant, Torrisi Italian Specialties, inside a fake Italian grocery store, their places have been highly distracting in ways that serious chefs tend to shun. The interiors are ornamental and over the top; the servers are dressed in uniforms that we might as well call costumes; the playlists are what your friend for whom entertaining is a life-or-death matter would put together for a highly specific theme party. Other chefs would have worried that their precious food would be overshadowed by the rest of the production. Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Carbone always seemed confident that wasn’t going to happen. Before they opened their Japanese restaurant, the Lobster Club, they were right. Now two months old, the Lobster Club is the third and final stage in the annexation of the Seagram Building’s dining spaces by the Major Food Group, run by the two chefs and Jeff Zalaznick. The first two stages were the Grill and the Pool, carved out of what used to be the Four Seasons. The Lobster Club sits under the Pool in a space that was originally a 24-hour brasserie. Vintage East Siders such as Peter Marino, the architect who designed the Lobster Club, still talk about dropping into the Brasserie for onion soup after writhing the night away at Studio 54. Mr. Marino apparently wanted to bring the party back. From the top of the stairs just inside the entrance, on East 53rd Street, a scene from Fellini seems to be playing out. A big square lounge in the middle of the room is bounded by zebra-striped panels of white ebony. Spurts and dribbles of paint cover the floor and the black trousers that some of the servers are wearing. It looks as if Jackson Pollock were called back for one last job. On the walls are prints Mr. Marino made from paintings he owns. The originals were painted by Richard Prince, modeled on paintings by Picasso. The Prince Picasso-painting prints have themselves been painted, gone over by Mr. Marino with thick pigment in a completely different style. Marvin Gaye is singing. He wants everybody to know that sexual healing is something that is good for him. Round tables are surrounded by pink lounge chairs that look, from behind, like enormous cartoon lips. The booths are upholstered in a chartreuse camouflage pattern, a useful fabric if the Army ever needs to hide in a green neon jungle. Blending in at the Lobster Club in winter means fur coats and designer sweaters. A man with silver hair, a double-breasted blazer and a pocket square is circling the perimeter, swiveling his head, an eager expression in his eyes, as if he had been told there would be a limbo pole. On the right, a big group is sitting around a skinny table that can be partitioned from the rest of the dining area by drawing a floor-to-ceiling curtain, as in an operating room. The curtain is made of black leather. All the bartenders are dressed like leather daddies. Isaac Hayes is singing now. He has some thoughts to share about a black private dick who’s a sex machine to all the chicks. What kind of Japanese restaurant is this? It would need to be a sensational one to compete with the rest of the goings-on. It is not. In fact, the Lobster Club seems to be making an effort not to be sensational. The cooking, as a whole, suggests Japanese food as seen through American eyes at some point in the recent past. There is no soup, no noodles, no tofu and few vegetables. But there is salmon teriyaki, made more meticulously than any I’ve ever seen, with a dark-pink medium-rare core and a translucent, unsyrupy glaze. The core of the menu is steak and seafood cooked on a teppan, the steel grill introduced to the United States by the original Benihana, which by the way is still in business a few blocks away. Not that Lobster Club is an explicit homage. If its cooks are juggling spatulas and flipping shrimp into the air, they are doing it behind closed kitchen doors. My Wagyu skirt steak was a far better product than anything I remember from Benihana. Ditto the teppanyaki king mushroom stems that accompanied it along with more shishito peppers than I needed and more sauces than I can name. The mustard miso was my favorite with steak; for grilled scallops, I would go with the yuzu chimichurri. Tasuku Murakami, the executive chef, was highly regarded during his time behind the counter at Sushi Azabu, in TriBeCa. He has his seafood shipped in from Japan, including seasonal treats like black-throat sea perch and tiny white shrimp called shiro-ebi. He, or one of his followers, carves it with finesse and sets it over a wad of rice that I wished were a little warmer and more strongly vinegared. The style is very traditional, except for the rolls that combine, say, fried oysters with Wagyu. The à la carte prices are on average slightly higher than at slightly better places such as 15 East. It would be silly not to try some sushi at the Lobster Club, and just as silly to travel there for it. Two skewered appetizers were among my favorite things on the menu. One is the pork belly, lightly browned on the grill and then half-buried under a chopped pineapple sauce. The other is the tsukune, or chicken meatball, which is richer than you expect thanks to an unadvertised, invisible but very noticeable addition of foie gras. Some of Mr. Murakami’s appetizers struck me as barely Japanese at all. Certain raw fish dishes could be served at any number of New York restaurants, like slices of sea bass showered with brittle strands of fried brussels sprouts, or raw cherry trout twirled around crunchy nests of fried potato threads. Both are fine things to eat, by the way. The one called wok lobster — battered and fried lobster tail pieces in a sweet-and-sour sauce — seems very Chinese. It is also very oily, like the fried rock shrimp and the teppanyaki garlic rice, which will ooze oil as you watch. “I didn’t expect it to remind me of Ruby Foo’s,” said a stranger who stopped by my table on her way out. (This kind of thing is always happening at the Lobster Club.) I think I knew what she meant. If you order the wrong things the food can be surprisingly heavy, and no matter what you eat you can’t quite avoid a sense that this place doesn’t take its supposed inspiration as seriously as it could. Then again, it is one of the only places in the city where you can end a meal with steamed black-sugar cakes, soft and homey and rarely seen outside their hometown, Okinawa. And it is among the few to serve kakigori, a mountain of shaved ice. Stephanie Prida, the pastry chef, soaks it with blood orange-syrup on one side and condensed milk on the other. As soon as one table orders it, everybody else in the vicinity wants one. I’ve never seen anybody finish it.

56,Ferris,★★,2018-01-09,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/dining/ferris-review-chelsea.html,Chelsea,"Ferris manages to do a lot within the confines of its small space in the basement of the new Made hotel, south of Herald Square. At times it reminded me of one of those Leatherman tools that unfolds to reveal not just a knife and screwdriver but also a spoke wrench, fish scaler, eyelash curler, olive pitter, tuning fork and eel skinner. One recent night I sat at Ferris’s seven-seat kitchen counter. I didn’t realize that I was also sitting at Ferris’s bar until the bartender standing in front of me had measured my drink, strained it into a stem glass and set it on a napkin, all without moving more than one step to the right or left. She had whipped up a citrus-sheathed gin number with a rustle of Chartreuse called a 388 C, and it was about as cheerful a kickoff to the dinner hour as anything I’ve come across lately. In fact, almost all the drinks that Ferris’s bartenders stir up in about four square feet of space are smarter and more bracing than what typically comes out of a full-size bar, and often they are poured into vintage etched glasses that any neo-speakeasy would envy. The cocktails encapsulate Ferris’s most likable traits. It’s a modest restaurant that overdelivers, cares about little details and has a personal, handmade sensibility. It doesn’t quite give you the feeling of showing up at a friend’s place for dinner, but it comes closer than a lot of places where that’s the explicit aim. The illusion is aided by the carpentered interior. The single dining room, clad in raw two-by-eights, could be a suburban basement finished over the weekend by a couple with a table saw. A long cushioned bench built into one end of the room provides about half the seating, along with the stools at high tables and the counter. There’s no lobby or reception area to speak of. If you arrive by elevator you’re facing the kitchen, and if you take the stairs from the sidewalk you walk straight into the action in the dining room. Standing behind the counter and facing the customers is the chef, Greg Proechel. He is generally holding a knife and spends much of the night carving meat. His cooking has settled down since his last job, at Le Turtle, a deliberately odd French spot on Chrystie Street. There, he had some original ideas but didn’t always seem to know the difference between the good ones and the bad ones. At Ferris, his only bad idea so far is trying to make roasted sunchokes into a main course, and by the time I gave up on the plate, filled out with smoked cabbage and sauced with scallion miso, I’d decided that sunchokes themselves were more to blame than Mr. Proechel. He is on firmer ground with other vegetables: Okinawa sweet potatoes, their purple flesh mashed so it opens up to a splash of buttermilk and pumpkin mustard; or roasted beets with soft curls of fresh coconut, dressed in a dark tahini made from black sesame seeds; or charred stalks of broccolini with grapes and cashews (welcome back, cashews, we’ve missed you) scattered over a cushion of yogurt spiced with Timur pepper — a relative of the Sichuan peppercorn. Agnolotti with a buttery and nearly liquid carrot filling are one of Ferris’s more appealing main dishes; they’re tossed with braised lamb neck. Maybe they would be slightly better without chips of crunchy raw carrot on top; contrary to popular belief, not every dish needs what chefs like to call texture. Mr. Proechel has a keen sense for contrasting flavors, though. He uses red pepper and sticky grilled dates to make what has to be the most exciting blood sausage in town. A chunk of grilled mackerel that any izakaya could be proud of sits in ponzu with — surprise — plums and an egg yolk cooked so that it looks and spreads like lemon curd. If you have heard anything at all about Le Turtle, then you know about the Sasso chicken that came to the table on a bed of smoldering hay with its head and feet still attached; it tasted great even though it looked as if the fire department had arrived too late at a four-alarm blaze in a chicken coop. Nothing at Ferris makes heads swivel and nostrils twitch in quite the same way, but if it’s a table-annexing feast you want, then the côte de boeuf with “all the fixings” is the dish for you. Mr. Proechel has his own notions about “fixings.” I have never looked at a grilled beef rib and thought that what it really needed was a bowl of whipped buttermilk, but apparently he has, and I have to give him credit. Beating the buttermilk turns it into something between yogurt and whipped cream; mixing that with charred cipollini makes it into a particularly luxurious onion dip. There’s also a paste of black garlic to serve as a super-concentrated steak sauce, and a shaved brussels sprout salad for relief from the richness. The only false move here was the sodden dumplings in broth, and they were easy enough to ignore in all the excitement. The danger of putting a firecracker like that on the menu is that the half of the dining room that didn’t order it ends up staring glumly at the half that did. That was me, one night, looking at the women at the corner table who doted on their steak for an hour while I poked at my (perfectly all right) cod with clams and hazelnuts. When you are ready for something to drink with the côte de boeuf, you run into another surprise of this Swiss Army knife of a restaurant: the versatile wine list, overseen by Jenny Lakin. It’s not long, and it draws mainly from France and Italy, but it’s been carefully drafted to include relative values from expensive regions and out-and-out values from less traveled areas. Ferris doesn’t knock itself out for the dessert course. The few sweets are simple and pleasant, though, from the yuzu-lemon frozen yogurt to a dark chocolate mousse stuck with chips of jasmine meringue. Ms. Lakin’s list carries over into dessert territory with amari, absinthes, liqueurs, eaux-de-vie and other end-of-the-night shots. Where all these bottles are stored I never figured out.

57,The Loyal,★★,2017-12-26,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/26/dining/the-loyal-review-nyc.html,Greenwich Village,"Usually, I can take or leave the slice of tomato that comes with almost every burger in America. The tomato at John Fraser’s latest restaurant, the Loyal, is the first one I’ve ever met that helps the burger so much that it becomes the whole point. Mr. Fraser calls it a “22-step tomato.” And thereby hangs a tale, no doubt, but in the interest of time let’s skip to the finished product: a peeled plum tomato collapsed down to a red cushion that more or less covers the patty. It’s juicy but not gushy, tart and sweet and complex, so it does some of the work normally done by ketchup, but it’s more dynamic and delicious. You could eat it on its own, but it completes the somewhat austere flavor of the beef from a Piedmontese cattle breed. Even under a melted sheet of Comté, the patty is not as woozily rich as many contemporary chef-burgers. In all, it’s an ingenious notion from a chef who is on his fourth current restaurant and seems to be in no imminent danger of running out of ideas. The Loyal switched on the lights over its red awning on Bleecker Street in September. Unlike the last two places Mr. Fraser opened, which have themes — Nix is vegetarian and Narcissa’s menu revolves around the rotisserie — the Loyal is a free-for-all. It has one of those overpopulated menus that borrows from brasseries, trattorias and mainstream American taverns. Cold seafood and snack sections run in a skinny column on the left side, across from a long scroll of appetizers, pastas and main courses. All this may cause eye fatigue long before you get to the crawl of side dishes at the bottom of the page. The something-for-everybody menu works, in the sense that by around 6:30 p.m. it starts to appear as if everybody has decided to eat there at once: bachelorette-party celebrators in plastic tiaras; people who look like artists and people who look like art collectors; older couples gaping in amusement at younger couples who have no idea they’re being gaped at. “What brings all these people here?” somebody at my table asked a server. She thought about it and shrugged. “Michelin-star chef?” One of Mr. Fraser’s two stars went to Nix and the other to Dovetail, his first restaurant as chef and owner, and his most formal. The Loyal is slightly formal itself. Wine bottles rest on polished steel coasters, and servers sweep crumbs from the white tablecloths after every course. Home Studios designed the dining room after the style of a 1950s nightclub, with leather booths and banquettes and one round table up front half-secluded in a cove of mirrors and marble that looks as if it is reserved for Walter Winchell. The formality is a peculiarly high-decibel variety. Enhanced by clever but not overly wonky cocktails, people strain to talk over music that is never soft, even early at night before the room fills up. At times I wanted to stuff my ears with the Parker House rolls, and at other times, like when Rob Base and DJ E-Z Rock rolled into “It Takes Two,” I almost thought the noise was necessary for the interior to make sense. Starting with chilled seafood fits the retro mood of the Loyal. It’s always smart to scoop up bay scallops when they are in their short season, especially as they are done at the Loyal, lounging in their shells in a pool of blood orange-ginger juice that you could drink by the glassful. When scallop season ends, the lobster tail dressed in smoked tomato sauce would make a fine consolation prize, as would the sweet, unrubbery shrimp in a cocktail sauce that leans heavily on Old Bay. The snacks are all over the map. Some borrow from Japan, like the soft-cooked eggs in the style of a ramen shop with red lids of jellied chile oil or the beech mushrooms, fried tempura style, wonderful even if their horseradish-cream sauce wasn’t quite an ideal match. Others come from nearer to home. Molding a pâté of chicken liver so it looks like a stick of butter, then serving it on a glass butter dish, is undeniably a bid for Instagram stardom, but the port wine syrup that surrounded it was so bright and fruity that I couldn’t be grumpy about it. Mr. Fraser is very skilled at getting vegetables to do things they’re not normally inclined to do. Steamed avocado with quinoa sounds like a dish you’d feed your enemies, but while it was on the menu I loved the way it almost melted into its spicy green chermoula sauce. Chayote, rarely an extrovert, got the extra spark it needed from an orange scribble of paprika-piquillo sauce. As partner for a bowl of polenta with truffles, broccoli pesto was unexpectedly sensible. A less eccentric idea, capellini with artichokes, still pulled off some surprises because Mr. Fraser got such bright and lively flavor out of the artichokes. With the main courses, the meal tends to settle down into a routine of standard meats and fish, enlivened by the occasional firecracker side dish. Lamb chops traveled with a terrific rice pilaf, pink with harissa. The burger took not just the 22-step tomato but also a little saucer of potato “tots,” large dice fried in duck fat. The starch for the hanger steak was potato purée with lobster gravy, which may not be the highest use of lobster but is almost certainly the highest use of gravy. Knowing that early in his career Mr. Fraser worked in an ice-cream parlor makes the heavy presence of sundaes on the dessert menu seem less pandering than it would in another restaurant. Or so I thought until our server told us, in breathy tones, about the “sundae set and candy shop,” a pile of Neapolitan ice cream that comes with Pixy Stix, Chupa Chups, Gummi Bears, gold coins, M&Ms, chocolate pebbles and other sugar bombs. It would be a big hit with children, preferably somebody else’s. My ageless companions enjoyed the Sonoma Harvest sundae instead, with brûléed figs and bits of honeycomb around yogurt and Concord grape sorbets. There’s a very clever baked alaska, too; the toasted meringue is filled with graham-cracker ice cream sitting on a base of chocolate cake, so it tastes like s’mores. The California-based artist Lukas Geronimas has been gradually filling the dining room walls with small, enigmatic paintings over the past few months. The ones toward the front could be illustrations from a book for children about friendly relations among humans, vegetables and farm animals. Toward the restrooms, the relations seem more than friendly. They’d probably be a hit with somebody else’s children, too.

58,Wallsé,★,2017-12-19,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/dining/wallse-review-austrian-restaurant.html,West Village,"On the first undeniably cold night in November, an idea began to take shape in my head. The shape was specific, and it looked like the map of Austria. As in my grade-school geography books, it was illustrated with images of natural resources: amber waves of Wiener schnitzel, nuggets of goulash the color of iron ore, the gentle white slopes of Salzburger nockerl. There is no wrong time of year to eat Austrian food, but the approach of winter always brings it to my mind — a lifelong habit of associating strudel and schnitzel with snowflakes that stay on your nose and eyelashes, thank you very much, Julie Andrews. So when I first saw that map, I knew what it meant: Time to go back to Wallsé. For 17 years, Kurt Gutenbrunner has been serving Austrian cuisine underpinned by farmers’ market produce at Wallsé, in the West Village. It was his first restaurant as chef and owner, the start of a minor Austrian empire that now includes Blaue Gans, where there are more wursts on the menu and more elbows on the tables, and Café Sabarsky in the Neue Galerie museum, where people sit upright over cups of milchkaffee and slim wedges of Linzer torte. Wallsé is still his base camp, where at the end of the night you might see him towering over the second-tallest person at the bar. Imposing as he is, Mr. Gutenbrunner is dwarfed by his own portrait, which hangs across from the bar. Julian Schnabel painted him looking both heroic and angry, surrounded by a lightning-blue nimbus. The blue light may represent the bolts of inspiration that drive Mr. Gutenbrunner to higher and higher creative peaks, although to me it looked as if he had been soaked with kirsch and flambéed. The painting is one of many that have accumulated at Wallsé over the years. Otherwise, the two small rooms look much as I remembered them from my last visit, around the time of its last review in The New York Times, in 2004, when Amanda Hesser gave it two stars. The windows on West 11th Street are still impressively wide; the tablecloths are still white; the chairs are still black, high-backed and convincingly Secession-ish. But furniture was not part of the map that had danced before my eyes. Schnitzel was, and the particular schnitzel I had seen was veal, pounded to the thickness of flannel, inside a rippled crust of crumbs. I wanted to be able to slice it with the side of a fork and hear it crackle. I wanted it with sweet, cool sliced cucumbers, a fingerling potato salad and lingonberries. And that is what I got. Another pressing issue: Was quark spaetzle with braised rabbit still on the menu? It was. Would this warm bowl of buttered noodles, in irregular curves and swoops like some secret alphabet, still make me glad I’d walked this far west facing a chilly wind off the river? It did. The goulash was not the home-style stew I had pictured — it was made from short ribs braised separately before being introduced to a paprika-onion sauce — but it was delicious. The fine produce that I remembered as setting Wallsé apart from more old-school Austrian restaurants was still there, too. Wonderful lobster poached in butter was woven in with small chanterelles and crisp zucchini. Little minarets of romanesco sat alongside the warm smoked char under chopped green apple and trout roe. Wallsé’s Sacher torte has a black-gloss icing made from a darker chocolate than usual, and it’s moister than some versions; it doesn’t necessarily need its little quenelle of whipped cream, but of course Sacher torte that is not served mit schlag is not Sacher torte. As for the triple-mounded soufflé known as Salzburger knockerl, it was better than anything my imagination could have whipped up. Mr. Gutenbrunner’s version looks and tastes like three peach-size toasted marshmallows with small brown peaks, and it sits on a pool of hot dark caramel and huckleberries. All these things are just what I want when I go to Wallsé. But other aspects of my recent meals knocked a little of the shine off the enthusiasm I used to feel. There were dishes that didn’t come off. The next time I tried the goulash it was a venison stew, and each bite was different. A few were tender, but others were hard, dry or gristly. Raw wild bass, with radishes and black sesame seeds, tasted as if its swimming days were a little too far in the past. Savory palatschinken, crepes rolled around smoked trout and horseradish sauce, were fine and lively one night, but on another the cold hand of the refrigerator lay heavily on them. And I tried the Icelandic cod twice without ever learning to like the peculiarly fruity, soupy squash purêe spooned around the fish. Apple strudel fell somewhere between the two extremes. You could certainly pick worse strudels to end the night with, but the pastry was a bit of a nonentity; its flavor almost disappeared into the fruit’s. The service seems to have lost the lightly starched Middle-European rectitude that I remembered. Plates were all set down at the same time, but some were cleared before everyone was finished. There are excellent Austrian bottles on the fairly concise wine list, but with prices that easily drift up above $70, you might wish the servers were better versed on their ins and outs. And it shouldn’t be so easy to be ignored in dining rooms as intimate as Wallsé’s. It wouldn’t take much to pull the lines taut again. And even with these flaws, Wallsé has Old World charm and grown-up civility that aren’t easy to find in the younger restaurants that have cropped up nearby. The things it does well it does better than anybody, which is important to know when you start dreaming about nockerl, followed, of course, by a glass of schnapps.","Schnitzel and Strudel and Other

59,Jeju Noodle Bar,★★,2017-12-05,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/dining/jeju-noodle-bar-review-korean-ramen.html,West Village,"Before Jeju Noodle Bar came along in September, avid noodle watchers could have believed that the New York City ramen scene had reached a point of, if not saturation, at least diminishing returns. High-functioning Japanese chains such as E.A.K., Ichiran and Ippudo had established beachheads. Ivan Orkin, Joshua Smookler and other chefs were having their way with the genre, following the trail of noodles left more than a decade ago by a young unknown named David Chang. Ramen tasting menus and ramen isolation booths were thriving along with stand-up and sit-down ramen counters. Appreciation for the finer points of tsukemen and mazemen, of seasoning shio and blending tare, had grown far beyond Japanese expatriates. But fresh wrinkles on the classics were growing rare, while new ramen-yas came along so fast it was getting hard to keep them straight. All that remained, it seemed, was to fill in the blank spaces on the map until bowls of tonkotsu and shoyu ramen were sold everywhere from Tottenville to Gun Hill Road. The one thing this view failed to take into account was the inspiration for Jeju Noodle Bar: Korean ramen. Yes, Koreans eat ramen. Oh, do they. Last year, South Korean domestic demand for ramyun, as it’s known there, reached 1.16 billion pounds, a new high. We know the weight because almost all the ramyun made and eaten in South Korea is the instant variety. This reportedly also holds true in North Korea, where reliable sales figures are harder to come by. In other words, Jeju, in the West Village, is a tribute to a packaged convenience store item made up of a compressed brick of dried or fried noodles and an envelope of powdered or concentrated soup base. Often it is sold and mixed in a disposable cup. As important as ramyun is to the Korean diet, it is not the kind of culinary tradition that typically draws the attention of American chefs who have cooked at Per Se, Bouley and Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare, as Douglas Kim did before founding Jeju. It is somewhat as if a cook had left L’Astrance in Paris to open a restaurant specializing in interpretations of Hot Pockets. To judge from the three soups on Jeju’s menu, Mr. Kim is not trying to reverse-engineer just-add-water Korean brands like Shin and Samyang. All of Jeju’s broths have the body and texture that comes with boiling and skimming for hours over an abundance of meat and bones. One of them, the so ramyun, is made with veal. It is slightly less thick and rich than eggnog, but just as smooth. Mr. Kim ladles this broth over thin squiggles of chewy noodles, a hunk of stewed brisket and thin red sheets of raw Wagyu striated with white fat. Unbashful amounts of garlic chips and black pepper rough up the edges of the broth’s gorgeously rounded beef flavor. The pork soup called gochu ramyun has a similarly lavish texture; heavy on the slippery collagen that holds pigs’ feet together, it glides across your lips. This broth, though, is spicy, and the gochujang spooned over the seared pork belly slab on top makes it even more so. This is Mr. Kim’s most obvious homage to Korean instant ramens, many of which are more fiery than the typical Japanese product. But Korean ingredients and seasonings turn up in all of his ramyuns. The gochu ramyun is garnished with daikon kimchi — not the pink, chili-bathed kind, but an unspiced white kimchi that, like the small sheaf of iceberg lettuce, provides a break from the heat. In contrast to the milky opacity of the veal and pork broths is the translucent, sparkling-gold chicken broth in a ramyun called the Fish Coop. The fish in question is bonito, flakes of which bring a mild background of seafood to the intense chicken flavor. Even with slices of jalapeño and a floating green rim of herb oil tasting of chives and dill, the broth is subtle enough that you can really taste the juicy shreds of chicken confit. Each of the three soups is so carefully considered, so well harmonized, that Jeju’s menu really could end there. But Mr. Kim makes a handful of Korean-inspired appetizers, too, all more nuanced than what you’d find in a typical ramen-ya. I love the cucumber kimchi, skinny little numbers whose soft tartness is almost bubbly and very slightly minty. Is there shiso in the brine? There’s certainly plum in the sweet dressing dotted with black and white sesame seeds. Mr. Kim’s soon du bu doesn’t have the gloom-killing uppercut of more traditional recipes — it’s a little too dainty and mild — but its tomato-shellfish broth supporting the usual soft tofu and some unorthodox but welcome green olives is very good on its own terms. One of three raw-fish appetizers is tuna yuk hwe in a pallid, forgettable dressing. But the amberjack salad with chimichurri and brown-butter vinaigrette is very delicious, as is the hwe dup bap — sashimi and trout roe over warm rice made extra-fishy by tiny black dots of flyingfish roe. There are a few other small dishes, including a likable steamed bun filled with pork belly and corn kernels. It will be interesting to see whether Mr. Kim elaborates this portion of the menu a bit, perhaps adding some larger plates. At the moment, it would be hard to make a complete meal at Jeju without ramyun, which may keep away people who don’t eat meat. Like some other young chefs, Mr. Kim has brought his cooks into the tip pool by asking them to double as waiters. It may help him recruit talent for his kitchen, but it may also be a reason the service is muddled. I’ve been served food meant for another table; I’ve been asked the same question by two people within the space of a minute; I’ve been given empty plates I didn’t need, and had to stop somebody from clearing dishes I hadn’t finished. The confusion even extended to the greeting at the door. One night when I got there before my guests, a host asked how far away everybody else was. I said I was sure they were close. “Well, your reservation was at 8,” was the reply. It was 8:03. These are minor gripes, but Mr. Kim’s cooking deserves better. And so does the dining room, which is roomier and more elegant than the words “noodle bar” might suggest. Jeju took over what used to be Nighthawks, in the space where the north side of Christopher Street meets the east side of Greenwich Street at an acute angle. It isn’t the room Hopper painted, but it’s not far off. Mr. Kim kept the wraparound windows, the black-and-white floor tiles and the recessed tin chandelier rosette, then added some backlighted shelves behind the bar to hold the handmade plates and other pottery. It is all clean and orderly, just bright enough that when you stand across the street you can see the new nighthawks bending over their bowls of noodles.

60,Ugly Baby,★★,2017-11-28,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/28/dining/ugly-baby-review-thai-brooklyn.html,Carroll Gardens,"If you’ve ever hired a contractor, someone probably told you that you can get work that’s good, fast or cheap, but not all three. This may be an immutable law for kitchen cabinets, but it is not always true of Thai restaurants, as I learned at a new place in Brooklyn with the memorable name Ugly Baby. We were still asking ourselves whether we’d ordered too much when the first plate landed: four little fried coconut cakes, called tue ka ko, with sweet black beans and taro sticks embedded in their tops under a handful of chopped peanuts. Imagine coming across a snack that combines the best qualities of the doughnut, the mini-muffin and Orwashers’ toasted-coconut macaroon, and finding it not at some hipster’s stand at Smorgasburg but on a dim sum trolley, and you have a pretty good idea of Ugly Baby’s tue ka ko. It was the perfect dessert for a meal we hadn’t eaten yet, I decided, just as the next dish touched down. This was kang hoh, rice vermicelli tangled up with tender pork in a tamarind-soured dry curry from northern Thailand. The bits of fried pork skin on top, curled like Fritos, gave me something to munch on while I wondered how much of my tongue the curry would shut down. Not too much, it turned out; the steady drive of the heat just made me want more. But by the time that became clear, the table was full. It had taken about five minutes. Nothing cost more than $25. All of it was very good and a few things were so exceptional that they are now pinned to my map of great Thai dishes in the city, up on the mental wall with such standbys as the duck curry at Ayada and the papaya salad with crispy ground catfish at Sripraphai. Kang kua supparod is one of them. The menu terms it a mushroom pineapple curry, but you will get a sharper idea if you picture mushroom slices and squares of pressed tofu paddling around in a creamy yellow sauce of crushed pineapple and coconut milk. You can see the lime leaves that flavor it, but you only taste the lemongrass, galangal, chiles and other complications. Another is a kao tod nom klook, a warm rice salad with roots in Laos. The rice is cooked with a dry curry and a nontrivial quantity of chiles, then seared to imprint a chewy, golden crust on it. Stirred with short bits of long beans, cilantro, mint, peanuts and, crucially, some tangy pink crumbles of fermented pork sausage, it performs best when wrapped in lettuce with a basil leaf, a dried chile and anything else you happen to discover on the plate. Ugly Baby is in Carroll Gardens, across Smith Street from the hole in the earth where the F and G tracks begin to climb toward their high-rise crawl over the Gowanus Canal. Open since August, the restaurant traces its lineage back to two restaurants that had brief lives not far away in Red Hook. One, Chiang Mai, a pop-up inside another establishment, was supposed to be temporary. The other, Kao Soy, wasn’t, but the two owners found that their partnership was not built for the long haul. What the three restaurants share is Sirichai Sreparplarn. He shared chef duties at the first two and takes the wheel himself at Ugly Baby, which is named after the Thai superstition that evil spirits won’t bother harming unattractive infants. The walls are painted in a James Rosenquist palette with quick, energetic brush strokes. The cooks and servers wear cartoon colored T-shirts, sneakers and aprons, except for the younger cook whose apron is printed with a monochromatic photograph of hand-lettered cassettes. There’s buzzy guitar pop playing at volumes that can make the restaurant sound like a bar, even though the refrigerator at the entrance to the open kitchen isn’t stocked with wine and beer yet. When I reviewed Kao Soy in 2015, Mr. Sreparplarn told me that he and his co-chef were passionate about serving “the real food from the north.” He has let himself have the run of the country at Ugly Baby, although he still gives the north its due. In his larb, made with duck in the style of the Isan city of Udon Thani, smashed dried chiles do not so much coat the meat as embed themselves in it. As you chew, you summon up new waves of heat that the fresh leaves of Vietnamese coriander and bites of raw cabbage and cucumbers can do only so much to mitigate. Its only rival for sheer atomic power comes from southern Thailand. Kua kling is a beef curry that is stir-fried until it is completely dry and there is almost no hope of separating the meat from the chiles. Mr. Sreparplarn’s version is cooked with needles of lime leaf and clusters of green peppercorns on their stalks. I tasted them right away, although it took five minutes before I was able to tell anybody about it. Southern Thai cooking isn’t all scorched earth, though. Ugly Baby has a soothing fried sea bream rubbed with fresh turmeric and garlic, a favorite way to cook fish in that part of the country. Another calming seafood dish, this one from central Thailand, looks like a soup, but its tea-colored broth — soured with tamarind and brightened by sticks of ginger — is simply meant to flavor the fillets of red snapper in it, and keep them hot. Some of these dishes are rare in New York. You can’t say that about the grilled chicken skewers marinated in coconut-peanut sauce, but Ugly Baby’s might be the best available version of the dish, made with meaty thighs instead of stringy white meat. Like Mr. Sreparplarn’s first two restaurants, Ugly Baby serves a rich kao soy, with beef in the coconut broth instead of chicken this time. I have to admit that I miss the crisp haystack of fried noodles and green papaya fritters that the first restaurant piled on top, and I wish Mr. Sreparplarn added in more pickled mustard greens and less chile oil (or served condiments on the side and let you decide how sour and spicy to make the soup, as Kao Soy did). The one dessert, when it is available, is rice pudding with durian. You may love this. Or, like me, you may try a spoonful to see if you still think durian tastes like boiled pearl onions. (Yes.) Or you may want to keep your distance. If you’re in that group, and you haven’t ordered the coconut mini-muffins, now’s your chance.

61,Cote,★★,2017-11-14,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/14/dining/cote-review-korean-barbecue.html,Flatiron,"When a Korean barbecue place wants to set itself apart from all the other Korean barbecue places, it has essentially three variables to play with: meat, heat and sides. (In this way it is similar to American barbecue, which it otherwise doesn’t resemble at all.) Cote, which has been wielding scissors and tongs on West 22nd Street since June, is resoundingly in the meat camp. Specifically, the meat that Cote grills is prime beef aged anywhere from a week to four and a half months in a cooler downstairs, next to a small lounge. Like Gallagher’s, Cote hangs the sirloins, rib-eyes, hangers, skirts and so on behind glass so customers can inspect the inventory. Unlike Gallagher’s, Cote floods the room with light the color of freshly spilled blood, making it look like a set from “American Horror Story: Steakhouse.” The two dining rooms upstairs aren’t nearly as gothic, although they are dark and moody. The walls are painted a deep blue-green, the floors are raw concrete, the tables are black soapstone. It is not exactly a date place — the hard surfaces amplify noise a little too well — but it is not exactly not a date place, either. People dress up to eat at Cote (it sounds like coat), perhaps because the Japanese-built yakiniku grills set into the center of the tables emit almost none of the smoke that can weave its way into your clothes after a night in one of the remaining barbecue palaces on 32nd Street. After taking cocktail orders (the rosé slushie, decorated with a paper flamingo, tastes the way wine does when you are 8 years old), servers will offer a tour of the menu that ends with a strong endorsement of the “butcher’s feast.” This is a set menu, at $45 a person, with fluffy steamed eggs in a pot, two fundamental Korean stews, pickles, lettuce and, at the center of it all, a dealer’s choice of four cuts of beef. After all that has been cleared, vanilla soft serve under a squiggle of soy caramel appears in little paper cups with little wooden spoons. The meats at my most recent butcher’s feast were hanger steak, the reddish-purple of a brand-new bruise; a rib-eye together with a flap of rib-eye cap, both pink and spiderwebbed with white veins of fat; a thickish slab of flatiron steak, said to be the product of a cow who had Wagyu on one side of the family and Angus on the other; and finally galbi, short ribs in a sweet soy marinade. The other cuts in the butcher’s feast vary but galbi is a constant, as it should be. The meats came out early, while the gas grill warmed up. The wire cage over it was primed with a cube of beef fat, and then the beef went on, one cut at a time. Our server turned the meat once, then walked away, and one of my guests started to worry that the meat would burn. But the flames were low, and the beef browned gradually. The gas burners at Cote will never give you the sharp, dark, crackling edges that you find in the charcoal-grilled meats at Mapo Korean BBQ in Queens (and almost nowhere else in the city). The beef, though, is in all likelihood the best at any Korean barbecue place in New York. Its two closest competitors for steak supremacy are probably Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong and Gaonnuri, and neither can match Cote for richness and concentrated flavor. One night I ignored the butcher’s feast path and went off-road so I could try some sirloin that had been ripening downstairs for 138 days. Steaks aged that long are often described as funky, but the word doesn’t cover this piece of meat. It tasted like something other than beef, or maybe beyond beef, more condiment than protein. At $80 for six ounces, it was not my cup of barley tea, but it may be yours. Next time, I’ll stick to the road more traveled by. The butcher’s feast takes in most of the menu’s highlights, avoids the lowlights, and does so at a very good price for a steak supper. No matter what or how you order, though, you will have to contend with Cote’s notions of when to serve the condiments and side dishes that make the difference between Korean barbecue and a heap of grilled meat. Pickled cauliflower and soy-marinated chayote (both very good), lettuce and ssamjang (the fermented bean paste) arrive as the beef starts cooking. Rice doesn’t turn up until midway through the meal, when you’re finally brought pickled daikon, kimchi, kimchi stew and fermented bean-paste stew. Gochujang may show up at the beginning or at halftime. There is no one right way to eat Korean barbecue, but people who like to bundle the meat into lettuce or shiso with a lump of rice and a pickled cabbage leaf will wonder why Cote parcels the side dishes out in stages. That isn’t the only case of the missing kimchi. I couldn’t taste it in the fried rice “paella” with kimchi and Wagyu. The dish didn’t have much in common with paella, either. I wouldn’t care what it was called if it were delicious, but like some of the other attempts to loosen Korean custom, it came off as timid. Simon Kim, the owner, keeps saying in interviews that Cote is a Korean steakhouse. I understand why he wants to draw attention to the steak, but anybody who shows up expecting a kimchi-fied Smith & Wollensky is going to be very confused. You will search in vain for a baked potato or creamed spinach on David Shim’s menu. You can, however, get a shrimp cocktail with gochujang cocktail sauce, an idea that’s not as good as it sounds. You can eat an adapted wedge salad with candylike lumps of bacon and an unresponsive tofu-sesame dressing. And, in a homage to Peter Luger, there is bacon as an appetizer, which turns out to be unsmoked and uncured pork jowl. It’s better with a smear of ssamjang, but then most everything is. More traditional Korean dishes tended to taste more complete. If you want more starch than rice alone, the skinny wheat noodles in hot anchovy broth are simple and delicious. Cold noodles stirred at the table with slivered apples, lettuce and gochujang are spicy, sweet and refreshing. There’s a very good dolsot bibimbap, with a chewy bottom crust where the rice meets the searingly hot bowl. Aside from the meat locker, the other useful idea Cote borrowed from steakhouses is a wine list that is chosen with beef in mind and can run into real money if you’re not careful. Anyone hoping to find a red for less than $100 will find that a quick glance at, say, California or the Côte d’Or can be discouraging. But Victoria James, who wrote the list, found some pockets of affordability in Beaujolais, Southern France, Corsica and Switzerland, and she makes a small adventure out of the wines by the glass, all poured from magnums. Does Brouilly go with ssamjang? Can a Patrimonio get along with galbi? I didn’t know I wanted answers to these questions before Cote came along, but now I do.

62,Sen Sakana,★,2017-11-07,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/07/dining/sen-sakana-review-peruvian-food-nikkei.html,Midtown,"Peru is making a move on Manhattan again. Get ready for huancaína and huacatay, tiradito and tacu-tacu. Brush up on the rocoto chile and its cousins, pinpoint-bright aji amarillo and aji panca, warmer and fruitier. Renew your friendship with causas and chaufas and leche de tigre, the milk of the tiger, without which there can be no ceviche. All these things and more are draped all over the menu at Sen Sakana, which is devoted to the food created by Japanese immigrants and their descendants in Peru. Non-Peruvians who know this hybrid cuisine at all probably first ran into it at a restaurant run by Nobu Matsuhisa, the Japanese-trained sushi chef who worked in Lima for a few years in the 1970s and helped himself to local ingredients and ideas. If you have ever eaten the raw fish with yuzu and a dot of rocoto chile paste that is Nobu’s interpretation of tiradito, or its grilled skewers with spicy anticucho sauce, you have tasted Peru’s Nikkei cuisine. At Sen Sakana, you can have more than a taste. The restaurant opened over the summer on the block of West 44th Street that is home to the Algonquin, the Royalton and the Iroquois hotels. There is room for almost 200 people in the square bar up front, the main dining room with rows of light wood tables and chairs in neutral upholstery, and a raised mezzanine that manages to make room for both extra tables and an entire sushi bar. To make this vastness look less like a warehouse and more like a Japanese restaurant, the designer made liberal use of slats. Some run up and down and the rest side to side, and behind some of those slats are lights that flood the walls with red or blue. It is the kind of sleek, sprawling, good-looking restaurant that you used to see all over Midtown, and then saw less often as the dining scene’s center of gravity moved to smaller, handmade spaces downtown and across the East River, and are now starting to see again at, say, Empellón and the Grill. Sprawling and sleek is not the current fashion, but it has also become apparent that small and handmade does not always mean high quality. Like any style, it can be faked. And one advantage of Sen Sakana’s sprawl is that if you are working in Midtown when the quitting-time whistle blows, or are going there for a show, your chances of getting in are better than average. At six pages, the menu is a bit of a sprawl itself. Its many categories can, however, be distilled down to just four: appetizers, main courses, skewers and sushi. In the first group is a cold cucumber of unusual interest. Covered in crunchy quinoa, toasted sesame seeds and flakes of kelp intensified with soy, it sits on a yellow streak of sauce made from aji amarillo. The menu calls the cucumber yamitsuki, the Japanese word for addictive. I wouldn’t go that far, but it does push a lot of good buttons at once. Gyoza, a half-dozen or so bound together by a crisp, shattering crepe-like lid, are filled with shrimp, crab and an exhilaratingly big jolt of fresh ginger. Sea bream tiradito gets a shower of shio kombu and two sauces; the tart yellow one is mango with aji amarillo and white soy; and the spicy green one is cilantro. Another tiradito sets raw bigeye tuna, daikon sprouts and pickled daikon in a lake of cilantro-jalapeño sauce. I’d order any of these again, which I can’t say about all the appetizers. Root vegetable chips were more oily than crisp. Sen Sakana also has a take on Japanese onigiri in which causa, the Peruvian whipped-potato constructions, are pinched inside sheets of nori. The idea is more interesting than the flavors; the potatoes needed seasoning, and the crab and chopped salmon fillings, advertised as spicy, weren’t very. With the exception of undercrisped chicken skin, the skewers of meats and vegetables grilled over charcoal on a robata are worth investigating, especially the Japanese sweet potato with a melting slab of aji amarillo-spiked butter, and the pork belly stuffed with queso cremoso, which has the texture of mozzarella that is trying to turn itself into cream cheese. The short roster of main courses on the menu nearly gets lost. This wouldn’t be a bad thing in the case of the skirt steak over tacu-tacu, a go-to rice-and-beans dish in Peru that becomes a flavorless paste here. But there are better choices, like a pleasantly unorthodox oyakodon, with an egg and chicken thigh over rice cooked with cilantro and pumpkin. And the chicken nanban removes any doubt that quinoa can make an effectively crunchy crust for fried chicken. Peru and Japan each have one representative in the main kitchen, where two chefs, Mina Newman and Taku Nagai, share power. Ms. Newman is a New Yorker who spent summers as a child in Chiclayo, the city in northwestern Peru where her mother was born. Mr. Nagai, an Osaka native, is a veteran of Japanese restaurants in New York and Asia. The two generally keep up with the number of seats and the size of the menu, although waits between courses sometimes drag. The dining room staff doesn’t seem as well organized. My servers were cheerful and communicated well with customers, but not necessarily with each other. Three people in a row would stop by to ask the same question, and just clearing the table seemed to take a cast of hundreds. A third chef, named Sang Hyun Lee, presides over the free-standing sushi bar. His work ranges from simple, classic nigiri and sashimi to psychedelic, 10-ingredient inside-out rolls that might make Jiro Ono cross-eyed. Sen Sakana’s best sushi is somewhere in between: what Mr. Lee calls Nikkei sashimi and nigiri. Augmented with Peruvian or Japanese flavors, these pieces are only slightly out of bounds, and can be delicious. There’s pleasurable tension in topping raw scallop with a tiny fleck of yuzu-ponzu jelly and commas of shaved lemon peel, or brushing sea bream with a tart, spicy sauce of yuzu and aji amarillo, then dotting it with a tiny bit of salted plum paste. Add six more things and they would all start to collide somewhere over the Pacific. One dessert is a small waffle made from batter that contains squash and sweet potato, a homage to Peruvian picarones, with a dark molasses syrup. Another is a shallow-pan chocolate tres leches cake, which tasted something like a dense brownie over which somebody poured a glass of cocktail de algarrobina, Peru’s answer to eggnog. It had never occurred to me to soak a brownie in eggnog. “Does this make sense?” I asked, between bites, until it was gone.

63,Momofuku Ssam Bar,★★★,2017-10-31,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/dining/momofuku-ssam-bar-review.html,East Village,"When I see something wrapped in a banana leaf, I am almost always interested in what’s inside. Unwrapping one such package at Momofuku Ssam Bar recently I was extra interested, because the restaurant has a new chef named Max Ng who is a citizen of Singapore, and one of the dishes he has brought with him from that country is a whole skate wing cooked in a banana leaf. The wing was rubbed top and bottom with sambal belacan, a Malaysian sauce built on a foundation of fermented-shrimp paste. It was a little spicy and strongly, disorientingly funky in a way that gave me the feeling of trying to stand up in a small boat in high surf. On the side, Mr. Ng served a bowl of congee to act as a kind of buffer, although it was by no means bland. Under the orange belacan I could taste the green-tea flavor of the banana leaf, drawn out by steam. Mr. Ng had intensified that, too, by charring the leaf so aggressively that it was still smoldering when it came to the table. Smoke in restaurants is usually found in captivity these days, caged within a glass or a cloche or a bag and carefully liberated, to oohs and aahs, before it drifts toward the ceiling and is gone. This is a favorite modernist party trick that anyone can do with the right smoker and pump. It is kind of cool the first time you see it. The smoke rising from the banana-leaf skate was the old, Promethean kind, and if I’m reading its message correctly it signaled another shift in direction for Ssam Bar. Founded by David Chang in the East Village in 2006, the restaurant evolved so quickly in its first two years that it took three New York Times reviews just to keep up. In the very beginning, Ssam Bar sold three kinds of Korean burritos. Dana Bowen, writing for The Times’s cheap-eats column, called them “enjoyable enough,” then spent the rest of her space on the after-hours experiments that Mr. Chang and three other cooks were serving late at night, like a whole roasted pork butt, to be pulled apart with tongs that quickly become as joyously greasy as everything and everybody else at the table. By early 2007, when Frank Bruni weighed in, the after-hours experiments had taken over the menu, which offered previously unimagined combinations of kimchi, country ham, hamachi, rice sticks, fish sauce and organ meats. Ssam Bar had become “a nearly full-fledged restaurant in near-perfect sync with the times,” Mr. Bruni wrote. Apparently it wasn’t done fledging yet; he returned in 2008 to promote it from two stars to three. Review overkill? No. Ssam Bar wasn’t just changing its menu. It rewrote the rules by which critically acclaimed restaurants were supposed to operate, stripping away comforts (chairs with backs, sound systems with a “low” setting) and amenities (reservations, unshared tables), and gambling that everybody would be too stunned by the food to complain. It worked. Ssam Bar mounted a guerrilla attack on the dining establishment, and it won before anybody quite knew what was going on, Mr. Chang included. There followed a long period of refinement and maturation, which is more than some guerrilla outfits can say. The wine list now takes more than 20 seconds to read, and is especially worth exploring for fans of gamay and sparkling wine. (Or both — there’s a sparkling gamay.) Under Matthew Rudofker, the executive chef from 2010 until May, Ssam Bar expanded beyond pork shoulder to other sizable cuts of meat: rib-eyes, briskets, whole ducks. Over the years, like many of Mr. Chang’s restaurants, Ssam Bar was increasingly infiltrated by modern techniques, fermentation, cutting-edge plating styles and umami-building tricks. The kitchen worked at a very high level, but at times it felt slightly deracinated, as if it drew much of its inspiration from other islands in the Momofuku archipelago. Carefully but confidently, Mr. Ng is moving away from that style and toward one of his own. He has gone back to the traditions of Asia, particularly street food and Singaporean cuisine. Like the char on that smoldering banana leaf, his techniques tend to be premodern, even though he has worked for nobody but Mr. Chang since moving to the United States in 2011, starting with an externship at Ssam Bar during culinary school and rising to chef de cuisine at Momofuku Ko. Mr. Ng has been trying his hand at the fish-shaped cakes from Japan known as taiyaki. He has a terrific idea for what to do with them: stuff them with foie gras. In his hands they’re almost French, because he fills the molds with croissant dough rather than pancake batter and glazes the crust with honey and white port. Over the top he strews some candied puffed rice that would make a fine breakfast; the whole dish would make a fine breakfast, come to think of it, although you’d stand up afterward knowing your day had already peaked. Sizzling eggs arrive not quite set in a cast-iron pan hot enough to finish cooking them at the table. The heat also softens a slice of pork terrine, which melts to coat the eggs. When I first tried this open-faced omelet, the eggs had been poured around a handful of chanterelles. Now they’ve been replaced by smoked bluefish. To make one of the most original corn dishes I’ve seen in a long time, Mr. Ng cleaves the cobs lengthwise into quarters and fries them until they curl. They are dusted with spice. You pick one up with your fingers and swipe it through a black aioli of squid ink or a white streak of whipped ricotta, which will melt like butter. Then you eat the kernels from the cob as if you were gnawing the meat off a baby back rib. These new dishes live alongside some legacies of Mr. Rudofker’s regime. There are cured sardines on long fingers of toast spread with hozon, the fermented chickpea paste that in this case plays the role of butter very well. Big cuts of meat are still offered. They have to be ordered ahead, but a variation of the rotisserie duck can sometimes be had on the spur of the moment. The breast is rubbed heartily with five-spice powder and fanned out over rice, the idea being to wrap it in lettuce with fried shallots and gochujang, without getting too distracted when the duck’s fried bones show up about 15 minutes later. As if he had realized that a restaurant that acts like a teenage punk is not as endearing once it reaches middle age, Mr. Chang redid Ssam Bar last year. The seats and bar stools have backs. The communal tables have been replaced by smaller ones where you sit only with people you know. Somehow the noise has been tamed. You won’t have tinnitus by the time you get to Mr. Ng’s Singaporean coconut pie, which has a smooth, sweet, wobbly, pandan-scented filling like chess pie, a dome of whipped cream made from coconut milk and a dark brown drizzle of coconut-sugar caramel.

64,The Pool,★★,2017-10-17,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/dining/the-pool-review.html,Midtown,"The Pool is such an exceptional restaurant that customers may suspect there’s something wrong with them when they walk out feeling that something was missing. But they’re right. Eating there is like dating somebody who looks great, gives you presents, takes you on trips and tries to convince you that you’re happy until the day you find out that the gifts and plane tickets were charged to your credit card. Much of this restaurant’s appeal, as well as some of its problems, come from its architecture. The Pool is one half of the old Four Seasons restaurant in Midtown, the part on the north side of the Seagram Building with a square marble pool in the center. The other end is now the Grill, which I reviewed in August. Philip Johnson designed the whole thing with richly detailed, rigorously geometric understatement that earned it status as one of the few interiors in the city protected by landmark designation. Major Food Group, the company that runs the Grill and the Pool, took its cues from Johnson to give the two restaurants contrasting styles. The Grill, with its imposing walnut paneling, has a meat-focused menu with midcentury roots that is overseen by Mario Carbone. The Pool, under the hand of Rich Torrisi, serves seafood with a contemporary outlook. Crucially, Major Food Group and the building’s owner decided that each restaurant deserved its own bar with its own style. The Grill already had one. For the Pool, which didn’t, they requisitioned, redecorated, refurnished and renamed the mezzanine. The new Pool Lounge, I discovered by making a phone call, was built without the permits from the Landmarks Preservation Commission that the law requires. In September, the commission summoned the building’s owner, RFR Holding, for a public hearing. An application has been belatedly filed to cover three major installations made without approval: the bar and the wall coverings of woven cotton, wool and silver threads in the lounge and the reception desk in the lobby off East 52nd Street. (Sheldon Werdiger, director of marketing and design development at RFR Holding, said in a statement that because furniture is not covered in the landmark designation, “we thought a new reception desk and bar in the lounge were additive fixtures to the space that can be easily removed and did not require LPC oversight.”) But you don’t need to be an architectural historian to see that none of them are remotely in the International Style. The large, inelegant reception desk belongs in an airport; you half expect to be asked if you’re checking any luggage. But the more serious rupture is the Pool Lounge. Although the building’s owner has argued that the Four Seasons used the mezzanine for private events and storage, it was open and in use for restaurant seating every time I ate in the old Pool Room. The tables up there, with their views of the lower dining room and the pool itself, were among the best in the house. Now the mezzanine looks as if it had been moved on a trailer from some other building and attached with thumbtacks. Its blue color scheme and rounded, Deco-inspired furniture fight with what is left of Johnson’s right angles and natural tones. When the lounge is full, it’s a distraction. When it’s half-empty, as it often seems to be, it looms like a stage set waiting for the actors to show up. Either way, it sucks energy from the restaurant, which needs all it can get. The Landmarks Preservation Commission is waiting for a response from the landlord before ruling on the new fixtures. One change that it is not challenging is the removal of the large planters from the four corners of the pool. When the Four Seasons opened in 1959, these held trees that were changed whenever a new spring, summer, fall or winter rolled around. The trees broke up the sight lines, so you never saw the entire space at once. Now you look around at an uninterrupted sea of heads. Messing with the subtle dynamics that Johnson set in motion puts pressure on the cooking and the dining room staff to animate the room. They don’t completely succeed right now. The Pool’s problems don’t include the ingredients, which are spectacular. The sweetness of chilled spot prawns under a few drops of olive oil made me shiver with pleasure. A trio of flash-seared Hokkaido sea scallop, Pacific mackerel whose skin had been peppered and griddled, and raw amberjack under tiny cells of finger lime suggested that Mr. Torrisi could run a stunning sushi restaurant. My eyes rolled back in my head whenever I ate sea urchin. In one appetizer, it is arranged on griddled pretzel bread with mustard oil and tiny cubes of green apple. In another, lobes of it are layered into an iced bowl to be eaten, with crème fraîche and chives if you like, over blini, hard-cooked eggs, toast or, my favorites, creamy potato halves roasted in duck fat. (Caviar and trout roe are served the same way.) Mr. Torrisi’s approach is to be lavish with punctiliously cared-for seafood and to outfit it sparingly. A beautiful illustration is the cured king salmon, two long, intensely flavorful strips served with a single potato dressed with mustard, shallots and dill. Another is any of the whole fish. The skin on turbot caught in Portugal is seared to a satisfying crackle on a plancha and served with a simple lemon vinaigrette. Like the Dover sole, it is lifted from its skeleton by a slim captain (they’re all slim) who performs the surgery wearing a Tom Ford suit. One night five captains in five suits filleted five sole for five diners at a table next to mine. It looked like a scene from “Ocean’s Eleven” that didn’t make the final cut. But some of the more elaborate dishes are underwhelming. I don’t know how striped bass with banana peppers and “mole spices” can be dull, but it is. Coconut-orange vinaigrette sounds like a terrific sauce for lobster, but it added very little except sweetness, which the lobster didn’t need. Chopped gazpacho ingredients over a puddle of actual gazpacho was both too complicated (why not just serve gazpacho?) and too plain (the cucumbers and tomatoes didn’t shine with flavor). This is all a huge improvement on what prevailed in the last years of the Four Seasons. But it doesn’t make you feel as if you are in the hands of one of the city’s best chefs, which Mr. Torrisi is, I think. Even at its best, the food rarely rises to the technical brilliance or boldness of, say, the green curry mushroom mille-feuille or the Vietnamese-flavored chicken legs he put on the menu at Dirty French. If his cooking at the Pool had some of that swagger, what’s on the plates could live up to the best parts of the original architecture and help make up for the renovation’s mistakes. This is exactly what happens when Stephanie Prida’s desserts arrive. Ms. Prida, who until a few months ago was the pastry chef at Manresa in Los Gatos, Calif., has a knack for combining flavors that seem to get more interesting as you go along, like a crème brûlée with shaved plums and bitter almond ice cream under a squiggle of reduced sherry vinegar, or coconut parfait and fluffy pink-grapefruit mousse sandwiched between the thinnest possible layers of matcha sablé. Bottles of Chateau d’Yquem going back to 1811 are kept in a glass wine room just off the entrance to the Pool, where they cast a beautiful amber glow that the servers are fond of pointing out. Enjoy it as you walk in, because this is as close as you will get to a dessert wine of any kind unless you are ready to spend at least $95, the price of the least expensive glass. The wine list is full of wonderful bottles, but its most noteworthy feature is its breezy lack of concern for normal budgets. Out of dozens of sparkling wines, more than 30 are priced above $1,000. Just one is under $90. This is quite a pinch to put on customers who are already paying between $39 and $74 for main courses. The Grill/Pool bifurcation extends to the dining room staff. In the Pool they are reserved, poised, deferential and seem to have been directed not to show any warmth or wit. Compared with the talkative, jokey characters in the Grill, who are ready to flambé something at the drop of a hat, the servers in the Pool are cardboard figures in tailored suits. Major Food Group has no fear of going over the top. So I’m reluctant to suggest that the Pool needs more personality and drama — these guys are capable of stocking the pool with live sharks if they thought it would help. But the restaurant needs something, because at these prices, what might pass for restraint and simplicity can start to seem like a sophisticated heist.

65,Public Kitchen,★,2017-10-10,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/dining/public-kitchen-review-jean-georges-vongerichten-nyc.html,Lower East Side,"At Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s latest restaurant, Public Kitchen, the menu is supposed to have a theme: the food of New York City. Nobody I brought there noticed it, though. Somehow it slipped my mind, too, even though I’d read about it weeks before my first meal, and had eaten things like smoked salmon and Manhattan clam chowder. The restaurant is all the way in the back of the ground floor of the new hotel on the Lower East Side designed by Herzog & de Meuron. The owner, Ian Schrager, calls it simply Public, and to make sure it lives up to its name he has divided the common areas into a sequence of hangouts. To get inside you walk down a hedgerow of rhododendrons flanked by two small lawns where hotel guests alight on Adirondack chairs as if they were up in the mountains and not a knish’s throw away from Chrystie Street. The scene changes once you come through the revolving front doors to face a pair of escalators reflected off into infinity by polished metal mirrors. It may remind you of the entrance to a mall, and the tacit message is similar: Keep circulating until you see something you want. Around the escalators to the right you come to a Vongerichten-run grab-and-go market and beyond that, the first of two Vongerichten-catered bars. While the other offers snacky highlights from the Public Kitchen menu, this one serves the whole megillah. At the far end of the bar you reach the entrance to the restaurant. Strangely, it’s one of Public’s least interesting rooms, a yawning, noisy canteen whose walls are tiled with the same shiny marble that more expensive hotels put in their showers. I’ve led you on this hotel tour to help make sense of Public Kitchen. The menu is a kaleidoscope because Mr. Vongerichten and Thomas McKenna, his executive chef, are trying to offer up something for many moods and occasions. Customers who don’t grasp the I♥NY concept when they see pasta and pizza and Chinese food will still find something to eat, whether they’re drinking mezcal below the Diego Rivera-inspired tapestry on the second floor or settling in for a couple of hours at the restaurant. One snack is so popular it’s already a classic of sorts: popcorn under a thin Frisbee of fried Cheddar sprinkled with chives and chile flakes. I didn’t totally get it, but it was a fun thing to crunch on with a drink in my other hand. So were the little latkes topped with sour cream, trout roe and smoked salmon, straight from the hors d’oeuvres tray of the fanciest Hanukkah party you’ve ever attended. Smart ideas pop up all over the place. Rigatoni with yellow wax beans and gold tomatoes is saved from ordinariness by a very good pesto in which pistachios do the work of pine nuts. Shrimp toast, one of those foods that are likable even when they’re bad, is exceptionally good at Public Kitchen, where the crunch of water chestnuts is pitted against tender, unusually sweet shrimp. There’s a phenomenally good steak marinated in soy sauce and dressed with fermented black soybeans and sesame oil. Also wonderful: roasted hake with sweet and spicy peppers interrupted by shards of fried potato. But, unusually for one of Mr. Vongerichten’s recent restaurants, a number of dishes don’t achieve liftoff. At my first meal I was nonplused by the shrimp cocktail: The shrimp were warm but served on ice, and the cocktail sauce was a bizarre and acidic collision of peaches and horseradish. The last time I went, these hot-and-cold shrimp weren’t on the menu. I hope they are using their time away to think about the choices they’ve made. Nothing else was so misconceived. But spicy avocado dip punched the lights out of a delicately flaky Chinese scallion pancake with basil in place of scallions. Nondescript cheese, bland mushrooms and a pointless egg dragged down a pizza with a very good, light crust. And Manhattan clam chowder, repurposed as a sauce for a fine, clean-tasting hunk of pan-seared salmon, was the answer to a question nobody asked. The only reason I can think of for hijacking red chowder like this is to make a connection with New York. But with a few exceptions, Public Kitchen doesn’t explore the city’s food in a coherent or illuminating way. And it doesn’t come close to hitting, as the website puts it, “all of the cultures that make up the eclectic mix and melting pot that is New York City.” Thai flavors animate one side dish, roasted carrots in red curry paste and coconut milk. But the main cuisines brought into play are Italian and Chinese, as if it were still 1970. A good menu doesn’t need a theme to hang together, of course. The pastry chef, Eric Kalaboke, found a through line in slightly old-fashioned favorites like a fruit cobbler capped with sweet sticks of puff pastry, an extremely endearing chocolate layer cake with blackberry sorbet and peanut butter ice cream, and a quietly spectacular tartufo resting in sour-cherry syrup. As for the wine list, it does a great job of presenting reasonably priced bottles from all over, made by some of the leading producers in their regions. This is a nice surprise in a hotel that seems to have been built as a backdrop for the cocktail lifestyle. And if your big idea is New York City, you’re probably better off underplaying it than going all out like the Grill, where they all but park a Checker cab next to your table. There are no lectures at Public Kitchen, blessedly, no footnotes or history lessons. The closest I got to an elucidation of the menu was when a server said, “Everything is individually portioned and meant to be shared with the table” — a Zen koan for our time. Still, it’s a sign of trouble that what Public Kitchen is trying to pull off doesn’t come across clearly. You can have a meal that is mostly very good, or one that is decidedly mixed, but either way you will probably walk out not entirely sure what sets this restaurant apart, other than Mr. Vongerichten’s sensibility. He doesn’t layer flavors like anyone else. These days he doesn’t have as many imitators as he used to, either, although his spicy tuna tartare slicked with sesame oil will be with us forever. He trots it out again at Public Kitchen, over sliced avocado, with an undulated rice cracker that left oil on my fingers. It’s hard to tell whether he’s repeating himself, making a sly comment on how pervasive the dish is in New York, or both.

66,Oberlin,★★,2017-10-03,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/03/dining/oberlin-restaurant-review-providence.html,"Providence, RI","PROVIDENCE, R.I. — Raw bluefish was on the menu at Oberlin in July, and I was thinking: I hope they know what they’re doing. Bluefish goes off so quickly that there was a chance my first impression would end my curiosity about this restaurant. But I gave it a shot, and it was great: sliced cold and neatly fanned out like sashimi, then sprinkled with olive oil and salt and pickled garlic-chive buds, the bluefish was chewy and soft at the same time, somehow, and had a rich, oily flavor that was especially delicious because I knew that in 24 hours it would taste half as good and a day after that it wouldn’t be worth eating at all. Finding bluefish fresh enough to serve raw takes connections down at the waterfront. Oberlin’s chef, Benjamin Sukle, has been cultivating relationships with fishing captains in southern Rhode Island for about four years since he opened Birch, his small tasting-counter restaurant in this city’s compact downtown. His shopping list got longer when he opened Oberlin a few blocks away early last year. Fish isn’t the only thing on the menu here, but there is a lot of it, and the ways Mr. Sukle uses it illustrate the exploration of local ingredients that makes Oberlin the most rewarding new restaurant I know of in Southern New England. The menu starts with a long list of raw seafood that is a snapshot of what’s swimming around Rhode Island at the moment. “When I go to the docks I’m not just picking the best of the catch,” Mr. Sukle said. “It’s all great.” I last ate there in the middle of September, when the raw fish included bonito and bigeye tuna, striped bass, mahi-mahi, both Spanish and Boston mackerel, and scup. A week or so later, the final gasps of a hurricane had chased the fish away, and Oberlin’s raw bar was down to a dish dreamed up in the last hurricane season, mussels marinated in their steaming juices and a slug of aioli. Slightly rich and spicy under crunchy little sweet-potato chips, it is a terrific thing to eat even with plenty of fish around. Buying whole fish instead of fillets helps Mr. Sukle, who owns the restaurant with his wife, Heidi, keep prices down and the menu varied. I loved Oberlin’s shiny, alluringly pasty brandade, made not with cod but with salted remnants of more abundant white-fleshed fish such as scup, mahi-mahi and fluke. It is served with a green splash of herbed olive oil on top and lightly toasted slices of the restaurant’s excellent sourdough on the side. Salty pink hunks of cured bigeye tasted like the canned tuna of my dreams, alongside cucumbers and explosively ripe heirloom tomatoes seasoned with basil, wild mint and seaweed. Cured local bluefish stands in for imported anchovies in a bracingly original interpretation of puttanesca sauce in which the flavor of each ingredient — garlic and tomato and chiles and bluefish and razor-thin shavings of green olives — was clear and distinct. Birch is the smaller, tidier and quieter of Mr. Sukle’s restaurants. Lamb pelts thrown over the backs of high leather-upholstered seats project a studied cool borrowed from Scandinavia. The handmade ceramics are plated with more delicate precision. Greater subtlety is drawn out of, or spirited into, the ingredients. There were delicious surprises in everything I tasted, and the set price of $55 for four painstaking courses was remarkably fair. When I ate there, charred cucumbers dressed with pistachio butter lurked below a translucent shingling of marinated cucumber. Airy fronds of fennel and a single preserved beach-rose petal had been airlifted into place on top. Wild foods like beach roses turn up in both restaurants, a sign of the imprint left by Mr. Sukle’s brief stint at Noma, in Copenhagen. Some chefs have copied Noma in exactly the wrong way, importing ingredients that grow in Denmark instead of scouring their own landscapes. I wonder if Noma’s chef, René Redzepi, ever feels like the character in “Monty Python’s Life of Brian” who tells a crowd of followers, “You’ve got to think for yourselves! You’re all individuals!” only to hear them shout back in unison, “Yes! We’re all individuals!” Mr. Sukle took Mr. Redzepi’s teachings the right way. Edible discoveries get slightly more play at Birch, but the next time I’m set loose in Providence for a night, odds are my feet will carry me to Oberlin. I like the friendly spontaneity of the dining-room crew. They’re busier and can be harder to flag down than the staff at Birch, but once you have their attention they seem more engaged. Seating is in a rhythmic hodgepodge: high tables and bar stools to the right, regular tables to the left and out on the sidewalk, and a few wooden stools at the short counter facing the cooks who put together salads and slice raw fish under a sign that reads, “Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana.” (An absurdist streak is one of Providence’s underappreciated charms.) I might settle in with sake — a diverse set of 10 are poured by the glass — or beer from such nonconformist breweries as To Ol in Copenhagen and Prairie Artisan Ales in Tulsa, Okla. If I was feeling lucky I might roll the dice on the wine list, which contains some reliably crafted natural wines alongside some lean, withholding ones. An Oregon pinot noir recommended as a staff favorite was, to me, off-puttingly thin and tart. Then I would get down to business, starting with raw fish, of course. A submerged Italian theme surfaces on the menu from time to time. My experience with Oberlin’s handmade pastas, though, was patchy. The filled pastas I ordered were not very good; both the duck inside triangular pansotti and the pork folded into doughy ravioli were dry and a little severe. But then there was that inspired puttanesca tossed with fusilli, and some wonderful potato gnocchi that were browned on one side and stirred into a buttery clam broth with tender littlenecks. Knowing that Mr. Sukle seeks out produce I’m not likely to meet every day, I’d keep an eye out for things like Victor squash. This is also known as Red Warty Thing, an accurate description in the fall when it ripens, but Mr. Sukle is fond of it when it is still green and immature. Cut into thin raw crescents that were sandwiched with juicy slices of cantaloupe and sprinkled with fresh oregano and za’atar, then arranged over creamed feta, it tasted like a cucumber that has been carbo-loading. Its thin, edible skin was also delightfully free of large warts. (The Red Warty Thing lobby should feel free to use that language in its ad copy.) Most nights see two whole, bone-in fish on the menu, one grilled and the other roasted. I’ve had yellowtail flounder and Boston mackerel, and both were cooked just the way they should be, with a hint of pink along the spine. The same two desserts were offered each time I went. One was a rustic blueberry tart that was slightly underbaked on a first encounter and perfect the second time around. The other was a peach-blossom custard topped with fresh fruit. The custard had the fluffiness of a soft meringue. It was, in fact, a panna cotta infused with flowers that were preserved just like the rose petals and then frothed with a nitrous oxide canister. It was studiously put together but easy to like, which come to think of it is not a bad description of Oberlin itself.

67,Cervo’s,★,2017-09-26,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/dining/cervos-review-restaurant.html,Lower East Side,"Cervo’s, a two-month-old restaurant on the east end of Canal Street, is divided in two. In front is a long bar where bartenders stir sherry with lemon-lime soda and three cooks make all the food. In the rear is a squarish dining room that can fit about 16 people if they all hold their breath. The tight quarters back there, the low ceiling broken by a skylight, and the glossy wood paneling made me feel as if I were eating in the dining cabin of a large but not excessively luxurious sailboat. And the man at the table next to mine couldn’t seem to find his sea legs. “I don’t recognize anything on this wine list,” he said. “Which is exciting, in a way, but ...” Gamely, the sommelier asked what he usually liked to drink. “Unoaked chardonnay and California-style sauvignon blanc,” he said, “but you don’t have any of those.” He was right. Drinking at Cervo’s means leaving familiar landmarks behind. Most of the wines are from Portugal and the rest from Spain, with very few well-known names between them. After a few false starts, the sommelier steered him to a vinho verde from a winery called Aphros. I’d drunk it very happily on another night. It was more lush and ripe than the thin, fizzy vinho verdes that I cut my teeth on as a youngster, and had enough citrus to come in for a soft landing in Mr. Sauvignon Blanc’s comfort zone. He took a sip, and looked as if he’d decided to wait and see what happened. Without calling itself a wine bar, Cervo’s does a good impersonation of one, pouring about 12 unfortified wines by the glass along with another dozen or so sherries, Madeiras and ports. On my previous visits I’d ranged all over the list. I’d enjoyed a sparkling wine bottled, with spirited acidity, by Sidónio de Sousa in the Bairrada region of Portugal, by the Atlantic Ocean; a quietly flowery vermouth from the Basque Country, poured from a tap; Los Bermejos’s illuminatingly bright dry malvasia, grown in the volcanic soil of Lanzarote, one of the Canary Islands; a glass of red from 4 Monos, made in the mountains west of Madrid and so approachably low in tannin that Cervo’s serves it chilled, like a Beaujolais. According to the owners, Nialls Fallon and Nick Perkins, the menu is inspired by Portugal and Spain, like the wine list. For years, they say, they talked about opening “a Portuguese version” of Swan Oyster Depot, the San Francisco institution. (They have another place in Brooklyn called Hart’s, taken from Mr. Perkins’s middle name. Hart is also an antique word for deer, which is what cervo means in Portuguese.) The menu reads like a wine bar’s, too. Portions are generally small and the plates are unstudied, starting with some basics like fleshy green olives in olive oil and paprika, or pan con tomate with ripe tomatoes and shavings of bottarga. But while the wine list sails off into uncharted territory, the menu sticks closer to home. Few of the dishes would be familiar in Lisbon, but several would be right at home in Estela or Wildair. The main ideas that Mr. Perkins and Aaron Crowder, who share the chef duties, seem to have drawn from the cuisine of Portugal is that people there eat a lot of seafood and tend to keep things simple. This isn’t a bad place to start, though. Their next move is a smart one, too. Mr. Perkins and Mr. Crowder cooked in many of Andrew Tarlow’s restaurants, smallish Brooklyn places with locavore inclinations. At Cervo’s, they work with very fresh seafood caught off the Northeastern coast, supplemented by a few things from farther away. It doesn’t take much to make these ingredients stand out. The selection of oysters is not overwhelming, but each time I’ve turned up there were new ones to swallow, Truro Pearls and Wellfleets from Cape Cod in August and, in September, Pink Moons and Savage Blondes from Prince Edward Island. From the raw bar also come things like whole white prawns marinated in white wine and garlic, or radishes shaved over anchodinas, the meaty and salty Spanish sardine fillets that are preserved like anchovies. The kitchen has a way of applying just enough chile heat to register: The pink flesh of yellowfin tuna was just starting to go opaque from lemon juice stirred with fermented Serrano chiles, while pickled banana peppers accentuated the sweetness of marinated and browned scallops, and stopped there. Cockles or small clams steamed open in vinho verde with garlic seem always to be on the menu, and they make a very delicious next step after cold seafood. There is often a strangely likable beef tartare with littlenecks and so much of the clams’ steaming juices that it almost comes across as some kind of mutant chowder. Fish — porgy or Boston mackerel recently — goes right on the plancha in one piece. Chicken skewers with sweet onions and yogurt may sound, in the context of this menu, like a sop to the seafood-averse. It is, in fact, a standout. The chicken is marinated and griddled with ground fennel seed, coriander and other spices, a bit like the great Andalusian snack pintxos moruños. The skewers are carried out on a plate with all their juices pooling around a spoonful of yogurt and petals of onions brought to the crunchy-tender threshold on the plancha. Dessert is an opportunity to look again at the Madeiras or one of the inexpensive ports, all from a young, boutique operation called Morgadio da Calçada. On some nights, there is a thick, yolk-rich custard infused with anise hyssop. Other times, I’ve eaten soft, sweet vanilla pudding decorated with peaches and tiny yellow husk tomatoes. I can’t decide which I like more. It would be easy to let my enthusiasm about Cervo’s get the better of me, the way some people have gotten carried away over Hart’s. The charm of both restaurants is that they come on easy, then deliver more than some places that are much more full of themselves. Overstating that charm wouldn’t do Cervo’s any favors. The lamb burger can be juicy one night and dry on another. (Either way, adding white anchovies for $3 more improves it, one of the few restaurant-burger upgrades I’d say that about.) Raw cabbage leaves dressed with yogurt and bottarga, meanwhile, might have come from a completely different restaurant. Cervo’s hasn’t put down deep enough roots into Iberian food yet for the kitchen to flirt with trendier styles. So I won’t make extravagant promises. I think you should just go and see what happens.

68,Prune,★★,2017-09-19,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/dining/prune-review.html,East Village,"First, some disclosures are in order. Gabrielle Hamilton, who owns Prune, writes one column a month for The New York Times Magazine. I don’t have anything to do with that, but I have edited a few of her essays in the past. We had a fine time working together, and kept in touch for a while. About a decade ago we introduced our toddlers for a play date while she cooked breakfast. It ended after her son hit mine over the head with a toy truck. I haven’t seen her in the five and a half years I’ve been reviewing restaurants, though, even when I’ve eaten at Prune, in the East Village. And, against our personal history, one has to balance the simmering resentment I feel each time I remember that writing is only a sideline for Ms. Hamilton, and yet she’s better at it than most people who do it for a living, including me. Any new Prune customer who isn’t already aware that Ms. Hamilton is a very good writer will realize it when the menus arrive. They are put together by somebody who understands how words work. Although these days she drafts them with Ashley Merriman, whom she married last year and with whom she shares the title of chef, their tone has not changed in the 18 years Prune has been open. They do not follow the current fad of forcing nouns into shotgun weddings to which no prepositions, participles or conjunctions were invited (“cod, radish, yogurt, nasturtium”). Instead you see phrases that could be in the first sentence of a short story you wouldn’t be able to put down. Under the bar snacks is one I defy you to read without feeling a spasm of curiosity: “Turkish disco pistachios.” You may not instantly grasp that the nuts are going to be roasted before your eyes over a mound of flaming salt, or that when the fire goes out they will be warm and will have the unmistakable flavor of anise, but you will know that something is about to happen. Often, the phrases are more direct. One of the vegetables recently was “Corn on the cob with butter and salt.” You might see corn on the cob anywhere, but the butter and salt are the kind of concrete details that could make this a line from a poem about summer. Here’s another line: “plain boiled zucchini drowned in olive oil.” There were four delicious little squashes, cooked whole with their bright firm stems on, and there was indeed enough clean, grassy oil to drown them. What’s that I hear? Is that an objection from someone who boils zucchini at home? Go ahead, knock yourself out. Just don’t try to tell me that I’ve been scammed. The whole objective of Prune is and always has been to cook the food of hunger and desire, strip it of the usual restaurant window dressing, and put it in front of you. This is why the menu reads so well. Good writing comes from clear thinking, and Ms. Hamilton’s thoughts on what makes a satisfying dinner have always been extremely clear. What more could you ask from the start of a meal than sautéed chanterelles shedding mushroom juice and butter into a thick slice of toasted white bread? And what could you add to improve a main course of swordfish, grilled gently enough that a rosé blush is left in its flesh, with melted anchovy butter that runs into the tiny boiled potatoes? Well, there is a garnish: a lemon wedge and a parsley sprig. This I suppose counts as restaurant window dressing, but because it comes from another era it also evokes a specific sense memory that gives meaning to the whole dish. Over the years Ms. Hamilton has delegated the cooking to several people. I didn’t eat there under every regime, but I can say that the meals I’ve eaten since Ms. Merriman arrived from the Waverly Inn early last year have been at least as good as any I’ve ever had at Prune. Certainly the cooking is more steadily skillful and more varied than it was around the time of its last Times review, a dozen years ago, when Frank Bruni gave it one star. Not everything sparkles; a ragout of artichokes and shell beans tasted about as gray as it looked. But for the most part Ms. Merriman has managed to nest her style inside her wife’s while, I think, expanding the boundaries of both. Braised rabbit leg is a very Prune thing to cook, but I doubt that in 1999 it would have been presented, as it was earlier this summer, over yellow hexagons of carrot mixed with Calabrian chiles, mint leaves and pine nuts, with a handful of fried bread crumbs thrown over the top. That Mediterranean tilt could be Ms. Merriman’s work, but the dish still has a Hamiltonian directness. The grilled branzino on the menu, on the other hand, is a classic Hamilton dish. The simplicity — a whole fish on a plate — has her name all over it, and the application of fennel oil is the sort of nuance — invisible, politely insistent — she prefers to screamingly interventionist moves. The two women run a kitchen that is capable of intricate footwork, but that’s not what it’s known for. What they and their cooks do, you can too, generally. This was true back when Prune still served canned sardines loaded onto a plate with Triscuits, pickles and a bloop of mustard, a dish that didn’t take any cooking but did require enough nerve to fill a punch bowl. The sardines are not on the menu, but cans are kept on hand for sentimental customers. The nerve is still there, although a less fraught word for it is confidence. It is confidence that allows Prune to place a scrupulously made martini on the cocktail list next to a Long Island Iced Tea that has been purged of its scuzzier ingredients but is still pretty louche. It is confidence that gets you unshowy desserts like slices of black plums tossed with sugar, lemon zest and cardamom and spread out on buttered toast, or a bunch of Concord grapes lounging on a plate of chipped ice. It is confidence that lets some servers wear pale pink crew-neck T-shirts and others V-necks of a riper, fleshier pink. Confidence that helps them thread through tables that are by anybody’s standards too close together; confidence that allows them to treat every customer, the ones who look like actors and the ones who look like retired semiotics professors, with the same attention and care. It is confidence that lets this French-looking bistro with its much-put-upon marble bar and fuzzed-up mirrors play Yo La Tengo one night and Whitney Houston’s greatest hits on another and still believe that somehow it will all mean something.

69,The Grill,★★★,2017-08-22,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/dining/the-grill-review-midtown.html,Midtown,"New York kept certain fantasies about the Four Seasons alive for a long time. We told ourselves that it was an elegant restaurant, that it was an important restaurant, that the roll call of designers, editors and so on who ate lunch there — a short list that grew shorter as publishers moved downtown, expense accounts were clipped and longtime patrons were called by the great reservationist in the sky — was proof of something other than the tendency of famous and busy people to act from habit and herd instinct. Long before the end, fantasy and reality had gone separate ways. The Four Seasons was a mess. The beaded curtain chains that rippled upward for 20 feet in endless waves like a waterfall running in reverse were coming apart, some of them missing or broken or lying on the floor like dead snakes. The bronze-rod Richard Lippold sculpture that hangs in midair over the towers of whiskey and gin bottles inside the square bar was furry with dust. A dinner I had in 2013 was a disaster, from the stale rolls to the zombified service to the dry and crumbly duck served with fruit compote that tasted like the filling in a grocery-store pie. It goes without saying that all this cost a pile of money. Because the restaurant’s lease was winding down, I never wrote up that meal. And when the landlord signed a new one with the Major Food Group instead of the old owners, New Yorkers might have mourned the end of our fantasy Four Seasons, but there weren’t a lot of reasons to be sad about losing the real one. Now, instead of one restaurant, we have two. Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone, the two chefs who run the Major Food Group with their noncooking partner, Jeff Zalaznick, have taken a divide-and-conquer strategy. Mr. Torrisi is in charge of what was the Pool Room and is now just the Pool. The Grill, formerly the Grill Room, is in the hands of Mr. Carbone. It was the first to open, in May, and comes very close to being the kind of restaurant many of us imagined in this space all along. The Grill is confident, theatrical, retro, unsentimental, sharp and New Yorky. Like other projects from Major Food Group, it is packed with ideas and historical allusions. Unpacking it all is a lot of fun if you can afford it; preposterous expense is one reality of the old restaurant that the new tenants preserved. They also preserved the Philip Johnson interior, after the landlord proposed some changes that were swatted down by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. Rightly so: funded by the Seagram Company, Johnson did something astonishing in this room. It’s a vast space that offers privacy, a corporate monument that gives back to the public, an expression of International Style austerity that feels exuberant. All that is in sharp focus again now that it’s holding a restaurant with a full battery charge. The beads have been strung back together. Lippold’s bronze glints again. The book-matched French walnut paneling is glossier and more radiant, the patterns in the grain more evocative of monumental abstract paintings, than before.  Mr. Carbone, Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Zalaznick prepare for their restaurants the way Matthew Weiner or David Simon get ready for a new show, with a mountain of research. Taking over a high point of midcentury modernism gave them license to study James Beard, rolling trolleys, Jacqueline Kennedy, the martini, John Cage, club sandwiches, Joe Baum, continental cuisine, Delmonico’s, green goddess dressing, Craig Claiborne and Catalina sauce. Some dish names are cryptic, as if written to invite a question the servers can answer with a story. The one about “Jack’s Pie” involves John F. Kennedy and comes in two parts. The second is a dubious dirty joke about Marilyn Monroe. This postmodern approach to modernism leads to some self-conscious nonsense. Next to the staircase is a buffet table set with a surreal cornucopia of vegetables, fruits and layer cakes. It’s stunning to look at but it’s purely decorative — “a buffet in name only,” the servers have to explain. Dinner sees a traffic jam of rolling carts parked tableside for various bits of stage business, some of which are pointless. Peach Melba doesn’t get better when you set it on fire, and when a server painstakingly removes a pastry seal on a cocotte to reveal two pieces of endive, you have to wonder if Mr. Carbone hasn’t lost his mind. But any doubts about his sanity vanish when you taste the spectacularly good guinea hen that the endive accompanies. Roasted and sauced with jus, Madeira and black truffles, it is among the most delicious things I’ve eaten this year. So is the Seagram crab cake, very sweet and pure under a golden lid of potato coins. So is the prime rib, carved thick or thin at your elbow — this time, the ritual makes sense — and set in front of you along with a meaty barbecued bone in a dark mustard and spice crust. So are the lamb chops, brushed with curry oil and grilled, with yogurt sauce and a fantastic molded cone of apple-mint jelly. So is the honey-mustard duck breast, dry aged for a month until it is supernaturally tender. So is the larded squab in bittersweet orange sauce with a grilled candied orange; the lard is provided by a cloak of whipped fat that bathes the squab breast as it cooks. So is the slice of lemon chiffon cake confected by Jennifer Yee, who is serving as pastry chef until the restaurant is on solid footing. Perfectly tender and fluffy and just sweet enough, it is the kind of dessert that has almost disappeared from New York restaurants, and deserves to come back. I’ll be thinking about those dishes for the rest of the year, and probably beyond. At least half a dozen others are merely very, very good: the gently spicy salad called avocado crab Louis; the anchovy-laced steak tartare that finishes with a surprising riptide of chile heat; the broodingly dark crab gumbo; the “Neptune’s crown” Dover sole under a Creole shellfish sauce; the hot pretzel twists and the griddled anadama bread and the nearly weightless dinner rolls brushed with butter that come around at the start of the meal. For all of this you pay prices that range from “Wow” to “Are you guys serious?” The reassembled lobster Newburg (or Newberg, as the menu has it), in a reduced-fat sauce outfitted with dried cherry tomatoes and basil leaves, is marked “MP” on the menu; it’s $98, about five times what you’d pay for a live lobster of the same size. At least it’s memorable, which is more than can be said for the $25 jumble of smoked wild mushrooms held together by a wafer-thin one-egg “omelet,” or the $38 chicken “à la Queen,” which is like chicken cacciatore that’s been fancied up.  Balanced against a few lapses of taste and judgment, though, is the real achievement of Mr. Carbone and his partners in breathing new life into the formal, French-derived style of dining. This used to be the only style chefs thought was suitable for expensive restaurants. But then tasting counters came along; suddenly the rituals of captains standing at attention above white tablecloths seemed antiquated. Taking off from the model the Major Food Group polished at Carbone, the Grill turns that old and increasingly empty formality into theater, or a game that everybody can get in on. The captains are allowed to have personalities, which means the rest of us can, too. It would work even better if Major Food Group hired more women for the dining room; it’s hard to imagine many female captains who would be O.K. with calling Marilyn Monroe “Jack’s pie.” As a strict constructionist about the architecture of this space, I can’t write about it without registering the loss of the lovely, understated modernist stemware, bowls and other pieces designed specifically for these rooms by Garth and Ada Louise Huxtable. Eating here without them is like visiting a Frank Lloyd Wright house furnished by Ikea. Some of the things they’ve been replaced by are very good. Others are reasonably apt. A few are painful. The chunky brass bar coasters marked with a big capital G are a Trumpian touch. So are the napkins with “THE GRILL” embroidered in gold thread. But coasters and napkins can’t cause lasting damage to an interior this extraordinary. It was always one of the most beautiful dining rooms in New York. Now it’s also one of its most exciting restaurants.

70,Made Nice,0 star,2017-08-15,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/15/dining/made-nice-restaurant-review.html,NoMad,"New Yorkers will have more idle hours on their hands, or at least more time to watch otter videos at work, if Made Nice turns out to be the future of dining in New York. The food appears within 10 minutes from the moment you walk through the door on West 28th Street. Before that happens, you choose one of the eight or so main courses pictured on the wall, give your order to an extroverted host who taps it into a hand-held screen, and mill around the silverware and condiment station until you hear your name and are handed your meal on a charcoal-colored tray that doubles as a place mat. This routine may sound familiar and indeed it is, being the basic model of fast-casual restaurants from Shake Shack on down. Made Nice has nipped and tucked the formula all around, but the biggest difference is what’s on the tray. It’s not a burger or a grain bowl but a multicolored, photogenic and meticulously arranged plate that bears at least a familial resemblance to the cooking at Eleven Madison Park and the NoMad. Like those two restaurants, Made Nice is under the ownership and direction of the chef Daniel Humm and his collaborator, Will Guidara. To bring some of their usual meticulous care and a few glimmers of their artistry to a high-speed operation is the trick Made Nice is trying to pull off. To do so, the two owners have requisitioned a sous-chef from Eleven Madison Park, Danny DiStefano, to run the enormous kitchen, while Mr. Humm waves his magic wand somewhere offstage. As trays loaded with salad-like dishes leave the counter, you can glimpse bits and pieces of the two more formal restaurants flying by, like the scraps of Kansas that Dorothy sees caught in the twister. Look — it’s the NoMad chicken! And isn’t that the pork confit from Eleven Madison Park? Well, no, not really, as you will discover when you sit down and eat. The Made Nice confit doesn’t have the creaminess or the concentrated delicacy that suckling pig gives the original, or the golden roof of crisp skin. It’s a dark brick of shredded pork, a heavy-tasting and oddly inert centerpiece for a summer salad of shaved corn, watercress and wheat berries. Served at night and on Saturdays, the chicken is the only major dish at Made Nice that could not even by the most elastic definition be called a salad. With a bread stuffing under its browned skin, it does resemble the NoMad chicken from a distance. But the one at NoMad tastes as if it comes from some lost island where the gene that controls delicious chicken flavor has been passed down intact for centuries. The Made Nice chicken, by contrast, is ordinary — moist without being juicy, as if all its flavor had leaked out of the meat in order to make the stuffing as gummy as possible. The price is $22 for half a chicken and skinny fries. The fries are very good. Nobody should be surprised when a stripped-down dish that can be ready in five minutes and costs, on average, about $14 isn’t as wonderful as one that was fluffed to greatness for its role in a $295 tasting menu. It’s not a fair fight, yet it’s one that Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara have invited by trying to link their fast-casual business with their other restaurants. But some of the food at Made Nice doesn’t just suffer by comparison; it can also suffer all on its own. The curried cauliflower is said to be a callout to another standby at the NoMad. I don’t remember trying it there, so I can’t say whether it’s so unevenly cooked that some pieces are brown and collapsed while others are white, crunchy and barely cooked. That’s how the cauliflower at Made Nice was, though. It tasted nothing like a real curry, and only a little bit like curry powder. Another dish is called chicken rice. The rice tastes like tomatoes and needs salt. The chicken seems exhausted. Imagine a chain of Cuban restaurants started by retired employees of the Olive Garden. This could be their arroz con pollo. Of the nine major dishes on the current menu, there are three I would be happy to eat again. One is a salad of watermelon and quinoa that has just enough twists and turns to stand out, like crisp pistachios and soft, creamy feta. Another, seared hanger steak slices over roasted broccoli that is chopped and seasoned with lime, may not sound like a winning combination, but it is. A third is smoked salmon salad whose croutons are, in fact, little fried cubes of shredded potato. Actually, there is a fourth dish worth revisiting, though I wouldn’t try to make a meal of it: the milk and honey sundae. The ice cream is soft serve — milk, uncontaminated by vanilla — strewn with a variety of fun, crunchy bits made from milk or honey. It’s $6. The sundae combines sophistication and pleasure better than anything else on the menu. It is also the only item you can’t get delivered. I suspect these things may be related. That enormous kitchen wasn’t built solely to feed the 30 or so people who can be seated in the restaurant. It was designed to handle a tall pile of takeout and delivery orders. So, in fact, were the recipes. Aside from the sundae, everything is engineered to look and taste almost as good after being sealed with a plastic lid, packed into a bag and carted 10 blocks. The explosion of delivery services has entranced chefs of all sorts. New York restaurants that would have hung up on you 10 years ago if you’d called for a delivery order — Mission Chinese Food, Hearth, DB Bistro Moderne, Santina, most of the Momofukus — are now, like Made Nice, signed up with Caviar. Others use services such as GrubHub, DoorDash and Postmates. According to one projection cited by The Atlantic, the market for delivery orders placed online will have grown 15 times faster than the rest of the restaurant business by the end of the decade. Meanwhile, restaurants across the country are anxiously watching as foot traffic falls at lunch and dinner. These twin trends have created a new and nearly invisible kind of restaurant with no dining room, just a commissary kitchen that fulfills orders to go. They’re called ghost restaurants. Made Nice seems to be something different. Its small dining room is merely the tip of a much bigger operation lurking below the surface. It’s an iceberg restaurant. To test it out, I ate one of my three Made Nice meals at The New York Times Building. My order showed up about a minute late, which counts as early given Midtown rush-hour traffic, and was pretty much as advertised. The fried chicken skins that are supposed to be scattered over the gravy-like chicken velouté didn’t show up, and a caper-dill relish that the menu said came with the tuna niçoise was smeared on the pork confit and the cod Provençal as well. Nothing was hot after about 30 minutes in transit. But the cooked items were still warm, the lettuce and other raw ingredients hadn’t wilted, and all the plates looked as if they had been primped by a food stylist for an overhead shot. Eating food like this at your desk would not feel like a complete surrender. Eating it in a restaurant is another story. Whether the same recipes can suit both experiences is the question Made Nice asks. Your own answer will depend on whether you are hoping for food that is quick, inexpensive and as delicious as you would expect from one of the city’s best-known chefs, or are willing to settle for two out of three.

71,Nur,★★,2017-08-08,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/08/dining/nur-review-middle-eastern-restaurant.html,Flatiron,"New York is supposed to be tough on out-of-town chefs who go into business here. In reality, it’s tough on chefs of all kinds. Distance simply multiplies the difficulties, and competition weeds out the unprepared. For long commutes, few chefs can top the one that Meir Adoni has been making since he opened a Middle Eastern restaurant called Nur on East 20th Street in April. He splits his time between Manhattan; Tel Aviv, the site of his two other restaurants; and his home outside Jerusalem. In Israel, he’s got a full dance card; he has published a cookbook app and has a leading role in a popular Israeli cooking-contest show called “Game of Chefs,” where he is both a mentor to one of the teams and a judge. (Television viewers in Israel must have different ideas about impartiality.) Running a new restaurant in New York tends to be more than a half-time job, and yet Nur doesn’t have the lethargy and mechanical quality of a kitchen run by remote control. The plates have energy. At times, in fact, they don’t know when to quit. The sauces and powders and garnishes proliferate so quickly that it’s hard to keep count. But it’s easier for a new restaurant to settle down after an excess of high spirits than to recover from a tentative start. The swirl of flavors also reflects Mr. Adoni’s expansive definition of the food of the Middle East. Nur’s menu embraces Morocco and Libya in North Africa, in addition to Israel, Yemen and Syria; again, it’s hard to keep count. His vision of his part of the globe is pluralistic. Inspired by the Arab cooks working in Mr. Adoni’s Tel Aviv restaurants, Nur’s Palestinian tartare begins with mounds of raw beef and adds layer upon layer of complication. Pine nuts, tender young favas, pickled onions, slices of green chiles, broccolini florets, sumac powder and micro-sprouts are strewn over at least three sauces, including a pitch-dark and smoky eggplant purée and a very good sheep-milk yogurt. All of this flirts with chaos, but it doesn’t topple over. Nur turns an Arab dessert, the folded pancakes called qatayef, into fried savory pies filled with a mince of spiced lamb. There is some sweetness in the dough and a fair amount of delicious fat in the lamb, so a break from the richness comes in the form of cucumber spears and salted green almonds. Maybe the yogurt-mint sauce would work better as a dip than a “chaser” served in a shot glass, but the flavors are right. Born in southern Israel to a Moroccan family, Mr. Adoni draws on some of the cooking of that culture. The Moroccan fritters known as sfenj are the basis of an odd and appealing appetizer he calls a date doughnut. Although it is sweetened by dates it could just as easily be seen as a smoked trout beignet, or, when you get right down to it, a fish cake. The sauce is an intense sweet-and-sour citrus vinaigrette with curry powder lurking in it; a few drops go a long way. Like the chatter of a nervous guest at a party, the hyperactivity of certain dishes probably comes from a desire to impress. But the quieter plates can be just as remarkable, sometimes more so. There is a suave and very good seafood stew that is a cross between bouillabaisse and chraime, the Moroccan braise of fish in spicy tomato sauce. On the side is a bowl of what has to be the finest couscous I’ve ever eaten in a restaurant. Mr. Adoni says he learned to make the fluffy little semolina crumbs from a Libyan woman. Also from Libya is the scoop of tershi that sits atop the couscous. Made from pumpkin, eggplant and harissa, it is sweet, spicy and terrific. One factor in Nur’s early success — the small dining room has been thronged every time I’ve gone — is Mr. Adoni’s business partner and guide to local customs, Gadi Peleg. An owner of Breads Bakery, a champion producer of babka and rugelach, Mr. Peleg found the space, which crouches three steps below grade, beneath an eyelash-extension salon. The ceilings are low. The layout is tight. The service is familiar and opinionated about the menu. (Almost all the opinions are positive.) The place looks and acts, in other words, like a New York restaurant. It sounds like one, too, when all the seats are taken and raised voices start careening off the ceiling. Oddly enough, the bar is relatively quiet, and not a bad place to eat if you want to have a conversation. Mr. Peleg had a hand in the menu, and makes all the breads at his bakery from Mr. Adoni’s recipes. There is a miniature loaf of challah brushed with honey, salt and golden flakes of garlic; a kind of Yemenite monkey bread, flecked with nigella seeds, called kubaneh; and a sesame-blitzed Jerusalem bagel the size of a small bath mat. I recommend trying all three. Probably not on the same night. With all the ideas zinging around Nur’s menu, a few are bound to veer off in the wrong direction. The brazenly trayf gefilte shrimp, buried under pebbles of dashi jelly, doesn’t open up the way it should; both it and the jelly are too firm to melt on the tongue. A main course of octopus shimmers under a fine spice glaze, but gets wrong-footed by a jumble of sauces. Sea scallops, another main course, get along better with just one good sauce, a tart sorrel purée with an undercurrent of cumin. If the kitchen can do something about the awful, overcooked nuggets of ricotta gnudi, it would be onto something. Lisa Meisenger, the pastry chef, is certainly with the program. For a recent special, she scattered some juicy, dark strawberries over a bay-leaf custard with candied walnuts and pine-nut brittle. Rounded out with a scoop of mastic ice cream and decorated with flowers and edible gold, it was one of the more straightforward desserts. Something going by the name of chocolate cassata is made up of three small sandwiches of pistachio ice cream between almond cookies. They are nearly engulfed by chocolate foam, cherries in syrup, orange zest and candied pistachio. It is hectic, but delicious. Mr. Adoni said he would like to open a second New York restaurant. Selfishly, I’m hoping it will be North African; he could build an entire menu around that Libyan couscous. But he has his sights on a kosher restaurant. If he can use ingredients as vibrant as those at Nur, and keep the prices from soaring out the window, it would be a real achievement.

72,Guan Fu Sichuan,★★★,2017-08-01,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/dining/guan-fu-sichuan-review.html,Flushing,"Before I’d seen my first chile pepper at Guan Fu, it was already clear that it is a new kind of Sichuan restaurant for New York. To get there, you head to downtown Flushing, Queens, cross a courtyard off Prince Street and pass between the two stone lions under a small Chinese gabled roof, guarding the front door. Inside is a dignified dining room where polished wood panels stand next to weathered wooden screens under gilded, illuminated ceiling recesses. In the private rooms visible behind sliding doors, a few of the chairs look like small thrones. The ones in the main dining room are elaborate, cushioned and wide enough for two. The tables are set with dark wooden chopstick handles, wrapped in metal filigree at one end, with brushed steel tips at the other. To use them, you twist disposable bamboo tips into the steel ends. While you’re doing this, a server brings a party-size segmented wooden bowl holding sunflower seeds and roasted watermelon seeds for you to crack open while you page through the menu. Guan Fu Sichuan’s formality and rich interior detail are rare among this city’s Sichuan restaurants. Atmosphere doesn’t fill your stomach, of course, but when it’s done right, it can slow you down and wake your senses to the smells and tastes on the way. That is the case at Guan Fu, where the kitchen doesn’t always try to strafe your palate into submission with a hail of chiles. The flavors are potent, but they don’t get all of their force from their heat. I didn’t think I could love Sichuan boiled fish with pickled vegetables more than I already do until I tasted Guan Fu’s version. Here the body and flavor of what is typically a rather thin sauce is broadened with a stock made from fish bones. Fresh green chiles provide a heat held in thrilling check by the sourness. The broth is too intensely salty to qualify as soup, the server explained, but I still drank as much of it as I could handle. The kitchen gives mapo tofu, that old war horse, a new lease on life. While the chile heat is not full-bore, the fermented beans and other components are. Shimmering over jiggly mounds of white tofu is a mapo sauce as deeply flavored as any I’ve tasted. Cabbage is fried with pork and fresh chiles, but the appeal of the dish is the way the invisible presence of Sichuan peppercorns sets your mouth and lips tingling. And there is hardly any heat at all in the “eggplant with iron plate.” Traditionally made at home for Sichuan spring festivals, the dish was new to me, and I was very glad to make its acquaintance. Slices of eggplant are slit open, stuffed like dumplings with a pork-eggplant filling, then closed up, battered and fried. They are served in a pan kept over a small flame. The sauce that coated them was swimming with scallions and a few lengths of dried chile, but it drew its energy from the tension between sweet and sour. Not that the kitchen avoids spices. One reason to keep your wits about you while eating at Guan Fu is that you can’t always tell when extreme heat is about to rain down like Judgment Day. One of the hottest things on the menu, the Guan Fu-style cuttlefish salad, contains almost no red chiles. Its ability to shock and amaze comes from fresh green chiles that are roasted until black, skinned and made into a sauce that tastes almost Mexican. Barely cooked cuttlefish are scored with a knife so they twist up and look like little pine cones. That potent green sauce insinuates itself into every one of their crevices. This is one of many Guan Fu dishes that are rarely seen in New York, if ever. The menu is about 40 glossy pages long and full of color photographs of coral groupers, crystal crabs and other sea animals. In some parts it looks like a children’s book, although the kids won’t like the way the story ends for the soft-shell turtle. If you order one, a live specimen is brought out for inspection and reappears a short time later in pieces, mingled with potatoes, green beans and pickled cherry peppers. Its shell lies over the dish like a green cloche. Tradition dictates that the oldest person at the table has first crack at the chewy rim of fat around the edge. (At my table, that honor went to me. It and the soft cartilage were the most interesting parts of the animal; the meat was like fish-flavored chicken.) Not all the exotic imported species were available when I went, and others were offered at prices that scared me off. They are, presumably, meant for other customers who can afford to pay for a taste of home. Guan Fu, which joins a cluster of restaurants under the Hyatt Place hotel in the One Fulton Square real estate venture, is a reflection of the new money that is starting to transform this end of Flushing. The owners, Li Boru and Xue Wei, moved from China to New York to go to graduate school and wanted to open a restaurant that would evoke the aristocratic cooking of China’s dynastic era. For ordinary budgets, the kitchen will make most fish dishes with either tilapia or sea bass. The bass, clean and fresh tasting, is what I ordered with the pickled vegetables and in an equally heroic dish called “homemade roasted fish.” The bass was cooked whole and served with crunchy lotus root in a dark, fiery, wonderful stew seasoned with cilantro, Sichuan peppercorns and a 32-ingredient chile oil. Among the menu’s soft spots were two dishes any Sichuan restaurant should nail. Both dan dan noodles and kung pao chicken were unaccountably sleepy. Still, the noodles themselves, made on site, were very good, and the chicken had real flavor, which isn’t always the case. This wasn’t enough to make either dish interesting, but it does show the care Guan Fu takes with its ingredients. The day-to-day cooking is in the hands of one chef and the recipes are the domain of another, who works in Chengdu, the capital of the Sichuan Province. Mr. Li and Mr. Xue declined to name either man, citing personal reasons and a fear of chef poachers. According to one server, the chef in Chengdu was meant to join the one in Flushing but has been prevented from leaving China. This may explain some minor kitchen inconsistencies, like knife work that can be painstaking on some nights but haphazard on others. The dining room staff is variable, too. Multiple cues were missed at one dinner, when plates weren’t changed and cups of very good jasmine tea weren’t refilled as often as we would have liked. During other meals, the servers were extraordinarily eager to help. Guan Fu is a restaurant with room to grow. But it is an exceptional one already, throwing open a window on Sichuan cuisine to show New Yorkers the nuance and rich variety that lie beyond the old blast of chiles.

73,Atla,★★,2017-07-25,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/dining/atla-review-mexican-restaurant-noho.html,NoHo,"Since Atla ambled up to the corner of Lafayette and Great Jones Streets this spring, all the people who run to every new opening in town have been telling me they want to eat chilaquiles for breakfast there; they want the chicken enchiladas for lunch; they want to hide from the afternoon sun with a tall glass of iced tepache, a tingling, off-dry agua fresca Atla makes by letting sugar ferment with pineapple rinds. Sometimes, under their breath, they query a few of the prices at this casual Mexican cafe (“Fourteen dollars for radishes?”), but I haven’t talked to anyone who doesn’t think Atla is an extremely likable place. Despite its fairly modest goals, or maybe because of them, Atla is one of the least divisive restaurants Manhattan has seen in some time. It’s as if people, worn out by the sheer effort of being scandalized by the news, had decided that 2017 would be more bearable if we could all just find one thing to agree about. Atla is that thing. Opened by Enrique Olvera, the chef best known for Pujol in Mexico City, together with his proxy in New York, Daniela Soto-Innes, and their chef de cuisine, Hugo Vera, Atla knows just what it’s doing without seeming to try. This combination is as attractive in a restaurant as it is in a person. One thing it is not trying to do is make a big statement. Mr. Olvera and Ms. Soto-Innes made their statement already, at Cosme, their more elaborate restaurant on East 21st Street, which is now nearly as well known as Pujol. Having proved at Cosme that they have original things to say about Mexican cuisine, they are set free at Atla to serve Mexican food that New Yorkers may want to eat every day. Which is not to say that this is the everyday cooking of Mexico. While Cosme specializes in the kind of layered, multicomponent dishes with which chefs make their mark, Atla’s menu is simpler. The chilaquiles are just chilaquiles, tortilla chips in red or green salsa under white onions and a tangy crema. The chips are thick enough to keep their crunch, and they get more of it from a sprinkling of toasted flaxseeds. Flaxseeds are not a standard garnish for chilaquiles, but they are symptomatic of the contemporary strain of nutrient-conscious eating Atla displays. It has less in common with the sturdy cooking of traditional Mexican restaurants than with the modified health-food aesthetic of places like Dimes that cater to the yoga-mat crowd. Besides a regular cafe con leche Atla serves two versions with no dairy; one is made with cashew milk (a little odd) and another with coconut milk (wonderful). In any form, the cafe con leche is made with strong espresso, sweet enough to get along without sugar. Chia bowls usually bore me, despite their exemplary levels of omega-3 fatty acids, but the one at Atla held my attention. It’s stirred with sweet Mexican cinnamon, like a semisolid horchata, and topped with candied ginger, pumpkin seeds and nuts. A number of dishes are flat-out salads, like the fine if not soul-stirring quinoa with cucumbers and pico de gallo. Others are salad-adjacent. Those $14 radishes, cool, crisp and skinny, surround a smooth avocado dip. The chunky guacamole is pounded with nearly enough tarragon, mint and basil to qualify as an herb salad. When it arrives it is nearly invisible under a single chile-dusted corn chip the color of a wet bluestone sidewalk, and the size of a flip-flop. A smaller, rounder blue masa chip, spread with farmer cheese and capers, is the foundation of the arctic char tostada. As an attempt to introduce Russ & Daughters to Mexico it is all right, but it doesn’t go beyond that. The ceviche verde, on the other hand, is more dynamic than you expect, thanks to the fresh ginger in its tart green sauce, among other tricks. Depending on your metabolism, all this will leave you feeling either refreshed and ready to meet the day or slightly hungry. To make a lunch of the chilaquiles I needed to fortify the plate with poached chicken, bringing a $14 dish to $19. There are more substantial things to eat. Gray sole fried in a crunchy panko crust that tastes of garlic and butter is a complete meal. It comes with a small cucumber salad, like a Viennese schnitzel, although in Vienna they probably wouldn’t bathe the cucumbers in herb juice and add green chiles and cilantro. Nor would they sell you a $3 plate of warm tortillas so you can make your own tacos. Maybe they should, though. The pambazo, meanwhile, is the traditional sandwich of chorizo and potatoes on a soft roll dipped in guajillo salsa. It’s more or less the pambazo you would get out of a Oaxacan lunch truck if you were lucky enough to find one parked on Lafayette Street. Still, the overall lightness of the food has some bearing on the one real debate you could have about Atla. The question is not whether to go, but when. (People plan their meals at Cosme a week ahead or more, and while Atla takes reservations, going there tends to be a spur-of-the-moment decision.) The dining room’s corner space is wrapped in plate glass. By day this invites the sunshine in and provides a wide-screen view of the endless fashion parade of NoHo. By night, when the eggs and other breakfast dishes roll off the menu and the room fills up with people more interested in mezcal and the “overproof margarita” than coffee and agua fresca, the windows become sounding boards. At times like this you may notice all the other hard surfaces, like the stone floor; you may wonder why only some of the seats have backs; you may be frustrated in your effort to keep all your plates and glasses on the small round table. The very qualities that make Atla ideal for a relaxed breakfast or lunch, in other words, make it a dinner destination that is best approached with a moderate appetite, a resilient lower back and a suspicion that whatever your friends are saying probably isn’t important anyway. Better still, treat it as a drinking spot where food is an added attraction. For dessert there is a curious tamal topped with queso fresco. It’s more salty than sweet, a minor-key reprise of the great corn-husk meringue at Cosme. The most appealing dessert I had was a roasted sweet potato under a caramelized pool of sweetened condensed milk. It is off the menu now, but I am telling you about it anyway because I suspect it will be back. I know I will.

74,Little Tong Noodle Shop,★★,2017-07-11,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/dining/little-tong-noodle-shop-review-east-village.html,East Village,"Wheat noodles blur at the edges. At their core, they taste of cooked flour, or flour and egg, but toward the surface, they take on the flavor of their sauce. Think of pappardelle allied with a meaty ragù, or spools of ramen entwined with pork broth, throwing off starch, drinking in soup. Their boundaries dissolve. Rice noodles have very little flavor of their own and generally don’t take on much, either. They tend to make a hard break with their surrounding flavors; the more intense those flavors, the more welcome the break. They are almost pure texture. The favorite noodle in the Yunnan Province of southwestern China is a long, round, spaghetti-like rice noodle called mixian. It is the specialty at Little Tong Noodle Shop, a small, new, inexpensive restaurant in the East Village. Little Tong’s mixian seems to have a barely perceptible sour tang, but it is the very soft and elusively smooth texture that is most memorable. Just when your mouth is about to get some purchase on the noodles, away they slip. Little Tong Noodle Shop plunges mixian into soups and sauces that make a definite impression. Yunnan shares borders with Tibet, Vietnam, Myanmar and Laos; northern Thailand is not too far, either. The characteristic Southeast Asian tension of saltiness, sourness and chile heat creeps into these noodle bowls. They are buoyed by green herbs, too, by mint and cilantro, and by the tendency of the chef, Simone Tong, to twist contrasting strands of flavor together. Fundamentally, the banna shrimp mixian is a tomato soup, removed from Campbell’s reach by a whiff of smoke and a slight taste of shrimp and crab shells. Wheels of pickled green chiles add not just heat but depth; there are fried shallots, too, and fresh mint, stirred in along with coconut. In the grandma chicken mixian, a dark and grainy oil slick — a distillation of garlic and black sesame — dyes and deepens a chicken broth that is already so full-bodied it’s almost sticky. Resting on top of the rice noodles is chicken confit, which, in terms of moistness and flavor, is the exact opposite of the desiccated, used-up meat typically found in chicken soups. There are spicy red bits of fermented chile, some salty and sour pickles, an egg boiled in pu-erh tea, and long ivory chrysanthemum petals. It has to be the most interesting chicken noodle soup in the city right now. Another soup, the “little pot” mixian, tastes something like a spicy miso ramen that has shed its excess weight and picked up extra flavors. Chopped shiitakes and pork belly sit on the surface of the salty, milky pork broth, along with garlic chives and minced stems of pickled mustard greens. If this had been ramen, I would have left some noodles behind, but I finished this bowl, all of it, in an astonished haze, and didn’t regret it.  Little Tong Noodle Shop is Ms. Tong’s first restaurant as chef. She is also an owner. It is a modest place in many ways. The drinks list offers one red, one white, one rosé and a handful of beers and sakes. (The best choice may be Yunnanese tea.) There are 28 indoor seats, some pale wood slats on one wall, and exposed brick on another. The Noodle Shop does not necessarily invite comparisons to a more famous Noodle Bar three doors south on First Avenue, but it does not exactly discourage comparisons to David Chang’s restaurant, either. Like Mr. Chang, who cooked for Tom Colicchio before opening the first Momofuku, Ms. Tong threaded a path toward Asian noodles that ran through modern New York restaurant kitchens. Born in Chengdu, China, she went to culinary school in the United States. She worked as an intern for Masato Shimizu while he was still at 15 East, and cooked for Wylie Dufresne at WD-50 and Alder. It’s easier to see an American chef’s sensibility in the section of the menu called “little eats,” which are free of noodles and give Ms. Tong a chance to evoke Yunnan with East Coast ingredients. She coaxes impressive flavors from a small amount of cold Chinese broccoli dressed in citrus soy, with a salty, crunchy and smoky dusting of grated egg yolk. The “mini stir fry,” a seasonal improvisation, was made recently with fiddlehead ferns, pine nuts and tender, lime-green needles from the spring tips of spruce branches. They eat flowers in Yunnan, and Ms. Tong seems to recognize the value, in the age of Instagram, of a strategically deployed blossom or two. (They eat insects in Yunnan, too, but you don’t see her garnishing plates with deep-fried bamboo grubs.) In the case of the excellent egg drop soup, the stray petals had less presence than the corn kernels and salmon roe and the rags of cooked egg whites in the translucent broth. But I liked the peppery bite that chrysanthemum brought to the grandma chicken mixian and found the rose petals on the Yunnan salad to be more than just decorative. You will think this salad belongs in a trattoria when I tell you that it is composed mainly of radicchio and prosciutto, but no Italian would then go on to add fresh pineapple and boiled beef tendon. One night I ate peanut butter cookies for dessert. I’ve never seen them again. Where in Yunnan they came from, I don’t know; where they’ve gone, I can only guess. My latest meal there ended with six flavors of fruit sorbet in gumball-size scoops topped, of course, with edible flowers. The noodles cost either $14 or $15, except for one special, which is $16. Every appetizer is under $10 except the chopped raw beef, which is dressed with shallot oil and chile oil and can be spread on flaky, oily scallion bread with a daub of Sichuan-spiced beef fat or a swipe of smoked egg yolk. For this I paid $13 without griping. In fact, because Little Tong’s prices include service, they all seemed too low to be real. I wouldn’t mind if Ms. Tong asked $16 or $17 for noodles, rather than charging $1 each for chile oil, chile soy sauce and fermented chiles. People in Yunnan like to doctor their broth to taste from a whole range of condiments and spices; it’s part of the experience. Ms. Tong has a precise palate, I think, but there were times when I wanted to recalibrate the broth. Little Tong Noodle Shop is strict about not seating incomplete parties, even when the place is empty. Once you have a table, though, the servers are quick and sympathetic. The dining room is overseen by Emmeline Zhao, who has the twin titles of general manager and panda caretaker. One of the sakes comes in a glass decorated with painted pandas, like an old Welch’s jelly jar. Panda art hangs in the front window, and if you are ever called on to administer the Heimlich maneuver to a panda, the custom-drawn choking poster by the restroom door should provide all the information you need.

75,ABCV,★★,2017-07-03,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/03/dining/abcv-review-vegetables-restaurant-jean-georges-vongerichten.html,Flatiron,"Warnings about the risks of eating raw shellfish and eggs are now fairly routine on menus. Somewhat less common are disclaimers like the one that appears next to an asterisk on the drinks menu of Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s latest restaurant, ABCV: “These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. These products are not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. If you are pregnant, nursing, have a medical condition or take medications, please consult with a healthcare professional before use.” This note refers to a group of juice blends with ingredients from ayurvedic and other medical traditions, and what the Food and Drug Administration has not signed off on are not so much statements as nebulous targets that the juices may or may not hit. The first one I drank was tangerine and black currant juice dosed with rhodiola, St. John’s wort and albizia, which some believe fight anxiety and depression. ABCV calls this beverage Joy. Those who follow Mr. Vongerichten know the chef to be a protean shape-shifter. Over the years, he has championed Asian fusion, luxe American comfort food and border-dissolving pan-Latinism, among other things, all while holding down the fort of modern haute cuisine at Jean-Georges. Still, it is a bit surprising to see him pop up as a pitchman for drinks that require cutting and pasting verbiage from section 101.93 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The V in ABCV performs triple duty, standing for vegetables, vibrations and Vongerichten. It does not officially signify vegan, although many things on the menu are. Sustainable farming is favored. Ingredients whose genes have been monkeyed with are avoided. The aromas of cooking animal flesh do not pollute the atmosphere of the dining room, which is loftlike and white with a few brightly colored chairs, like the lounge in “2001: A Space Odyssey.” ABCV sits on East 19th Street, inside ABC Carpet & Home and side by side with ABC Kitchen and ABC Cocina. Mr. Vongerichten owns and operates all three with Paulette Cole, the store’s proprietor. Sustainability was a theme in the first two ABC restaurants, but ABCV extends the idea into a boutique wellness exercise. It is the sort of restaurant where the menu has a preface. ABCV, it explains, “is here to serve, inform and inspire a cultural shift towards plant-based intelligence.” The food is not simply vegetarian. It is “high vibration,” and has the goal of nurturing “our personal and planetary ecosystems.” An insert within the menu, illustrated with pretty watercolor drawings, goes into detail on the health benefits of various plants you may encounter. I found the menu’s prose mildly indigestible, but the food it describes is light, colorful, fresh and easy to like. Some of it is memorable, and none of it makes you feel as if you have asked your stomach to do things it wasn’t meant to do. These are the two sides of ABCV: a missionary message combined with cooking that has a large measure of creativity and surprise. I guess that qualifies as “high vibration.” Some of the most engaging courses at ABCV are dips. The gold medal in this event goes to the green hummus made with fresh chickpeas and Thai basil and served with substantial puffs of whole-grain pita. Good hummus has many fine qualities, but it is rarely exciting. This is. Running a close second is the labneh fortified with shallots, which give it some of the charm of an old-fashioned cocktail-party onion dip. It is great on purple potato chips or cucumbers (“a warrior against hypertension and heart disease”). Mr. Vongerichten and his chef de cuisine, Neal Harden, focus their salads in ways that turn them into precise statements. There’s nothing random about the pairing of bitter radicchio with ripe strawberries, a few of which are crushed so they get smeared around the purple leaves and join forces with the saffron vinaigrette. Warm appetizers are built with a similar care. Grilled caps of donko shiitakes the size of muffin tops are spread with a green goddess dressing with a tingling charge of yuzukosho. The mushrooms (whose B vitamins help “manage physical and emotional stress”) come with caramelized fennel, a more apt partner than you might guess. Roasted carrots (“eat with oil or a fat to absorb the full benefit of her beta-carotene”) are spritzed with lime and piled over an excellent and spicy butter, ground from toasted nuts and seeds. All of this is many miles away in flavor and charisma from the dour school of vegetable cookery that has been dished out recently by young, Nordic-influenced chefs I think of as the Brotherhood of the Charred Sunchoke. These chefs avoid the spices, citrus and chiles of warmer climates, presumably in tribute to their North Star, the Copenhagen restaurant Noma. Mr. Vongerichten and Mr. Harden aren’t playing in that sandbox. They’ve got their own toys. When a squirt of lime juice can help, squirt they will. One or two dishes struck this omnivore as not quite complete. A plate of crisp, salty, horseradish-spiked sauerkraut made from savoy cabbage was a little monotonous on its own. I’ll bet it’s fantastic on a hot dog. I also wanted more heft from the parts of the menu headed “noodles and rice” and “legumes and grains.” In the wild rice with spring vegetables and fermented carrots, rice was an ensemble player, not the lead. And when my server recommended the spinach spaghetti by means of a story about cooking pasta at his mother’s side, I was hoping for more than a sparrow’s nest of green noodles under a mulch of kale and broccoli (“a cruciferous that prevents premature aging”). The flavors were very good, livened up with preserved lemons, but I had to manage my stomach’s expectations. Desserts are unpredictable. You could get a grainy, thick, cakelike pudding trying to pass for chocolate mousse. Or you could have an exemplary pavlova outfitted with strawberries and rhubarb. And yet, I always got up from the table feeling pretty good. True, the health claims are not made in a style that appeals to everyone. ABCV goes in a little too much for the Goop style of transactional nutrition: If you eat X, then Y will (or won’t) happen. But since I tend to treat nutritional advice the way the owner of a new Lamborghini treats speed-limit signs, I sent ABCV’s menu to Jeffrey B. Blumberg, who researches antioxidants at Tufts University. For the most part, he approved. The specific claims looked largely accurate to him, and the more general ones struck him as vague enough to be harmless. “I’m not giving it a scientific endorsement for precision,” Dr. Blumberg said. “But this kind of information, in a very subtle way, gives you the idea that each of these plant foods gives you different things. And if you put enough of them on your plate, you’ll be eating according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which very few people follow.” Did I eat more vegetables than usual at ABCV? Yes. Will it stop me from aging? Time will tell. Did my Joy bring me joy? Maybe not, but it didn’t make matters worse, either.

76,Empellón,★★★,2017-06-27,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/27/dining/empellon-review-mexican-midtown.html,Midtown,"To begin at the end, the desserts at the new Empellón in Midtown are some of the most exciting New York has seen in a long time. Empellón is the flashiest, fanciest and newest of Alex Stupak’s three restaurants, and the one that provides the fullest expression of his dreamscape vision of Mexican food. He doesn’t reproduce or translate the cuisine; he builds a fantasy version of it, coupling deep technical skills with imagination to create a slightly unreal version of reality, the way the best animated movies do. Dessert lends itself to fantasies better than other kinds of cooking, a fact that Mr. Stupak and his pastry chef, Justin Binnie, have exploited to the hilt. One of the desserts is a frozen parfait that looks like half an avocado on a snowy bed of ice. The illusion is almost perfect, with tones of green that fade from the near black of the peel to a grassy pale color in the divot where the pit should go. The mimicry isn’t just visual. The parfait is as creamy and smooth as the flesh of an avocado left on the counter for four days. But of course it’s sweeter and tastes of butterfat, so it’s a relief when the ice crystals melt on your tongue into a bright limeade. Under the ice is yogurt infused with eucalyptus. Although making all this can’t possibly be simple, the flavors are, and they’re wonderfully balanced. Another dessert comes in the form of a taco, because why not? A waffle cone folded into the shape of a hard-shell tortilla is stuffed with a delicious ice cream flavored by corn and salt. It might be Empellón’s answer to the corn husk meringue at Cosme. It might be a tribute to Corn Pops. Either way, it’s great. “Strawberries for the table” is a plate of seven one-bite sweets with different permutations of the fruit. One is a raw, red berry. Its leaves have been replaced by shiso, it’s been stuffed with yuzu jelly, and it’s electrifying. Another is a birch-flavored marshmallow dusted with powdered, dried strawberries. Eating all seven took me about four minutes (including pauses for such penetrating insights as “Wow!”) and completely restored my faith in the power of a good pastry chef to amplify and extend the themes that started with vegetables and meat. Restaurant reviews don’t usually turn over so much space to desserts, but the ones at Empellón deserve it. They also illustrate how much Mr. Stupak has matured as both chef and restaurateur since he left a career in pastry to tackle Mexican food.  Before it closed recently, Empellón Cocina in the East Village was Mr. Stupak’s statement restaurant, and boy, did he have a statement to make. He had come out of the pastry kitchens of two of the country’s most determinedly avant-garde restaurants, Alinea and WD-50, and many of his dishes were self-consciously arty and tightly clenched. Even the action-painting bloops of salsa and mole radiated tension. I loved the flavors, but sometimes it seemed as if Mr. Stupak didn’t have the heart to tell his food that somebody was going to try to eat it. Maybe it’s the competition from Cosme, which takes a much less formalist approach to high-end Mexican cooking. Maybe Mr. Stupak has more empathy for his customers now. Maybe setting up shop in a big, two-level space in Midtown in March triggered a dormant crowd-pleasing gene. Whatever the cause, the food he is cooking at Empellón wants to be liked. There’s no doubt that you’re supposed to knock back the oyster shooter in tomato-and-orange-flavored water with drops of ketchup oil floating on the surface. A distillation of the flavors in a Mexican seafood cocktail, the shooter disappears in one fast gulp. Another seafood cocktail is made from poached lobster and curls and spears of cucumber jutting out of a lovely lobster cream that functions like a party dip. Served in a vase like a flower arrangement — there are even some purple star-shaped blossoms scattered around — it’s as striking as anything at Empellón Cocina, but the relaxed generosity feels new. There’s a wild salad of yellow beets under a snow pile of green-chile granita and coconut crema. And there’s a tart heap of salmon tartare chopped with gooseberries; it’s dotted with crema and a gooseberry-pasilla chile salsa. One dish puts young red-leaf lettuces spritzed with lime and salted water next to what looks like the icing on a birthday cake: It’s salsa verde creamed with butter, spread smooth and ringed with crema in tiny piped rosettes. If there is anyone who hasn’t yet figured out that butter makes salads better, spreading this salsa verde icing on lettuce leaves should be persuasive. Larger courses don’t have built-in structural barriers to sharing, as some dishes at Empellón Cocina did. Roasted sea bream is served whole under pickled onions, thin wheels of tomatillo and miniature salsa-verde-soaked chilaquiles. Short-rib confit pulls apart into rich purplish hunks that you eat with a version of picadillo in which every ingredient tastes more delicious than it’s supposed to. Pork belly slices attached to ribbons of crunchy skin come inside a kind of taco bowl made from a single, plate-size chicharrón. You can crack the chicharrón and use the shards as chips, or you can fold it into a warm tortilla with watermelon radishes, sliced chiles and some habanero salsa that gives the pork the get-up-and-go it needs.  In one section of the menu, Empellón’s desire to please does not quite translate into actual pleasure: the tacos. I used to think Mr. Stupak did not know what tacos are. He’s been serving them for so long, though, that now I suspect he just wants them to be something else. He seems to have the idea that because people love tacos, he can fill them with weird things — curled tendrils of octopus on spicy peanut butter, or dense and dry falafel balls with grasshopper hummus — as an invitation to the rest of the menu. Yes, anything can be turned into a taco, but perhaps not everything should. The best taco I had at Empellón, not counting the corn ice cream, was one I made from the peppers and onions sizzling on an iron plate on which a server had briefly seared a Wagyu steak. This is a great, witty take on fajitas, although the joke would be funnier if it didn’t cost $125. You can write off the tacos completely, and what’s left is still a very enjoyable restaurant. The architecture firm Glen & Company has brought some Broadway boogie-woogie to the space, creating rhythm with colors and suspending a theatrical scalloped balcony over the main floor. There’s enough room between the tables for a bar cart to trundle around loaded with bottles of mezcal and other hard stuff. It’s another way for Mr. Stupak to show that he’s serious now about bringing the party to the table.

77,Don Peppe,★,2017-06-20,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/20/dining/don-peppe-review-italian-american-restaurant-queens.html,South Ozone Park,"“Get ready for a lot of flavor.” This was what an old hand with the menu at Don Peppe said as the first plates came to our table. He could have shortened that to “get ready for a lot,” or just “get ready.” Some preparation for the meal to come is definitely in order for the uninitiated, a word that on a typical day applies to nobody at this white-tablecloth red-sauce restaurant in South Ozone Park, Queens. Don Peppe novices need to know that certain items are not welcome on the premises, as listed on a sign on the front door: No Tank Tops, Hats, Strollers, Baby Carriages, Credit Cards. With these exceptions, the dress code is permissive and allows for pantsuits, polo shirts, track jackets, pleated trousers, wide shorts. The manager in charge of the waiting list one recent night — reservations aren’t taken — had on a guayabera embroidered with a Yankees logo. Waiters wear white shirts and neckties. Bussers are dressed in black T-shirts with The Original Baked Clams printed on the back, a stirring if undocumented claim. Don Peppe is about half a mile north of a long-term parking lot for Kennedy International Airport and half a mile east of Aqueduct Racetrack. Seeing the jockey silks and photographs of thoroughbreds hanging on the walls, a first-timer might conclude that the restaurant has been a horse-themed clubhouse for touts, trainers, gamblers and bookmakers since the Damon Runyon era. In fact, the original racing décor, which dated back to the 1960s, when Don Peppe moved to Lefferts Boulevard from Brooklyn, was replaced by Italian landscape paintings many years ago as Aqueduct traffic faded. Michael DeLuca Sr., the owner, said the track crowd had started to come back recently, with bigger shares of the purse in their pockets. In their honor, he revived the equestrian motif. A person who knows of Don Peppe only as a scheme of Turtle’s in an “Entourage” subplot may ask to see the wine list. Everybody at Don Peppe drinks the house white or the house red. Both come in bottles with no cork and no label. Both are well chilled. Both have the carefree good cheer of the very young. It would be a similar error to wait for menus. They are not printed on paper. Everything, the antipasti and pastas, the seafood, meat and desserts, is printed in white on a blackboard. If the sightlines were better, a person with good vision could read it from the other side of Lefferts Boulevard. Sitting in a corner, my guide couldn’t see the menu and didn’t need to. He mentioned about a dozen family-size dishes to the waiter: baked clams, fried peppers, the “special salad,” a pound of pasta (the minimum serving), another pound of pasta, veal cutlets and something called shrimp Luciano, which may or may not be named after Lucky Luciano. “You want linguine with the shrimp Luciano?” the waiter asked. “Why not?” So that was another pound. I thought my guide had finished, but he was merely pausing for breath. “We should get the chicken Chinese, just so you can try it,” he said. “Oh, and the steak’s not bad either. Let’s get a porterhouse.” As I was saying, it was a lot, and as he had warned me, a lot of flavor, although another way to put that would be to say a lot of garlic. Garlic chopped to a fine mist and warmed with clam juice and olive oil sloshes under the baked littlenecks, a dozen to an order. Spooned over the almost blackened crust of bread crumbs, this sauce is rich and gentle. It doesn’t bully the freshly shucked clams, whose small size — inside their shells, many are no bigger than a quarter — helps distance Don Peppe from legions of other baked-clam artists around the city. Garlic in whole cloves is browned with onions and strips of red peppers in a pan hot enough to scare the peppers out of their skins. Called fried peppers, it’s essentially a three-ingredient dish, five if you count black pepper and olive oil, and the first time you eat it you can’t quite believe how far the flavors take you. One person I ate with insisted that the peppers had to have been laced with sugar. A more likely explanation is that the kitchen makes these dishes and others the way they are supposed to be made, adding a few flourishes of its own. This is a rare thing. Italian-American restaurant cooking is not an endangered species in New York just yet, but enough of its practitioners have closed or slumped into irrelevance to raise concerns about gene pool dilution. Don Peppe is one of the few exemplars where pride and purpose, both essential to this cuisine, remain intact. Mr. DeLuca employs three chefs, all charged with following recipes that in most cases go back more than 100 years, to when the restaurant was founded by a Neapolitan who went by the name Don Peppe. (His full name and the exact date were forgotten many baked clams ago.) Those pounds of pasta are one place where the difference is plain. White clam sauce can be a thin soup with stray eraser tips, or it can be, as it is at Don Peppe, a concentrated broth that sinks deep into the pasta, which sits under a wide swath of chopped fresh clams and parsley. The pomodoro sauce is a thick, profoundly red gravy that doesn’t cast a watery pool on the bottom of the plate. The same sauce, or one close to it, is the bed for shells stuffed with ricotta, topped with mozzarella and run under the broiler long enough to put a crackle on the lips of the shells. The meat sauce is just meat sauce. The marinara, though, is what every jarred sauce on the market wishes it could be. Beginners may need to have a few menu items decoded. Don Peppe special salad: iceberg, tomatoes, salami, provolone and so forth, in a huge bowl. It sounds ordinary but somehow it isn’t. Shrimp Luciano: shrimp in a garlic-butter sauce turned sunset pink by a rumor of tomatoes. It’s great, and there’s no reason not to have it over pasta. Veal Don Peppe: chopped raw tomatoes, red peppers and onions ladled over a breaded cutlet that you could slice with a wooden spoon. Chicken Chinese: cut-up chicken in a tomato sauce reduced to a brownish jam. The least compelling of these is the chicken Chinese, the subject of a homage on Carbone’s opening menu. (It didn’t make sense there, either.) At Don Peppe, it tends toward dryness, an affliction that can also touch the chicken scarpariello. In several return visits, I noticed regulars eating things not advertised on the menu — stuffed peppers, a porterhouse, a tomahawk chop with a bone that you could use to prop up a car hood. The beef is better than you might expect but will not give you the false impression that Don Peppe is a steakhouse. The best dessert is probably the cheesecake. The rest are what kids in Bay Ridge and Corona used to want on their birthdays: tortoni, tartufo, spumoni. Of course, the other people at your table will say they have no room for dessert. Even on your first visit, you’ll know they don’t mean it.

78,King,★★,2017-06-06,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/06/dining/king-restaurant-review-soho.html,SoHo,"A friend who has made herself a regular at the SoHo restaurant King sums up its appeal, with deep approval, as “food on a plate in a room.” This undersells the place — King offers much more than that — but she has a point. The restaurant, which opened in September, is not a show-off. The dining room is small, tidy and nearly square, painted the pale color of butter in the winter. Windows stretching to the ceiling along the north wall look out on the dormered Federal townhouses of King Street. The facing wall is broken up with a single abstract painting, a doorway to the kitchen and a long opening behind which the four people who make up the entire kitchen staff can be seen at work. It is a room content with being just a room, and letting you focus on the people you’re with and the food that’s on the plate. There will be papery curls of carta di musica before anything else arrives. Brushed with rosemary, this Sardinian flatbread shatters when you tap it. It will be gone in a minute, but it serves as a brief introduction to King’s culinary realm. After this gift from the kitchen, an order of panisse may seem redundant. It isn’t. At King, these chickpea fritters are long, thin tongues that puff up like pommes soufflés and are scented all over by fried sage. They’re beautiful. They were on the menu last month, but they may not stay long. Nothing does. King’s two chefs, Jess Shadbolt and Clare de Boer, cook a different slate of dishes each night. The changes tend to be evolutionary, drawing from a fixed repertoire of ideas. The first time I had halibut there, it was grilled, and its skin had been deeply charred without drying out the rich white meat right under it. The plate was filled out with spinach and white coco beans soft enough to mash with a spoon. The next time I ate halibut at King, it was poached, the beans were back and the greens had been replaced with small artichoke hearts simmered in white wine and amaranth. I’ll eat either dish again in a minute if the chefs give me a chance. Their food borrows liberally from the home cooking of those parts of Italy and France where New Yorkers of a certain generation dreamed of buying a summer house. This style has gone out lately, but a few years ago it was the default for the breed of American chefs who led their staff in fava-shucking parties each spring. Ms. Shadbolt and Ms. de Boer practice an English variant of the style they learned in the kitchen of the River Cafe in London. Anybody who’s eaten at that restaurant or has gone to bed with one of its cookbooks will experience occasional flashbacks at King. Polenta and almond flour go into a classic River Cafe dessert and into a different one that recurs at King. If you see it on the menu, especially if it is weighted with nectarines, pounce. Chefs can’t get far on imitation. They need to understand the how and why of things, and Ms. Shadbolt and Ms. de Boer do. Once you get past King’s debt to River Cafe, what you really notice is how many little moves they know that can raise a recipe from good to exceptional. Olive oil blended with nettles is an excellent sauce for boiled fingerling potatoes. What makes King’s even better is that a few fingerlings have been crushed into the purée, so from time to time you bite into a chunk of potato hiding inside the sauce. This was a side dish that traveled alongside a guinea hen, roasted whole with a bath of verdicchio in the bottom of the pan. Wilted nettles sprawled over its crisp skin. With a squeeze of lemon, it was one of the most appealing guinea hens I had ever come across. If you eat at King often, you can see the chefs making subtle adjustments to keep flavors in balance. Ravioli under spring peas and raw pea shoots were filled with minimally seasoned ricotta one week. The next, the ricotta inside floppy tortellini got an extra spur from lemon zest. The citrus might have stepped on the sweetness of the peas, but it helped the tortellini, because the only competition on the plate was fresh marjoram. And when some new seasonal ingredient appears on the scene, you can see the chefs strike like cobras. Saltwort, the salt-marsh-loving succulent that Italians call agretti, was the exciting foundation for a May salad built with wild arugula and raw ovals of asparagus stalks, making one of their first appearances of the year. Salty goldenrod bottarga was shaved over everything, even the white rim of the plate. To be won over by King, it helps not to expect things you’ve never seen before. Even those meeting saltwort for the first time will find that the rest of the meal looks familiar. What Ms. de Boer and Ms. Shadbolt offer is not a wild vision of new ways to cook but a solid vision of how to eat. They put pleasure at the table above gymnastics on the plate. For reasons I don’t want to understand, I associate this trait with other female chefs around town, including Rita Sodi, Missy Robbins, Gabrielle Hamilton, Sara Jenkins, Angie Mar and April Bloomfield, another River Cafe alumna. At King, the vision extends to how to drink. Annie Shi, who superintends the dining room and is a third business partner with the chefs, can offer guidance with the wine list. She favors French and Italian producers, many of them not quite famous, whose wines gracefully weave in and around the cooking. At the compact bar by the front door, cocktails are put together with the simplicity and respect for aperitif wines that you find in Italy. There is a kir and a sbagliato, which is nothing more than Campari and red vermouth on the rocks topped up with prosecco. These and other drinks slip into the bloodstream without knocking the palate out of alignment. The desserts are cafe style. They don’t look like extraterrestrial landscapes but rather recognizable slices and scoops. One of the few things at King that didn’t make perfect sense was a tiramisù; it went too heavy on the espresso and too light on the mascarpone. Every other dessert was just what I wanted, even when I didn’t know I wanted it. Chilled, thickened cream flavored with Pernod? I’m a fan now. I’m also a new convert to something called the Colonel. It’s a cup of lemon granita served with a tiny pitcher of cold vodka. You pour one over the other. I have no idea why the vodka makes the granita taste better, but it does.

79,Pinch Chinese,★,2017-05-30,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/30/dining/tim-ho-wan-review-pinch-chinese-restaurant-dim-sum-dumpling.html,SoHo,"Visitors to Hong Kong who have an appreciation for dumplings, an eye toward low prices and faith that a single Michelin star reliably predicts quality will tend to eat at one of two places. Those who are more attracted to Cantonese dim sum classics will almost certainly end up at a location of the locally based Tim Ho Wan chain. The ones whose idea of a perfect dumpling is a xiao long bao with hot broth sealed inside will head to a branch of Din Tai Fung, which was founded in Taiwan. The very hungry ones will go to both. The two businesses have been busy exporting their folding and crimping technologies to dumpling-conscious cities around the world. With its 45th location, which opened in the East Village just before Christmas, Tim Ho Wan is the first of the pair to bring its towers of bamboo steamers to New York City. Tim Ho Wan was started by the chef Mak Kwai Pui, who had been in charge of the expensively exquisite dim sum at the Four Seasons hotel in Hong Kong. With his partner, Leung Fai Keung, his idea was to go back to basics, retaining some of the techniques and refinements of high-end dim sum while bringing prices down to sea level. In New York, the entire menu fits on a paper place mat. When you read it, it’s not immediately apparent why fans were willing to stand on Fourth Avenue in the cold for hours last December simply to put their names and phone numbers on a list for the privilege of being called a few hours after that, when a table was finally free. Many items can be found for about the same price (nothing is over $6) in other dim sum parlors. Now that the lines have died down considerably, it’s clear that the versions at Tim Ho Wan are good, but very few are throw-half-the-day-away good, and some have a rote quality that tends to creep into all but the most vigilant chains. True, the har gow wrappers are thinner than you expect, the shrimp inside firmer. The black bean sauce with steamed spare ribs tastes especially savory; the abalone sauce on the chicken feet a bit richer than the typical oyster sauce. The pan-fried turnip cakes contain flecks of dried shrimp that send their particular intensity in all directions. Soft as bread pudding inside, they are firmly seared, giving them an undertone of char and a hint of smoke somewhere off in the distance. The beef balls, under ragged veils of tofu skin, are the lightest and airiest I’ve ever eaten. But the rice rolls, a point of pride for the chain, are white bogs of starch that blot out the underseasoned fillings of beef, pork or shrimp. I’ve tried all three in New York, and they’re never quite there, while the pork liver rice roll I tried at a Tim Ho Wan last month in Sydney, Australia, buzzed with ginger and scallions inside its thin and delicate wrapper. The barbecued pork buns, which make the Hong Kong airport location of Tim Ho Wan the first and last stop in town for some passengers, have been a work in progress in New York. The flaky pastry, somewhere between a Parker House roll and a Southern buttermilk biscuit, shows off Mr. Mak’s finesse. The crackled surface, made of short crust dough blooped out of a pastry bag, doesn’t taste like much but somehow makes the buns more exciting to eat. The trouble has been with the gooey, half-sweet filling. Back in January, there wasn’t much of it, and it lacked conviction. In March, it was only slightly more sure of itself. This month, I finally had one that was richly flavored, well proportioned to the bun, and very hot. Steamed egg cake is another signature dish, or, as Tim Ho Wan puts it, one of the “big four heavenly kings.” A square tan slice of it is so plain it looks like the last thing left on the table of a PTA bake sale, but it’s consistently airy and wonderful, with its homey taste of molasses. It’s not a dessert. It seems to go with everything on the menu. In Australia, the osmanthus jelly, which is a dessert, was a shimmering, translucent amber, saturated with the spring-fever flavors of peaches and flowers. The New York version has been rubbery, as dark as beef bouillon, and strangely bland. Far more appealing are the coins of French toast pressed together around a center of egg custard, a cross of two Hong Kong snacks bred expressly for the New York market.  Din Tai Fung has almost three times as many branches as Tim Ho Wan, but for now its American presence is focused entirely on the West Coast. A few months ago, though, a restaurant in SoHo came along with a chef, Charlie Chen, who had been pried loose from the company’s kitchens. The xiao long bao and other dishes at Pinch Chinese will for many New Yorkers be the first taste of the Din Tai Fung aesthetic. Mr. Chen’s dumpling cooks wear masks over their mouths as they work behind glass at the end of the dining room, which gives them the air of fast-moving surgeons. The first thing you notice about their soup dumplings is that they are pretty. In other restaurants, they are baggy, saggy water balloons ready to spill their guts on impact. At Pinch, they stand upright like Hershey’s Kisses, and their skins, though very thin, don’t rupture when squeezed between chopsticks. A single dumpling fits quite comfortably in the mouth. Once you bite down, the broth that pours out is not as lip-smackingly gelatinous as it could be, but it’s still rich and full of flavor. The best and most unusual is filled with chicken soup, and you wouldn’t want it any thicker than it is. It’s very good. As finely made as those are, I somewhat preferred the non-soup dumplings: the steamed half-moons stuffed with gingery flakes of fish; the ones with a dark core of minced mushrooms and truffles; or the pan-fried semicircles filled with juicy sautéed beef, found only at lunch and brunch. Pinch also makes the best Sichuan won tons, shaped like clothesline ghosts and swimming in chile oil, that I’ve tasted outside a Sichuan restaurant. Sean Tang, who owns Pinch with a cousin, Tony Li, and Mr. Chen, has said he wants the menu to be “region agnostic.” Occasionally this results in stuff I might cook at home with a recipe from an American magazine, like the humdrum fried rice with steak or the pork ribs in cumin and chile seasoning. A magazine would call them Spicy Sichuan Ribs. They aren’t. In general, though, the conceit works. Other Sichuan-style dishes, like the ma po tofu, make up in balance what they may lack in heat. From Taiwan, there’s a highly credible three-cup chicken cooked with all dark meat (it makes a difference), as well as a hypnotically good stir-fry of cabbage with red chiles and thin slices of browned bacon. Snow Crab in a Chinese Restaurant has a generic name but a nongeneric flavor, with spicy black bean sauce over glass noodles and crab meat. The Wind Sand Chicken is a whole roast bird suffused all the way down with five-spice seasoning, then buried under a golden drift of fried garlic. It costs $45, which will strike Chinatown regulars as a large number. It will seem almost a bargain to anyone who eats in other restaurants that have wine lists like Pinch’s, which takes in pét-nats and skin-contact wines in styles from forbidding to friendly. It was put together by Miguel de Leon, who presided over the heroic cellar at Casa Mono, and you can tell he had fun with it. “You really like merlot” is a phrase that turns up twice. The first time it is above the wines by the glass, all made with the grape that everybody decided was trash after “Sideways” came out. Everybody was wrong. You really do like it.

80,Italienne,★,2017-05-22,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/dining/italienne-review-restaurant-jared-sippel.html,Flatiron,"Jared Sippel might have had too much time to think before he opened Italienne. The restaurant, the chef’s first in New York City, has been open since the fall and is on its way to being something well out of the ordinary. But Mr. Sippel is trying to do so many things at once that his point of view gets garbled. The potential for confusion is even embedded in the name, which means Italian in French. Two rooms, with different styles and food, are spread out across a deep, high-ceilinged spot just west of Madison Square Park. Up front is the Taverna, where you can study the generally Italian menu of snacks and more over a cocktail and some pink folds of San Daniele prosciutto, shaved on a fire-engine-red slicer that is on display at the end of the bar like Clark Gable’s Harley at Kiehl’s. Past the bar you enter the polished, expensive Dining Room, where the food is much more French, is arranged with an eye on negative space, and is available à la carte or as a six-course, $140 tasting menu, wine pairing optional. On Monday nights, this half of the enterprise switches over to a four-course set menu devoted to the cooking of a single region, which could be French, or Italian. These party-in-the-front, business-in-the-back setups are complex propositions. They’re not hot-dog stands. Mr. Sippel has made a tough job tougher by taking on two countries and more than one style of cooking, and layering the formal-casual split on top. At times, Italienne is like somebody who starts to tell you a joke about a priest, a rabbi and an imam in a rowboat and ends up talking about Maimonidean law. Mr. Sippel moved to New York four years ago after his cooking at Quince in San Francisco and Frasca Food and Wine in Boulder, Colo., put him in the national eye. He had been hired to be the chef of the Manhattan edition of Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare, which was supposed to be imminent. It wasn’t. Mr. Sippel finally dropped out to work on a place of his own, which beat the new Brooklyn Fare to opening by about a month. Along the way, he brought together a talented crew. Erica O’Neal, who had been a sommelier at Frasca, stockpiled mostly French and Italian wines for a discovery-packed list that is full of twists and turns even at its cheap end. The desserts and pastries are under Rebecca Isbell, whose work made the end of a meal at Betony something to look forward to. His business partner and general manager is James King, a well-rounded pro who put in time at both Frasca and Brooklyn Fare. Everybody is out to make a good impression. One busy night in the Taverna, when my guests and I had to wait at the bar for about 20 minutes past our reservation time, we were handed glasses of prosecco before we had finished our cocktails. When we got to the table, two of the Italian snacks the menu calls stuzzichini were waiting for us: warm arancini with melted fior di latte at their core, and panzerotti, little turnovers filled with bits of warm salumi and scamorza. It was more of an apology than the situation called for. On the other hand, every apology should taste so good. On a quick read, the Taverna’s menu is like the ones at many other casual Italian spots. A deeper look, though, reveals more originality than usual. Scattered among the Italian favorites are a few French ideas, like the subtly curried cauliflower gratin under a tan layer of Comté. One of the snacks was a kind of sandwich filled with something like hash browns; crisp fried triangles of cheese take the place of bread. Eating it is like getting a tax refund you weren’t expecting. Under pasta was another big surprise: delicate little cabbage-and-bread dumplings the size of Swedish meatballs. They’re from far northern Italy, where they’re known as canederli. Italienne gave them an Eastern European lilt by serving them with beets, horseradish and applesauce. Mr. Sippel seemed to reach beyond the borders again with the caraway seeds and excellent braised red cabbage he brought to a plate of pork — tender ribs and a juicy chop that got a little too much finishing salt but were still close to perfect. Ms. Isbell’s desserts in the Taverna made some unexpected moves, too. Her lemon tart was wonderful and showed a sense of humor; with a cloak of white lemon icing outside and a soft filling of lemon-poppy seed cream inside, it looked just like a wedge of Camembert. But I don’t know what to make of her baba au rhum, which tasted like a two-day-old coconut doughnut that had been accidentally splashed with liquor at the bar. My first meal in the Dining Room was on a Monday, when the four-course menu was supposedly inspired by the northern Rhone. I had trouble seeing the connection, but I enjoyed it all. There was an exceptional velouté of squash and apples with a fat lobe of foie gras, and a little meditation on beef and spring onions, with a Syrah-glazed beef cheek and a slice of strip loin. Dessert was a tart of dense, rich chocolate layered over salted caramel. It was an ideal end for a dinner of refined bistro food. When I went back on another night, though, the plates were excessively fussed over, self-conscious and forced, with the form of haute cuisine but not the sense. It was like reading a French text that had been run through Google’s translator and then back again. The frogs’ legs hidden inside a frizz of kataifi were almost flavorless, and a white garlic sauce had a sharp, raw bite. Snails and strips of prosciutto strewn over buttered pappardelle never came together, and bull’s-eyes of pasta called corzetti stampati were dotted with beet greens and a walnut pesto that was sweet when it should have been savory. Other dishes were better, but the only complete successes were the warm herb fougasse, served on a hook like a Bavarian pretzel, and Ms. Isbell’s desserts — a rhubarb granita with salty candied pistachios, and a weird, inspired oat bavarois veined with chocolate ganache. Some of the food at Italienne made me want to dance on the table. Some of it made me want to hide under the table and wait for the lights to go out so I could leave without making eye contact. My three meals might have come from three different restaurants. I would settle for one where the ideas had been worked out. At the moment, that is the Taverna.

81,Pig Bleecker,★,2017-05-16,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/16/dining/pig-bleecker-review-greenwich-village.html,Greenwich Village,"Pig Bleecker takes the second half of its name from its Greenwich Village address and the first from Pig Beach, a beer garden and barbecue stand on the idyllic shores of the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn. The two places share a chef, several owners, some sauces and recipes, and a fondness for wood smoke. They have pigs in their names for a reason, but one appealing thing about Pig Bleecker is how often it gravitates toward cooking that has nothing to do with barbecued pork. One recent night, a length of striped bass was half-buried under charred green buds of romanesco broccoli, chopped smoked almonds — not the kind from a can — and spoonfuls of chopped fresh herbs in olive oil. The flavors were clean and strong, the approach direct and Italian. “I could see this at a Batali restaurant,” I wrote in my notes. I didn’t know yet that until about a year ago, the chef, Matt Abdoo, cooked at Mario Batali’s Del Posto. Pig Bleecker also has broiled oysters, meaty ones that slosh around in their shells with chile oil and melted garlic butter under a cap of flaky brown bread crumbs. Carbone, down the street, serves three styles of baked clams side by side, and I don’t think any of them outdoes these oysters. In another appetizer, chunks of cod cheeks are quickly fried with country ham that sizzles up as crisp as a potato chip. Both cod and ham are knocked around with chopped pickled peppers and their spicy vinegar. The menu calls this “Rhode Island style cod cheeks.” I grew up in Rhode Island and never saw cod cheeks in any form there. Things were simpler then. But I did see, and eat, fried squid tossed with pickled banana peppers. The last time I encountered it on a menu was at Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar in Times Square. I generally try not to think about what they did to it there, but I couldn’t help recalling it at Pig Bleecker, which gets closer to the taste of the original with fish cheeks than Guy’s did with actual squid. In fact, a lot of Mr. Abdoo’s menu successfully does what Guy’s claims and fails to do. It rounds up unfancy American dishes whose natural habitat is small taverns and bars and shacks on the state road just outside town. Utica greens, spicy chopped escarole baked under bread crumbs and Parmigiano-Reggiano, are terrific at Pig Bleecker. Mr. Abdoo’s affection for regional specialties is written all over the slate of sandwiches Pig Bleecker serves at lunch. Baltimore pit beef is represented, thinly shaved with charred edges and a horseradish sauce inside an onion roll. So is the New Orleans muffuletta. Cold cuts and smoked mozzarella are piled on a sesame hero roll instead of the customary miniature hubcap, and it’s arguably too sparing with the olive relish. So call it an Italian hero with olives; it’s still a great thing to eat for lunch. Is Pig Bleecker crazy for serving a pastrami sandwich within walking distance of Katz’s Delicatessen? Is the meat a little too lean? Does melting Gruyère on it make Mr. Abdoo a heretic? Yes to all of the above. On the other hand, his pastrami has an unusually fine flavor, shot through with a robust vein of smoke. Smoke runs through much of the cooking like a rhythm track. A thick-cut chop spends time in the smoker before it goes on the grill; served with battered onions and a peach glaze that’s spicy, tart and sweet, it’s one of the strongest main courses on the dinner menu. Pig Bleecker’s take on Buffalo wings involves not just smoking them but trimming the drumsticks into lollipops, leaving an exposed length of bone for a handle. They’re dressed in butter swirled with a reasonably spicy sauce of red Hatch peppers. You can find that sauce, or something like it, at Pig Beach, along with the Alabama white sauce that turns up as a dip for the celery sticks that come with Pig Bleecker’s wings. I must be a heretic, too, because I like the white sauce more than blue cheese dressing. The sauces Mr. Abdoo invented for Pig Beach are worth importing to Manhattan, especially a sweetened mustard number that does wonders for the pigs in blankets. The two restaurants strike different tones, though. At Pig Beach, dogs and children wander between the picnic tables, and orders are placed at a canopied bar and an outdoor barbecue counter that backs up against the Gowanus. (“No fishing,” the signs warn anyone who may have mistaken the canal for a body of water.) Pig Bleecker is more domesticated. There is one long communal table made from a single polished slab of wood in the center of the room. Around the wall is a banquette of leather the approximate color of the mustard sauce. Instead of paper towels and wet wipes in an American flag pouch, the tables are set with cloth napkins. The design is crisp and urbane, to the extent that those words can apply to a place with the head of a Texas longhorn mounted on the wall. I might give Pig Bleecker more than an enthusiastic single star if the cooking didn’t sometimes swing and miss. “Deviled steak and eggs” sounds more clever than the thing it describes, deviled eggs with beef tartare piled under the yolks. (At lunch, the eggs are more effectively paired with thin sheets of country ham.) The crudité platter is a gorgeous spread of raw and gently cooked vegetables, and a good buy at $13, but it deserves better than the generic cocktail-party dips. Oddly, given Mr. Abdoo’s time at Del Posto, pasta can be dull. Ravioli filled with juicy bundles of smoked and braised brisket could have used a real sauce instead of melted truffle butter with zigzags of reduced Barolo. Tossing house-made cavatelli with clams and ’nduja is a great idea, but I wanted more flavor from the clams and more spice from the ’nduja. There is also an Oreo cheesecake that proves not everything gets better when you stuff it into a Mason jar. More than making up for that, though, is the deliciously tart key lime pie with a crunchy nut crust. Then there is a peanut butter milkshake with hot fudge and a buckeye candy on top (creamy and smooth, like peanut ganache), and a hot fudge and brownie sundae. They’re both true to their ice cream parlor roots, and truly good.

82,Atoboy,★★,2017-05-09,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/dining/atoboy-review-korean-restaurant-nyc.html,NoMad,"When all of the little plates of pickles and vegetables and whatnot land on the table at the start of a Korean meal, it’s like winning a game show. They are called banchan, and they shower down out of nowhere, like balloons. Fermented daikon and wavy cabbage leaves, pink with chile paste. Pinwheels of soy-stained lotus root. Silvery, crunchy stir-fried anchovies no bigger than paper matches. If I’m in a restaurant, I pay close attention to these dishes. The better they are, the higher my hopes for the rest of the meal. They serve as a quick reminder from the outset of how varied Korean cuisine can be, how it can pack both nuance and power. And, of course, I like them because at most Korean restaurants they’re free. It was my strong feelings about banchan that made me suspicious when I first heard that a new restaurant called Atoboy had made them the foundation of its menu. What could this be but another ploy to charge us for something that used to come with the cost of the meal? We’ve lost the battle over bread. I was ready to draw a line in the sand over banchan. After three dinners at Atoboy (ah-TOE-boy) since last fall and one quick snack at the bar, I’m happy to admit that I was wrong. This is no scam. Junghyun Park, the chef, uses banchan as a starting point, then goes on to build smart, surprising dishes around it. Look at what he does with those pinwheels of lotus root, laying them over a bed of tofu in soft, tiny curds like ricotta. It’s a great dish, half crunchy and half creamy, both halves humming along under a dressing of chile oil and sesame oil. Fans of the barbecue at Kang Ho Dang Baekjeong will remember the pan of corn in melted cheese that sits at the edge of the domed grill and is basted by the hot drippings that slide down from the sizzling meat. Mr. Park has a wonderful take on this, using bacon for its fat and taleggio for its tang, mixing in the fermented soybean paste called doenjang to make everything more intense. When a bowl of it showed up, it got side-eyes at my table. Corn out of season? Nobody who tasted it stayed skeptical. Mr. Park, 32, was raised in Seoul. Bypassing culinary school, he went on a grand tour and learned to cook at restaurants in England and Australia. At the end, he returned to his hometown to work in the kitchen at Jungsik, a westernized Korean restaurant with global aspirations. When Jungsik set up an outpost in Lower Manhattan, Mr. Park was dispatched to serve as its chef de cuisine. Finally ready to go out on his own, he opened Atoboy on East 28th Street last summer with his wife, Ellia, a veteran of the dining rooms at Noreetuh and Maialino. She manages the restaurant. Like Jungsik, Atoboy favors the subtler end of the Korean flavor spectrum, but it avoids fussing and tweezing. Mr. Park’s novel and lovely sea bass tartare, under a shimmering pale-green layer of chopped kiwi, mint and fermented spring garlic, could easily slide onto the menu at Jungsik if he decked out the plate with some foofaraw. (I’m glad he doesn’t.) The low-key atmosphere that the Parks have set down, though, has little in common with the carpeted environs of Jungsik, which affects a formality so stiff around the spine that the servers might be wearing back braces. Atoboy is also a deliberate step away from the controlled chaos of the Korean restaurants a few blocks north on 32nd Street. Between its patched walls of raw concrete, simple wooden tables are arranged in two symmetrical rows with a narrow path to the kitchen down the middle. It looks like a downtown wine bar, and in fact wine is one of the chief attractions. The list is brief but manages to take you to places you wouldn’t expect to visit in a Korean restaurant. There’s a concentration of bottles from Nikolaihof, Gut Oggau and other fine Austrian producers; a small flock of Loire winemakers such as Olga Raffault; Champagnes from Charles Ellner and other independent labels; and some respected West Coast names like Pedroncelli and Dirty & Rowdy. Everything I’ve tried has cohabited amicably with Mr. Park’s food. Although all 18 dishes on the menu can be ordered on their own, servers suggest a $36 meal made of one from each of three categories — roughly, cold salads, warm appetizers and plates where seafood or meat do most of the work. They’re served more or less in that order but without pauses between the courses, and the plates pile up in the middle of the table. This makes it too easy for nuanced dishes, like fried and braised sunchokes with oyster mushrooms and oranges dressed in a creamy truffle emulsion, to get lost. The servers insist that everything is meant for sharing. Heard that one before? But some dishes, like the delicate egg custard in a smoky dashi with morels and soybeans, were worse for wear and tear after they were doled out to individual plates. It’s almost impossible to get worked up about any of this, though, because the $36 menu is such a fair deal, and because so many of the dishes work so well and do things you didn’t know Korean food could do. Mr. Park’s take on yuk hwe is memorable, the beef tartare cut into long skinny threads that are tossed with soy sauce, dotted with nettle cream and topped with what seem to be julienne potato chips. Braised mackerel, usually cooked in soy sauce, is simmered in a complex green-chile broth. Little drums of octopus leg, a dot of parsley oil in the center of each one, are ringed around a kind of hash of kimchi and chorizo — two things that were meant to be together, though I never would have guessed. After these shifting, swirling flavors, the desserts have a clarifying effect. The ginger panna cotta with pink grapefruit is just as refreshing as it sounds. There’s also one that uses sujeonggwa, the sweet cinnamon punch ladled out at the end of Korean meals. It’s frozen into a granita and then spooned over burrata, lychee yogurt and candied walnuts for a cheese course you won’t find anywhere but Atoboy.

83,Loring Place,★★,2017-05-02,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/02/dining/loring-place-review-greenwich-village.html,Greenwich Village,"ABC Kitchen signified a small turning point in the appetites of New Yorkers when it opened seven years ago. We had snuffled through much of the previous decade in search of pork shoulders, lamb belly, rib-eyes and marrow bones, and if we didn’t exactly wake up on the first day of 2010 doubled over with regret, some of us were starting to wonder why the bed smelled like bacon. Then that spring we got ABC Kitchen, with Dan Kluger in the kitchen, Jean-Georges Vongerichten whispering in his ear and a new way of filling our stomachs on the menu. Mr. Kluger wasn’t cooking health food, not with that mayo-spritzed cheeseburger. But a sizable chunk of the nearly 50 dishes were salads or saladlike constructions. Vegetables were everywhere, including on top of the whole-wheat pizzas. The plates jangled with flavor, and very little of it came from animal fat. We might have called the food “vegetable forward” if that term had been invented. When diners stood up at the end of the night, you could almost hear them sighing with relief that they’d had an entire meal in a hot downtown restaurant without eating lard. The two chefs teamed up again for ABC Cocina, which opened a new front on the culture wars by mashing peas into guacamole, before Mr. Kluger left Mr. Vongerichten’s synchronized-swimming team to splash around in a pool of his own. After two years of preparation, he opened Loring Place in December in an expansive space on West Eighth Street, where the shoe stores used to be. There’s a long and busy bar to the right of the entrance where the drinks list offers you very well-made classic cocktails as well as innovations that taste like classics in the making. On the left are two dining areas: one that sits on a platform in the window, and another, bigger one off the kitchen. Designed by Cycle Projects, the rooms are full of handsome expanses of white brick and stained walnut. Yes, these hard surfaces amplify the noise. Yes, they’re trying to fix it. Mr. Kluger has said in interviews that at Loring Place he is bringing back some of the tricks he picked up before he learned his ABC’s, while he was working under Floyd Cardoz and Tom Colicchio. That may be true of the recipes, but the template of the menu comes unmistakably from ABC Kitchen, all the way down to the whole-wheat pizzas. There are more salads at Loring Place, and the saladlike constructions are even more saladlike. At the end of winter, I loved the combination of crisp Bosc pears with soft roasted leeks over thick yogurt, and some sugar-glazed walnuts for ballast. A couple of weeks ago, with pollen in the air, I appreciated the arrival of sweet sugar snap peas, lightly charred and served with bright pink breakfast radishes and shreds of pecorino. In this herbivorous decade, Loring Place isn’t the only restaurant to try grinding flour from local grains, or the only one to get mixed results. The emmer crackers, armored with sunflower seeds, are terrific with a schmear of the excellent and lightly sweet hummus. So are the breakfast radishes lodged in the surface of the hummus. A friend who knows her grains looked dubious when I ordered the house-made whole-wheat spaghetti. I was skeptical, too. (It is almost never as good as it sounds.) Loring Place gets it right, though, and lets it be, tossing it with basil, chiles, grated cheese and some velvety leaves of spinach. The whole-wheat bread, on the other hand, isn’t quite at the point where Loring Place should be charging $6 for a loaf smaller than a football. The crust is impressively sturdy, but the interior is neither tender nor elastic — it’s dry and crumbly. I liked the whole-wheat pizza crust enough to wish it had been allowed to breathe a little more under a mass of shaved asparagus, maitake mushrooms, jalapeños and three kinds of cheese. But I have to admit I had a hard time keeping up my interest in the other pies at Loring Place once I’d eaten a square of what the menu calls “grandma-style pan pizza.” Like a less doughy Sicilian baked with canned tomatoes, not sauce, the grandma has been slowly expanding its range west of its traditional breeding grounds in Nassau County. The Loring Place grandma crust is thicker than in the archetypal versions, but flavorful, light and nongreasy. I hope Mr. Kluger has stocked up on pizza pans because he runs a serious risk of selling a grandma pie to every table in the restaurant. Its only close rival on the menu is the cheeseburger, which comes with bacon made on site, a likably combative pickled-pepper aioli and a cast-iron pan of thick-cut fries that seem to get crunchier as they got cooler, a neat feature. I don’t imagine Mr. Kluger wants us to think of Loring Place as a place for cheeseburgers and square pizza, but a lot of the other main courses aren’t as compelling for one reason or another. Halibut with a market’s worth of mixed mushrooms in miso and lemon juice was an ideal example of how to cook and serve fish, but I can’t say the same about the nondescript king salmon or the sea scallops in a sauce whose naked acidity was intensified by apples marinated in vinegar. Grilled chicken breast with carrot barbecue sauce sounded more exciting than it was; the sauce never kicked in hard enough to rouse the warm peas and rice that seemed to have settled down under the chicken for a long winter’s nap. As much as I want to take Loring Place on its own terms, the menu makes comparisons with ABC Kitchen inevitable, and Loring Place comes off as slightly less interesting. It’s not just that a lot of it feels familiar now; some of it is also unfocused and busy. The plates have more going on, but there’s not as much happening. To be fair, very few restaurants are as interesting as ABC Kitchen was when it opened, and there are solid reasons that reservations at Loring Place are hard to come by. They include the wine list, which packs a few nice surprises, not the least of which is the attention it pays to the $40 to $60 range. And they continue through the smartly nostalgic dessert menu. There’s a sly update on the Hostess CupCake, a tin of cookies, and a vanilla ice-cream sundae with pretzels, toffee and whatnot, modeled on the Dairy Queen Blizzard. O.K. It’s kind of like the sundae at ABC Kitchen. It’s still good.

84,Union Square Cafe,★★★,2017-04-25,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/dining/union-square-cafe-review.html,Gramercy Park,"Sitting at the upstairs bar, one of the best places to eat in the new Union Square Cafe, I listened in on a conversation the woman next to me was having with the bartender. In December, after a year out of operation, Danny Meyer’s first and most formative restaurant had been transferred from its original address on East 16th Street to the corner of Park Avenue South and East 19th. The woman had been transferred, too; a regular at the old location, she had some pointed questions about a certain item on the menu. “Is it the same?” she asked. “Exactly the same?” The bartender assured her that it was. “If we ever took it off the menu, we’d have a riot on our hands,” he said. The item in question was a salad of red-tipped oakleaf and Bibb lettuces, with some fresh and springy croutons and whitecaps of grated Gruyère on top. It is a very nice salad, a model of good behavior. It does not bring to mind images of mob violence. This is Union Square Cafe, though, a place that from the beginning has inspired attachments of a peculiar intensity. Other restaurants have customers; Union Square Cafe has fans, and knows it. Almost everything about the new place caters to their memories of the original, fetishizing the restaurant’s own idiosyncrasies to an amazing degree. It’s almost a museum to itself. If you’re not part of the fan base, you might feel a bit like somebody who goes to see “Rogue One” without ever having seen “Star Wars.” At the old location, I was more an admirer than a fan. I was never quite as amazed by the food as it seemed I was supposed to be. But then, fluctuation is normal in a long-running restaurant. Over the years, reviews of Union Square Cafe in The Times have ranged from two to three stars. In the most recent appraisal, in 2009, Frank Bruni awarded it two. The Rockwell Group, the architecture firm, was given the job of evoking the old address in a space that is much roomier, without the narrow passageways and sunken dining room. Some of this is done subliminally: Pendant lamps downstairs hang at the height of the 16th Street ceilings. I could swear the original downstairs bar was smaller, but that’s probably because I could almost never get a seat there. Mr. Rockwell swears that the new one is the same length: 27 feet 1 inch. The upstairs bar top where my cocktail rested was precisely the size of the old upstairs bar top because it was, in fact, the same piece of wood with a fresh coat of varnish. The art collection has come along for the ride, too, and one of the pleasures of the Rockwell layout is the way you seem to bump into a Frank Stella or a Claes Oldenburg or a Judy Rifka every time you turn around. The cellar stocks wines from Italy, France and the United States, and nowhere else. As Jason Wagner, the wine director, explained one night, those are the countries that were on the list when Union Square Cafe opened in 1985. The menu does not go so far as to point out all the old showstoppers — some from Michael Romano’s reign in the kitchen and others from that of the current chef, Carmen Quagliata — but the servers are happy to help. Do I even need to say this? It’s the most famous thing about Union Square Cafe: The servers are always happy to help. I hadn’t realized the salad was a cult object, but I did know about the gnocchi. In this case, I stand with the cult. They are not so much gnocchi as little cushions of ricotta that have been tricked into holding their cylindrical shape only for as long as it takes to move them from the plate to the mouth. Consider me a fanboy when it comes to the ideally crunchy fritto misto, and the polenta, too, a $13 bowl of warm fluff that has absorbed its weight, and then some, in milk and creamy young cow’s milk cheese. With maitake mushrooms and shiny green pesto, it’s so filling and likable that you could make a meal of it and walk away more content than if you’d had a 12-course tasting somewhere else. The risk in churning out old recipes like this is that the kitchen becomes bored, and the food boring. That’s not happening at Union Square Cafe right now; the cooks seem to have dialed right in on the qualities that made these dishes favorites in the first place. Union Square Cafe has always been the offspring of a mixed marriage between a trattoria and a bistro, with an American bar and grill somewhere in the family tree. In the current phenotype, the trattoria genes are dominant. There is a wonderfully tender and gentle rabbit sugo, tossed with bands of pappardelle. Mr. Quagliata’s pasta work can be just as satisfying when he carves out new traditions, tossing tubes of rigatoni with roasted carrots and sizzled scallions and chiles, then brightening the flavors with a spoonful of yogurt. A little less thrilling was a lasagna Bolognese that has been rotated off the menu for the time being; while the pasta sheets were as thin and light as any Italian could hope for, the flavors in the meat sauce weren’t as developed as they might have been. Though I split that lasagna with somebody else so we could have traditional appetizer-primi-secondi meals, the mains are so imposing that a simple two-course plan is the wiser path. I was nearly done in by a braised lamb shank, although the bright salsa verde helped spur me along. Even the choices that sound lighter, like red snapper sandwiched between a thatch of shaved puntarelle and a bed of chickpea purée, or a flattened half-chicken, with cumin and dried chiles embedded in its surface and slabs of white sweet potato peeking out from below, are best tackled with an undented appetite. After all: There will be dessert, and it will not be a minor event, especially if somebody at your table has strong memories of the panna cotta (beautiful; the pastry chef, Daniel Alvarez, surrounds it with citrus segments and granola), or the pumpkin bread pudding (more bread than pudding when I last saw it), or the fantastic tart topped with a caramelized puff of banana so soft it seems to have blown apart. Sometimes Union Square Cafe’s eagerness to please has something close to the opposite effect. When a server suggested with wide-eyed eagerness that I might like “a very cold glass of milk” with the espresso-chocolate cake, chills went down my spine, and not chills of anticipation. The last time I drank milk with a meal, I was wearing footed pajamas. Then I’d remember how happy the service had made one of my guests, who had shown up before me, but still about 30 seconds too late to grab a seat at the downstairs bar. She spun around in agitation for a moment, but a manager spotted her and offered to call upstairs to see if there were any open bar stools there. This empathic attunement to disturbances in the Force defines the Meyer brand of hospitality. While it flows through all his restaurants, it functions in its purest and most effective form at Union Square Cafe. The restaurant is far too nice to be polarizing, but it won’t be everybody’s cold glass of milk. Diners from the Instagram generation might want more crunch, more adventure or more spontaneity. I hope that as it settles into its new home, it gets a little less self-referential. But even now, it has a combination of energy and well-honed familiarity that’s rare in Manhattan. It’s rare anywhere, and it lifts this restaurant above fashion, to a plateau that it occupies all by itself.

85,Torishin,★★★,2017-04-11,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/dining/torishin-review-japanese-yakitori.html,Clinton,"Consider the chicken. Consider each part of the chicken. Consider eating each part of the chicken, one after another, grilled over charcoal at a yakitori restaurant called Torishin. Dark neck meat first, gathered in a ruffle around a bamboo skewer. When stuck to its long root of bone, the neck is picky business to eat, but it is full of flavor when it is pared away and the outer bits are singed over charcoal and the fat starts to spill over the rest. Now the tenderloin. Many tenderloins come to an ignominious end as “tenders,” encased in bread crumbs in the ketchup-smeared fingers of a toddler. But grilled lightly, so they firm up without scorching, they run with delicate pink juices. Livers, of course, are seared very fast so they don’t get leathery. The rich, red insides are as soft as yogurt. They take well to a few grains of ground sansho pepper, enough to spark a slow buzz on the tongue. So do the hearts, done medium-rare, like steak. On the bird’s back, above the tail feathers, are the oysters. At Torishin they go under their French name, sot-l’y-laisse — “a fool leaves it.” They are grilled with their skin, which puckers and hisses and goes from creamy blue to gold. For all I know the first yakitori chefs in Japan had nothing but efficiency in mind when they speared each anatomical bit on its own skewer. Fast-cooking livers can be pulled from the grill to make space, while other pieces take their time. In the hands of the attentive chefs at Torishin, this technique produces something beyond convenience. Cooked separately, each part has a different pleasure to offer. Some you chew, and some you crackle. Some have cerebral appeal, others call to instinct. The house style is sensitive to timing, averse to charring and careful with seasoning. The chicken is salted, brushed with a sauce called tare, which is less sweet at Torishin than at some other yakitori specialists, and grilled about an inch above long-burning sticks of binchotan, a Japanese charcoal. The cooks wave bamboo fans at the fire when it needs a boost. Sitting on the tables and counters are vaguely humanoid gourds filled with sansho and the spice blend shichimi, as well as pitchers of soy sauce. “Which skewers are good with soy?” I asked Atsushi Kono, the chef, one night when he was tending the coals. His head bobbed noncommittally before he said, “It’s there for people who think they want it.” Right, then. No soy. With minimalist cooking, the distance between dull and delicious can sometimes be measured in grains of salt. This became clear during my only meal at Torishin’s original location, on First Avenue in the 60s. There were many skewers. None of them seemed to have been seasoned. Even the pickled cucumbers and daikon that showed up at the start of the meal seemed to be under orders not to draw any attention to themselves. I knew that some people revered the restaurant, so I just figured that it fell into one of my blind spots. When Torishin moved to its current address in Hell’s Kitchen in 2015, I did not exactly rush over on my hoverboard. In fact, I didn’t make it there until last fall, a delay I regretted as soon as I had unskewered my first lump of chicken. Whatever had been missing from the chicken before was there, and it’s been there each time I’ve gone back. (I still think the pickles need more pep, though.) To the left as you enter is a small bar. The bartenders spend the quiet hours whittling big ice cubes into spheres, with knives. These rough globes are plopped into tumblers of shochu, and if you want to learn about this distilled spirit, Torishin is a fine place to start. The sake list is compact but varied. The few wines come from big, obvious names. At the end of a winding corridor is a split-level dining room. The mezzanine might be the spot for privacy. The lower space is more active, with seating at tables or around a U-shaped counter that hugs the open kitchen and a grill, the depth of a single skewer. If you know your favorite bird bits, ordering à la carte is simple enough. The menu is helpfully illustrated, from neck to tail. All but one of the skewers is under $10, and the package of seven chicken skewers plus three vegetables is a good deal at $65. But Torishin always puts me in the mood for surprises, so I like to ask for an omakase menu. The grill cooks serve up a mix of vegetables (the mushrooms are a particular treat, and I don’t think it’s possible to grill zucchini better than Torishin does); white meat (the piece wrapped in a shiso leaf and dabbed with salty plum paste is a nearly perfect bite); dark meat (chicken legs can be subdivided in more ways than you might think); and curiosities called “special skewers.” This is where you will find the oysters, the kidneys, the nugget of meat from the base of the wing, the wrinkly and fatty neck skin, the smooth and supple belly skin. Most of the surprises have been positive, like “knee gristle.” What about “main artery”? The nicest thing I can honestly say about this blood vessel, which ties the heart to some other vital organ, is that it is, in fact, edible. If hunger still calls after you have stripped all the bamboo sticks and left them standing in the ceramic cup in front of you, there is an excellent remedy in the form of oyako-don. A homey dish of chicken and egg over white rice, oyako-don can be filling or it can be almost ethereal, as it is at Torishin. To one side of the passage from bar to dining room is a narrow nook behind curtains. Inside is an eight-seat bar, called the Select Counter, where Mr. Kono presides over extended menus that borrow from the kaiseki tradition. One recent meal began with a tiny simmered octopus with peppery sansho leaves. Sashimi followed. Chicken breast was steamed in cherry leaves and served with cucumber wheels and fresh shoots of spring ginger; the flavor was lovely and transient, one of those Japanese miracles of putting the mood of a season on the plate. The $150 menu came with a complete fusillade of skewers as well as a choice of grilled luxury items: either Kumamoto beef (not as meltingly rich as it could have been) or king crab leg (smeared with some funky stuff from inside the crab’s head, and completely delicious). If Mr. Kono had kept cooking all night, I would have been happy, but to experience Torishin you don’t need to spend $150 and a couple of hours. Just a few skewers are enough to expand your sense of what’s possible in the department of chicken.

86,Babbo,★★,2017-04-04,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/dining/babbo-review-pete-wells.html,Greenwich Village,"When the waiter asked if we wanted the last roasted goat’s head, I didn’t think it was a big deal. It was just another night at Babbo. This was around 1999, a year after it had opened, when Babbo had few peers among Italian restaurants, serving unusual meats with a side of light decadence. In this classically simple Greenwich Village townhouse, an energetic and pleasure-seeking chef named Mario Batali wanted New Yorkers to try something new: a salad of truffled lamb’s tongue; melting pink windowpanes of head cheese; triangles of beef-cheek-filled pasta in a sauce thickened by crushed squab livers. The strategy was to tempt us and dare us at the same time. Back then, Babbo funneled you toward giving up all restraint, right down to the wine pours, which were sold by thirds of a bottle instead of fifths. So when the chance to eat a goat’s head was dangled before me, I saw it as the natural outgrowth of an entire philosophy of eating and drinking that I wanted to adopt as my own, at least for as long as it took to find out which parts of the face were good to eat (the sides) and which weren’t (the eyes). Mr. Batali and his business partner, Joe Bastianich, now own about two dozen restaurants in the United States and Asia. Babbo remains the empire’s spiritual home, where the original formula of adventure and pleasure and curious-minded indulgence is still intact, where you can still try recipes that sprang from Mr. Batali’s forehead when he was only a minor celebrity. Now that he’s superfamous, Mr. Batali could probably pump up the prices at Babbo. He hasn’t. That’s one reason Babbo is still one of New York’s essential restaurants. But it isn’t quite the same restaurant. The cooking doesn’t always have the old finesse and bravado that my colleague Frank Bruni found when he  gave the restaurant three stars in 2004, when it was last reviewed in The Times. The service, meanwhile, can go in and out of focus more than it used to. From the restaurant’s beginning, overbooking has been an issue. Even now, when reservations are not as much in demand, the bar is often crowded with people waiting to be seated. This narrow area is less a waiting room than an exercise studio. One recent night, three guests and I ducked and bobbed and turned every minute or so as somebody tried to squeeze through with a hot plate of food, or an empty chair, or an armful of coats. This lasted 30 minutes. We never got an apology, but we did get to work on our balance and core strength. What bothered me more than not hearing “I’m sorry” was that nobody acted as though half an hour was an unusually long time to keep customers waiting. At the table, the style of service I got seemed to depend on whether I was there for the first or second seating. An early-evening dinner rolled along like a skateboard on new concrete, and the check came with the coffee. A meal that began after 8 p.m. was slow, even draggy, and at times it seemed we had dropped out of sight. Our sommelier was smart and engaging as he talked about a Sardinian red we were curious about (as ever, the all-Italian wine list is a mix of blue chips and underrated discoveries), but after decanting it, he was nowhere to be seen and our glasses stood empty. On another night, four people ordered appetizers, but only three of us got them. Mr. Batali discusses changes to the menu every week with Frank Langello, Babbo’s executive chef since 2003. Mr. Langello’s kitchen is run by professionals who seem to know by instinct when to take meat off the flame; even tricky ingredients like rabbit were faultlessly done. Given how many classic dishes are on the menu, the cooks could probably make half of them with their eyes closed. Sometimes you wonder if they do. I suspected that the salt had been left out of the soupy polenta served under Babbo’s long-running (and still terrific) beef braised in red wine, the brasato al Barolo. A salad of lamb’s tongue and browned beech mushrooms topped with a soft-cooked egg was nice. But the salad was warm and the egg was cold, so it was not as nice as it could have been. I felt the same way about a grilled guinea hen leg; it would have been easier to love if the skin hadn’t been rubbery and damp. And a banana crostata could have been exceptional if its crust hadn’t been soft and its flavors melded together, as if it had been made too early in the day. These glitches were far from catastrophic, but they were frustrating because I could usually imagine, or remember, just how good the dish was supposed to be. And with some recipes, there was no need to imagine. Babbo’s pasta station can still turn out the hit singles with plenty of the old shimmy-shimmy-shake, like the beef-cheek ravioli or the “mint love letters,” parcels of minty lamb sausage under a bright tomato sauce. Some of Babbo’s most exciting pastas stand on more delicate flavors. Goat cheese tortelloni, like little folded paper hats, were slithery with warm butter that was seasoned by dried orange peel and fennel pollen: lovely and transporting. And when the calendar said spring was here, the kitchen was ready with asparagus tossed with tender, slick fettuccine and brittle crinkles of sautéed pancetta. Rebecca DeAngelis’s desserts are memorable, too; that glum banana crostata was an outlier. The saffron panna cotta is seductively musky, its perfume offset by dried apricots soaked in passion fruit purée. And the friends with whom I shared the olive oil cake — a simple drum with a crisp top and a tender middle, splashed with a bright-green squiggle of peppery olive oil — still text me about once a day to ask if I remember how wonderful it was. I do. To say that Babbo’s long suits are its pasta and desserts is just to praise those courses, not to diminish the others. Antipasti, like the steamed mussels poured with their garlic-laden juices over thick toast, or the octopus and just-tender borlotti beans in a fantastic, citrus-packed, lightly spicy limoncello vinaigrette, manage to be very active without seeming frantic. Mr. Batali and Mr. Langello work hard to chase boredom away, but they know when to stop, and you can see that in such main courses as the pork chop, so plump it could pass for a baby ham, with cherry peppers, or the lamb chops you could pick up by the bone if you didn’t mind getting broccoli rabe pesto on your fingers. Still, I keep thinking about goat’s head. In those early days, I knew Babbo could ace the weird stuff. I’m not sure I trust the restaurant the same way today. Then again, I’m not sure I want another goat’s head, either. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.",Adventure (Try a Goat’s Head?)

87,Augustine,★,2017-03-28,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/28/dining/augustine-review-french-food-nyc-keith-mcnally.html,Financial District,"Keith McNally switched on the lights of his latest restaurant, Augustine, on the first day of November. New McNally projects always incite anticipation but not a great deal of suspense. Certain things are known before the first oyster is popped open. One of those things is the presence of oysters. Veteran McNally watchers will nod as they take in the recurring characters: the tag team of Shane McBride and Daniel Parilla, who also oversee Cherche Midi, is in the kitchen, and the dining room is patrolled by a crack squad deployed like Navy SEALs for the early days of each new campaign. Seasoned observers will scan Augustine’s dining room, inside the Beekman hotel in the financial district, for proof that every inch was obsessed over, down to the new paint that appears to have been on site for a hundred years before the smoking ban. They will notice the accustomed stemware, sturdy and utilitarian, for wines that run the gamut from very good to good enough. They will take it all in, the distinctive blend of the louche and the meticulous, and say to themselves, Mr. McNally has done it again. What he has done again is to borrow the tricks of successful genre fiction. As with a new Patricia Cornwell novel, everybody knows the template but shows up to see what’s different and what’s the same this time around. There have to be some fresh elements, or else why bother? But they have to be applied in ways that don’t change how the engine functions. This means avoiding self-consciously arty cooking — “cuisine” — at all costs. In a genre exercise, the addition of art just gums up the pistons. If the machinery in a McNally restaurant slows down too much, people may start to notice that his template foregrounds his habitual strengths while sweeping weaknesses, such as the occasional spottiness of Augustine’s food, into the shadows. By unanimous consent, atmosphere is Mr. McNally’s great, almost unrivaled strength. Just as the James Bond movies move from one location to another, all of which feel exactly like Bond movie locations, Mr. McNally’s dining rooms are all different and yet somehow the same. He excels at building rooms that evoke vintage Paris — not exactly the real Paris, but the city the way you remember it a year after taking a vacation there. Augustine has the prettiest, giddiest interior he’s ever done. It’s a space that makes you feel, as Holly Golightly put it, as if nothing very bad could happen to you there. Painted glazed tiles are set so that vines and stalks of flowers — tiger lilies, chrysanthemums, peonies, poppies — seem to climb the walls; more tiles place pink and white cockatoos up in the crown molding. It’s like a garden out of Fragonard, and while the 21st-century customers don’t quite look like French aristocrats, at least their hard modern edges will be blurred away by an impossibly warm honey-colored light. Augustine’s Parisian flashback mood is so successful that it doesn’t matter whether the food resembles anything you might eat in Paris itself. Beef, which can be hit or miss in France, is one of the most reliable choices on a McNally menu. At Augustine, there is a lot of it. Grilled steaks get their own menu heading — grillades. One of them is a filet mignon au poivre, but even my T-bone was sheathed in cracked peppercorns. The meat had the density and force imparted by dry aging, and was tender without being floppy. The obligatory steak frites has been exiled to the entree section. It is agreeably muscular and chewy, and served with amber-gold fries that are a perfect illustration of what may be the McNally Doctrine: Restaurants don’t need to do new things if they do the old things right. The leg of lamb has not been reinvented. Having spun on a rotisserie under a coat of herbs, it is carved off in long strips, like shawarma, and draped over very soft flageolets. A cheese soufflé appetizer recalls the warm pot de fromage at Cherche Midi; it’s delicious, even if it is breadier than a classic soufflé, more like a Gruyère-and-Parmesan popover. On Mondays, you can get a bowl of fine, fattish mussels in coconut milk with lemongrass, like a tribute to Jean-Georges Vongerichten in the Vong era. At lunch, there is a lobster roll that Mr. McBride and Mr. Parilla have the good sense to serve warm, dressed just with lemon and melted butter, the way you’d eat it on the Connecticut coast. At lunch or at dinner, somebody will be eating a burger, a richly dripping hulk of meat under melted Comté and onions cooked with Scotch. It shows up at the table with a shot of bourbon. The Scotch does more for the onions than the bourbon does for the burger. On the other hand, a shot of bourbon is just as welcome with a burger as it would be with any number of other purchases — haircuts, MetroCards, the morning paper. When invention does rear its head, the results are not always spectacular. What dark urge led the chefs to foie gras Augustine, thin slices of foie gras terrine scattered with chopped green beans and artichokes barigoule? And is there a way to get it de-Augustined? The steak tartare has been chopped to a pulp and then sent to Japan, with flakes of nori and a dose of yuzukosho that overpowered the meat on the day I had it. And while prunes are wonderful soaked in Armagnac, it turns out that when they are also incorporated into the pastry cream of a mille-feuille, they just muddy up the production. This was the only squishy spot on the dessert menu, though. Darkly caramelized apples, wound in a spiral and set on a crumbly hazelnut crust, make up the excellent tarte Tatin. Baba au rhum can be a fire-breathing beast, but the one at Augustine, soaked in an orange-scented syrup before it’s showered with rum, is sweet and gentle. As with any good genre piece, some details have been changed, but the formula remains intact; things fall into place, and yet nobody appears to have been trying too hard. That’s another advantage of conspicuously avoiding serious cuisine: If anybody points out an imperfection, you can say, “Look, it’s just dinner.” This is not the worst philosophy for a restaurant.","We’ll Always Have Paris, at Augustine","['keith', 'mcnally', 'switched', 'light', 'latest', 'augustine', 'november', 'mcnally', 'project', 'always', 'incite', 'anticipation', 'great',

88,Sugarfish by Sushi Nozawa,0 star,2017-03-21,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/21/dining/sugarfish-by-sushi-nozawa-review.html,Flatiron,"Like many habits, the pursuit of good sushi can get expensive. At the extreme end, the cost includes airfare to Tokyo and bribes to hotel concierges. Even for New Yorkers who stick close to home, the price of keeping up to date on sushi is high and climbing. Well-financed sushi nuts have already had the $145 omakase and been served on both sides of the counter by the profoundly courtly employees of Kosaka; tried Sushi Zo’s $200 omakase, the rice almost invisible under very long and very soft and unadorned ribbons of fish; sat down to Ichimura’s $300 sonata of fish cured and seasoned in an emphatic style that descends from the days before refrigeration; and handed over as much as $400 to  Sushi Ginza Onodera for nigiri and other dishes that are as minutely detailed as the interior is soaringly grand. For sushi chasers whose bank accounts are not self-replenishing, this all gets kind of depressing. Or consider the novice fan, who has begun to realize that there are realms of pleasure out there beyond tuna rolls from Duane Reade. What’s next? Sugarfish by Sushi Nozawa would like to be the answer. It’s not, but enough people believe it is, or want to believe, that getting inside this four-month-old restaurant on East 20th Street can be a test of patience. Sugarfish arrived with an out-of-town pedigree. Its branches around Los Angeles have an ardent following, and one of the chain’s founders, Kazunori Nozawa, was among the first sushi chefs to bring to that city a rigorously autocratic style. Specializing in omakase, he was known to yell at those foolish enough to stir wasabi into their soy sauce. Nobody yelled at me at Sugarfish, but the staff didn’t seem all that eager to feed me, either. I made my first assault on the host stand just after 6:30 one weeknight. (The place doesn’t do reservations.) I was alone and willing to wait even if it took until closing time — 11 that night. What an optimist I was in those days. “We’re not taking any more names tonight,” a host announced. Later, I learned to stage my raids between 2 and 4 in the afternoon, not hours when I typically crave raw fish. One lucky day, I was in within 30 minutes and out before sunset. One can order sushi by the piece, but the servers and the printed menu heavily push the three “Trust Me” meals. This is a variant on omakase, which roughly means “I trust the chef,” but a Trust Me is not an omakase meal. It is, essentially, a set menu served in waves. All three start with chilled edamame and slices of tuna in ponzu, move on to several small courses of nigiri and end with a hand roll or two. The simplest, Trust Me Lite, is $27 and includes four pieces of nigiri; the most expensive is the Nozawa Trust Me, with 12 pieces of sushi and two hand rolls at a price of $51. Each course zooms out of a window in the kitchen where sushi is made with unusual speed. Efficiency lets Sugarfish keep prices low, the volume high and the rice warm — a hallmark of what the critic Jonathan Gold has termed the School of Nozawa. The rice is not only warm. It’s seasoned with so much vinegar that it’s almost pickled. This makes it appealingly energetic, a quality that sets it apart from the rest of the food. The fish is uniformly soft and pretty, but none of it tastes much like fish. Sweet shrimp and sea scallops were both exactly as they should be. But there was no heft to the tuna, no depth to the salmon, and anybody who happens to like shiny-skinned, fishy-tasting species like mackerel or sardines is in the wrong restaurant. The menu and website make much of Mr. Nozawa’s connections among elite fishmongers, but the selection at Sugarfish rarely rises above entry level. The menu lists certain specials “when available.” Sea urchin is one; the last time I went, there wasn’t any. This has to be the only sushi restaurant in New York that can’t get its hands on sea urchin. Fresh wasabi may be too much to ask at Sugarfish’s prices, but there is no wasabi at all under the fish. This is weird. Where sushi is concerned, wasabi isn’t just a condiment. It’s the air in the tires.

89,Franklin Barbecue,★★,2017-03-14,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/dining/franklin-barbecue-review.html,"Austin, Tex.","AUSTIN, Tex. — “How much brisket are you having?” That’s the first question the man with the knife behind the counter will ask when you reach the front of the line at Franklin Barbecue. He won’t stab you if you don’t have an answer ready, but I might. By that point, you or another person who is either being paid by you or who just likes you very much will have been waiting outside for two hours or more — sometimes a lot more. The line starts earlier and grows faster on weekends and during South by Southwest, the festival of music, film and technology that metastasizes here each March and runs, this year, through Sunday. Nobody reaches the front of the line accidentally. If you haven’t managed to work out how much brisket to buy when you get there, you are beyond my help. I won’t blame you, though, if you double your order after the man with the knife cuts off a little block of meat and hands it to you. Look at it, the way it shades from nut-brown at the inside to cherry-jam around the border to black at the crust, stained by carbon and stubbled with coarse pepper. Smell it while the steam is still carrying the smell of burning post oak. Taste it, the way it combines the fat-bathed richness of fresh beef with the tight focus of meat cured by salt and smoke. Still want just half a pound? Other considerations come into play, like the elasticity of your stomach and your taste for pork, smoked sausage and turkey. But brisket is the foundation on which Franklin Barbecue was built, brisket as it is seasoned and barbecued by Aaron Franklin, the chief pitmaster and an owner. Mr. Franklin is a gearhead and a MacGyver with obsessive tendencies. Men like him were building hot rods in the 1960s and six-chambered bongs in the ’70s. In the 2000s, Mr. Franklin was designing and welding offset smokers and firing them up for loosely organized backyard cookouts. He writes in his book, “Franklin Barbecue: A Meat-Smoking Manifesto,” that his first brisket was “flavorless — tough and dry.” He got better. By 2009, when he began selling meat from a white-and-aqua-blue 1971 Aristocrat Lo-Liner trailer he’d bought for $300, he had moved far upscale from the cheap supermarket brisket of his first experiments. And when he moved to an actual structure, painted to look like an overgrown version of that trailer, his brisket was already famous. He had studied the physics of chimney draw and the maddeningly long time during which barbecue appears to have stopped cooking long before it’s done, known in the trade as “the stall.” He has to be the first pitmaster in Texas history whose cookbook has a list of recommended books that is devoted entirely to the food-science writers Harold McGee and Nathan Myhrvold. What Mr. Franklin had stumbled across in his backyard was a craft in which, for both the maker and the consumer, the financial barrier to entry was low and the opportunity for connoisseurship was ample. These are the two chief prerequisites of any successful hipster food business, and Franklin Barbecue set off a new-traditionalist barbecue movement across the country. One of Mr. Franklin’s apostasies from old-school central Texas barbecue technique is wrapping meat midway through smoking to keep it from drying out. All his products are noticeably juicy; the turkey is helped by a quick dip in a pan of butter and juices. He swaddles brisket in butcher paper, which lets some steam out. Other meats are sealed inside aluminum foil. I wondered if this was the reason the marbling inside the brisket was more appetizing than the fat on the pork ribs and pulled pork, which could be a little wet and squishy. Much of the fat simply yields a glossy liquid that makes a delicious sauce for the lightly smoky pulled pork. The smoke works its way more thoroughly into the ribs, which become a firm and chewy pig candy, and into the sausages. Franklin Barbecue isn’t famous for its sausages, which are custom-made by a nearby butcher. They are glorious, though, loaded with pepper and garlic and enough beef fat to make the wrinkled surface of the casings sparkle. Within the next few days, they will be ground and stuffed on site. As for the turkey, it is so mild that it will probably be of surpassing interest only to those who don’t eat beef or pork who’ve been dragged along by brisket-crazed friends. Vegetarians may find some comfort in the fine vinegared slaw of purple cabbage or the potato salad, made in the creamy style that I hope to find at every picnic. They will run from the pinto beans, which are supplemented by odds and ends of meat scraped from the butcher block. Near the cash register are palm-size pies wrapped in plastic, with old-fashioned crusts. Lemon chess pie had a citrus tartness that the Key lime pie was missing, and I admired the way the bourbon-banana pie compressed childhood and adulthood in a single dessert. And so, you ask: Is it worth the wait? The answer, like many things in life, depends on what else you could be doing with your time. I would note that in the hours required to line up and sit down at Franklin Barbecue, I could have driven 35 miles northeast to Louie Mueller Barbecue in Taylor, ordered the magnificent beef rib (which Franklin sells only on Saturdays), and eaten it until I couldn’t hold any more. But I’d also note that I would not trade Franklin’s brisket for Mueller’s. I doubt I’d trade Franklin’s brisket for anybody’s, although for other meats, and certainly for turkey, I may give a slight edge to Killen’s Barbecue in Pearland. Finally, I’d point out that the line at Mr. Franklin’s restaurant is not Mr. Franklin’s fault, except insofar as he is responsible for cooking meat that people sacrifice entire mornings for. The line is a function of popularity and the way Texas barbecue is sliced (on the spot) and sold (by weight). Franklin Barbecue also goes out of its way to offer customers standing outside what you might call palliative care. A dozen or so folding chairs are kept in a corral under the stairs for early birds. Although the main entrance is locked until 10:59 a.m., another door is opened so the faithful can use the restrooms or buy drinks. An employee will walk down the line several times in the morning, selling canned beer from a cooler (Franklin stocks beers from some of the city’s best breweries) and trying to estimate when the meats will run out. This is an imprecise science, involving people’s best guesses for what they’ll order when they get inside. On my first visit, I was right in the middle of the parking lot, and was told there was a chance I’d miss out on pulled pork. That was incorrect, I’m happy to say. Though inexact, Franklin’s estimates can fend off the kind of disappointment I felt at La Barbecue, a highly regarded local truck where I spent more than an hour one afternoon and where everything but chopped beef was gone by the time I’d inchwormed to the front of the line. Franklin Barbecue doesn’t have to be so humane. Employees could probably stand on the roof pouring hot lard over customers’ heads without driving too many people away.

90,Sahib,★★,2017-02-21,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/dining/sahib-review-indian-restaurant-nyc.html,Kips Bay,"Anybody who tries to tell you that the place to go for Indian food is Jackson Heights, Queens, hasn’t been there in a long time. Beyond question, Jackson Heights is the first stop for anyone seeking an education in the Tibetan syllabus: momos filled with brothy beef under their bellybutton pleats; laphing, noodles neatly rolled and sliced like strudel and set loose in a puddle of chile oil; steaming, salty, bracing cups of yak butter tea. Most of the neighborhood’s places for samosas and naan, though, either are gone or have faded into insignificance. You less often meet somebody who sends you to Curry Hill for the cooking of India. But it’s the correct answer. Once known mainly for cheap buffet lunches (Haandi, long the reigning champion of the steam table, is still one of Manhattan’s unnatural wonders), Lexington Avenue in the upper 20s has over the past few years become home to the most diverse and concentrated hub of Indian restaurants in New York City. A disproportionate amount of this diversity is the work of two veteran chefs and restaurateurs. Shiva Natarajan opened one Curry Hill restaurant that paid tribute to Kolkata, particularly its Jewish cuisine; another that showcased food from India’s southwest coast; a third that brought together dishes from the cities of Lucknow and Hyderabad; and a fourth that specialized in the Punjab. He sold all four to Hemant Mathur two years ago. Together they started working on a fifth, Sahib. It opened in the fall. More than those other restaurants, one of which has closed, Sahib darts around India. Mr. Natarajan, who worked as the consulting chef, organized the menu around dishes he has been gathering in India while researching a cookbook. He isn’t trying to be encyclopedic, and the menu reflects that; it pays a little bit of attention to several regions and ignores others entirely. This makes it hard to get a firm sense of any one regional style, but easy to enjoy several dishes you may have never seen before. This may even be true for Indians. Goans might not recognize Sahib’s wonderful blend of fried eggplant stirred into a smoky mash of eggplant that has been softened in a tandoor; the dish, only casually spiced, comes from the northern city of Varanasi, on the Ganges. Potatoes are stewed all over India, but Sahib’s dum olav may be new to those who aren’t from Kashmir. Little round potatoes are stabbed with a toothpick first so they will pick up more of the sauce they’re cooked in: yogurt seasoned with tamarind, cardamom and Kashmiri chiles. The sauce wins its arguments through persuasion rather than force, in part because it has no tomatoes or onions. To see what a difference leaving them out can make, try the rogan josh. If you’ve had this Kashmiri lamb dish at other local Indian restaurants, you probably think of rogan josh as a bulldozer of a dish, more powerful than graceful. Chances are onions and tomatoes were the ground floor on which the thick brown gravy was built. At Sahib, the sauce is creamier and gentle enough that the taste of saffron doesn’t get lost, and I found myself really paying attention to the flavors — a new experience when it comes to rogan josh. If the lamb in both that dish and another I tried was very slightly more chewy than my ideal, it’s also true that the goat never let me down. In the marchwagan korma, a curry from Kashmir, goat was cooked on the bones in a rich and intensely aromatic yogurt sauce. Nothing I had at Sahib was noisily spicy, but the Kashmiri chiles in this korma made themselves heard. From the city of Mangalore on the Arabian Sea comes kori gassi, a very mild and irresistible chicken stew; coriander, asafetida and curry leaves season the coconut milk. The recipe for Mr. Natarajan’s chicken biryani comes from Lucknow. Made with both yogurt and milk, cooked in a pot sealed with a leaf of pastry, it’s his favorite version of this rice dish, he says. It may be mine, too. Kolkata is the source of the batter-fried cauliflower coated in red chile sauce, called lasoni gobi. An example of what happened to Chinese food after it spent a few years in India, lasoni gobi is fun when it’s spicy, and dreary when it’s not. I’ve had it both ways at Sahib. The “chicken 65,” a dish that is much loved on the streets of Chennai, was a little dull here, too. Basic staples, though, were unusually good: fragrant lemon rice; thair pachadi, a South Indian raita with mustard seeds and okra; and the dal of black lentils with an uncommonly fresh taste (from ginger, green chiles and cilantro) under the cream and butter. Mr. Mathur is both the chef and the owner. He is probably best known for Tulsi, in Midtown, although some New Yorkers still fall into twitchy daydreams at the memory of his menu at Devi. Like those places, and like the restaurants Mr. Natarajan sold to Mr. Mathur, Sahib walks a middle ground between high-gloss operations like Junoon or Indian Accent and the places in the East Village that spent their entire decorating budget on Christmas lights. Sahib’s appearance is restrained, with a lot of whitewashed and weathered planks of wood; it looks like some of the nicer beach rentals on VRBO. Service, while overeager at times, avoids both the harried anxiety of cheaper Indian restaurants and the ceremonious pretension of more expensive ones. There is no wine or beer yet, but the waiters always offered to open any bottles we had brought. I stuck with tea or the fine mango lassi, a little tart and very slightly salty. More than once when I tried to skip dessert, the servers talked me into gulab jamun, warm globes of cheese and milk dripping with a rose-scented syrup. I’d always protest and I’d always surrender, and I was always glad I did.","Sahib, in Curry Hill, Lets You Eat All Over India","['anybody', 'try', 'tell', 'place', 'indian', 'jackson', 'height',

91,Chinese Tuxedo,★★,2017-02-14,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/dining/chinese-tuxedo-restaurant-review.html,Chinatown,"The bend halfway down Doyers Street in Chinatown used to see more killings than any other stretch of road in the country. The Bloody Angle is safe now, but not quiet. The gangs there have been replaced by packs of roaming young people who come for siu mai and har gow at Nom Wah Tea Parlor, or underground mezcal at Pulqueria, or archival cocktails at Apotheke. And, for the last few months, they’ve been filing through the door under the long vertical neon sign that reads TUXEDO. Once inside this restaurant, whose full name is Chinese Tuxedo, you run into gridlock at the dark and crowded bar. A couple of besieged hosts try, without noticeable success, to control the flow of customers and winter coats moving in both directions along a narrow passageway. It’s chaotic and claustrophobic, and you may feel a strong urge to go back outside. Keep going. At the end of the bar, the vista suddenly opens out, as if you had come out of a tunnel into daylight. You are standing at the top of a staircase that descends into a sunken dining room filled with round tables of bright white marble. Fluted columns of cast iron rise 15 feet to the ceiling. The walls look like an archaeological dig in progress, stripped back to old layers of paint and plaster. Curved black banquettes hug the perimeter, with tropical plants sprouting up behind them. The room has a vintage air and a gleam of drama, which is appropriate enough because it was once a Chinese theater, the first on the East Coast. During the Tong Wars of the early 20th century, the theater was neutral territory, where Hip Sings and Un Leongs sat separately but peaceably, until the day in 1905 when Hip Sing gunmen set off firecrackers during a performance and then opened fire on their rivals. The Chinese Theater Massacre isn’t necessarily the piece of local history that Chinese Tuxedo wants to evoke. It takes its name from another turn-of-the-century establishment on Doyers Street, an ornate restaurant where a traditional carved second-story balcony crested with a larger-than-life-size eagle was built as a kind of advertisement for passengers on the Third Avenue elevated line, who could see it through the train windows. Like the original Chinese Tuxedo, this new model, which opened in November, makes its pitch to people passing through the neighborhood as well as to locals. On some nights, the crowd is a mix of white people here simply because it’s new, and Chinese families tentatively poking at the fried eggplant and pork dumplings topped with flying fish roe. They look as if they are trying to decide whether this is really Chinese food. The answer is an unequivocal “sort of.” The chef, Paul Donnelly, is a Scot. Until recently, he ran the kitchen at Ms. G’s in Sydney, Australia, which specializes in entertainingly mongrelized dishes like cheeseburger spring rolls and masala fried rice. Mr. Donnelly has called his menu at Chinese Tuxedo “fusion.” That dreaded word deserves two qualifications. First, he doesn’t tend to handcuff together unrelated cuisines that have nothing in common except a continent; most of his dishes have discernibly Chinese antecedents. Second, there is dumb fusion and there is smart fusion, and Mr. Donnelly practices the smart kind. Each time I went back, I wanted the fried eggplant in sticky, spicy caramel again. The flicker of Sichuan peppercorn in the sauce could be more pronounced, but the chile burn is just strong enough and the eggplant keeps its wonderful airy crunch even after sitting around for a while. So does the fried pork cheek in the reformed sweet-and-sour pork, stacked up above fresh pineapple chunks and a bracing vinegar sauce that is closer to the Cantonese version than to the orange ketchup sauce that glows radioactively from inside American takeout boxes. The long, sliced slab of char siu pork glazed with honey is simple and classic; if the excellent whole squab with a glossy Peking-duck-style lacquer on its skin turned up at Royal Seafood or another traditional Chinatown restaurant, nobody would blink. It’s served in five pieces, one of which is the head. One of my guests crunched away happily on it, but I was more interested in the meatier quarters. These straight-faced Cantonese studies worked out better than Mr. Donnelly’s halting excursions into Sichuan. The smashed cucumber salad was barely dented and scarcely seasoned. Mapo lo mein, a promising enough idea, was short on heat and swagger and long on sweetness. (This was one of the few dishes that struck me as too sweet, but the menu as a whole relies on sugar more than it should.) Mr. Donnelly puts more strut into his step when he freestyles. Steak tartare on rice crackers is seasoned with fried shallots and a healthy glug of fish sauce; it may be more Vietnamese than Chinese, but it’s great. So is the glistening scoop of chicken liver pâté that you spread, with a pickled slaw of apples and radishes, on youtiao, those cruller-like sticks of fried dough. And I think my favorite invention of his is the beef and broccoli made with tender, peppery tongue pastrami. While the kitchen is fairly consistent already, service is unpredictable. Sometimes dishes crowd the table, and other times they arrive one at a time. Once, we had two waiters shadowing us all night; another time, we sat with our menus for 20 minutes trying to catch somebody’s eye. We thought somebody might take our order after an overexcited guest of mine accidentally knocked her wine glass onto the floor, but once the broken pieces were swept up, we must have put on our invisibility cloaks again. One major inconvenience: The restaurant is so popular that reservations are essential, but Chinese Tuxedo won’t take them for parties of fewer than four. When three of us showed up at 6:30 p.m., we were told we might have to wait an hour and a half. As it turned out, it didn’t take that long, but if I hadn’t been on the job, I wouldn’t have stuck around long enough to find out. The staff could also use more wine training. Chinese Tuxedo’s list is not the kind that you can point at with your eyes closed and know you’ll get a good bottle, but my servers weren’t much help in sorting it out. I sat there wishing I could get wine delivered from Fung Tu or Mission Chinese Food, where the lists are deeper and more adroitly chosen for Chinese cooking. For the moment, Chinese Tuxedo has no hard liquor. But it does have one dessert that is almost worth a trip all by itself. Called Chinese strawberries and cream, it’s a pretty pile of whipped cream and yogurt with fresh and dried strawberries, nuggets of mochi and a few other surprises. This is a dessert that has fun but also knows exactly what it’s doing.",Culinary Clashes End in Harmony at Chinese Tuxedo,"['bend', 'halfway', 'doyers', 'chinatown', 'used', 'see', 'killing',

92,Chumley’s,★★,2017-01-31,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/dining/chumleys-review-bar-west-village.html,West Village,"If you heard that Chumley’s is open again, you were misinformed. The dim, spare, beer-scented hideaway in the West Village is gone, torn down, not coming back. At its old address is a restaurant that has nothing in common with the original except a name, a door, an archway and framed photographs of, and jackets of books by, writers who used to drink there. Most of them wouldn’t be able to afford a cocktail there now, let alone dinner. Chumley’s first quietly and selectively opened its unmarked door, inside a hidden courtyard at the end of an alley, during Prohibition. Flappers, sailors, actors, Wobblies, writers heading for fame and bohemians heading for nowhere ate and drank in its windowless rooms. Simone de Beauvoir, who tumbled into Chumley’s in the 1950s on a tip from Richard Wright, wrote that it was “utterly simple, with its little tables lined against the walls, but it has something so rare in America — atmosphere.” On busy nights in later years, the atmosphere could be like that of a college rathskeller in a state with a low drinking age. But if you caught Chumley’s at the right hour, when there were empty booths and a log burning in the fireplace, it could be a shelter from the city and an ideal embodiment of it at the same time. All this time, the building, almost a century old when Chumley’s opened, was falling apart — slowly at first and then, in 2007, in a landslide of bricks. It was so far gone that it had to be torn down and rebuilt. The work went so slowly that Chumley’s nearly lost its chance to renew its liquor license. Then Alessandro Borgognone, who owns Sushi Nakazawa around the corner, was made a partner in the business; he must have hit the construction crew with a dose of wasabi, because the build-out zoomed along, the liquor license came through just in time, and the restaurant began serving in October. The chef is Victoria Blamey, who has cooked under Paul Liebrandt, Matthew Lightner and Justin Smillie. Her menu has far-flung influences — the old regulars would have taken one look at it and called for another shot — but she doesn’t let the dishes get wispy or abstract. Some of them even look like bar food, sort of. And she loads them with more excitement than you’ll come across in other new restaurants that are getting far more attention. Starting with a warm pretzel and French onion dip, you first notice just how light the pretzel is. It is to the street-cart variety what a hummingbird is to a Butterball turkey. The crust is salt-flecked and rough with toasted onion powder. Orange dots of salmon roe sit on top of the dip, which tastes pure and chemical free — cooked garlic and shallots and onions are stirred into a base of soft cream cheese, cloumage and crème fraîche. Chumley’s beef tartare goes a few places other tartares don’t. Instead of mustard and capers, it takes its sharpness from confit tomatoes and gratings of a sheep’s milk cheese from Catalonia. It’s meant to be spread on a wavy, blistered puff of fried beef tendon. Crunchier and airier than a cracker, the tendon has a very clean flavor and doesn’t soak up the taste of raw steak the way toast does. There is a terrine that would be right at home in one of those casually excellent bistros run by young chefs in Paris. Foie gras and shredded ham hock are pressed between leaves of savoy cabbage; the cross section you get on a vintage china plate is served with a tart, fruity puddle of apple cider reduced to a gastrique. It’s radically simple, and makes something memorable out of ham hocks and cabbage. (To be fair, the foie gras does its part, too.) New York may not need another burger, but any place called Chumley’s definitely does. The one Ms. Blamey has provided is like an erotic poem on the theme of fat. It is a double-decker, both of its patties buried under American cheese and soaked with bone marrow that’s been hit with a blowtorch. Liquid marrow falls from the burger; so do a few dark and crunchy fried shallots and orange blobs of cheese. On the side are very crisp and skinny fries tossed, after their second trip to the deep fryer, in melted dry-aged beef fat. I imagine the burger is pretty great after a few drinks. I ate it while I was as sober as a mechanical pencil, and it was all I could do not to paint my face with grease until I looked like Martin Sheen at the end of “Apocalypse Now.” Any qualms I had about the price, $25, vanished while I was looking around the floor for my napkin. I had also rolled my eyes at first when I saw a $43 potpie on the menu of a former speakeasy. The thing is, it is an amazing potpie. The body of a Dungeness crab is stuffed, all the way out to its spiky corners, with a crab meat stew. Ms. Blamey based it on an abalone dish from Chile, where she grew up, and it gets its kick from fresh ají dulce peppers along with ground Aleppo pepper. The richness that comes from the fatty innards of the crab helps the stew cling like cream to the tender puff pastry crust, which is dotted with sesame seeds. There are two desserts: a scoop of vanilla ice cream with pistachio streusel and parsnip purée (it’s good, I swear), and a gold-foil-wrapped sandwich of ice cream made with Luxardo maraschino cherries pressed between square almond-cocoa cookies that are as black as Oreos. Along with cocktails, Chumley’s drinks menu has a series of variations on the Scotch and soda, a terrific idea. Highballs deserve more attention from restaurants; they’re more refreshing and more amenable to food than more concentrated medicine like the manhattan. Ms. Blamey works in a galley in the back. Across from her confined territory are the restrooms, where you can visit framed slices of the original wood tables. They were deeply carved over the years, and now the names and initials are displayed behind glass like frescoes from Pompeii. Nobody at Chumley’s is likely to take a switchblade to the tables now, not after having to provide credit-card numbers to make a reservation. It’s possible to get a table without one, but you wouldn’t know that from the way the hosts greet new arrivals with one finger poised over an iPad and an expression that says, “Are you on the list?” There is something a little too clubby, too, about the way cards that read RESERVED are placed on the empty tables and in front of unoccupied bar stools, even when the restaurant is winding down for the night. Closing time is midnight now, a concession to neighbors who fought the liquor license. Chumley’s is emphatically worth going to as long as Ms. Blamey remains content to work in that kitchen. What happens after that is anyone’s guess. The reservations policy seems to keep people from just dropping by for a drink, and casual drinking was part of the atmosphere that de Beauvoir liked so much. Now, instead of atmosphere, Chumley’s has décor; the book jackets and photographs are elements in a haunted house attraction featuring the ghosts of Hemingway and Kerouac. The neighbors sleep better, but the neighborhood isn’t as interesting.",The New Chumley’s Raises the Culinary Bar,"['heard', 'chumley’s', 'open', 'misinformed', 'dim', 'spare', 'beerscented',

93,Fowler & Wells,★★,2017-01-24,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/dining/fowler-and-wells-restaurant-review-beekman-hotel.html,Financial District,"You enter Tom Colicchio’s new restaurant near City Hall through what is suddenly the most stunning hotel lobby bar in New York City. The Beekman hotel’s bar is at the bottom of the atrium of the 1883 Temple Court Building, which rises up through seven floors of elaborate cast-iron railings to end in a soaring glass pyramid. It’s a striking room where you can sink into an armchair with a solidly built drink in your hand and get lost in the past, a quintessentially urban experience that most of the city’s grand old hotels no longer give us. With Fowler & Wells, Mr. Colicchio tries to extend the atrium’s Gilded Age exuberance. He never quite gets there. The problem isn’t quality or effort: The cooking is spotlessly correct, the ingredients shimmer on the plate, the flavors all make sense, and the dining room is dignified in a way that makes you realize how undervalued that trait has become in restaurants. But the central vision tying it all together is fuzzy. The restaurant is somehow less than the sum of its parts. Choosing the $135 tasting menu one night, I got a seven-course tour of robber-baron dishes as interpreted by Mr. Colicchio and Bryan Hunt, the executive chef. The opener was a delicious variation on the theme of oysters Rockefeller. Watercress stood in for spinach, and the chubby Belon oyster had been poached in oyster liquor and crème fraîche seasoned with fennel and bacon: all the right flavors, rearranged. Duck à l’orange was reworked, wonderfully, with kumquats. I smiled at how smart the chefs were to add a rippling charge to the sweetened citrus with ginger, mustard seed and vinegar made from oranges. The meat of little lobsters had been chopped and replaced in the shells with a green slash of tomalley, tarragon leaves and chanterelles the size of shirt buttons. It was very good, but was the sort of dish that chefs of Mr. Colicchio’s generation have been cooking for a couple of decades. With the possible exception of its superb pastry crust, the same was true of venison Wellington, with chestnuts and black trumpets inside a ring of huckleberry sauce. None of this is a problem in and of itself — good food is good! — but you might feel mildly let down if you believed the pre-opening press, which promised cooking inspired by an earlier era. At Le Coucou, Daniel Rose locates the energy in old-guard French dishes and then multiplies it, but the kitchen at Fowler & Wells often seems to be trying to get away from the past. If you order à la carte, the historical references are hard to spot. The freedom the chefs take here can lead to some exciting turns of imagination. Pounded rabbit loin was fried into a long, crunchy schnitzel and served over chickpeas and pistachios; lemon confit and lots of thyme leaves snapped the dish into harmony. There was a memorable monkfish cooked in hot wood smoke, served with freekeh and other grains cooked in reduced beet juice. The same grains, toasted to a crackle, had been tossed over the top. Warm crème fraîche softened the earthy taste of the beets, although I didn’t see the point of spiking this sauce with caviar. The kitchen’s creativity seems to run out of gas at some points, though. There wasn’t a lot of flavor in firm lumps of sweetbread with brussels sprout leaves and pale bands of lardon, and not much surprise in the juxtaposition of roasted salsify, sunchokes and leeks over a pale sunchoke purée. There’s a pretty plate of raw fluke under red-rimmed wheels of radish and tiny globes of finger lime; it was as good as it is in other restaurants where I’ve had nearly the same dish. The à la carte menu would be more tempting if it overlapped at all with the tasting menu. It wasn’t until my third visit that a server suggested the chef might be able to dislodge some dishes from the tasting menu to serve as an appetizer or main course. The two barely related menus make it hard to figure out what the Fowler & Wells experience is supposed to be. The disconnection carries over to the atmosphere. Like the lobby bar (but not the hotel’s other restaurant, Keith McNally’s Augustine), the dining room interior was done by Martin Brudnizki Design Studio, but seems to have been put together by two different Brudnizkis who may or may not be on speaking terms. One Brudnizki went for a turn-of-the-century glint. There are tiered bronze chandeliers and walls overlaid with green and gold plaster until they look as if they belong in the ballroom of some faded Italian palace. In the middle of it all is an immense oval cabinet, with wine bottles on its marble top and stemware on shelves held up by bronze rails that rise into the air like the upper decks of an ocean liner. The other Brudnizki commissioned huge grids of backlighted colored glass and brought in mirror tiles and sparkly faceted-glass sconces. The walls belong in “The Leopard,” but the mirrors and sconces are right out of “The Sopranos.” The name Fowler & Wells is a muddle in its own way. Before the current structure was built, another building stood on the corner of Beekman and Nassau Streets. Among its tenants were Orson Fowler and Samuel Wells, a pair of phrenologists with a sideline in publishing. The 19th-century belief that  skull shape revealed character provides some amusing, arcane cocktail names. But in its day, phrenology wrapped a gauzy cloak of fake science around the ugly armor of racism. Fowler was close to several abolitionists, but he also wrote that the heads of black people made them “our best nurses” and “excellent waiters” while dooming them to language skills that were at best “middling.” This is obviously not a side of phrenology that Mr. Colicchio, who is outspoken about his progressive politics, embraces. “We don’t want anybody to think we take it seriously, because it was used for some not very good things,” he said in an interview. Later, I told him that the dining room staff was noticeably diverse. (One day I hope that will go without saying at restaurants all over the city.) “I’m not involved in hiring front-of-house staff,” he said. “But I’ve got to say, I feel pretty good about it.” My service was sometimes jittery, but fast and attentive. A brisk professionalism is at work throughout the restaurant. The wine service and the list, overseen by Jarred Roth, is welcoming whether you have specific tastes or just a general notion of what you like. Meals always ended on a high note thanks to the pastry chef, Abby Swain. She has a nimble mind and a sensible palate, a great combination that results in desserts like a baked alaska based on the flavors of Black Forest cake, or the panna cotta with poached quince and maple syrup. Fowler & Wells has so many strengths that few people will leave unhappy. But they may wake up the next day with scattered impressions of what the place is about, until Mr. Colicchio and Mr. Hunt can bring more focus to the menu.",Glimpses of a Gilded Past at Fowler &

94,Ichiran,★,2017-01-17,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/17/dining/ichiran-review-ramen-brooklyn.html,Bushwick,"Ichiran, a Japanese ramen chain that touched down in Brooklyn last fall, makes one kind of soup, the opaque ivory pork broth called tonkotsu. Like a heart surgeon who operates only on the left ventricle, it has staked out a niche within a niche. Within its microspecialty, though, Ichiran presents you with a boggling number of decisions. The first comes before the menu, and it will determine what kind of restaurant you eat in. When you walk in from Johnson Avenue, one of those Bushwick streets that runs along blank walls that hide disquieting postindustrial scars, you’re asked if you would rather sit in a booth or at a table. This is an easy choice. The tables are arranged in a bright room with red paper lanterns, promotional posters and a television in the corner. It will do if you came with a group, but it is as special as the nicer restaurants in Penn Station. The booths, on the other hand, aren’t like anything else in town. There are two long rows of them separated by a long alley where the servers work. The booths are separated from this backstage area by bamboo shades and one another by hinged partitions. When the partitions were shut and the shades were down, I was all by myself. I couldn’t decide if it felt more like a library carrel, a peep show or a confessional. (“My child, how long has it been since you last slurped a noodle?”) According to the company, which has around 60 locations in Japan, these are “flavor concentration booths.” In the closed position, the partitions did seem to keep the sweet-smelling steam that rises off the soup from wandering away on currents of air. I could soak in the aroma even when my head wasn’t bent over the bowl. The effect was minimal, though, and I wondered if the thing that was supposed to be doing the concentrating was me. The signs tacked up all over the place were distracting, though. There is even one taped to the restroom wall explaining that Ichiran’s owner is determined never to run out of toilet paper. The wall is already covered with toilet paper rolls, but a few extra sheets are tucked behind the note, in case of emergency. One of the many signs inside the booth read, “Flavor Concentration in progress — please be quiet and silence your phones.” In theory, you could eat a whole meal at Ichiran with no human contact. The menu is a checklist. A laminated card signals that you want a water refill. The paper wrapper on the chopsticks doubles as an order form for extra noodles if you finish the ones in the bowl. Leave one of them by the red call button, press it, and a server rolls up the shade to take away your order. All of this may happen wordlessly in Japan. In New York, we talk. Almost every time the shade went up, a server bent over to peer through the opening, which is at the height of a belt buckle, to chat about my order. One night, just after I sat down, the screen went up, and a hand stretched toward me. Without thinking, I held out mine, and we shook. Anxiety flushed through me. Had I broken ramen protocol? Was this like reaching over the front seat of a car to give an Uber driver a neck rub? I recovered from my shame and started filling out the menu with check marks and circles. How strong did I want the broth? How rich with melted pork fat — a few isolated slicks coasting on top of the soup, or a layer thick as frosting on a cupcake? Would I like chopped scallions or not? How about cha-shu, thin slices of marinated pork? Extra cha-shu on the side? No chopped garlic, a pile of garlic, or something in between? Should my noodles be soft on arrival, or firm because they’d get to keep cooking in the hot soup? Finally, did I want any of Ichiran’s proprietary spice mixture dropped on top, and if so, how much? Would a few pinpricks of fire do, or should I make the broth so incendiary that I would have to reach for the tissues mounted on the wall behind me? All these decisions would be pointless, of course, if the ramen were not very good. It is. Whether you will prefer it to the majestically potent tonkotsu at Mu Ramen or the memorably savory one at Ippudo, I can’t say. But it is rounded and substantial, moving across the mouth with the glide and density of extralight coffee. The flavor is very porky without any of the unnerving butcher-shop note that creeps into some tonkotsus. I was never served a bowl that was less than painfully hot, which is the ideal. One edge Ichiran holds over its competitors is that you can give what you consider the correct answer to all of those questions. For the record, my preferences after a few rounds of experimentation are: broth of medium richness and strength; yes to scallions and the standard, free portion of cha-shu (it is less flavorful than at some other places, the meat less generous with jiggly streaks of fat); a smallish dab of garlic; and firm but not “extra firm” noodles, which are straight and skinny, like spaghetti. The spice blend is called hiden no tare, which translates as “secret sauce.” Supposedly only four people know the recipe. This coarse, rust-colored paste adds more than heat; after it sits in the soup for a while, the broth takes on a toasted flavor that sometimes reminded me of roasted peanuts. The amount I asked for varied based on how badly my head required banging that day. I stopped short of a full skull-shattering dose, but it’s reassuring to know I can get it when the need arises. These basic options don’t change the cost of the soup, $18.90. Tips are not accepted, which brings the price into line with, say, Ivan Ramen or Ippudo. Ichiran’s ramen can become one of the most expensive in town, though, if you add toppings like a cooked egg, squares of dried nori or wood ear mushrooms, which come with extra charges. Those who, like me, enjoy semiliquid yolks in their ramen will not want the egg, which is solid all the way through. The only garnish I was happy to spend more money for was the little pitcher of vinegar for $1.90. It has a soft, somewhat oxidized bite, like that of aged sherry vinegar, and it brings definition to the blunt contours of the pork broth. There is one dessert, an almond-tofu pudding glazed with matcha. The only other dish, strips of simmered pork belly, can be eaten with a bowl of white rice. The pork was good enough to pad my stomach, but when hunger is my concern, I’ll go for a supplementary coil of noodles. Crouched in my booth, I’ll practice my slurp, and when hot droplets of soup fly everywhere, nobody will get spattered but me.","Slurping Solo, in Sweet Isolation, at Ichiran in Brooklyn","['ichiran',

95,Flora Bar,★★,2017-01-10,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/dining/flora-bar-review.html,Upper East Side,"I’m on the verge of giving up trying to explain why Ignacio Mattos’s food is so good. I once wrote that the cooking at his first restaurant, now closed, dabbled in “deep, surrealist weirdness.” At Estela, the place on Houston Street that put him on the map, I described his food as “almost familiar, but not quite.” What struck me at his most recent restaurant, Café Altro Paradiso, was “the inverse relationship between prettiness and deliciousness.” (What I ate was unpretty and highly delicious.) In retrospect, nothing I wrote captured the qualities that made the food compelling. I latched on to visual style because I couldn’t figure out how to explain why the flavors grabbed me the way they did. After spending some time at Flora Bar, which Mr. Mattos opened in October, I’ve started to think that whatever it is that sets his food apart is something you can’t see. It’s a kind of cooking that’s almost invisible. Flora Bar is inside the Met Breuer museum, Marcel Breuer’s blunt and muscular stack of granite and concrete on Madison Avenue in the 70s, regarded as a masterpiece of the brutalist style. “The taste for its disconcertingly top-heavy, inverted pyramidal mass grows on one slowly,” the architecture critic for The New York Times, Ada Louise Huxtable, wrote in 1966, “like a taste for olives or warm beer.” The food at Flora Bar is much easier to like than warm beer. Under the direction of Jake Nemmers, the executive chef, it comes out of the kitchen in a series of tidily formal circles and squares. The rough edges of the cooking at Altro Paradiso and Estela have been refined, which makes it even more astonishing when the flavors come at you out of nowhere. A simple red disc on a white plate, Flora Bar’s tuna tartare isn’t like any I’ve had before; it pops with toasted flax seeds and crunches with fried shallots, neither of which hides the clean, cold taste of chopped yellowfin tuna. Flora Bar does not quite reinvent tuna tartare the way Estela reinvents beef tartare, but it comes closer than you’d think was possible. Steak comes with béarnaise and beet hunks. The beets look a little wrinkled, like prunes, and have an uncannily focused flavor. The béarnaise is silky and light on the herbs. The steak looks like steak, sliced. It is tender, and the flavor goes on and on as you chew, yet it doesn’t have the meat-locker stink of dry-aged beef. Something must have happened to make it so extraordinary, but the answer is not visible. (The beef has been given, among other treatments, a surreptitious marination in fish sauce.) How can a shrimp cocktail hold any surprises? Well, there’s the price, $29, which may be a record. But then there’s the astonishingly fine flavor and texture of the blue shrimp themselves, glossy and appealingly slippery on a bed of ice pebbles. They’re terrific, and so is their dark, uncloying cocktail sauce. Note the name. Flora Bar is, when you get down to it, less a restaurant than a wine bar. The plates are almost all small; even the steak, which could pass as a main course, is a far cry from a steakhouse portion. Flora Bar is not trying to be a utilitarian cafe for museum patrons who knocked themselves out taking in Kerry James Marshall’s show upstairs and now want a cheap, filling meal. That job goes to Flora Coffee next door, where you can get sandwiches and pastries during the day. The wine list at Flora Bar is about as exhaustive as any artist’s career retrospective. It contains multitudes, and in three visits, I barely scratched the surface. And I left the shelves and shelves of tempting, knowledgeably chosen spirits mostly untouched, apart from the slug of gin that went into my very soothing Tuxedo No. 2 cocktail. As wine bars go, it’s somewhat stiff. The service can be punctilious in a way that I imagine is meant to appeal to the Upper East Sider, but fans of Estela (and there are many Upper East Siders in that group) may find it slightly off-putting. Or Mr. Mattos and his business partner, Thomas Carter, may just be trying to live up to the space. It’s an exceptionally dramatic one, with marble surfaces and banquettes of dark leather and windows the size of billboards that look out on Breuer’s bridge across the moat below Madison Avenue. A sculpture garden when this building still housed the Whitney Museum of American Art, the moat is now an outdoor extension for Flora Bar. I miss the art, but the tables look inviting enough to make me come back when the weather warms up. The menu is part tapas, part sashimi and part something else. On the tapas side, we have wonderfully crunchy croquetas with a soft core of warm raclette, pink shavings of jamón Ibérico, and a plate of anchovies, three cured in oil and three in brine. The quality is impeccable if you can get over paying $18 for six anchovies. I couldn’t. Representing sashimi, there is shimmering raw seafood, some of it on or under squares of nori. You’re meant to treat the nori like a tortilla. A month ago, the filling in this taco was raw scallops and a salty streak of plum paste, and I was quietly happy. When I went back, the nori covered sticky raw red shrimp and sea urchin, and I went completely giddy. It took me a minute to warm up to another raw dish, the lobster crudo. Raw lobster is not something you naturally want to cuddle up with. Here it is chopped with shiso and molded into a disc, ready to be swabbed in a soft-spoken mayonnaise. It’s refined and almost comforting. As for something else, you tell me how to characterize raclette and golden slices of rutabaga over a thin, buttery tart shell, or an omelet that is in fact cooked in a thin disc, inverted on to the plate runny-side down, and then topped with spoonfuls of hackleback caviar, firm trout roe and crème fraîche. There’s a fine line between simple and dull, and one or two dishes fell on the wrong side. Stracciatella with lemon peel and cubes of fennel struck me as an ordinary burrata salad traveling under an alias. Halibut with wild mushrooms was no more than the sum of its parts, although they were very good parts. Natasha Pickowicz’s desserts sound safe but can be daring. Mandarin sorbet in a kind of cradle made of coconut was served with a yuzu sauce so sour it made me sit up straight. After the initial shock, I loved it. If I’d expected the parfait of chocolate and amarena cherries to be a layered dessert served in a tall glass, like other parfaits, I was wrong. This was cherry-flavored chocolate, as dense as ganache, and served in the shape of, you guessed it, a disc.",The Art of Flavor at Flora Bar in the Met Breuer,"['i’m', 'verge', 'giving', 'trying',

96,The Odeon,★,2016-12-27,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/27/dining/the-odeon-review.html,TriBeCa,"Why do I keep going back to the Odeon? It’s not because people on Condé Nast expense accounts have returned to this TriBeCa landmark with the bones of a brasserie, even though it’s nice to know that some editors still have time for lunch. Nor is it because Lena Dunham had the neon sign on West Broadway replicated in blazing-orange ink on her body this year, either, although I appreciate how neatly the sign’s progress from the front cover of “Bright Lights, Big City” in 1984 to Ms. Dunham’s backside encapsulates the recent cultural history of New York. Nostalgia is not the lure for me. The Odeon was opened in 1980 by Lynn Wagenknecht; Keith McNally, whom she would later marry; and his brother, Brian. I had not moved to New York yet when the surfaces of its downstairs bathrooms provided cocaine runways for some “Saturday Night Live” cast members and a troop of art-market players and fixers. And besides, knowing that by the end of the decade drug abuse would kill at least two famous regulars, John Belushi and Jean-Michel Basquiat, makes it hard to see much glamour in that white-powdered scene. I don’t go to the Odeon for the last word in culinary fashions, which were part of the package under the first chef, Patrick Clark. Mr. Clark had cooked under Michel Guérard, one of the founders of nouvelle cuisine, and he was one of the earliest American chefs to apply its principles to homegrown ingredients. Moira Hodgson, who during her brief stint as restaurant critic for The Times in 1980 may have been one of the only people who went to the Odeon to eat, was impressed enough by dishes like “médaillons of tender veal on a green pool of puréed watercress artfully decorated by leeks, string beans, carrots and celery” that she gave the restaurant two stars. (It got the same rating in its last full review, by Bryan Miller in 1989.) The kitchen at the Odeon, in the hands of Vincent Nargi for more than a decade, retrenched long ago to a comfortably broken-in lineup of French and American standards. So when I go, I often start with oysters on ice or with frisée and lardons in warmed vinaigrette, even if I wonder why the poached egg that completes the salad is optional. In cold weather, I ask for a scalding crock of French onion soup, lifting my spoon higher and higher in the steam until the thread of melted Gruyère finally snaps. Anything out of the ordinary I approach with caution. “Spicy chicken dumplings” turn out to be Buffalo chicken wontons with a blue cheese dipping sauce. This is every bit as wrong as it sounds. I ate one with the grim consolation of knowing I’d gotten exactly what I deserved. The pressed octopus appetizer sounds risky, too, but it is good, tender and lightly charred with some chickpeas and preserved lemon and a smooth sauce of leeks. It’s hard to look at the Odeon’s slowly revolving ceiling fans, hanging globe lamps, white tablecloths and burgundy banquettes without the words “steak frites” popping into your head. This is an understandable reaction, and a smart one. The steak, a New York strip, is of high quality, and the fries are exactly what you’re picturing, skinny and golden and salty in their paper-lined metal cups. If the words you hear instead are “moules frites,” you’re still in good shape; the mussels will be fat and fresh, and their saffron-cream sauce will be rich and flavorful, even if the taste of saffron is more of an allusion than an outright statement. Under Ms. Wagenknecht, now the sole owner, the restaurant looks virtually the same as it did when she and the McNallys assembled it, including the Art Deco bar, itself larger than many restaurants. One night, when I’d arrived early, I was waiting there with a fine approximation of a Sazerac when I asked the bartender if there were any main courses I shouldn’t overlook. He thought about it for a while. “The roast chicken is kind of a sleeper,” he finally said. Whether roast chicken qualifies as an underdog is debatable, but the Odeon does a fine job with it and sends it to the table with root vegetables and a simple jus. A better sleeper candidate is the omelet. Who goes to a restaurant for an omelet? I do, if it’s the one at the Odeon, which tastes like real eggs and is a little puffy but never looks as if it is trying out for a role as a balloon in Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. Cooking like this is sometimes called comfort food, but I think of the menu and everything else about the Odeon as restorative. The word shares a root with restaurant, a term that goes back to pre-revolutionary France, when aristocrats made a show of their delicate constitutions by sipping health-giving bouillons in public dining rooms. The Odeon doesn’t market itself to neurasthenics on the verge of collapse, but it does go out of its way not to jangle anybody’s nerves. In so many places now, the servers want to know if you have any questions about the menu. (When you don’t, they always seem disappointed.) They want to know if it’s your first time, too, as if special instructions might be required. At the Odeon the servers never ask either question, probably because they assume the answer will be no. They are steady, unexcitable and prompt. Most of all, they don’t seem to need anything from you except your order and eventually your credit card. Once in a while, it’s nice not to be needed. It’s good to know that you don’t have to live up to the chef’s expectations, too. The restaurant world has gone a little crazy lately. Other parts of the world were crazy a long time ago. This is why the Odeon has been hitting the spot for me these past few months. I go there to feel restored, to act sane for a while, and to finish my meal with a crème brûlée that’s exactly what I expect.",The Odeon’s Not-So-Bright Lights Still Beckon,"['keep', 'going', 'odeon',

In that era, Mr. Puck was a nonstop innovator. He turned the Sunset Strip on to duck-sausage pizzas and other exercises in treating Italian cuisine as a blank slate at Spago. He hipped Santa Monica to Chinese-style fried catfish with Japanese ponzu at Chinois on Main, the kind of crossbreeding we would learn to call Asian fusion. Above all, by the end of the decade, he had shown chefs the way to scrub the starch out of their restaurants and still be taken seriously. All of these ideas would hitch rides to New York sooner or later, but Mr. Puck could have given us a peek into the future of dining if he had come to town in those days. It never happened. Aside from opening a kiosk at Kennedy Airport about a decade ago, he stayed away until September, when he opened a steak-driven restaurant in the financial district. Nothing on the menu at Cut by Wolfgang Puck breaks new ground. It sits on the ground floor of the new Four Seasons Hotel New York Downtown, to allow both operations their full, overtaxed names. (There are five other Cut restaurants flung across the world.) The steaks, presented bare, on white plates, are excellent. Appetizers and other dishes are appealing, if a little unfocused. The food is served in rooms whose design, by Strata Architects and Jacques Garcia, appears to have been lost in the mail for a decade or so. It is a new restaurant that already feels dated. To the right of the glass doors on Church Street is an entryway framed by fold upon fold of shimmery red fabric, suggesting that you are about to walk into a room full of elegantly debauched vampires. Instead you find hotel guests and solitary men in an awkward lounge illuminated by slashing bolts of red neon lightning; it’s how you’d imagine a sexy downtown bar if you’d never been downtown, gone to a bar or had sex. To the left of the entrance is the main dining room, its rear wall given entirely over to a diptych by a young, fast-climbing artist named Alex Israel. Each half of the work features text in sans-serif block capitals, in the manner of Barbara Kruger, but instead of spooky aphorisms about power, we get cheese-ball romantic comedy dialogue superimposed on pink fireworks: “‘Sometimes you know it in your head,’ the chef whispered.” “‘Sometimes you feel it in your stomach,’ she smiled, buzzed.” Sometimes you gag in your mouth, the critic sighed. Early in the meal, a short glass vase arrives at the table loaded with Parmesan-crusted breadsticks about a yard long. They always seem to be aimed straight at my face, as if challenging me to a duel. They do taste good, though, and the sharp, creamy gougères that show up next are terrific. While we’re looking at our menus, somebody stands next to the table holding a white china platter arrayed with cuts of Wagyu beef wrapped in black napkins. Each hunk of muscle is pointed out and described appreciatively. There is less ceremony when you buy a diamond at Tiffany. Some pride in these steaks is understandable, particularly in the case of the Japanese beef. Imported from Miyazaki Prefecture, this is true Wagyu, rarely offered in American restaurants. It is rich in a way that’s hard to fathom, the melting streaks of fat cascading from the flesh onto your tongue. It is sold at $25 an ounce. I can’t stand pointlessly expensive luxuries, but this one has a point. The beef is so rich that a table of curious diners for whom the price is not an automatic deal breaker might share a six-ounce steak, the smallest cut offered. I am less inclined to splurge on the hybrid Wagyu raised in Idaho, with its broader, less graceful flavor and noticeably less marbling. Next to the genuine article, it tastes like a compromise. Of course there are normal American steaks, too, from three sources. One night, I ran a controlled study on two of the rib-eyes, both of them cornfed. While I was taking apart a steak from Kansas that had been aged for 28 days in vacuum-sealed plastic, a guest ate one raised in Illinois that had been dry aged for 35 days. The contrast kept us trading slices all night. Mine was chewier, more purple, a little more concentrated, with a potent red-meat flavor. The other exemplified the old-fashioned American ideal: soft, pinkish, mild and shiny with rendered fat. Cut uses a technique for cooking its varieties of beef that I strongly endorse. Steaks are grilled over wood and charcoal and then blasted under a broiler running at 1,200 degrees, roughly hot enough to melt aluminum. The meat arrives with a textured, almost brittle outer bark, like the crust on a really great loaf of sourdough. Old-guard steakhouses are losing their juice these days because well-connected chefs like Mr. Puck can often buy better, more flavorful beef. Other ingredients at Cut are enviable, too. The tender and herbaceous double chops of lamb come from Elysian Fields Farm in Pennsylvania, and two preparations of bay scallops out of Nantucket popped up, near the start of their brief, glorious season in November. Very little about the menu says steakhouse aside from the steaks. Cut is not a wedge-salad joint. The executive chef, Raymond Weber, who comes to New York from the Cut in Dubai, makes elaborate new dishes alongside vintage ones from the first Cut restaurant, in Beverly Hills. Impressively tender and flavorful veal tongue with artichokes and white beans was served at the original from the start, and it is worth repeating. So is the lobster and crab Louis, the chilled shellfish set over a coaster of panna cotta pointedly spiked with horseradish. A few dishes fail to land their punches. A bone-marrow flan, meant to be spread on toasted brioche with a savory mushroom marmalade, was very delicate but didn’t taste much like marrow. Steamed salmon with snow peas and spicy soy sauce reminded me of all the perfunctory, umpteenth-generation Asian fusion dishes that made everybody lose interest in the genre. The pastry chef is Zairah Molina, another Puck veteran. Like the rest of the kitchen, her department can overcomplicate its plates. But she always puts a good idea at the center, like the crisp membrillo-stuffed fritters dusted with cardamom sugar next to a spoonful of kabocha ice cream that she was serving last month. Except for the art, nothing about Cut is less than good. But a lot of it isn’t very inspired, either. The Wolfgang Puck in charge here is the proficient overseer of high-end hotel amenities, not the chef who crossed boundaries and defined an earlier era. If 80 percent of success is just showing up, as Woody Allen has said, a good chunk of the remainder is arriving at the right time.",Making Way for the Tried and True at Cut by Wolfgang

98,Aska,★★★,2016-12-06,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/06/dining/aska-review-brooklyn.html,Williamsburg,"One of the 20 or so courses served to me the first time I ate at the new Aska in Brooklyn was a cluster of nasturtium leaves, next to a bundle of burned herb sprigs and flower stalks, tied up with a string. It looked pretty and pagan at the same time, like a page from a Martha Stewart lifestyle magazine for witches. This plate was more than just photogenic, though. Wrapped inside the scorched bouquet was a langoustine, very gently cooked to a soft pink. It tasted of herbs and ashes. There were blots of chamomile jelly and a langoustine-head sauce on the plate, too, and when I rubbed a bit of the orange-pink lobster around in there, the combination of flower and shellfish flavors was a complete surprise, extraordinary in ways I’d never imagined before. One of the rewards of working as a restaurant critic for a few years is getting to see chefs growing into their ambitions. On my watch, few have done this as dramatically and successfully as Aska’s chef, Fredrik Berselius. Aska, which opened beneath the ribs of the Williamsburg Bridge in July, is his third restaurant. And with each fresh incarnation, his cooking has taken a leap forward. His first, in 2012, was a part-time operation called Frej, which shared its space in Williamsburg with a ramen outfit and a coffee bar. Its five-course menu was a great deal at $45, and Mr. Berselius, who was born and raised in Sweden, was already showing a gift for delicately naturalistic compositions in the New Nordic style. But some of the flavors were tentative, like underexposed photographs. Mr. Berselius fleshed out some of those sketches when he turned Frej into a full-time restaurant, called Aska. The menus were longer and a little more expensive. Some dishes were too subdued and others were just off-putting; I may still have a bit of a coagulated-pig’s-blood cracker stuck between my teeth. The pleasures, however, were numerous and original enough to persuade me that Aska was easily a two-star restaurant. Less than two years in, though, Mr. Berselius closed Aska, saying that he had outgrown the site. New York’s real estate and construction industries being what they are, it took him more than two years to find and then renovate the new space, a warehouse from the Civil War era about a mile south. He installed a bar and lounge in the basement, a patio in the courtyard and a moody main dining area and open kitchen in the soaring, big-boned room at street level. Mr. Berselius must have used some of that time to bear down in the kitchen, too, because his new tasting menus vault past the ones at the old Aska. They are longer, and much more expensive, at $145 for 10 courses and $215 for 19 courses, service included. But the flavors don’t hide anymore; they have an insistent presence, and their dynamics are beautifully modulated from one dish to the next. You will still be eating things you probably didn’t think you wanted to eat. A new pig’s blood creation has replaced the cracker, and this time it leaves a memory I’m happy to be haunted by. The blood lends a mineral tang to an appealingly tender traditional Swedish pancake set under rose petals, cherries and a sweet-sour rose hip jelly. It looks, and even tastes, a little like a thin chocolate cake. (Blood imitates chocolate again in a little truffle that shows up at the end of the night.) Reindeer lichen, another ingredient that didn’t entirely win me over last time around, is back. I may never learn to love the way a clump of it feels in my mouth — like a cross between kataifi pastry and a hairball — but I loved the chanterelles and their broth that surrounded the lichen and the swoosh of cream, cooked down to a caramelized sweetness, that was hiding beneath. Mr. Berselius is the rare chef who thinks like an artist and gets away with it. His Nature Boy act took a turn toward the mystical on a recent night as he delivered a dish to the table; he recalled seeing a small flock of sheep in the Catskills, amid hills overrun with bedstraw. He said he wanted to bring the two together, which he accomplished by placing lambs’ hearts under burning bedstraw until the hearts collapse into ashes. These ashes are then scattered over sunchoke cream mixed with pickled sunchokes. The pairing of bitter cinders and sweet sunchokes was fascinating, and reminded me of baking chocolate grated over melted white chocolate. But one or two tastes were enough for me; incinerated heart may be better expressed as a one- or two-bite snack, like the grape-size puff of pommes soufflées, topped with wonderfully smoky flounder roe. Part of the program at Aska asks us to look again at nature, and to try ingredients that aren’t sold in any supermarket. Mr. Berselius does impressive things with more ordinary materials, though, like the slabs of scallop and their dark-coral roe with elderflower-scented brown butter spooned over the top, or a simple and remarkably good stick of roasted king crab leg with tiny potatoes, cooked almost al dente. The procession of plants and seafood is usually broken up by some red meat right before dessert. Once, it was dry-aged beef bathed in rendered beef fat, tasting the way the air at Peter Luger smells: hypnotic. More recently, there were a few deep-red slices of wild wood pigeon, brought in from Scotland; a very fine thing on a chilly, windy fall night. After that came an amazing sorbet of raw milk served with little strawberries preserved during the summer, along with some fermented juice on its way to becoming wine. This was followed by birch ice cream under white slices of raw pine mushrooms and woodruff leaves, an odd, herbaceous and unexpectedly stirring combination. In my tour of duty, I’ve eaten a number of dishes that were supposed to represent a walk in the woods, but none came as close to capturing the forest’s aromas as this one. The service is warm and unpretentious, even down to earth. Guidance through the wine list, which has some fashionably esoteric choices alongside some excellent, familiar ones, isn’t quite as fluid as at the old Aska, but the servers know how to listen and respond. Their tone is especially welcoming in the basement lounge, where you can sprawl on a couch or unwind at a small table over a martini that’s been Nordicized with Icelandic birch liqueur and syrup distilled from prehistoric amber. The à la carte menu downstairs offers a fantastic cured pork shoulder in mushroom vinaigrette, or red-leaf lettuce leaves dotted with a mash of smoked hake that tastes like unusually good gefilte fish. These and other dishes may not be the makings of a filling weeknight meal, but they do provide a fine, low-cost introduction to the Aska worldview. Mr. Berselius has a lyrical sensibility, though it seems to have abandoned him when it came time to design the main dining room. The tablecloths and the ceiling are black, which makes most of the room disappear. When I was there, most of the tables were taken by couples seated side by side, facing the open kitchen. It looked as if they were at a cabaret, waiting for the show to start. By the third hour of the night, I was restless and conscious of the passage of time; I kept expecting the cooks to do something, maybe sing a little Sondheim. The atmosphere at a lot of tasting-menu restaurants can feel a little inert. This tends not to matter very much to most customers, few of whom are going to put a $215 19-course menu into their regular rotation. What they want is a delicious, memorable night that takes them to places they haven’t been before. Aska does all of that, and throws in a little blood and poetry.","At Aska, a Nordic Chef’s Vision Bears Fruit (and Lichens)","['course', 'aska', 'brooklyn', 'cluster', 'nasturtium', 'leaf', 'next',

99,Bad Saint,★★★,2016-11-29,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/dining/bad-saint-dc-review.html,Washington D.C.,"WASHINGTON — I have now spent roughly twice as many hours standing on the sidewalk outside Bad Saint as I have spent inside eating its Filipino food. This is not an ideal ratio, but at least I had company. Bad Saint, in this city’s Columbia Heights neighborhood, has never taken reservations since it began operating in 2015. The line that begins forming on 11th Street at least two hours before the doors open at 5:30 p.m. is by now as much a part of the experience of having dinner at Bad Saint as hanging out in the stadium parking lot is a part of the experience of seeing a Phish concert. Repeat customers are common and easy to spot. They’re the ones who have brought folding chairs, bottles of water, boxes of wine, volumes of Murakami and Ferrante, and bug spray to keep away the mosquitoes who also like dining at Bad Saint. Blankets appear as the weather gets chilly; in scheduling my meals for this review, I watched the approach of winter as anxiously as covered-wagon pioneers eyed the clouds over the Donner Pass. To pass the time before I was allowed to eat Bad Saint’s extraordinary Filipino food, I chatted with Blelvis, the Black Elvis, who challenged me to name a song of Mr. Presley’s he did not know, and felt mildly ashamed of myself when I stumped him with “Froggy Went a-Courtin’.” I tried not to eavesdrop as a woman gave her friend a year-by-year account of her decades-long marriage and the affair that took it down. I met a paid line-stander who said that waiting outside a restaurant for three to four hours paled beside his greatest achievement: camping out in front of the Supreme Court for more than a week on behalf of a client who wanted to hear the oral arguments in the same-sex marriage case. Absorbing as these intervals were, I felt relief and joy each time the four bamboo blinds would be raised in unison at 5:30 by four servers, one of whom would then unlock the door and start filling the 24 seats. Genevieve Villamora, the partner who most often handles this task, has compared it to a game of Tetris. The largest tables hold just four people, as some parties of five or six have learned to their regret. All the other seats are jimmied into blind alleys and passageways around the open kitchen. Once they are all taken, Ms. Villamora takes names and numbers for openings later in the night. With a woven Filipino mat on the wall and light filtering down from geometric slashes in a ceiling of oxidized-steel tiles, the restaurant has a certain compulsory intimacy. It’s easy to strike up a conversation with somebody, although it won’t necessarily be the somebody you arrived with. Seated at a shallow ledge in the back one night, I stood up to talk to one of my dining partners, who was three seats away. The arrangement had a cocktail-party charm until I was asked to return to my seat; I was blocking the path to the restroom. Clearly, Bad Saint was built to make the best of its scarce square footage, not to handle the pressure of being one of Washington’s most sought-after restaurants. Now it has to do both, because the food that Tom Cunanan and his cooks prepare under columns of wok smoke is richly compelling no matter how many prior run-ins you’ve had with Filipino food. Most people with a glancing knowledge of the cuisine have tried an adobo, a garlic-laden stew braised in soy sauce that’s been soured with vinegar. But Bad Saint’s adobo of tender squid is still astonishing, its sauce deepened and darkened by squid ink and given a slow, lingering burn by long peppers. The oxtails and bok choi stewed in peanut sauce with an intense undercurrent of shrimp and anchovies is amazing whether this is your first encounter with kare-kare or your hundredth. I love bitter melon, but even the skeptics I’d brought with me were won over by Bad Saint’s stir-fry, in which the vegetable’s aggressive tendencies are offset by fermented black beans, softened by eggs and sweetened by a topcoat of fried shallots. My guests were even more dubious about pancit canton, a Filipino lo mein that can be reassuringly bland. As interpreted by Mr. Cunanan, with lots of royal trumpet mushrooms and a steady thrum of Calabrian chiles, it is startlingly good. Ms. Villamora and her partner in the restaurant, Nick Pimentel, have Filipino heritage but were born and raised in the United States. (The restaurant’s name is derived from St. Malo, La., the first Filipino settlement in this country.) Mr. Cunanan was born in the Philippines and has called his mother his main inspiration in the kitchen. Some of the cooking has a homey simplicity, like the arroz caldo, chicken in a ginger-laced rice porridge that can be cranked up with a dab of red chile paste or left to its own, soothing charms. In other dishes, Mr. Cunanan stretches tradition to wrap it around local ingredients. In the Philippines, laing would be made by stewing dried taro leaves in coconut milk. At Bad Saint, the leaves are kale, braised to a velvety tenderness and swaddled in Chesapeake crab meat. This laing is so luxuriously flavorful, I can’t get it out of my head, and I don’t want to. If you don’t get into the first seating, you might spend the cocktail hour checking the screen on your phone while you wait a few doors down at Room 11, also owned in part by Mr. Pimentel. Once you gain entry, you can have one of the Filipino-influenced mixed drinks like the Chili Manilli (spicier than I wanted with this food) or a home-brewed green mango soda (lovely). Bad Saint carried about three wines when it opened. Now the selection is almost long enough to be called a list, and is wisely centered on lively, aromatic bottles like a red grenache from Tarragona or a still white from Catalonia that is a blend of xarello and riesling. The beers are even more esoteric and reflect this restaurant’s easy assurance that people come here to be turned on to something new. I especially admire Bad Saint’s refusal to translate Filipino food into the European-derived idioms of fine dining. When the servers say the dishes are served family style, they mean it. There’s no artfully blank space on the plates, no Abstract Expressionist smears of sauce. The food goes from the wok to the plate, and it is relentlessly delicious. Because the cuisine of the Philippines is so closely tied to home cooking, it’s been hard to imagine what a three-star Filipino restaurant would look like. Now I know that it looks like Bad Saint.",Filipino Food Worth the Wait at Bad Saint in Washington,"['washington', 'spent', 'roughly', 'twice', 'many', 'standing', 'sidewalk', 'outside', 'bad',

100,Fish Cheeks,★,2016-11-22,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/dining/fish-cheeks-review-restaurant-noho.html,NoHo,"In the early days of Thai cuisine in the United States, when pad Thai and spring rolls were exotic treats, Americans fell hard for the interlocking tastes of lime, fish sauce, chiles and herbs. Over the years, that love has grown lukewarm. Many of the restaurants weren’t very good to begin with, and watered-down, sloppy Americanized versions of dishes from central Thailand were the only Thai food many Americans knew. When a reformist tide of traditional Thai food began rolling in about a decade ago, it was led by restaurants specializing in the cooking of the north and northeast regions. Now, when thrill chasers tell you about Thai meals that realigned their taste buds, they’re likely to be talking about Kris Yenbamroong’s organ- and chile-laden cooking at his two Night & Market restaurants in Los Angeles, or Johnny Monis’s sticky-rice-centric set menus at Little Serow in Washington, D.C., or Andy Ricker’s deep repertoire of Isan dishes at the far-flung outposts of Pok Pok. This northward expansion has brought eye-opening discoveries. It’s also made it painfully obvious how desperately the central and southern Thai food available to Americans needs an overhaul, the way the last shirt I bought made it clear that I could use a haircut. All of this is to explain why I’m so interested in Fish Cheeks, a new restaurant in NoHo that focuses on traditional seafood dishes from around Thailand. The menu isn’t particularly adventurous or long by Thai standards, with just five appetizers and nine family-style main courses. Service is still in the eager-but-wobbly toddler stage, and the cocktail list is not so much a minefield as a box of live grenades. But the cooking is fresh, vivid and intense. The kitchen is in the hands of Chat Suansilphong and his brother, Ohm, who cooked at Nahm in Bangkok under its erudite and painstaking chef, David Thompson. Fish Cheeks doesn’t aspire to the worldwide recognition Nahm has won. But the neighbors seem to be enjoying it, filing under the awning of fish-scale shingles to take their places on wooden chairs painted blue, yellow and hot pink. On the black-and-white letter board that lists the daily specials is a note proclaiming “No pad Thai zone.” This may be true, but it gives the impression that Fish Cheeks is going to take you on a wild ride careening down the unmarked back roads of Thai cuisine. This isn’t quite accurate. The Suansilphongs, in fact, serve tom yum, the sour and spicy soup that can be found at almost every Thai restaurant in the land; often it’s watery and acrid. The version here hums with fresh galangal, lime leaves and lemongrass. Shrimp and knobby mushrooms simmer in a broth that gets extra body from milk, a twist I’ve never seen before but one I approve of. It could be spicier, but the use of bird’s-eye chiles is far from shy. Woon sen, the transparent noodles that are almost as widespread as tom yum, are baked with shrimp and pork belly in a sweet, Chinese-influenced casserole. From southern Thailand comes a lush and complex crab curry, rich from coconut milk and hypnotically aromatic from freshly ground spices. Nam tok, a northeastern salad of grilled meat with green herbs and shallots, is another familiar sight, but the pork is more flavorful than usual, with a deeply satisfying char on the edges. And I wish every Thai restaurant could make fried chicken with shallot rings and a classic sweet red-chile dipping sauce that is as engaging as the appetizer version at Fish Cheeks. If you’ve ever eaten a Thai seafood dish that was undermined by the shallow-pond flavor of farmed fish, you’ll understand why I hope the Suansilphongs keep using local bluefish. In one recurring special, they steam a big skin-on fillet and serve it in a pot that bubbles as it lands on the table. The broth is mild on its own, but the spicy green nam jim sauce and the fresh bird’s-eye chiles liberally tossed over the top are exactly the kinds of aggressive partners that bluefish enjoys sparring with. Bird’s-eye chiles also brought a pleasantly psychedelic level of heat to raw butterflied shrimp flash-marinated in fish sauce, lime and garlic. The dish turns up at Somtum Der, among other local restaurants, and the version here is forceful enough to suggest that the brothers have faith that people on Bond Street can take a little pain. For the ones who like to walk on the mild side, there is a very likable branzino that has been fried to a golden crackle with garlic. On the side is a dish of fish sauce, which you should dump on top. It’s almost laughably uncomplicated, and while I wouldn’t try to make a meal of it alone, it’s useful as a spacer between more intense bites. I would recommend Fish Cheeks even more loudly if the cooking had been more consistent. Pad cha, a stir-fry of mixed seafood with wild ginger, little eggplants and grapelike clusters of green peppercorns, was bracingly intense one night. It was unremarkable a week later, and green-lipped mussels in a perfectly good galangal and lemongrass broth had been cooked so furiously they were rubbery. On the short list of mixed drinks, I didn’t object to the iced tea with Cognac, which tasted like a Southeast Asian milk punch. The old-fashioned was bitter in ways that didn’t help it make its case, though, and the mango sticky-rice cocktail simply made me wish I could have mango sticky rice. There’s just one dessert on the menu, a Thai tea panna cotta. Servers usually mentioned it offhandedly, as if it didn’t make much difference whether you ordered it or not. This turned out to be the case. But nobody judges Thai restaurants by their desserts. What comes before is what counts, and Fish Cheeks had won me over by the end of the meal. It’s not a groundbreaking restaurant; it simply cooks the way I wish more Thai kitchens did.",Thai Food Strikes Out in a Fresh Direction at Fish Cheeks,"['early', 'day', 'thai', 'cuisine', 'united',

101,TsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie,★,2016-11-15,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/16/dining/tsurutontan-udon-noodle-brasserie-restaurant-review.html,Union Square,"The news reports filled the city with gloom. From out of a big Manhattan real estate firm had come a change that few locals expected or wanted. Reactions were apocalyptic. There was a shared fear that we were moving in the wrong direction, that the values of our community were being trampled by dark, hostile forces. I speak, of course, of Union Square Cafe’s losing its lease after 30 years, when the landlord decided in 2014 to drastically raise the rent for the space on East 16th Street. Danny Meyer’s first restaurant, for many years one of the most beloved in New York, moved out. Writers and internet commenters saw it as another step toward a Manhattan in which independent and worthwhile restaurants can’t make it. It seemed likely that the proposed $650,000-a-year rent would scare off any business that wasn’t part of a chain. That part was true. But the chain that moved in turned out to be more interesting than another franchise selling lattes in paper cups or burgers in paper wrappers. TsuruTonTan Udon Noodle Brasserie is the first United States location for an operation that owns 13 restaurants in Japan. It’s now easier to find a ramen shop in Manhattan than a mailbox, but udon specialists are rare. As far as I can tell, TsuruTonTan is the only one that mixes, kneads, rolls and cuts the dough for these long, pale wheat noodles on site. They have almost no flavor and are the opposite of delicate. But their consistency, the way they slide past your lips and spring back against your teeth, provides a distinct physical pleasure that will surprise anybody who has had only shaggy, overcooked udon that starts breaking apart before you have a chance to chew it. This is the rare restaurant where the servers’ explanations of how to order is actually helpful. “With any of our udons, you can choose thick or thin noodles,” I was told the first time I ate at TsuruTonTan. Thick ones are suggested for the hot soups, and thin for the chilled udon with dipping sauce on the side. “You can also order a large udon, which just means extra noodles, for the same price.” I liked this place already, and I didn’t change my mind after learning I wasn’t allowed to take home leftovers. This rule is apparently not meant to encourage customers to act as if they’re in the Nathan’s hot dog eating contest; our server said the restaurant just hadn’t found takeout cartons it was happy with. Following instructions, I ordered my chilled udon with thin noodles, about the diameter of bucatini. In TsuruTonTan’s uni udon, they were slicked down with a majestically rich sauce of sea urchin and dashi. In the zaru udon, they had been wound in a loose figure eight like yarn and placed on ice chips. Before I got to eat them, I had a job to do, mashing sesame seeds with a birch pestle and stirring them together into a soy dipping sauce with scallions and ginger. It’s a summer dish. I responded to the cold splash of udon in my mouth with an appreciative shiver in October. Under the direction of the chef, Tomoya Tamaru, the menu switch-hits between soups with this kind of lean Japanese purity and more zaftig concoctions. In the first category are the soups with sliced duck breast or the one with Wagyu rib-eye shavings slowly warming on the surface of a carefully balanced broth. Both broths are built on a deeply savory and focused dashi, although the rib-eye shavings were a little too hard to locate in a dish costing $19. The broths, savory with fish and seaweed, did not taste fatty or leave me with that sensation of having swallowed a boiled football that I sometimes get from ramen. On Team Zaftig, we have bowls like “truffle crème with mushroom,” a full-on swoon in which Parmigiano-Reggiano, cream and truffle oil swirl together into a kind of Japanese Alfredo. The broth is so intensely creamy I couldn’t finish it, but that’s no sin in an udon restaurant. TsuruTonTan’s Japanese curry is more sauce than soup, too. The thick liquid is not especially spicy, but it is very good with a tonkatsu-style pork cutlet, tempura shrimp and shaved beef in the $23 “curry deluxe.” I was less taken by the mentaiko broth; the scoop of spicy cod roe in the middle of the bowl didn’t save the soup from tasting a little heavy-handed. In Japan, like most udon specialists, TsuruTonTan mostly sticks to its noodles. To woo New York, the company whipped up a bunch of new donburi and appetizers such as spicy tuna cones, heavily accessorized sashimi, and fried chunks of chicken in a tartar sauce the color of borscht. Rather than describing each individually, I’ll share a handy method I came up with for dealing with all of them at once. Unfold the menu and place it on the table so that you see the noodle dishes. The reverse side, with the appetizers and donburi, will be face down. Now, never turn the menu over. If you have accidentally learned the name of a dish printed there, don’t say it out loud. Even when TsuruTonTan is very good, you never forget that it’s a chain. But if you leave aside the stuff it shouldn’t be serving anyway, it’s a very impressive chain. Soups come in heavy, gorgeous ceramic bowls made by Japanese potteries that have access to intensely colorful glazes. The larger ones are big enough to give a puppy a bath in. Servers are well versed in the menu, paying close attention when somebody at the table told them about a food allergy. Although they’re busy when the place fills up, they take time to greet customers on the way in and the way out, and they’ll guide you to the restroom as if they were working in a much more formal restaurant. Several times, I got to watch people who had not realized where they were sitting suddenly recognize the bones of Union Square Cafe. The space has lost its old dowdiness and gained an energetic horizontality that makes a virtue of the low ceilings, though the design doesn’t do much to dampen the noise. The crowd is different now, of course, with a lot of young Japanese noodle enthusiasts. As I looked around, the anger directed at the remorseless workings of the rental market seemed misplaced. The engines of New York real estate may plow under the past, but they also clear the ground for new opportunities. A far more direct threat to the values of the New York dining community is the snarling hostility to immigrants now at loose in the country. As a restaurant critic, I am very concerned about where this will lead. New Yorkers have been told lately that they live in a bubble, but it is a large bubble with room for people from many other countries and cultures. Real estate shapes the city’s food scene, but a longstanding openness to different ways of cooking and living, a curiosity about Yemeni roast lamb or Oaxacan mole or Japanese noodle soup, defines it.","TsuruTonTan, a Japanese Chain That Knows Its Noodles","['news', 'report', 'filled', 'city', 'gloom', 'big', 'manhattan', 'real', 'estate', 'firm', 'change', 'local', 'expected', 'wanted',

102,Paowalla,★★,2016-11-08,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/09/dining/paowalla-review.html,SoHo,"After Tabla, Floyd Cardoz doesn’t owe New York anything. In his 11 years as the chef of that restaurant across from Madison Square Park, he used the language of Indian cuisine to say things we had never heard before. A native of Mumbai, he showed us that the Indian spice cabinet can perform many other tricks besides curry. Upstairs at Tabla, he helped end the era in which the fine-dining wing of the restaurant business operated as a club to which cuisines of non-European descent need not apply. At the bottom of the winding staircase, in the little lounge known as Bread Bar, he showed us that a serious chef could pull off a more affordable and accessible menu without pandering. Restaurants that change people’s perceptions don’t come along very often, though. So in assessing Mr. Cardoz’s new restaurant, Paowalla, it’s more productive to view the things it does well (and there are a lot) as a bonus, without getting caught up in the ways in which it doesn’t quite live up to Tabla. The next two jobs Mr. Cardoz held in New York after Tabla closed in 2010 took him away from Indian cooking. In theory, North End Grill and White Street could have set him free. In practice, neither gave free rein to his talents. Luckily for him and for us, he is his own boss at Paowalla, and he’s cooking Indian food again. Reaching into his back catalog, Mr. Cardoz is serving some dishes and even a couple of cocktails, like the mind-clearing cucumber-gin highball called the Kachumber Cooler, that are flashbacks to Tabla and Bread Bar. He found a corner spot in SoHo that used to be an Italian restaurant. The wood-fueled pizza oven in the middle of the dining room was a stroke of luck, fitting in with the theme that also led to the name. Paowalla means bread seller, and breads lead the menu. They come in many shapes and sizes, from the familiar standards like naans and rotis to more exotic forms. Pao are yeasted dinner rolls, a Portuguese-derived specialty of Goa with a slight, charming sweetness. (If you grew up with Parker house rolls, you want to drop a pat of butter on them.) The white spirals called tingmo are Tibetan steamed buns, which Mr. Cardoz treats like cinnamon rolls with chile paste where the cinnamon should be. Rosemary naan had almost no rosemary flavor, and naan stuffed with minced bacon wasn’t as irresistible as it should have been. But the kulcha filled with Cheddar was improbably wonderful. I understand why Mr. Cardoz has put the breads at the top of the batting order on his menu. But I think his policy of automatically serving them first, with nothing but chutneys to accompany them, is a mistake. These breads deserve to be on the table in the company of other food. They’re a little lonely on their own. A lot of the menu is made up of small plates, many of them snacklike and many served with bread, to the benefit of both bread and snack. The melting roasted bone marrow is terrific spread on sliced pao and drizzled with a thrilling chutney of fresh herbs and curry leaves. Potato fritters are sandwiched between halves of pao in a fun evocation of wada pao, a Mumbai street snack. A curried shrimp turnover is a homage to one that Mr. Cardoz remembers eating as a child on the beaches in Goa. I’d remember a hand pie this good, too. Another street snack he’s toying around with is chaat; the night I had it, he was making it with sweet potatoes and apples, an untraditional assemblage that made perfect sense. One likably eccentric aspect of Mr. Cardoz’s menu at North End Grill was the raft of egg dishes. Eggs make a more limited, but still memorable, appearance at Paowalla. Scrambled eggs patia are sultry with ginger and very, very soft; like the marrow, they come with sliced pao. Eggs kejriwal, meanwhile, is simple and totally likable: a sunny-side-up egg on toast ratcheted up by a green-chile chutney. With the larger plates, the playfulness and street-food allusions are mostly left behind. The results can be mixed. Mr. Cardoz has an excellent idea for getting New Yorkers to eat dal: He drops a globe of burrata in the middle of the plate. It’s one of the only large plates without meat or fish; in general, it’s a little tricker to eat a vegetarian meal at Paowalla than it should be. I wanted more flavor from the pork in baby pig vindaloo and a higher sour-to-sweet ratio from the sauce. And I wanted the bacon-and-chorizo biryani to be different in any number of ways: less saturated with smoke, more aromatic with spices, and probably cheaper than the $57 Paowalla is charging for it, although I might not whine about the price of this family-size portion if I had liked the way it tasted. The seafood main courses, though, tended to be very good, including the dogfish rubbed with a mildly spicy coating of coconut and tomatoes and then steamed inside a banana-leaf packet, or the whole sea bream roasted with a thick vein of vinegared spice paste inside. The menu sprawls, offering more than enough reasons to try Paowalla once. Whether you will come back depends on how much you mind the peculiarly disjointed dining space and service that can be unintentionally maddening. At first glance, Paowalla looks like a cozy neighborhood retreat, but several design decisions make it peculiarly uncomfortable. A row of stools facing a window puts anyone who sits there up for the inspection of pedestrians on Sullivan Street. The back end of the dining room is separated by a steel-and-glass partition, turning one medium-size space into two cramped, awkward ones and doing a real number on the acoustics. The most comfortable and, oddly enough, most peaceful evening I had at Paowalla was spent at a sidewalk table. That night was also free of a hovering, mosquitolike service style that I encountered inside. Once I had been spotted, somebody was always leaning in to clear a glass, or fill one, or wipe the table, or make room for another plate. When a new course arrived, before anybody had a chance to try any of it, I heard a question that was new to me. “First impressions?” It’s bad enough to be asked, as happens more and more often lately, “How are the first few bites tasting?” If we have to give opinions on how the food looks without tasting it, we may as well stay home looking at Instagram.",An Indian Chef Comes Home Again at Paowalla

103,Le Coucou,★★★,2016-11-01,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/dining/le-coucou-review.html,SoHo,"New York City cannot compete with Los Angeles’s patchwork quilt of cuisines, Northern California’s sainted ingredients, New Orleans’s discerning and passionate diners. What sets New York’s restaurant culture apart is that it never quite shakes the past and has never fully severed its ties to Europe. This is why New York can seem to be stuck in the last century, but it also explains its unusual receptivity to news from across the Atlantic. (No American city has been as fast to take up natural wines or the New Nordic mode.) With Le Coucou, this attention to Europe and attachment to the past come together in ways that are creative and fresh. The chef, Daniel Rose, runs a restaurant in Paris called Spring, but he’s from Chicago. He has said that his old-guard French menu is meant in part as a homage to Lutèce, a restaurant in Manhattan that he never visited. (It closed 12 years ago.) In other words, a chef who knows a lot about what actual French people are eating in 2016 has decided to summon a long-closed Manhattan restaurant that gave many Americans their ideas about French cuisine in the last four decades of the 20th century. This idea would make no sense anywhere but New York. It may not make sense here, either, but of all the restaurants to open in the city over the last year, Le Coucou would be my first pick for visitors from out of town who wanted a meal they couldn’t have back home. Not that it’s a tourist restaurant. Locals have been pouring through the doors at the south end of Lafayette Street since they opened, in the last week of spring, and reservations are scarce unless you want to eat before 6 p.m. or after 9:30. A lot of the love is due to Mr. Rose’s decision to bring back the long-gone high style of French cuisine. At Spring, his first restaurant in Paris, he put market produce in the foreground, following the seasons and his own contemporary impulses. Le Coucou’s cooking is more informed by old-school traditions and focused on animal parts, like the bands of fried tripe, crunchy on the outside and wonderfully creamy within. Or the eel fried in a sheath of rye batter, sauced with a vinaigrette that has a subtle and somehow very French flavor of curry. Much of the cooking revolves around glossy, spoon-coating, cream- and butter-reinforced sauces that some younger diners have never tasted. These sauces aren’t remotely heavy or deadening, two of the charges hurled at them when they were led to the guillotines by the Robespierres of nouvelle cuisine. In fact, they are so dynamic, the contours of their flavors so precise and rewarding, that smart diners lick the sauces from the heavy, scrolled, silver-plated tablespoon set to the right of the gold-rimmed plates, waiting for just this purpose. When the bourride arrived, I used the tablespoon to drink the shellfish fumet that a server had ladled from a copper sauté pan over a fillet of black sea bass in a soup bowl. I used it again to stir the smooth yellow aioli into the fumet, and again to taste the garlic-ridden aioli on its own. There were clams and a prawn in the sauté pan, too, and they were excellent. But the body and balance of the fumet were so right that it became the point of the dish; the shellfish were mere pretext. It’s no accident that after Americans swore off rich sauces, they began to hunger for fatty cuts like pork butt and rib-eye. But you can see the point of the old high style when you eat Le Coucou’s beef filet. The lean, rosy slices taste pure and clean; the decadence is supplied by ovals of soft beef marrow and by the marrow jus spooned over the meat. A side dish that comes with the beef is a rare mismatch: thin, crunchy slices of potatoes boulangère that don’t absorb the juices of the braised oxtail underneath. A bulging lobe of sweetbreads, scored with a knife and seared in a pan, is wonderful with its surrounding sauce, but you will also want to get some of that lively union of cream, white wine, tomatoes and fresh, minty tarragon on its own. You’ll also need to taste the brandy and lobster in the foamy sauce Américaine both with and without the delicate white mound of a pike quenelle. After eating that dish, a Francophile friend pronounced, “Downtown finally has its La Grenouille.” True enough, but I’d add that the food coming out of Le Coucou’s kitchen is more focused, the ingredients are finer, and the service is more tuned in. As for the wine list constructed by Aaron Thorp, it is better in every way you can name. Mr. Rose and his partner, Stephen Starr, allow themselves a couple of stagy visual references to those old French restaurants. The menu is written in French, although there are English subtitles. The cooks all wear tall white toques, and for many customers, Le Coucou will probably be the first place they’ve seen that piece of headgear outside children’s books. For the most part, though, Le Coucou carefully avoids the things that people found intimidating about the old Le and La restaurants. Mr. Rose wears a black shirt and no toque; his modern outfit sets the tone for the dining room. To the right of the front door is an intimate, soft-focus cocktail alcove that doubles as a waiting area. There are no seats at the bar, which is too bad if you want to eat by yourself, but which also gives the room a little bit of romance. The space opens up as you enter the dining room, with chandeliers that look like concentric rings of votive candles suspended above the white tablecloths, each of which is set with a single white taper. What Le Coucou achieves in its look and feel is impressive. It has an elegance that is well outside the everyday rumble of New York life but that doesn’t have any of the heaviness in décor or the off-putting reserve that nobody really misses from the old days. The only place where Le Coucou falls slightly on the wrong side of the line between casual and formal is in Daniel Skurnick’s desserts. They’re lovely, but some seem too relaxed after the rigorously elegant main courses. There’s a roasted pear stuffed with vanilla ice cream standing gracefully upright amid candied almonds, the golden folds of its skin clinging to it like a silk shawl. But other desserts, like the rice pudding with chopped pistachios or the chocolate mousse under leafy chocolate shavings, have a slouching, stuff-in-a-bowl informality that seems to belong in a wine bar. (A wine-bar annex to Le Coucou isn’t a bad idea, by the way.) One night, I sat next to two Parisian women who said they were regulars at Spring. A French-speaking waiter appeared and engaged them in a long deliberation about the cheese course. They sent over their cheese, we shared our desserts, and then I slipped outside with them while they lit up their Gauloises. “This is very different from Spring,” one said. “But it makes sense in New York.”",Le Coucou Pays Rich Homage to Old-School French Cuisine,"['city', 'cannot', 'compete', 'los', 'angeles’s', 'patchwork', 'quilt', 'cuisine', 'northern', 'california’s', 'sainted', 'ingredient',

104,The Beatrice Inn,★★,2016-10-25,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/26/dining/beatrice-inn-review.html,West Village,"The last time I reviewed the Beatrice Inn, the going was tough. Formerly a nightclub that reliably infuriated its neighbors in the West Village, the place had just been rehabilitated by new owners, including the magazine editor Graydon Carter, who envisioned a chophouse of old-establishment sensibilities. They were on their third chef by the time I wrote it up with a Satisfactory rating, in the spring of 2013. All three had obvious talent. As far as I could tell, they were just having trouble making food that was as dull as the owners wanted. The restaurant hired its fourth chef later that year. Her name is Angie Mar. A dinner there not long after she took over convinced me that the kitchen was moving in the right direction, but it did not hint that she would eventually make the Beatrice Inn into a meat lover’s palace with a menu unlike any other in the city. Ms. Mar, who bought the restaurant over the summer, still calls it a chophouse, but it is no longer a place where cautious eaters seek refuge from the unknown. Her Beatrice Inn offers an irresistible opportunity to take chances and eat with abandon. She refers to the past, all right; the restaurant is big on vintage silver tongs and serving spoons whose patterns glint in the low light. But Ms. Mar isn’t looking for safety. She’s mining history for neglected pleasures and forgotten indulgences. A quick look at the menu tells you the direction her kitchen obsessions take. The main courses are divided into “Of the Land” (12 choices) and “From the Sea” (two). A couple of the meat dishes are said to serve two people, others are meant for two to four, and the tomahawk rib-eye roasted on a bone the size of a cricket bat is simply listed as “for the table.” When an animal can be cooked and served in one piece, that is what Ms. Mar will do. There is a whole rabbit smoked over apple wood, giving it the flavor of meat wrapped in bacon and roasted, except that the smoke goes all the way down to the bone. Ducks, meanwhile, are cured in salt for four days, then smoked, then slowly roasted, then doused with flaming booze at the table. The skin is dark, and the meat is pink and pull-apart tender; it reminded me of a slow-cooked Easter ham. The entire-animal approach is not restricted to animals. A side dish on a recent night was a carnival squash, roasted whole and carved at the table, like a chicken. Knowing all this, I should have been ready for the cheese incident. Before dessert one night, a server brought out a platter with an ash-coated pyramid of Valençay, a white and gently slumping wheel of a Rensselaer County triple cream, and a stack of shaggy leaves of clothbound Cheddar, each with its own jam or honey. We said we’d like some of the Valençay. “You realize that you’ll be getting that whole pyramid, right?” our server asked. We hadn’t, but we were game (though it would have been nice if he had warned us that we’d pay $38 for it). Or you could just get a burger. The patties are tall, firm and moist with fat in the style of the Spotted Pig, where Ms. Mar used to cook. The ones in the dining room are made from beef aged for a month and a half. Lamb burgers are sold at the bar, where you can also get a manhattan served inside a crystal candy jar that the bartender has filled with a cloud of wood smoke. But the best chef-engineered burger can’t hold my attention the way a really good classic stew does. My last time at the bar, I sat down in front of half a dozen Nova Scotia oysters followed by a hulking stump of oxtail braised in Madeira. I ate the beef with a spoon, as I’d been instructed, scooping up the juices and stewed prunes and honest-to-goodness mashed potatoes. Enjoy your burgers, kids. Ms. Mar brings back champvallon de tête, an old French artillery piece in the battle against hunger. Beef cheeks and veal are braised separately and then, when they have reached different forms of seductiveness, combined with chanterelles and porcini. The whole stew is then baked under a thin fan of sliced potatoes. It is like shepherd’s pie cooked by very happy shepherds. The game pie is very much in the same vein, although here the stew is a mix of venison, lamb and boar. The only true game animal is the boar, but Ms. Mar coaxes a brawny flavor, not fully tamed, from the combination of meats. The crust, an expanse of golden suet pastry, was a little tough the night I ate it, but I’d rather have an overworked suet crust than no suet crust at all. On another night, the suet crust under a savory tart of fall plums was much more tender, though there was still room for improvement. Pastry is not the kitchen’s strong suit. One of two desserts is a fried pie whose apple filling was jarringly oversalted on a recent night. The better choice, and really the only choice if you have bought into the Mar aesthetic, is the crème brûlée in a marrow bone. It is lovely and weird, the familiar custard supplemented with a flavor that is unmistakably animal. Ms. Mar cooks animals, of course, but she also cooks for animals. She cooks for the animals that we are. She knows we have powerful senses of smell, that we can be led by our appetites, that certain instincts kick in when we sit together taking another animal apart. In many ways, the Beatrice Inn resembles a steakhouse, but Ms. Mar has given it a strong undertow of sensuality that would be unwelcome in most steakhouses, where the rites of male bonding are well established and don’t encourage unexpected detours into pleasure. In fact, the restaurant is one of the few meat joints in town that doesn’t seem to be pitched to men. Not all of Ms. Mar’s obsessions strike me as wise. Her bourbon-aged rib-eye, based on a technique she learned from the French butcher Yves-Marie Le Bourdonnec in which beef is kept wrapped in whiskey-soaked cloth for more than a hundred days, tasted to me like a very expensive hangover. But she has a vision. A vision isn’t the same as a concept. In the restaurant business, a concept is a market niche, while a vision can lead beyond the bounds of business sense, or any other kind. Ms. Mar might draw more customers if she didn’t seem to look down on vegetables, for instance. If that’s not a deal breaker for you, though, her cooking will seem especially wonderful because it’s so clear that she believes in what she’s doing. By following her gut, she has made the Beatrice Inn one of the most celebratory restaurants in the city. I don’t mean that you should go there to celebrate an anniversary or a new job. It’s a place to go when you want to celebrate your life as an animal.","At the Beatrice Inn, Cuisine for Animals","['last', 'reviewed', 'beatrice', 'inn', 'going', 'tough', 'formerly', 'nightclub',

105,Karasu,★,2016-10-18,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/19/dining/karasu-zadies-oyster-room-review.html,Fort Greene,"Restaurants have made bar food their own. In fancy kitchens serving fancy dining rooms, chefs have found almost inconceivably fancy ways to make pub and roadhouse food. The burgers are ground to order and slapped on rolls fresh out of the oven; the hot dogs are squirted with proprietary condiments; the Tater Tots are enrolled in elite private day care. Bars have to fight back somehow. Some of the smartest ones are taking the high road. They’re serving what would have been considered fairly ambitious restaurant food back when categories like that still made sense. To get to Karasu, you enter a small and well-populated corner tavern called Walter’s, across from Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn. You walk past the bar, past the kitchen, past the restrooms, and stop when you get to the midnight-blue wall in the back. At this point, some people decide they’re in the wrong place and walk out. Don’t. Locate the handle, push gently on the door and step inside. These speakeasy shenanigans may annoy you, particularly when the speakeasy in question is advertised on a chalkboard out on the sidewalk, but it’s hard to hold a grudge once you’re inside. Dark and tranquil, its only window so near the ceiling that the room is effectively cloistered from the street, Karasu is a refuge from noise and crowds. The first surprising thing about the food is that there is any. The second is that it’s so polished and considered. The kitchen is a box at the end of the bar so cramped that most D.J.’s would refuse to work in it. A space this size usually calls for reduced expectations. Yael Peet and Elena Yamamoto, the chefs, have other ideas. Their menu can read like an izakaya’s, but the plates have all sorts of subtle flourishes that most izakayas wouldn’t bother with. Sashimi could be a matter of shopping and slicing. At Karasu, it’s more than that. On a recent night, bonito was marinated in soy and sake, then gently smoked over smoldering mesquite. Finally, it was rolled in ground sesame and seared. A lot had happened to this tuna, but the flavors were restrained, and very agreeable. The wonderful Japanese sweet potatoes, just coming into season, had been deep-fried with kabocha squash and set in a soy-enhanced syrup. Steamed hard-shell clams were excellent in ponzu sauce, and thin slices of octopus made a welcome appearance with crunchy marinated cucumbers. Some things, like the terrific assortment of pickled daikon, work best as punctuation marks between sips of cocktails. When you start thinking about dinner, there is pasta with mentaiko sauce; the spicy red dots of cod roe are embellished with uni, and the thin noodles were rolled and cut on the premises, somewhere. One night they were slightly limp, always a risk with fresh pasta, but on another they were ideally firm and bouncy. If more serious hunger calls, there is a generous tonkatsu, left fairly thick and fried on the bone. Still more impressive is the koji-rubbed rib-eye, forcefully blackened on both sides and served sliced in a skillet, basted in its own fat. In the heat of the moment, I declared that it was better than the steak at Peter Luger. I am pretty sure I meant it. The first few times I walked through the black door, what I had in mind was a mixed drink or two. Overseen by Thomas Waugh, formerly the chief barman at ZZ’s Clam Bar in Manhattan, they reflect the punctilious Japanese approach to cocktail culture. (The heavy brass mold behind the bar that will melt the corners off a large ice cube and turn it into a large ice ball comes from Japan.) Some of the drinks, like a refocused mai tai called the Nettai, paddle through the lagoons of Polynesia with restraint and elegance, an unusual sight in those lagoons.  Wine is in the genetic makeup of Zadie’s Oyster Room, in the East Village. It replaces a wine bar called Fifty Paces, which replaced a wine bar called Terroir. The common thread linking all three is the chef Marco Canora. Mr. Canora converted Terroir to Fifty Paces soon after splitting with his business partner Paul Grieco, and the place had the provisional quality often found in the apartments of freshly divorced men. With Zadie’s, he seems to have regained his footing. Zadie’s chef, Devin Dearden, devotes his menu to the oyster in all its edible forms. Oysters are of course served raw on ice, with a good mignonette and an irrelevant cocktail sauce. But they are also broiled under minced seaweed and Parmigiano-Reggiano in a nervy, compelling take on oysters Rockefeller; poached in sherry and cream along with late-summer succotash for a soup that is halfway between oyster stew and chowder; and steamed with garlic, vermouth and butter, a suave oyster-dunking sauce that becomes a soup once you add oyster crackers. The only dud method is pickling, and the problem there may have been that the oysters were lost amid a heap of bitter greens and puréed seaweed. Mr. Canora seems to have realized that the huge growth in cultivating oysters hasn’t been matched by similar progress in cooking them. New York restaurants serve them raw, almost invariably. If Zadie’s can nudge a few chefs into rethinking this, it could signify the start of a new chapter in the city’s long relationship with oysters. And if not, I’ll still drop by when I’ m craving smoked bluefish spread, a New England treat that almost never turns up this far south. And I’ve never craved a tuna melt in my life, but that may only be because I’d never tasted the one at Zadie’s.","They May Be Bars, but Don’t Tell the Chefs","['bar', 'fancy', 'kitchen', 'serving',

106,Pondicheri,★★,2016-10-11,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/12/dining/pondicheri-restaurant-review.html,NoMad,"“This is the first place you’ve taken me where I’d come back and spend my own money,” a friend said in the middle of lunch at Pondicheri. He is highly sensitive to pretension and unjustified expense, so whenever I take him along on one of my hunting parties, I try to pick something with a high ratio of flavor to price. At Pondicheri, I finally hit his sweet spot. By that time, I was sure I’d be back, too. The chef and owner, Anita Jaisinghani, chose New York as the first site of a string of all-day Indian cafes she hopes to open around the country, modeled on her original Pondicheri in Houston. She also has a more formal Indian restaurant there called Indika, but if she brought that to Manhattan, she would have to compete with such restaurants as Paowalla, Tamarind Tribeca and Indian Accent. There isn’t anything in the city quite like Pondicheri. A few blocks north of the Flatiron Building, it inhabits a space so cavernous that maps may be useful. (It wasn’t until my fourth meal that I discovered a corner table hidden behind a wall all the way in the back of the restaurant.) The sheer number of seats is one of the things that makes it worth keeping in mind, because Pondicheri would work for so many occasions. When I wanted to have breakfast alone, I’d go to the front counter and ask for a cup of masala chai. Pondicheri makes it smooth and strong, with more than a whisper of spice. Then I’d find a table where I could eat the wonderful aloo paratha with my hands, loving the way the crisp shell collided with the soft potatoes inside, feeling the mustard oil rake the back of my throat, licking the ghee from my fingers. Or I might get the masala eggs, firmly scrambled with fennel, onions, peppers and spices, and then spread out over a wedge of spiced carrot paratha. For a morning meeting with people who’d never seen me lick ghee off my fingers, I’d probably point to a few things behind the glass pastry cases — whatever looked good that day. I’d hope for a return of the fig cake I had last week, essentially fig preserves baked into a muffin top. And I’d keep an eye out for the honey mesquite cake, which is delicate with almond and mesquite flour, savory with ginger and other warm spices. Honey has been spritzed around, but the cake hasn’t been drenched in it. It’s a delicious example of Ms. Jaisinghani’s strategy of importing Indian flavors into American daily life. The best time to take Pondicheri’s full measure is between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m., when servers at the counter will take orders for either breakfast or lunch. Beet uttapam is technically a breakfast dish here. But this spongy, slightly tangy pancake topped with a fried egg makes a perfect lunch; it is served on a thali platter next to little metal cups holding a nice crunchy salad, some cilantro chutney and a turmeric soup that tastes as if it held the secret of eternal health. In the nonvegetarian version, another cup carries a small crumbly heap of lamb keema, very tasty stuff. There are roti wraps called frankies, as well as salads and curries, like the chicken stewed in a tomato-tinged curry of unusual complexity. It’s named Chicken 25 after the number of seasonings in the curry, and it is worth asking for even though it sounds like a genetic engineering experiment. I liked this much more than the sayel lamb kofta, meatballs in a nondescript meat sauce. The snacks and side dishes that become available after 11 a.m. are exciting, too. I can’t remember a meat samosa that I liked better than the ones that Pondicheri fills with lentils and goat braised in spices. Papdi chaat, a plate of semolina crackers and lentil dumplings buried under yogurt and chutney, is completely messy and a joy to eat. My friend who’s planning to come back to Pondicheri insisted we get the fried okra, one of his benchmarks for Indian kitchens. Crunchy and free of any trace of goo, it passed his test. And I love Pondicheri’s “desi fries,” which start with curly fries (a very good place to start, as Maria von Trapp would say) that are blasted with an irresistible spice mix. After lunch, I stopped at the bakery counter, where the morning pastries had been replaced by cookies (there’s a great spiced chocolate chip and a puffy ginger cookie with a scalloped edge that makes it look like a paw) and appealing lemon bars that take their flavor more from the aromatic peel than from the sour juice. Raised in India, Ms. Jaisinghani earned a degree in microbiology, with the idea that she would eventually work as a pathologist. Her career was held up while she had two children. (Her daughter, Ajna Jai, now manages her New York City restaurant.) When she was ready to work again, she didn’t send her résumé to a laboratory but to one of the best restaurants in Houston. The two years she spent learning about flour, sugar and eggs in the pastry kitchen at Cafe Annie must account for the skill and creativity of Pondicheri’s bakery. If you go for dinner, the menu changes shape again. The food is a little dressier, is ordered at the table and falls more neatly into appetizers and main courses. My dinner started very well with tangy, tamarind-marinated quail, with a pine-nut stuffing tucked into the breast. Some lamb skewers were disappointingly dry, but I was wild about a version of saag paneer made with mustard greens; as soon as I tasted it, I knew I was going to crave the sharper, more assertive flavor the next time I had saag paneer made with spinach. The impressive size of Pondicheri may be an advantage at lunch, because it virtually guarantees that you will find a seat. At dinner, though, it works against the place. The crowds so far haven’t been big or energetic enough to fill the room, and even the long bar doesn’t do much to turn up the voltage. The staff can be a bit desultory, too, although I found this more charming than off-putting. (I loved the deadpan way our server said, describing the crudités appetizer, “All the vegetables come from the Greenmarket, if that’s of any interest.”) Pondicheri is not the place to take a crowd of people who want dinner to be the show. But that’s fine. It doesn’t need to do absolutely everything a restaurant can do when it already does several things so well.",Pondicheri Makes Indian Flavors an All-Day Affair,"['“this', 'place', 'you’ve', 'taken',

107,Sauvage,★,2016-09-27,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/dining/sauvage-restaurant-review.html,Greenpoint,"Roughly half of what I’ve eaten at Sauvage since it opened just before Memorial Day has been either forgettable or familiar. In the other half, though, this restaurant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, seemed to be on to something exciting, a combination of European kitchen discipline and a gut instinct for meeting appetite head on. Nothing I ate this summer knocked me back quite as hard as Sauvage’s pig head confit. The name is no figure of speech. This is the head of a pig in profile, flattened like a Cuban sandwich. I was still staring at it when a server said sweetly: “Just so you know: I forgot to mention that the sauce is made from the brains. It’s coming out of the ear.” When brain sauce is spilling from the ear of a pig, you don’t need to tell me what to do. I tore into the head, beginning with the tanned cheeks, following the curve of the smile and ending with the round snout, the size of a Ritz cracker. The skin was chewy and crunchy, with a compressed layer of firm meat underneath, basted in fat. On the side were plump white shell beans baked with some pig tongue, along with bitter greens in vinaigrette. The beans would have been creamier with a few more minutes in the oven, but on the whole, I couldn’t get over how skillfully done it all was. The chef is Lisa Giffen. She cooked for about three years at Adour Alain Ducasse, with shorter stays at Daniel and Blue Hill. In 2013, she was hired to run the kitchen of Maison Premiere, a cocktail parlor and raw bar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, whose owners opened Sauvage. I ate at Maison Premiere one night just after Ms. Giffen had started. I remember thinking that the compositions were pretty; the ingredients, especially the seafood, were excellent; and the portions were feathery, to the point that I wasn’t convinced I’d had dinner. There is some wispiness on the menu at Sauvage, too. Sea urchin with scraps of pickled watermelon rind didn’t make a lasting impression. A terrine of leeks with clams needed salt and acidity. A salad of peeled and pickled grapes, a recent special, wasn’t worth the obvious trouble that had gone into making it. The same was true of a plate of tiny stuffed vegetables, including a baby eggplant that was cute but underbaked. But Ms. Giffen’s talents are best used when she abandons the miniaturist mode. There’s a full-throttle thrill to breaking open chilled snow crab legs and dunking their briny flesh in brown butter that’s reinforced with mashed crab liver. There’s undeniable pleasure in slicing open the malakoff, dough mixed with alpine-style cheese that’s lumped on a slice of sourdough and then deep fried. This bonanza of starch, cheese and oil comes with pickled vegetables. It should also come with a small mountain for you to you climb after you finish it. Ms. Giffen’s chicken pot-au-feu is an essay in beak-to-tail poultry cooking. The breast goes into delicate white sausages that share an enameled casserole with a confit of dark meat, mushrooms, carrots and fennel. The vegetables are braised but still crisp. On a separate plate is a slice of sourdough toast spread with whipped schmaltz and fragments of brittle skin; the menu doesn’t call them gribenes, but I will. The pot-au-feu is a small feast and, at $25, a great buy. The pig head confit is $65. While price is not likely to be a deciding factor for people who want brain sauce coming out of a pig’s ear, there is a more affordable cut of pork on the menu. An Old Spot porterhouse, set off with pickled rhubarb, was intensely good and cost $31. The meat, robustly seasoned and juicy, was cooked and served on a bone that was last seen between the teeth of a woman at my table. Like Liz Johnson at Mimi in Greenwich Village, Ms. Giffen doesn’t cook in a systematically French way; both chefs just borrow French ideas at will and both have the French knack for spurring desire and then satisfying it. You can taste Ms. Giffen’s respect for the Gallic kitchen in the way she makes potatoes: the creamy dauphinoise with strip steak, the lavishly buttered chunks and bits of potato with lobster (itself slicked down with olive oil and served with a subtle, earthy blood sauce). One area that would benefit from a more overtly French treatment is the dessert menu. Recently there was a honey panna cotta, a chocolate cremeux and a mascarpone semifreddo — three variations on a sweet, creamy substance with random stuff in it. Cheese, when it’s offered, is a more persuasive last course. Ms. Giffen is a partner in the restaurant along with Joshua Boissy and Krystof Zizka, the people behind Maison Premiere. When Maison Premiere opened in 2011, its attention to period details like the weathered French Quarter facade, the antique absinthe fountain and the suspendered barmen was so thorough that it was easy to believe you’d wandered into an underground party for enthusiasts of Belle Époque New Orleans cosplay. But there was a serious dedication to food and drink, both of which got better as the place went along. (The quality of the work at Maison Premiere’s bar won it an award from the James Beard Foundation this year.) For all the hype about Brooklyn restaurants, the ones that turn out to be most impressive often come together slowly. Before Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare and Roberta’s became national names, it was hard to tell whether they were following a grand, premeditated design or just making it up as they went along. Sauvage at least has the advantage of starting off with expertise that Maison Premiere needed several years to accumulate. It has Ms. Giffen. It has Will Elliot, a former bartender at the first establishment whose cocktail recipes and spirit choices at Sauvage I’ve enjoyed very much, even though I haven’t had a chance to try out all six forms of ice he is rumored to stock. It has a wine list whose shallow end is very rewarding and whose deep end betrays extensive, possibly obsessive attention. This is no doubt the case with the restaurant’s design, too, but this time the owners are not as interested in historical re-enactment. Sauvage, which sits across the street from McCarren Park and opens its cafe doors on warm days and nights, seems to come from another era, but it’s hard to say which one the owners had in mind. Maybe they’re making it up as they go along.","At Sauvage, European Discipline Meets Gut Instinct","['roughly', 'half', 'i’ve', 'eaten', 'sauvage', 'since', 'opened', 'memorial', 'either',

108,Günter Seeger NY,★★,2016-09-20,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/dining/gunter-seeger-ny-review.html,West Village,"It’s complicated to praise someone whose confidence already seems to be reinforced with steel and clad in granite. It’s even more complicated in the case of Günter Seeger, whose confidence is the source of both his success in the kitchen and his occasional capacity for sabotaging himself in the dining room. Even the believers in Mr. Seeger’s lyrical cooking, and I became one the first time I ate at his new restaurant in the West Village, have noted that his insistence on following his vision does not always work to his advantage. This has been a theme since his time in Atlanta, first at the Dining Room at the Ritz-Carlton, Buckhead, and then at his own restaurant, called Seeger’s. Christiane Lauterbach, an admirer from the moment she tasted his red cabbage (“Aha!” she remembers thinking. “A German who doesn’t cook like a German!”), wrote in Atlanta magazine in 1999 that his refusal to hire a parking valet at Seeger’s cost him money. Each time it poured, customers canceled their reservations so they wouldn’t have to get wet running from the lot to the front door. “Ja,” Mr. Seeger told her. “I do it my way.” Those who wanted to eat at Günter Seeger NY when it opened on Hudson Street in May had to do it his way, too. Instead of offering reservations, the restaurant sold tickets for $185 a person, service included. Paying for a meal in full up front always gives me the feeling that the restaurant is worried I’m going to try to dine and dash. I put up with it, grumblingly, only for restaurants that have limited seatings and offer something I can’t get anywhere else. What did Günter Seeger NY have, besides Mr. Seeger himself, who hasn’t had a restaurant since Seeger’s closed nine years ago? New Yorkers griped. Then, in a sign that he has learned to bend a little, Mr. Seeger dropped the ticket scheme. Now he offers reservations, with a $100-a-person fee for cancellations within 48 hours. The restaurant’s website also shows the day’s menu, now priced at $148 before tip and tax. It’s easier paying for dinner once you’ve put away 10 to 12 courses and a bottle of German riesling from Günter Seeger NY’s impressive stash. But it isn’t quite easy enough to keep you from wondering just what you’re getting for the money. One thing it doesn’t buy you is a lot of fabrics in the dining room. Velvety clusters of roses sit on the bare tables; the uncarpeted floors clatter with the footsteps of servers pacing back and forth; the brick walls are painted white and echo with stiff formalities. “Chef wants you to feel like he’s welcoming you into his home,” we were told one night. When you go to dinner there, do you have to call him Chef, too? This deeply undomestic dining room is overshadowed by the immense stainless-steel kitchen in the back, where Mr. Seeger and his crew are on display, moving soundlessly under lights of operating-room intensity. With every detail, Günter Seeger NY tells you that the food is the whole show. At these prices, it had better be close to perfect. And on my first two meals, it was. The cooking is deeply expressive — expressive of the season and of Mr. Seeger’s focused, disciplined style. He doesn’t try for bizarre juxtapositions. When you’re surprised by his cooking, it’s because the voice of the ingredients is coming through more clearly than you’re used to. Chilled pea soup had a beguiling, toasted depth, and even the garnish was delicious, an open pea pod stretched across the rim of a shot glass. On another night, the soup was lemon cucumber, and it was refreshing in the way you want a gin and tonic to be, or an afternoon shower. A squash blossom twisted around delicate lobster mousse was served with a distinctive squash blossom pesto, crunchy with pistachios and seasoned, thrillingly, with saffron. Mr. Seeger welcomed the return of matjes herring with an early-summer tartare that was bright with apples, cucumbers and the piercing taste of ginger. Abalone was quickly grilled, sliced and sent back to its shell with dashi, briny threads of sea bean and a live-wire dab of yuzukosho. There were moments of theatricality. One night, a server ferried a wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano the size of a wedding cake to the table. “This is your cheese course,” he said, then toted it away, returning a short time later with a plate dusted with grated cheese and grated pistachios and slivers of candied citron. It was very good. Mr. Seeger’s people like to say that he draws up the menus while wandering the farmers’ market each day. Like the bit about welcoming you into his home, this is largely fiction. He didn’t find abalone or Parmigiano-Reggiano in a New York City Greenmarket. Well, who cares whether he gets his inspiration in Union Square or while talking on the phone to his importer: The point is that he knows where to find ingredients that speak far more eloquently than any server reeling off prepared talking points. After two dinners, I was as convinced of the excellence of Mr. Seeger’s cooking as he seems to be. I knew the sterility of the dining room would keep some people away, and I wasn’t sure anybody should have to pay quite so much for dinner, but the cooking had a finesse that’s exciting to find because it’s so rare. Then, in my last meal, nothing was quite as exquisite. Mr. Seeger’s opening move that night was a ball of sweet, flat-tasting langoustine ice cream with caviar and a fragment of sea urchin. I love langoustines, and hated to see them end up like this. It was the first dish I’d had that might have come from Mr. Seeger’s recipe files from the ’90s rather than straight from his heart. Later in the meal, that great squash-blossom pesto came back, this time with a small European sole the size of my hand. It had spent both too much time on the grill and too little. Crosshatches of char overpowered the sole’s exquisite flavor, and yet the thickest part of the fish clung to the spine, not fully cooked. For all his confidence, Mr. Seeger must be feeling a bit exposed right now. His future in New York City is riding on a restaurant that’s both brilliant and off-putting. Before it opened, Mr. Seeger told an interviewer, “The food will be simplistic, but also technically perfect.” That’s a cool trick when it works. When it doesn’t, there’s nowhere to hide.","At Günter Seeger NY, a Star Chef Resurfaces, Confidence Intact","['it’s', 'complicated', 'praise', 'someone', 'whose', 'confidence', 'already', 'seems',

109,Hao Noodle and Tea by Madam Zhu’s Kitchen,★★,2016-09-13,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/dining/hao-noodle-and-tea-by-madam-zhus-kitchen-review.html,Greenwich Village,"In the hedonist’s view of American immigration patterns, bad times for chefs in China are good times for dumpling chasers and noodle hunters in New York. When experienced cooks couldn’t make a living there for political or economic reasons, they came here. Conversely, over the last decade or so, the hypertrophic Chinese economy has left the kitchens of our Chinatowns somewhat flattened, with fewer high peaks of talent standing out in the landscape. But a cash-flush China may be working to the advantage of New Yorkers for once. An energetic entrepreneur named Zhu Rong, who owns restaurants in four cities around China, recently expanded her territory to Greenwich Village with a place she has named (take a breath) Hao Noodle and Tea by Madam Zhu’s Kitchen (exhale). Ms. Zhu brought along a pair of chefs whose skillful manipulation of bubbling oil, steam and smoking-hot woks is evident in almost everything they cook. They also know a thing or two about dough and hot peppers. The traditions invoked by the menu come mainly from Beijing, Shanghai and Ms. Zhu’s hometown, Chongqing. The interpretations are contemporary. The portions are generally bigger than a street snack but smaller than one of those platters that descends with a thunk on the Lazy Susans of Chinatown. The food is sometimes arranged with an attention to negative space that can make you wish you saw less plate and more food. Balancing any spareness, though, are the spicy intensity of some dishes and the stripped-down purity of others. The chefs are virtuosic fryers, able to express many nuances in the simple language of crust. The coating on the fish fritters is almost as soft as cake crumbs, a pale gold tinted green by seaweed powder. It’s a subtle partner for the delicate fish inside. Crispy shrimp sauté has a more rugged crunch, almost in fried chicken territory, with dark, thrilling slips of dried chiles clinging to it. Between the two extremes are the wonderful cubes of creamy tofu inside a crisp and ultrathin shell; they’re like mozzarella sticks refined to the nth degree. Everything on the menu’s many pages gets a color photo, and it all looks good. Mostly, it is. Lunch or dinner might start with chilled appetizers like the fresh and tender clams in a stack of quietly seasoned Chinese chives; or the juicy smoked sole, marinated in sweet soy sauce. Both were exceptional. So was the chilled salad of poached grape tomatoes. Fizzy on the inside and infused with plum syrup, they were a quick respite from the weather on a muggy summer day. Cold sliced beef shank, a Sichuan notion, pulled its punches on the night I tried it. But other cold appetizers from that region, like the translucent logs of mung bean jelly stacked up under a chile and fermented black bean sauce, landed all the expected body blows and uppercuts. There are excellent wood ear mushrooms, floppy and crisp at the same time in their dressing of vinegar and a dose of chile oil that will sneak up on the unwary. The more familiar dishes are some of the least interesting. Sweet and sour pork with pineapple was less sugary than usual, but I still left it alone. Seafood pancakes are tough and oily triangles that lack the tender layering that makes scallion pancakes so appealing. Something called rainbow salad is a plate of quinoa and carrots that you’d be happy enough to find at the company cafeteria. All danger of dullness is obliterated, though, when Madam Zhu’s Spicy Fish Stew shows up. It’s a Sichuanese inspiration, with a flaky fish in a lightly sour green broth so packed with fresh chiles that it brought all conversation, not to mention rational thought, to a standstill. The noodles and dumplings are toward the back of the menu, and tend to arrive near the meal’s end. The bacon sticky rice shumai, sheer wrappers that barely contain their stuffing, have instantly entered New York’s gallery of great dim sum. Everybody at my table marveled, too, at the half-moons called clay pot dumplings: These tender wrappers of cooked egg folded over pork and water chestnuts are something like omelets crossed with pierogies that moved into a bowl of soup. The only part of the menu I found unreliable was, oddly enough, the noodles. On a night when the restaurant was at full capacity, the Taiwanese pork noodles were monotonously sweet, and the dan dan noodles were an unfocused blur. But they and other dishes — there’s a fascinating and novel bowl of fresh tomato soup with ragged hand-pulled flat noodles and gingery pork meatballs — were excellent on slower days. I wondered if the kitchen had simply been moving too quickly. To gloss one of the eight words in the restaurant’s name: The tea is very good. There is delicate silver needle and white peony, pungently herbal green tea grown at high elevations, and a fine aged oolong, among others. The servers never seem to suggest tea, but once you order it they do remember to refresh your pot with hot water until the leaves have given all they’ve got. Ms. Zhu is a refugee from the art gallery business and she brings an airy, creative aesthetic to her restaurants. With framed prints of Arne Svenson’s window-peeping photography on the walls and a long, rough-grained communal table in the center of the room, Hao Noodle and Tea looks like an especially nice Brooklyn espresso bar where the rapture has arrived and taken only the laptops. There is enough space between the white tables and chairs to drive a riding lawn mower. Even the people at my table who are normally unmoved by Chinese sweets were impressed by the desserts. Slippery, cool taro soup was soothingly bland, which is no put-down. The rosewater jelly was the real surprise, broken into shards as sparklingly clear as cold vodka.","The Spicy Spoils of China’s Boom, at Hao Noodle and Tea","['hedonist’s', 'view', 'american',

110,Cassia,★★★,2016-09-06,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/dining/cassia-santa-monica-restaurant-review-pete-wells.html,"Santa Monica, Calif.","Editors’ Note: The Times has published starred reviews of restaurants in the New York metropolitan area since 1963. Starting today, we will occasionally offer such reviews of restaurants in other cities as well, applying the same standards that govern our reviews in New York: a minimum of three anonymous visits to the restaurant. SANTA MONICA, Calif. — On my table at Cassia was a thick, black, gnarled pig tail. The menu said it was grilled, but I was ready to believe it had been incinerated in a rage, as if I had mortally insulted the chef and serving me this stick of carbon were his revenge. But the nice woman waiting on me didn’t seem to think anything was wrong. She seemed excited for me. Would I like her to cut it up, she asked? “Um,” I began. Before I finished, she slid a knife’s point down the length of the tail. “I want to make sure you really get all the meat,” she said, lifting out links of bone. “Sometimes I see people serving themselves, and they don’t get into it the right way.” She got into it, all right, leaving me with a heap of meat, soft fat and skin. It was not nearly as annihilated as it looked at first glance. I rolled a forkful or two into a curl of Bibb lettuce with some Thai basil, cilantro and laksa leaf, and dipped it into nuoc cham. The antiphony of char and fat, cool leaves and warm grease, fish sauce and green herbs is in the end a simple thing. Or it would be simple if Vietnamese stalls across the United States sold grilled pig tails. One of the most appealing things about Cassia, a year-old restaurant here, is its pointed lack of interest in being confrontational, as my meeting with the pig tail illustrates. The restaurant goes out of its way to be accommodating, without doing too much violence to the various Asian cuisines that inspire much of the menu. Bryant Ng, the chef, isn’t in the business of scrawling his signature on other countries’ cultures. He doesn’t max out the fat and the funk, the standard tactic now for American cooks who want to let it be known that they are down with Asian cuisines. He’s more focused on balance than extremes. Mr. Ng owns Cassia with his wife, Kim Ng, and another couple, Josh Loeb and Zoe Nathan, who among other places run an impressive wine bar nearby called Rustic Canyon. The idea of Cassia was to flesh out the ideas Mr. Ng developed at his last restaurant, the Spice Table, within the framework of a busy, well-oiled brasserie. A whiff of blazing wood drifts across the menu and around the restaurant, which would look like an aircraft hangar if it weren’t broken up by an open grill, an oyster-shucking counter and a bar where seats have a view of Seventh Street beyond a mountain range of liquor bottles. As if you were at La Coupole, you could start with a shellfish platter, although here you’d be working your way from oysters with a lime and black-pepper mignonette and a sambal cocktail sauce, to snow-crab claws with a chunky and char-flecked romesco, to chilled prawns that taste of garlic, laksa leaf and smoke. Another portal into a meal, one that better suggests the kitchen’s reach, is a charcuterie plate: thin mahogany slices of lamb ham; a floppy, spicy sausage something like mortadella crossed with ’nduja; spoonfuls of salty pork fat, melting away under bread warm off the grill; strips of Singaporean candied bacon; a slab of Vietnamese pork meatloaf, liberated from banh mi at last, and excellent with some chopped fermented cabbage. The only dull item of the bunch was the smoked curried duck, a bit dry and not especially curried. The cabbage relish may or may not be Mr. Ng’s homage to choucroute, but his pot-au-feu has more obvious ancestors. The clarity and focus of the broth, along with the tenderness of the braised short rib, come from the classic French pot roast; the star anise and cinnamon in the broth are borrowed from Vietnamese pho. The short rib had something in common with corned beef, too, which along with the cabbage and mustard made me wonder whether the Irish weren’t also mixed up in this remarkable dish somehow. It’s the lamb breast, though, that really shows off Mr. Ng’s skill for harnessing the energies of his ingredients. Cumin seeds and Sichuan peppercorns have been stuck on the meat, and then a big flame-red gob of sambal has been dropped on top. Sesame sauce and a bed of jasmine rice lap up the spices. The dish could have landed like a brick to the back of the head, but its powerful flavors are handled with some delicacy. Nothing about Cassia is small. Not the dining room, not the menu, not the well-priced wine list, which covers about 80 bottles from Europe and the West Coast, and not the portions, which are really and truly meant for sharing. My table of three never made it to the bottom of a bowl of chickpeas sunk in a lush coconut yellow curry, as delicious as they were pinched in crisp triangles of flatbread from the clay oven. I left some of the charcuterie fried rice behind, too, even though I’d kept going back in for another taste of sweet lap cheong, pork fat and salted fish long after I’d stopped feeling hungry. On the other hand, my appetite was still intact when I lost interest in the jellyfish salad, the name an unsuccessful attempt to rebrand a sesame-chicken salad that would have been called “oriental” in the 1980s. Meals glide on currents of fish sauce and lime juice, steered by the staff’s attention to the mechanics of family-style service. Serving spoons arrive before you can ask, and bowls that are wet with the anchovy broth that is poured over black cod will be cleared and replaced before you’re brought the grilled pork belly over Vietnamese vermicelli noodles, slick with a dressing that is a little more concentrated and caramel-rich than usual. If there are any doubts that Cassia has a thick Gallic streak, the floating islands will dispel them. Yes, the puffs of meringue bobbing in lime crème anglaise are browned, but this is unmistakably the dessert that has disappeared into the mouths of a million French citizens. There is also a tart of dark chocolate with bananas in a pastry shell that is classically crisp. If I were to recommend one meal that captures some of the energy in the Los Angeles dining scene right now, I might come up with reasons not to mention Cassia. It is an outlier. It’s not exploring new horizons in fermentation, like Baroo. It doesn’t offer a direct connection to another country’s cuisine, like the dizzyingly good Sichuan mini-chain Chengdu Taste. It isn’t impossibly, irresistibly tiny, like Petit Trois or Le Comptoir. It doesn’t have the take-it-or-leave-it bravura of Night & Market (Song). It isn’t alluringly scruffy, like Gjusta, serving bialys to Venice beach bums. It’s not making an explicit appeal to the generation that grew up thinking of Los Angeles as the easternmost city in Asia, as Roy Choi’s places do. All these other options would flash through my mind. And then I’d wonder if maybe I were overthinking the question. Because, while Cassia is not the epitome of any particular trend, most of the food coming out of its kitchen is just really delicious.",Our Restaurant Critic Goes National.

111,Gramercy Tavern,★★★,2016-08-16,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/17/dining/gramercy-tavern-review.html,Flatiron,"Long before it turned 22 last month, Gramercy Tavern had settled into classic status. It is a classic, but there’s a downside to putting a restaurant in that category. The more familiar something is, the harder it is to see. Like the other restaurants in Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group, Gramercy Tavern is virtually synonymous with a certain style of service. Cheerful, wholesome, engaging, proactive, the servers are the sort you’d be comfortable leaving young children with. (Mr. Meyer could run a great babysitting company.) Whether we walk into the easygoing front tavern or reserve a table in the more expensive and ceremonious dining room in the back, we take for granted that the service will be very good. When that’s all it is, and if we forget that Gramercy Tavern on a very good night is still better than most restaurants when they try their hardest, it’s possible to be mildly disappointed. The staff seems to understand that high expectations work against the place, though, and sometimes you can be treated to next-level hospitality. One recent night, our table had interrupted the march from main courses to desserts by sharing a small cheese plate. A cheese interruption is never a bad idea at Gramercy Tavern. What I really went wild for, though, was a simple condiment that arrived with the cheeses, a little dish of sour-cherry preserves. I ate it on a wedge of aged goat, I ate it on crackers, and after they were gone, I dropped red jam onto my finger from a spoon and slipped the finger into my mouth. To make space for the desserts, the cheese plate was soon cleared away. Not the jam dish, though, because I had covered it with my hand and smiled in a way that said, “You’ll have to kill me first.” This being Gramercy Tavern, I knew I’d win without a fight. But I didn’t expect a manager to swing by a few minutes later and say: “I told Miro how much you enjoyed the cherry jam, and he was thrilled. It’s his grandmother’s recipe, from Serbia, and he loves making it.” As if by magic, my piggishness had been turned into a compliment to the pastry chef, Miro Uskokovic, and my happiness had become the restaurant’s. This is what’s meant by the cliché “It’s our pleasure to serve you.” But it takes in-the-moment intelligence to bring that phrase to life. Gramercy Tavern can do that. Maybe I paid a little more attention to Mr. Uskokovic’s desserts from then on, noticing how gingered pineapple and crumbled pralines brightened the wonderful carrot cake, appreciating the innocent sweetness that angel food croutons brought to a cheesecake topped with dark, soft strawberries. Maybe I also enjoyed the desserts more because I was in a good mood. They had the openness and generosity of spirit that I’d admired at Untitled, where Mr. Uskokovic is also the pastry chef. The executive chef at both restaurants is Michael Anthony. In 2006, he took over at Gramercy Tavern from Tom Colicchio, who had run the kitchen from the beginning. As the torch passed, it sputtered. In Gramercy Tavern’s last review in The Times, nine years ago, Frank Bruni wrote about “forgettable” meals at the end of Mr. Colicchio’s tenure and a “clumsy, laughable one” at the start of Mr. Anthony’s. The new team finally hit its stride, and Mr. Bruni’s appraisal carried three stars. But the kitchen’s sensibility changed much more significantly than a restaurant trying to remain classic would normally allow. Where Mr. Colicchio would often focus on a star ingredient, Mr. Anthony’s dishes tend to be ensemble efforts. It’s as if he has fallen in love with everything he puts on the plate. He’s like somebody who goes to the farmers’ market hungry, ends up buying everything he sees, then figures out a way to make it all come together. A bin of small hot red peppers must have jumped into his shopping bag in early August, when he made them into an unusually forceful and perfectly harmonious foil for corn and very tender poached lobster. What to do with red currants, so pretty and so resistant to the spotlight? Mr. Anthony scattered them over a chilled marigold-yellow soup of summer squash, which needed their jolt of juicy tartness. Mr. Anthony’s keen sense of what to do with produce was on full display in the $110 vegetable tasting menu, of course. But I also saw it in the $125 tasting, where blackberries helped out a braised pork shoulder paved with crackling hazelnuts and where a supple hunk of halibut sat over warm summer tomatoes given a briny, oceanic intensity by scraps of kombu. Even over three courses at a fixed price of $98, Mr. Anthony gives you a sense of what’s going on that week in the vegetable patch that few chefs can match. These are the menus offered in the back dining room. But the keen responsiveness to the season still comes across if you order à la carte at the long, perennially busy bar or one of the tables next to it. I loved the taste of corn kernels and green tomatoes, sliced into see-through wheels, on a flatbread dotted with lamb sausage, and the way Mr. Anthony made room for cool peaches in a tomato-basil salad. For the Tavern’s dessert menu, Mr. Uskokovic bakes a pie that has pastry-crust stars on top of a dark field of wild blueberries — an edible flag. It would be hokey if it weren’t so good. The barroom is more than a low-priced alternative; it’s integral to the restaurant’s personality. For example, it sets the tone for the way people drink in both rooms. Gramercy Tavern’s wine list is justly celebrated for its catholic embrace of diverse regions and styles, but how many other restaurants make cider or a glass of beer (on draft or from one of the vintage bottles) seem like a natural choice with a dinner that costs $100 or more? Although it’s not as plush as the dining room, the tavern is more attractive. The colors of the fruits and vegetables in Robert Kushner’s scrolling mural above the bar still leap out at you after all these years. In the back rooms, the collision of Italianate arcades and ye olde timbered beams is more clearly a pastiche than it once seemed. The appeal of Gramercy Tavern transcends design, though. It springs from a sense of trustworthiness that is kept vital by acts of imagination like the manager’s report about the cherry jam and Mr. Anthony’s constant adjustments to the season. You can tell that people value that combination if you study the clothes they wear to eat in the front room. With a wait for tables that may be right next to the crowd at the bar, the setup there is not too different from the Spotted Pig’s, but most dress as if they were going to one of the nicest restaurants in New York. And they’re right.",Gramercy Tavern: A Classic Still on the Move,"['long', 'turned', 'last', 'month', 'gramercy', 'tavern', 'settled', 'classic', 'status', 'classic', 'there’s', 'downside', 'putting',

112,Olmsted,★★,2016-08-09,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/dining/olmsted-restaurant-review.html,Prospect Heights,"Olmsted, a two-month-old restaurant in Brooklyn, looks innocent enough. Not much in the dining room sets it apart from any number of other new places to eat. The houseplants whose vines slink down one wall may well come from Lowe’s. Toward the back is a cooking space big enough for two people; I believe the term in the trade is “a two-butt kitchen.” The chef, Greg Baxtrom, works on the outside of the pass, putting the last touches on dishes that cost no more than $24. But hidden inside this simple and approachable neighborhood restaurant is another, more unusual one waiting to get out. Your first clue comes when you head out to the garden before dinner for a drink and encounter the livestock. At the bottom of an enamel claw-foot bathtub by the rear door, crayfish scuttle for cover as you get close. At the far end of a long, raised bed of radishes, against the back fence, is a bird coop. Living inside are one mottled quail and an all-white one, an experimental breed, no doubt the first of its kind to settle in Prospect Heights. This is not normal neighborhood-restaurant behavior. I’ve tried to garden in a Brooklyn backyard, and I’ve tried to raise crayfish. Each effort was done in by unforeseen complications. (Shade, cannibalism.) Olmsted is more serious about its backyard farming than I was. Mr. Baxtrom’s chief partner in the restaurant is Ian Rothman, the founder of a 10-acre farm in Massachusetts and the former horticulturist at Atera in TriBeCa, where he grew kale and other greenery in hydroponic beds under lights in the basement. His urban farm behind Olmsted is a trickier project, and it includes a composter in which vegetable scraps are broken down by the larvae of black soldier flies that, after they mature, are fed to the crayfish. The peppery leaves of those radishes go into Olmsted’s gazpacho. Thickened a bit with potatoes, it comes across less as a gazpacho than a green vichyssoise. Poured into a bowl holding trout roe, gently pickled radish wedges and a mound of lemon balm foam, it is inarguably delicious. This recipe did not come out of the Brooklyn farm-to-table playbook. That’s true of most of the dishes Mr. Baxtrom has devised. For a cocktail snack, he’s come up with riceless nigiri — a strip of raw fluke, underscored with an aggressive stripe of Calabrian chiles and set on a bed of watermelon. Earlier, the fish sat on a snap-pea pod, cut lengthwise into a little canoe. It’s very good both ways, even if the watermelon sushi is a little drippy for finger food. The carrot crepe is a strange and fascinating appetizer. Arranged under or over the big orange circle of the crepe are buttered littleneck clams, carrots in several forms and a cluster of sunflower seeds. I didn’t warm up to the whole ensemble right away, but it got into my head and now I want it again. Sweet-pea falafel, a main course, takes no getting used to. Some assembly is required, though. Into the fluffy purse of a pea-flour pita (or peata, as the menu has it) you pack some wonderfully light balls of pea falafel and dress them with puréed and whole peas, a salad of cucumbers and currants, and labne mixed with cardamom and fresh mint. You taste peas, lots of them, but you also taste summer. Before he opened Olmsted, Mr. Baxtrom cooked at Alinea, Per Se, Blue Hill at Stone Barns and Atera, where he met Mr. Rothman. You can see the influence of those kitchens in the way he treats falafel as a showcase for vegetables and carrots as a backdrop for clams. At least as impressive is one thing that Mr. Baxtrom didn’t take from those restaurants. He hasn’t locked up his thoughtful and original food inside an hourslong tasting menu. Individually, tour-de-force meals at the sort of restaurant where Mr. Baxtrom trained can be exhilarating. Collectively, what they represent is hard to cheer: the birth of a new restaurant elite that is even more exclusive than the old guard. What is particularly depressing is how many talented chefs now use what they know about ingredients, visual composition and other areas of expertise to devise menus that justify prices only a small number of people can afford. It’s similar to the way our best-known architects, rather than trying to make our homes and workplaces better, use their knowledge to build dazzling trophies. Even Olmsted’s least expensive main course, of course, is beyond the reach of many people in its neighborhood. But that doesn’t make it less impressive to see Mr. Baxtrom keeping prices low relative to other restaurants with Olmsted’s level of inventiveness. He cooks fish that are plentiful and, not coincidentally, cheaper. I missed dogfish’s run on the menu, but the other week I very much enjoyed the seared pollock he served with a tart cherry sauce and a panzanella made with juicy cherries and cherry tomatoes. (When I tried an earlier iteration using hake and rhubarb, the texture of the fish wasn’t as fine and the rhubarb sauce was a little sweet.) Torn scallops, bought at a discount, are threaded on skewers and charcoal grilled. They are as good and fresh as if they were whole, and I love how the pasilla chile in their dry rub nips at the sweetness of the creamed corn they rest on. There is no $100 roast chicken but there is guinea hen two ways for $24. The breast meat is shot through with a fat green vein of ramp mousse; even more appealing is the second installment, a braised confit of the legs under morels and a lush ramp hollandaise. (If you’re there when the hen’s liver has been made into a honey-topped terrine, order it.) When you don’t like something, it never seems like a good value, and that’s how I felt about a “Thai beet salad” that had too many crunchy ribbons of raw beet and not enough of whatever was supposed to make it Thai. It’s off the menu now. The kitchen backs off on the complications with dessert. Both the bowl of frozen yogurt, sweetened with whipped lavender honey, and the chocolate mousse, made by somebody who understands chocolate mousse, are simple and effective. The wine list was put together by Jeff Ruiz. He is another veteran of Atera, where a wine pairing with the tasting menu costs $195. At Olmsted, two-thirds of the bottles cost less than $60. A handful are under $40, a price range restaurants that pay attention to wine rarely bother with anymore. Olmsted is no competition to Atera and the other elite restaurants like it. But it is, in some ways, a challenge to those places, or at least to their notion that the best stage for a chef’s talent is the most expensive one.",Olmsted Bets the Farm on Winning Over the

113,Agern,★★★,2016-08-02,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/03/dining/agern-restaurant-review.html,Midtown East,"Almost everyone who has lived in Manhattan has had the dream. Wandering through your apartment, you see a door nobody has noticed before. On the other side, you find that you have been living all along with extra rooms: enough space for an office, a guest bedroom, a painting studio, a walk-in closet, a tiki bar, a library. That sensation is what you get walking into Agern for the first time. Just off a corridor in Grand Central Terminal that you’ve probably rushed down hundreds of times, behind a set of doors locked for longer than most New Yorkers can remember, a restaurant has appeared. In the three months since it opened, Agern has made both the train station and the city’s dining landscape into roomier, more interesting places. There are no windows, and the front entrance, at the top of a short flight of stairs, is marked by a small sign that’s easy to walk past. This makes Agern (AY-gurn) feel like a quiet harbor away from the eddies and currents of commuters outside. Hours can slip away. In the modern Scandinavian dining room, pale wood, charcoal seat cushions and wall tiles in mossy Grand Central green create a calming mood. It’s like a spa with tasting menus and cocktails. The primary owner is the Danish restaurateur Claus Meyer, one of the founders of Noma, in Copenhagen, and of its New Nordic cooking style. New Nordic is not so much a cuisine as a philosophy. Its followers value traditional methods like curing and smoking, and seek out forgotten or overlooked ingredients from nearby. Mr. Meyer recruited Gunnar Gislason, the chef of the New Nordic restaurant Dill, in Reykjavik, Iceland, to run the kitchen. Mr. Gislason has imported Dill’s philosophy but not, for the most part, its Icelandic provisions, like the dried sheep droppings over which fish is smoked. Buying food raised around New York, he and his chef de cuisine, Joseph Yardley, treat the city as another Scandinavian capital: Oslo-on-Hudson. Sign on for the Field and Forest menu, a vegetarian excursion through seven courses with a salvo of finger foods (the $120 price, like all the prices at Agern, includes service), and the plants you eat are mostly those you could buy at Union Square Greenmarket. What the kitchen does to them gives them an unfamiliar and often transporting cast. There was, for instance, a potato salad that caused double and triple takes. The potatoes had a restrained but durable smokiness. They were served with shaved rhubarb, ramps and feathery red seaweed, which carried a memory of the ocean. Finally, long yellow bands of cured egg yolk had the salty, intensifying effect of bottarga. That salad has been replaced by one with lemon cucumbers and fleshy summer melon, but the cured egg remains, giving the fruit and vegetables a depth I didn’t expect. Preserved blackberries, tart and a little salty, brought a welcome sharpness to endive salad, dressed with mild and creamy havgus cheese and chopped almonds. Sweet corn and fresh chanterelles are a classic summer match, but I had no idea how wonderful they could taste with the addition of tarragon and golden raspberries. The Land and Sea menu costs $25 more. In the New Nordic spirit, the animal flesh is not supplied by overworked and unsustainable ingredients. It comes from more humble stuff. Rather than foie gras, there is beef heart, chopped into red filaments that provide ballast and iron to a salad of skinny asparagus stems and garlic scapes with tart green slices of unripe strawberries. Instead of bluefin tuna, you eat skate, cooked gingerly to keep the appealing gelatinous softness, under celery and batons of apple. Heirloom pork is not the loin but the neck, imbued (too strongly?) with rosemary and served with a crisp, simple, creamy and very good salad of green beans. The two menus are not that far apart. Sometimes they are separated by a single ingredient: A few briny spoonfuls of trout eggs get the potato salad admitted to the Land and Sea menu. From time to time, they converge on an identical dish like the unaccountably delicious potato fry bread, a fritter of sourdough mixed with mashed potatoes, or the roasted beet. The last time I ate at Agern, this had become “our famous beet.” It does seem to have been consciously designed to be talked about. It’s carved on a cart next to the table after being liberated from the salt-and-ash crust it’s baked in. The crust is supposed to give the beet the flavor it would pick up over a wood fire, but it didn’t taste smoky to me. My first bite was impossibly salty, too. But after that, its natural flavors were deeply concentrated, and the underlying beet salad, flecked with fresh horseradish and fried caraway seeds, was stunning on its own. So was the tiny loaf of sunflower-seed rye bread, wonderful with beets mashed into it and even more wonderful under a thick coat of butter. These thumb-size loaves are baked by Rhonda Crosson, and I think they are at least as good as her big rounds of sourdough, and those are exceptional. Agern’s pastry chef, Rebecca Eichenbaum, showed how resourceful she could be in her last job, at Wassail, where she spun elaborate desserts out of parsnips and carrots. She is no less inventive at Agern, but the results are a little less effortful, even as she tops ripe berries with a kombucha ice made from rose petals or doubles up on the tartness of sorrel sherbet with curls of barely sweetened rhubarb. Many of these can be ordered individually, a considerate option from a restaurant where on the wrong night the tasting menus can inch forward like the rush-hour local to New Haven. My last meal lasted more than four hours, for no discernible reason. There may be travelers, or even nontravelers, who would be happy with two courses and dessert. I’d suggest, though, that they stay away from the $68 “24-day hung beef”; whatever flavor it picked up from hanging was stamped out by horseradish cream and horseradish leaves. In Denmark, Mr. Meyer is also active in delis, bakeries, a coffee roaster and other concerns. Last year, he moved to New York, and he is adapting to his new home with the same entrepreneurial energy. In Brooklyn, he has opened a bakery and a coffee roaster under the direction of a star of the Copenhagen caffeine scene named Omar Maagaard. Mr. Maagaard’s beans are brewed into Agern’s espresso and pour-overs, which made me think for the first time that the people who compare coffee to great wine are not completely barking mad. And I say this having lived through five excruciating minutes during which coffee was brewed drop by drop atop a digital scale. (For tableside drama, digital scales run a distant third to sharp knives and open flames.) Following the buy-local spirit, most of the other drinks are grown in the United States. Chad Walsh has put together a list of domestic wines, beers, spirits, cider and mead. (Strange things are happening in mead, a beverage that is pretty strange to begin with.) As you leave, you’re handed a cloth sack or two. Inside you may find a small sourdough loaf with a jar of butter or bright, freshly cooked raspberry jam. Or a bottle of cold-brewed coffee. They could be advertisements for Mr. Meyer’s tentacular operations, I suppose, but ads rarely taste so good the next day.","All Aboard the Nordic Express, at Agern","['almost', 'everyone', 'lived',

114,Pasquale Jones,★★,2016-07-26,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/dining/pasquale-jones-review-little-italy.html,Little Italy,"As a New Yorker who wants each neighborhood to be different, each block to be like a pocket with a secret tucked inside it, I have strongly mixed feelings about gentrification. As a critic confronted with shiny new restaurants in changing neighborhoods, though, I have to admit that I often end up liking the shiny new places more than what came before. So I didn’t waste time worrying about the other Italian restaurants on the south end of Mulberry Street when Pasquale Jones took up residence there in February. Those indistinguishable Little Italy flytraps with their sidewalk hawkers, their holy-communion-ready wines, their lifeless linguine facedown in a shallow pool of clam sauce: They could stand some competition. And the wandering hordes now stand a better chance of tasting New York-style Italian food. Pasquale Jones is the second restaurant from the Charlie Bird team, led by the chef Ryan Hardy and two wine scholars, Robert Bohr and Grant Reynolds. The three of them squeeze so many of the prevailing casual New York-Italian tropes into this glass-walled dining room on the corner of Kenmare and Mulberry Streets that it’s virtually a showroom of the genre, circa 2016. There is the menu that flits from pasta to pizza to small plates to the inevitable rib-eye for two. (It’s $125. If you try it, tell me how it is.) There is the wine list that roams outside Italy and tries harder than it needs to. And there are wood-burning ovens where most of the food is cooked, which you can see from the tightly organized tables or from a perch at the kitchen counter. At Pasquale Jones (as at the French-Italian L’Amico and the California-Italian Upland, among others), pizza is not a single-minded pursuit but a menu category. The crust is crisp and airy, speckled black around the rim. The kitchen didn’t get much mileage out of squash flowers by wilting a few on a bed of mozzarella, with some cherry tomatoes and dribbles of pesto. It sounds like a straight shot of summer breeze, but the flavors didn’t ride along. I did have fun with the pizza that had four big white clumps of burrata, one for each tomato-slathered and oregano-seasoned slice. I’d like to thank the server who suggested folding the triangle like a taco, which kept the soft cheese from cascading into my lap. One pizza that rises above toppings-on-dough status to cohere into a memorable whole is the clam pie. A little cream extends the flavor of juicy chopped littlenecks marinated in garlic. That could get Pasquale Jones run out of New Haven, but on Mulberry Street, it’s a great idea. The pastas are also more sideline than specialty, with just three on the menu most nights. The fresh noodles are particularly good. They keep their firm, egg-dense snap, like the strands of tagliatelle in a soft-spoken rabbit ragù or the thin tajarin with corn, cream and a cotton-candy puff of shaved summer truffle. Dried spaghetti from the Martelli family’s tiny factory in Tuscany is a constant, too. One night it was dressed with very fine bits of blue crab in a sauce that was so full of vitality I wanted to shoot it into a vein. I could have done it, too, with what was left at the bottom the bowl. The inevitable small-plates section is a catchall category for vegetables, seafood and the odd detour into offal (stewed tripe that still has a pleasant, octopus-like bounce in its chile-enhanced tomato sauce, or a breaded and fried ball of head cheese, gooey and alluring). Charcoal-grilled curls of cuttlefish with green tomatoes and mint were impressively meaty and sweet. On another night, squid had stayed on the coals too long, although I enjoyed the wild chickpeas that came with it. They were yellow and flattened, as if somebody had pinched them one at a time. A main-course portion of striped bass, though, left the oven at precisely the right time, with all the juicy mild sweetness still under the skin. The plate was minimally adorned with wilted escarole, a few crisp green olives and dabs of olive sauce: a textbook case of knowing when to leave a good piece of fish alone. If you’ve heard anything about Pasquale Jones, you have probably been told to order the pork shank for two. That advice is solid. So is the shank itself, a golden knot of meat that shines with melted lardo. One dessert a night is the rule. Usually it is fruit that’s been slipped into the wood oven and arranged around a simple ice cream, although one night I happily ate uncooked strawberries and whipped cream. Tiny elderflowers had been strewn on top, and while they didn’t add much flavor, they did provide the momentary suspicion that the kitchen had been taken over by fairies. This long and restless menu gives Pasquale Jones a master-of-none quality. Several pizzerias have more finely tuned doughs or dynamic toppings; other kitchens reach much deeper into the pasta canon. There are a lot of little reasons to eat at Pasquale Jones. For big reasons, you have the clam pizza and pork shank, maybe, and the wine. No maybe about the wine. Like Charlie Bird, the restaurant has a wine list that is longer than Donald Trump’s speech last week. It starts with a “seasonal short list” of, at last count, about 65 bottles. Then it really gets going. France and Italy dominate, with a few passing glances at other countries. Under the major regions are entire subsections of bottles from producers whose names make wine freaks and big spenders get sweaty and bug-eyed: Raveneau, Tenuta San Guido, Conterno, Coche-Dury, Chave and a little upstart Champagne maker by the name of Dom Pérignon. Who is buying these bottles? At least their prices have the effect of making everything else on the list seem incredibly cheap. I ordered a bottle of what Mr. Reynolds called “the house Champagne,” a nonvintage brut reserve from Bérêche et Fils that he recommended with pizza. It costs as much as four pizzas. O.K., not cheap, but reasonable as restaurant Champagne prices go, especially for one this layered and energetic. Pasquale Jones is right that bubbles go well with pizza, but it doesn’t have as many affordable options as it could. (The award for best inexpensive sparkling wine selection in a New York pizzeria goes to Marta.) Reds, whites and rosés under $65 are easier to find on the short list. Whatever you spend, your wine is poured into a crystal glass with a stem as thin as a lollipop stick. They weigh almost nothing, these glasses. Lifting one takes so little effort that the wine arrives at your mouth before you’ve had a chance to think about it. The first time this happens, it’s startling. Then you never want to drink from any other glass.",Pasquale Jones Brings a Little Novelty to Little Italy,"['yorker', 'want', 'neighborhood', 'different', 'block', 'like', 'pocket', 'secret',

115,Mimi,★,2016-07-12,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/13/dining/mimi-restaurant-review.html,Greenwich Village,"It took three dinners at Mimi before I saw the restaurant that had other people so excited. Mimi barely ruffled the waters of the crowded pond of New York dining when it materialized on a quiet Greenwich Village block last fall. The partners had never owned a restaurant before. The chef, Liz Johnson, was 25 years old. Although she had been cooking for a decade, it was hard to draw a bead on her busy work history. The critics waddled in gradually, giving the people at Mimi the rare luxury of time to find their rhythm. Each was more enthusiastic than the last, culminating with Brett Martin of GQ, who in May put Mimi on his list of the country’s best new restaurants. Mimi looks like an updated version of the French bistro New Yorkers dream of finding in the Village. In the front is a little parenthesis of a bar that ends at a sheet of white marble with dark Rorschach veins. The bar’s surface is stainless steel, not zinc, but you still get the idea. The tables are small and lined up one after the other, which brings you close to the people you’re eating with and to people you weren’t planning to eat with. So what. There are classical little cocktails and bluesy cocktail jazz to go with them, just what you want to hear at a fantasy bistro. The Mimi I encountered in early spring, though, seemed unprepared for national attention. Ours was the first table seated that night, and already the kitchen was out of the monkfish liver. This was unexpected, because it had been written on the menu by hand below that day’s date. After we ordered, our server came back to say that the lobster we’d wanted was gone, too. We still ate well. Ms. Johnson took marvelous ingredients and led them toward luxuriousness with a little imagination and a prodigal use of butter. To start, we shared firm pieces of raw madai in brown butter with lemon curd. Snails in a crater of puff pastry tasted clean and meaty, and the unannounced sweetbreads were a welcome surprise. There was also a long, rich, generous slab of tuna belly paved with a dark-green mash of shishito peppers — an odd idea and a good one. Other dishes could have used more precision. Five excellent, sweet scallops sat on creamy blots of bottarga sauce over black rice that had been swirled with more butter than it needed or could hold; the butter pooled on the plate. At dessert, the keen taste of rhubarb couldn’t quite break free from an over-thickened rhubarb gel on a blancmange. Over the next two months, while good reviews rolled in, I waited for Mimi to come into focus. It was even more blurry the next time I went. About half the meal was delicious in ways I rarely experience in other restaurants. Very gently crisped eel and fleshy yellow peaches went with a strong mustard sauce that sent fumes up the back of my nose, and the combination made neural pathways begin firing that had never seen action before. Less daring, more elemental, was lamb cooked until the fat melted into the soft pink flesh. The sauce was a rough pesto of nettles, nothing fussy about it, with a creamy brick of pommes dauphinois. But the rest was seriously undercooked. Most of the bottom crust on a rhubarb tarte Tatin was pale and doughy. Parts of a grilled turbot were still translucent. When the soufflé for two was pierced with a spoon, batter oozed out the top. In each case, a quick look in the kitchen (or at the table, in the case of the soufflé, which cost $22) would have been enough to tell that more time on the heat was needed. It was as if Ms. Johnson had two kitchens, one in which superb ingredients lined up and did exactly what she told them to do and another in which the clocks were broken. The last time I went to Mimi, all the food came out of the same kitchen: the good one. True, and as usual, some items had already been eighty-sixed before the sun went down. Mimi may be the first restaurant in which servers greet tables not with “Do you know what you’d like?” but “Do you know what we’re out of?” But I’d arrived early, so I got what I wanted. I finally tried the two desserts everybody loves. One is a very dark and fluffy chocolate tart, so pleasurable it must have been a reward for some good deed I’d done by mistake. The other is a baba au rhum that is more lavishly creamy than most. It’s also less boozy, though that can be treated by the bottle of Venezuelan rum the server leaves behind. At the start of dinner there were crisp spring peas in a creamy and stealthily spicy sauce. Above this were three raw spot prawns, as good as I’ve had in any sushi bar. Their heads had been fried and lined up on a plate like helmets at a biker bar. This was one of the stranger meetings of French and Japanese cuisines I’ve tasted, and I liked it very much. A hunk of foie gras had been sautéed with peaches, and then the contents of the pan had been more or less dumped onto a plate. Many chefs swaddle and spoil foie gras as if it were a high-strung show dog. Ms. Johnson seems to understand that it performs better when it’s allowed to roll around and get messy. Which is essentially what two guests and I did when an entire Dungeness crab was plunked down in front of us. It looked like the centerpiece of a Chinese banquet. The legs, bright red and wet with snail butter, radiated around the body, which had been excavated and backfilled with crab meat that had been enriched into a form not too far off from lobster thermidor. We ate a lot of crab. We ate a lot of butter. Finger bowls appeared, and we rinsed our hands in them again and again. Ms. Johnson may still be figuring how much food to order. She probably needs somebody to tell her when a plate doesn’t look right. But she’s got something any number of more experienced chefs don’t: a clear and personal vision of French food as a celebration of appetite, an occasion to eat with joy and lust. Turn left at the bottom of a staircase to the basement and you come to the kitchen. Turn right and you find the restrooms. The walls are painted with wavy red curves. The curves form hips and arms and breasts. There’s a framed drawing of an undressed woman with a Louise Brooks bob who lies on her belly, toes pointing at the ceiling. Smoke from her cigarette curls toward the words NO SMOKING. Never has a sign undermined its own message more attractively.","At Mimi, French Food Is a Celebration of Appetite","['took', 'dinner', 'mimi', 'saw', 'people', 'excited', 'mimi', 'barely', 'ruffled',

116,Nix,★★,2016-07-05,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/06/dining/nix-restaurant-review-greenwich-village.html,Greenwich Village,"There’s a lot of heavy eye contact going on at this restaurant. One of the most strenuous competitors is a guy at the next table who’s staring down the woman across from him while giving her a ferocious, what-big-teeth-you-have grin. I’d call his expression carnivorous, but we’re at Nix, and there’s nothing to eat here but vegetables. Not long ago, vegetarian restaurants in the United States were the last place you’d expect to see people who looked as if they couldn’t wait to go home and have non-tantric sex. The mood in their dining rooms could be tranquil, convalescent, earth-motherly, doctrinaire or ascetic, but rarely did it ripple with the energy of hookups in progress. The crackle in the air at Nix and other recent meatless restaurants is what you get when you liberate vegetables from vegetarianism. Stripped of ideology, Nix is freed up for hedonic pursuits. Sure, plants contain nutrients. But the people drinking Nix martinis probably aren’t doing it because they hope the oils left on the vodka’s surface by a thyme branch will boost their supplies of omega-3 fatty acids. Nor are the anti-inflammatory benefits of crucifers likely to be top of mind as they eat the cauliflower tempura. More likely, they are flashing back to the last time they sat on the floor eating Chinese food out of a takeout box. The fried cauliflower has been submerged in a sauce that tastes like spicy ketchup. Poppy seeds on top make a small but real contribution when one of these orange grenades of crunch and heat is stuffed, along with a pickle slice, into the soft, white half-moon of a steamed bun. The chefs lobbing those orange grenades at this four-month-old restaurant in Greenwich Village are Nicolas Farias and John Fraser. Mr. Fraser’s meatless menus at Dovetail, his home base on the Upper West Side, are much talked about. Stronger demonstrations of his wit and resourcefulness, his ability to treat vegetables like meat without seeming to be pulling a scam, are the spit-roasted beets and the coffee-laced carrots Wellington at Narcissa, his more casual restaurant in the Standard East Village hotel. One of Mr. Fraser’s collaborators at Narcissa is James Truman, a partner at Nix. That’s him in the pressed suit and rumpled hair at the end of the bar. He recognizes me, too. Before he got into the restaurant business, we used to run into each other at the parties of friends we have in common. As an editor at Condé Nast and later its editorial director, he used to worry about helping magazines see around corners. This approach informs Nix, which among other things is an attempt to locate the future of vegetable-centered dining. The white walls and other interior features, designed by the architect Elizabeth Roberts, have a low-key simplicity, and candlelight gives them a bit of mystery. The details don’t scream to be noticed. You have to look closely to see that the lamp bases are the twisted roots of old junipers. Understatement is, of course, flattering to the observer who picks up on it, which may explain why Nix seems to draw the upper crust of the downtown creative class, people with interesting jewelry and significant haircuts. I was hypnotized like a cobra by the patterns in the vintage dresses purchased for the hosts; the dyed cotton smocks designed by Paul Marlow for the female servers; and Mr. Marlow’s print dresses, one for each night of the week, worn by the wine director, Andrea Morris. But lavishing all this care on the women’s costumes while the male servers slink like ninjas in simple dark shirts and jeans can border on the fetishistic. Ms. Morris’s wine list also avoids the obvious. She has an Alsatian Chasselas, an Edelzwicker from Oregon and a lithe Pelaverga from the Piedmont, which Mr. Truman sold me one night as the product of a “banished grape.” (In fact, it has D.O.C. status in the Verduno area of the region.) Staying away from name brands has another benefit: keeping the prices on almost every bottle under $100. More like this, please. Editors occasionally follow their instincts right out the window. I think Mr. Truman has done this with the restaurant’s name. It comes from an 1893 Supreme Court decision, Nix v. Hedden, which held that tomatoes were a vegetable and thus subject to an import tax that did not apply to fruit. Mr. Truman also liked the look of the word with its “three strong letters.” What seems not to have entered the calculations, although it will occur to parents of school-age children and to any search engine, is that these three strong letters are also used by an over-the-counter delousing treatment. Now let’s eat! I highly recommend starting with a wheel of flatbread baked in the tandoor, and a cup of raw young vegetables or one of the dips. The red-pepper walnut spread is a wonderful take on muhammara, while the crushed avocado with mint and chai curry powder is fun because it looks like guacamole and isn’t. In the part of the menu labeled “lighter,” I like the little carrots baked in parchment with spices and bulgur very much. Tomato water, buzzed with fresh green chile rings, is so entrancing that it even made the mung beans bobbing in it taste good, although its higher purpose is to perk up a charred half of an avocado. In one salad, spears of Persian cucumber are splashed with a jerk sauce that’s coaxed back from the brink of too-muchness by crumbled goat cheese and, in an inspired touch, sliced kumquats. In another, jicama is shaved into what the menu calls ribbons. They’re more like seatbelts, and the dressing of blood oranges and Fresno peppers can’t quite get a grip on them. The menu’s third section is called “bolder.” Here you will find the fried cauliflower buns and shiitake mushrooms sauced, very effectively, as if they were pasta cacio e pepe and spooned over creamy, rough-grained polenta. There’s a bowl of stir-fried brown rice that, once it’s stirred up with nori, chanterelles and a runny egg, reminds me of bibimbap. Very occasionally, I wished the vegetables had been allowed to relax a little. Artichokes shouldn’t have to compete with broccoli rabe, tomato sauce and ricotta. Puréed sweet potato gets the right sauce, a pumpkinseed mole, but the line of reasoning that led the kitchen to pack the purée into rubbery balloons of tofu skin should be re-examined. Servers tell you at the outset of the meal that if you want to finish with the quartered pineapple roasted for 20 minutes in the tandoor, then brushed with tamarind glaze, you should order it early. This is sound advice. They won’t tell you that if you finish the whole thing, you may never make it to the rest of Italivi Reboreda’s dessert menu, including the dark and tender chocolate cake that is wrapped, jelly-roll-style, around chocolate mousse. But I will.","At Nix, Vegetables Get a Dash of Sex","['there’s', 'lot', 'heavy', 'eye', 'contact', 'going', 'strenuous', 'competitor', 'guy', 'next', 'who’s', 'staring', 'woman', 'across', 'giving',

117,Freek’s Mill,★★,2016-06-28,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/29/dining/freeks-mill-review.html,Gowanus,"Standing on a drawbridge one night early this month, a man and a woman stood close and kissed, blind to everything around them, even the motionless toxic porridge of the Gowanus Canal below their feet. About to cross the span, I stopped to give them their space. The Union Street Bridge in Brooklyn is not the Pont Marie in Paris. But romance can bloom anywhere, even on a Superfund site. Around the corner on Nevins Street, I’d just had an unusually enjoyable dinner at a restaurant that has been busy constructing its own Gowanus romance. Called Freek’s Mill, it is named after a pre-Revolutionary War gristmill powered by a race that emptied into the Gowanus, when it was still a creek. “The name Freek’s Mill references a time when people in the area not only knew where their food came from, but also where it was processed,” the restaurant’s website explains, adding, “The food we serve, clearly not from the canal or its long gone farms, comes wherever possible from the growers we know and love, who cultivate food based on taste and sustainable cultivation practices.” Scratch this story with your fingernail, and you quickly uncover a highly idealized view of the past. A century before Freek built his mill, Dutch colonists forced African-born slaves to turn the Gowanus marshes into farmland and dig the first millponds. The white settlers were lured by the Dutch West India Company, whose ships moved ingredients and other goods around the globe. It seems unlikely that most 18th-century grocery shoppers knew precisely where their cinnamon came from or where their molasses was processed. Fables of agrarian life are hardly unique to Freek’s Mill. They help form the narrative of the farm-to-table movement. In this case, they are also being used to recast the image of a neighborhood best known for pollution that makes the Flint River look like an Adirondack stream. Like most marketing, this should not be taken too seriously. Freek’s Mill is hardly a return to preindustrial living. But after two months in business, it is already a swell place to spend a night in a postindustrial zone where gentrification has moved as slowly as the fluid in the canal. There are smiles at the door on the corner, whether you walk in with or without a reservation. Servers wear gingham shirts, standard attire in restaurants broadcasting their affection for farms. Windows on two walls let the early-evening light into a spartan dining room with wide floorboards and a cheery bar. In the back are more tables across from a kitchen counter that faces a domed oven, a wood fire burning inside. Freek’s Mill, in short, looks not very different from other young, ingredient-minded Brooklyn restaurants from Greenpoint to Park Slope. But there is a little more air between the tables than usual. And there’s a little less attitude among the servers, even when they hit you with the news that nearly every white wine is a chenin blanc and that gamay is involved in almost all the reds. They’re cheerful about saying this, as they should be. Alex Alan, one of the owners, built the list to show how much range these grapes have. The wines are also flexible, wrapping themselves around whatever you happen to be eating. This is lucky, because so many things on Chad Shaner’s menu are worth trying. With half-grown chefs around the country getting attention for the two weeks they spent fondling beets at Noma, it’s something of a relief to learn that the highlights of Mr. Shaner’s career were jobs at Union Square Cafe and BLT Prime. Neither place has been in the vanguard of culinary innovation recently, but somewhere along the line, Mr. Shaner learned to cook food that really tastes good. The more you eat of his striped bass ceviche, the more interesting it becomes, as green chiles and tart, unripe strawberries meet the softening influence of basil crème fraîche. Mr. Shaner had the smart idea of turning veal Oscar sideways; asparagus, the traditional garnish, goes to the center of the plate. The crab meat and hollandaise go on top, with a sprinkle of Old Bay seasoning. The veal? There isn’t any, and you don’t miss it at all. The goal with fried soft-shell crabs is usually a delicate crust. Freek’s Mill goes the other way, giving it a very crunchy, thickish batter that you sometimes see on the fish half of fish and chips. You’d expect to find citrus in this dish, and you do, but it’s a cool surprise to taste lime juice mixed into the cashew butter swiped against the side of the bowl. I never met any bad dishes at Freek’s Mill, and only a few I wouldn’t try again. Chicken livers in a dandelion salad dotted with hard-cooked egg crumbs were cooked until they were dark and chewy. There’s precedent for this style, but I wished they’d been creamier. And barbecued kohlrabi served over grits just made me think about all the other things that could be barbecued and served over grits. We are, you won’t be surprised to learn, in the realm of small plates. Value can be hard to assess in this genre, and at Freek’s Mill, it is more complicated because service is built into the prices. (This is a no-tipping restaurant.) A big, smoky hunk of fat-streaked pork jowl with pickled vegetables and mustard sauce was a relative bargain at $19. For four rosy slices of dry-aged duck over a hard-to-resist mash of refried cranberry beans sweetened with rosemary honey, $24 didn’t seem out of line. But $25 was pushing it for three seared scallops with roasted lemon and asparagus, even if the scallops are strikingly fresh and sweet. And for $20, you may hope for more than a single short length of blackened octopus leg with potatoes and a chorizo vinaigrette. With dessert, the choices narrow. A slice of bread pudding in rhubarb syrup was just too wet, and an ice cream sandwich that’s meant to be a homage to Thin Mints, the Girl Scout cookies, wasn’t as much fun as it could have been. I suggest the strawberry clafoutis drowned under fresh cream that bubbles when it hits the iron baking dish. After dinner one night, I was standing across the street from Freek’s Mill reading emails when a bright light blinded me. “Do you live around here?” the driver of the police car demanded. “Am I doing something wrong?” “Well, you’re standing by yourself in a desolate area,” he said. Desolate? The officer wasn’t feeling the Gowanus romance yet.",Freek’s Mill Spins Romance Near a Superfund Site,"['standing', 'drawbridge', 'early', 'month', 'man', 'woman', 'stood', 'close', 'kissed', 'blind',

118,Le Coq Rico,★★,2016-06-14,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/dining/le-coq-rico-review.html,Flatiron,"I’m almost always the one who gets the chicken. For review meals, I try to let my guests choose their own food. Then I pick something nobody else wants. Often, this is the chicken. I think this can be explained by a remark a friend made recently. “I never eat chicken in restaurants,” he said. “I can make chicken at home.” So can I, but every time I go to a new restaurant, I hope the kitchen may know things about poultry that I don’t. Every once in a while, I’m right. At Le Coq Rico, a three-month-old restaurant on East 20th Street, I was right. In fact, I think I have finally found the perfect restaurant to take people who think they can make a better chicken at home. We’d ordered an old New England breed of chicken called Plymouth Rock for $95, along with a guinea fowl that cost a dollar more. Carved and fit back together, each bird was placed in the center of the table in its own iron roasting pan. Our eyes locked in on the bronzed skin and tapering curves of drumsticks with fixed and purposeful stares that, if we had not been humans looking at poultry, I would call lust. The meat had all the things I wanted and none of the things I didn’t. It was moist but not drippy or briny; compact and muscular but not tough; long on deep, rounded flavor that didn’t seem to rely on salt or sugar. Some of my guests preferred the chicken, calling the guinea fowl “sinewy.” It was a bit stringy at the joints, but once disentangled, the flesh had a flavor I found highly persuasive. Even the white meat tasted like dark meat. The menu suggested that one bird would feed up to four people. We nearly demolished twice as many, along with a macaroni gratin and a bundle of stout, dark fries that we dunked into a small pitcher of jus. After we were too full to go on, we noticed an untouched chicken leg. One of my guests ate that, too, down to the bone. True, he did it on a bet. But I suspect he would have done it for nothing. The chef and owner is Antoine Westermann. His distillations of the cuisine of his native Alsace at Le Buerehiesel in Strasbourg were widely praised before he handed it over to his son and moved to Paris. One of the places Mr. Westermann opened there is the original Coq Rico, a theme restaurant of sorts. Poultry (eggs, organs, broth) turns up in almost everything the kitchen makes, most spectacularly in the whole chickens that are first braised in chicken stock and then threaded on to a rotisserie. He gave Le Coq Rico a subtitle that is both irresistible and accurate: “The Bistro of Beautiful Birds.” By March, when he opened a Manhattan branch a few doors down from Gramercy Tavern, he had spent several months scouting for beautiful American birds. Mr. Westermann is particular about how long they spend pecking and strutting before they land on his rotisserie. The menu lists the age at slaughter — our server seemed to prefer “harvest” — for each breed on the menu, from 90 days for the Plymouth Rock to 130 days for the guinea fowl. “The industry standard is 40 days,” the server said, apparently used to fielding questions about these numbers. (Two more chicken breeds listed on the menu, New Hampshire and Cornish, weren’t available when I went; they are still enjoying country living.) A whole Brune Landaise (110 days), a French breed with milder flavor than the Plymouth Rock, is simmered in a clay casserole with potatoes, tomatoes, onions, artichokes, stock and a bottle of riesling. This, Mr. Westermann’s version of an Alsatian baeckeoffe, was terrific, with bewitching undercurrents of spice in a sauce that had body but no visible fat. The price, though, $120, made me queasy. A roasted quarter of the same breed, for $24, is Le Coq Rico’s offering for the solo chicken eater. The half-breast and thigh I tried were moist and flavorful but slightly inert, as if warmed over. If I came back alone, maybe to sit at the counter facing the kitchen in a narrow alley off the main dining room, I’d want the squab. Unwrapping the cabbage leaf around it, cutting into the handsomely roasted bird surrounded by foie gras stuffing, and dipping slices of excellent house-baked baguette into the glossy dark sauce is a sure route to Francophilia. Shopping for chickens, Mr. Westermann found eggs. Some go into Matthieu Simon’s desserts, one of which is awe-inspiring: the floating island, a single grapefruit-size ball of meringue with a crackling sugar glaze on top, resting in a pond of crème anglaise. The rhubarb soufflé is another good, if more routine, showpiece for egg whites. I’d choose either over the double-wide raspberry mille-feuille whose puff pastry wasn’t crisp enough to shatter. A Coq Rico meal could start with eggs, too — or, as the menu calls this group of appetizers, “Eggz.” It’s rare to find oeuf en meurette, in all its rich, spoon-coating, lardon-studded glory, made this well in Manhattan. Served with a heap of mâche and spicy pink hummus, sautéed chicken livers were glorious, combining the rich creaminess of a soft cheese with the metallic tang of organ meat. I expected great things from the chicken gizzards served with artichokes à la Barigoule, too, but their flavor seemed to have leaked out somewhere. From his days at Le Buerehiesel, Mr. Westermann has brought along the recipe for foie gras terrine baked inside a soft pastry crust. I’m not convinced this single slice of terrine is worth $32, but I don’t know anywhere in New York to get a better, cheaper version, either. The architect Pascal Desprez has slotted Le Coq Rico into a somewhat awkward U-shaped space. By the entrance is a bar where the cocktail menu promises, somewhat menacingly, “the dark side of Le Coq Rico.” There always seemed to be mild confusion at the host podium, and each time I was led to my seat, I was afraid I’d be deposited at one of the tables crammed into the narrow passageway. This hall opens in the back into a stylishly monochromatic dining room. Unless you have been to the Paris original, also designed by Mr. Desprez, the only things about the atmosphere that will strike you as French may be the peculiar pop music and, on some nights, Mr. Westermann himself, with wire-framed glasses on a head full of thoughts about chicken.",Poultry Has a Pedigree at Le Coq Rico,"['i’m', 'almost', 'always', 'get', 'chicken', 'review', 'meal', 'try',

119,La Sirena,★★,2016-06-07,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/08/dining/la-sirena-restaurant-review.html,Chelsea,"Somebody’s always on the move at La Sirena. Trotting up the steps to the entrance above Ninth Avenue. Getting up to say hi to a fellow prowler of the Chelsea galleries. Breezing across a full dining room to exit through a glass door to the terrace. Descending from a room in the Maritime Hotel upstairs and settling in for pancakes made with mascarpone and crushed almond cookies after the kitchen opens at 7 a.m. Casing the bar at night. Backing up to frame a picture that will prove they ate at Mario Batali’s new restaurant, his first in New York City since Eataly came along. The perpetual motion that supplies a lot of La Sirena’s energy — the rest comes from the dressy trattoria cooking overseen by Josh Laurano, the executive chef and a partner — is a function of geography and scale. There are matching north-and-south dining rooms, one near 17th Street and the other over by 16th Street. Each seats about 120 people. In between is a bar with the approximate dimensions of a jet runway. On warm, unrainy days and nights, another 150 or so chairs dot the terrace. It’s been easy to forget the excitement of eating in huge, kinetic restaurants lately because so many of them don’t offer much beyond that. The whole genre has gone out of fashion as modest little chef’s lairs have grabbed all the attention. Operations on La Sirena’s scale sometimes get knocked as “big-box restaurants,” as if any place seating more than 40 people were the equivalent of a Best Buy at the strip mall. Some of us hear “big” and think, “No, thanks.” And of course, Mr. Batali and his business partner, Joe Bastianich, preside over several restaurants that exemplify the charm of tight downtown rooms where the cooking can get close attention and the menus can have a targeted point of view. The one at La Sirena offers a little for everybody except, maybe, the person curious for fresh insights into Italian cuisine. The ground it covers is mostly the middle one. There’s orecchiette with tripe but no lambs’ tongue Jim Harrison (Casa Mono) or pajata finta (Lupa). What you notice are not dishes you’ve never seen before but ones you have: hulking meatballs, soft and pale inside with melting grated cheese; braciola, interpreted as braised rolled short ribs in a simple, ripe-red tomato sauce; clams baked under bread crumbs and oregano, jolted with a dab of chopped chiles in oil and a sweet slice of lemon. There is, in other words, very little breaking news, but what Mr. Laurano does, he tries to do with care and vigor and enough flourishes to keep your mind from wandering too far. Given the length of the menu and the sheer number of open mouths, though, it was probably inevitable that some dishes would have a certain numbness. In one appetizer, pickled anchovies sprawl over variations on fennel: shavings of the raw bulb in lemon and olive oil, other slices browned to a crisp, and fennel pollen, which carries its licorice sweetness around the plate. In another, fat roasted asparagus spears under grated smoked ricotta are piled over a cushion of cacio whipped with egg. Both are generous in size and flavor. Lasagna is layered with al dente wheels of waxy potato and a pesto as vibrant as if the basil had been picked 10 minutes ago. Tomatoes braised with spare ribs make a compelling sauce of ridged mini-torpedoes of cavatelli. Bucatini with bites of octopus, right on the border between firm and tender, have a tomato sauce with that low murmur of chile heat Mr. Batali’s restaurants are so adept at delivering. Servers like to recommend a half-portion each of two different pastas for $24. Take them up on it, and don’t be alarmed if they offer an opinion on whether your two choices work together. Mine always did. Mr. Laurano gives the main courses layers of complexity that go beyond standard trattoria cooking. The approach pays off for the lamb chops with a sweet-sour pomegranate molasses sauce and round chickpea-flour fritters, and for the grilled swordfish in a Sicilian tomato sauce with capers, olives, pine nuts and currants. When main dishes falter, it’s not because they’re too simple. It wasn’t pickled fennel that kept me from finishing a pork chop Milanese. It was the breading, thick and dense in a way that made me think of the apron you wear when you get your teeth X-rayed. The problem with porchetta alla Romana wasn’t the generous seasoning but the blubbery wrapper of under-rendered pork belly. And some fine, creamy white beans couldn’t disguise how little flavor there was in a baton of rabbit fried in bread crumbs. This kind of difficulty was rare among the pastas, although linguine with clams was pure Mulberry Street, a mop of bland noodles come to rest in a slosh of thin, salty sauce. In Michael Laiskonis’s desserts, there’s nothing but sophisticated pleasure. The baba is a citrus-soaked spongecake turned pink with Campari. The semifreddo looks like a baked alaska, a hedgehog of browned meringue around blood orange sorbet with a frozen core of honey nougat. Many servers in neckties and long black aprons traverse the multiple chambers of this restaurant. On a night when my table seemed to be the focus of special attention, I looked and saw neckties and aprons at the other tables, too. The staff never stood still, it seemed, until I got up and walked to the south dining room. Half a dozen servers stood idle in the middle of the room, as if on a smokeless cigarette break. It’s hard to keep all the billiard balls in motion at once. Even when they’re moving, it’s not easy to make them roll in the right direction, as Mr. Batali and I discussed in an email exchange after somebody on his staff served breadsticks to my son, who, we’d explained to two of our servers, has a serious sesame allergy. La Sirena’s bread is covered with sesame seeds, and the breadsticks were offered to him as a substitute. This was a well-meaning gesture, but they contained sesame seeds on the inside, as my son figured out after his mouth started to itch. This was a serious mistake, and dining room managers compounded it when they expressed concern without trying to find out exactly what had happened. Mr. Batali emailed me later that night. After I described the episode and let him know that the reaction had subsided before it got serious, he replied that he was apologetic and frustrated. His company, B&B Hospitality Group, has a full-time specialist in safety and environmental concerns who instructs all the food handlers on allergy protocols. After the incident at my table, Mr. Laurano also met with the staff to review procedures. As a parent, I was happy with that response. As a critic, I’ll keep an eye on the tendency toward entropy of large organizations. On a later visit, without my son, our server spent a long time going over the menu and taking our order. Two minutes later, he was back from the kitchen, looking a little embarrassed. “I forgot to ask,” he said. “Are there any food allergies at the table?”","At La Sirena, the Pleasures and Pitfalls of a

120,Ruffian Wine Bar & Chef’s Table,★,2016-05-31,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/dining/mr-donahues-ruffian-wine-bar-restaurant-review.html,East Village,"Keeping good small restaurants to myself is not what I’m paid for. Sure, I’ve enjoyed finding empty seats every night I’ve eaten at Mr. Donahue’s and Ruffian Wine Bar & Chef’s Table. Yes, I worry that both places would capsize under the strain of a party of six, let alone a full crew of hungry New York Times readers. But I didn’t take a newspaper job to keep secrets. I did it for the company stock. The smaller of the two is Mr. Donahue’s, although this is like a contest between a lentil and a chickpea. There are four chairs at two tables. Very nearby at the counter are five stools. Sitting at one, you see dime-store jars of hard candy, a lamp with a fringed pink shade, a Depression glass vase under a cloud of baby’s breath. You see a wicker monkey hanging by one arm above a window into the kitchen, where chickens make leisurely circles on a rotisserie. Most of these items were bought by the couple who own the restaurant, the chefs Ann Redding and Matt Danzer, who also own Uncle Boons. But the way they’ve put it together, everything just seems to have gradually accumulated over the decades. It’s as if you’d stepped into one of the little lunch counters with unpremeditated décor that used to be found in this part of town before it was called NoLIta. Five main courses and about twice as many side dishes are spelled in white on a letter board that has a blue-and-red Pepsi logo at the top. You pick two sides and a sauce at no extra cost. They will be served next to your main course on a sectioned china or glass plate, each in its own well, another tune from the past. We’re not supposed to want to eat this way anymore. Maybe that’s why, when I got my chicken-fried pork cheeks with Swiss chard and crab imperial, I was filled with gratitude. The chard was cooked with a little garlic and lemon and bread crumbs. The crab tasted of mayonnaise and Tabasco and had been browned and warmed inside a heavy foil dish in the shape of a crab shell. I spread it on saltines from a crinkly cellophane wrapper and ate it with the sensation of having found something I’d lost such a long time ago that I’d forgotten about it. Under rough whorls of golden batter, the cheeks were more tender and juicy than chicken-fried steak ever is. I ate them with a fine sauce of button mushrooms and Marsala, not too sweet. The romesco sauce — unorthodox, with more spicy red oil than usual — was very good with a whole porgy or the broiled steak of steelhead trout that replaced it. Honest-to-goodness gravy, rounded and meaty-tasting, is what you want with the heroic slab of roast beef. The beef was thoroughly rosy except at the edges, where it had a salty, crunchy, herb-flecked crust. The rotisserie chicken tasted like rotisserie chicken. With so few voices in the room, you almost always hear the music, which is soft and sounds as if it were coming from a tube radio that is still picking up an AM show that was broadcast a couple of years before the Beatles played Shea Stadium. It’s all big bands and crooners singing sweet words that are sad underneath, like “I’ll be seeing you in all the old familiar places.” (The only place he’ll be seeing her is in his head.) Cheap nostalgia hands you a fake past to make you smile. True nostalgia is mixed with pain because it conjures a past that was real and isn’t coming back. The nostalgia Ms. Redding and Mr. Danzer bring to Mr. Donahue’s is the second kind. Every detail shows their longing for the bygone world of Mr. Danzer’s grandfather Frank Donahue. He was a detective. His police cap sits on a shelf. For dessert, there is a root-beer float, if that’s what you want. Me, I’ll probably keep ordering the banana pudding forever, or until this mirage on Mott Street goes under and joins the past.  Just west of Tompkins Square Park in the East Village, Ruffian Wine Bar & Chef’s Table has more seats but not much more space. There’s barely enough room to squeeze your way to an empty stool at the concrete counter. The ones who are really in a tight spot, though, are the two chefs, Josh Ochoa and Andy Alexandre. Jammed behind one end of the counter, they arrange cheeses with house-made jam, warm some marinated olives that are as smoky as bacon, toast sliced baguettes for a knockout tomato chutney, plate some crisp, young radishes with bagna cauda, spread out sliced cross sections of fennel bulbs marinated simply and deliciously with sherry vinegar and fennel seeds, and plunge an immersion blender into batters that will go into the tiny convection oven and emerge as three-inch soufflés. The cheese soufflé, almost like a tower of soft scrambled eggs, makes a lush spread for toast darkened with a swirl of balsamic vinegar. The last time I went, it had been replaced by an equally good one with crab. I expected to like the beef tartare, but its sherry vinegar dressing made it too soupy and sour. I had no expectations of lentil salad, but it’s one of the best things on the menu. A variety of lentils and other legumes are firm, separate, not at all mushy, seasoned with dried chiles and curry leaves, swirled with yogurt sauce, and sprinkled with crisp threads of sev, the chickpea-flour snacks. Suddenly, dull old lentil salad is an exciting Indian street festival. (Mr. Ochoa and Mr. Alexandre met Patrick Cournot, an owner and a sommelier at Ruffian, when they all worked at Tabla.) There is usually a savory pie, either a big and imposing thing to be carved into wedges, or a small turnover filled let’s say with a well-seasoned mince of rabbit meat. The profiteroles are odd and overelaborated, with an acidic cream of mandarin oranges. The chocolate soufflé is better, if you have time to wait. In this kitchen, the only way to cook is one dish at a time. But of course you have time; you’re here to drink wine from a list that evidences Mr. Cournot’s open-minded curiosity. Like every other wine bar in town, Ruffian stocks some stars of the natural wine movement. It’s also picking up on the Georgian signals coming out of the Caucasus. But other choices show an independence from the latest trends, like a violet-scented pinot noir from Chile. Elena Hull Cournot, Mr. Cournot’s wife, has given this tight alley a surprisingly light, almost airy design, although the detail I remember most is the portrait of a horse on the back wall. She painted it with it a garland of orange flowers around its neck, like a lei. It has kind eyes and a nonjudgmental expression, fine traits in a portrait that hangs in a bar. A friend who has a lot of horse sense said, “The horse looks wise.” Horse, I’ll be seeing you.",Tiny Titans: Mr. Donahue’s and Ruffian Wine Bar,"['keeping', 'good', 'small', 'i’m', 'paid', 'sure',

121,Indian Accent,★★,2016-05-24,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/25/dining/indian-accent-restaurant-review.html,Midtown,"The emails from New Delhi began last spring. A new one arrived every few months, informing me that a branch of a restaurant in that city named Indian Accent was about to open in Midtown, and urging me to check it out. “Dear and Most Revered Mr. Pete,” one began. “Just wanted to let you know about the greatest Indian restaurant in the World.” Another praised the original location’s kulchas, or stuffed flatbreads, particularly one filled with duck and hoisin. “It’s as Indian as Padma Lakshmi,” my correspondent wrote. “But definitely more delicious.” These notes were my first exposure to the cult inspired by Manish Mehrotra. Since opening Indian Accent in a small hotel on the outskirts of New Delhi in 2009, he has become one of the most admired chefs in India. Mr. Mehrotra’s style is lightened by modern influences from abroad (he has trained in other Asian countries and worked in London) but anchored by the culture he grew up in; at his New Delhi restaurant, a scoop of kulfi may be served in a toy pressure cooker, an appliance roughly as common in Indian homes as microwaves are in American ones. In India, Mr. Mehrotra’s cooking feeds a desire to see traditional food bent, twisted and played with until it tastes new again. New York could use more of that, too. Junoon and Tamarind Tribeca are on the short list of comfortable, modern Indian restaurants where you can get dressed up for food that looks pretty on the plate. But surprises, ladled out by an active imagination working in an Indian mode, have been scarce since Tabla closed in 2010. Indian Accent, which finally opened in February at the foot of Le Parker Meridien Hotel, has surprises. It also has all the comforts of a restaurant where the prix fixe menu offers three courses at $75 (or $90 for four). Except for one gold wall at the far end of the restaurant, the interior stays away from anything that may play into preconceptions of how Indian restaurants are supposed to look. At the sharp-edged marble bar, cocktails are infused with tea and spices and made with a care that overcomes goofy names like Transcendental Medication. Tables are set with stiffly pressed napkins and thin-stemmed wineglasses — a cue to pay attention to Daniel Beedle’s list, which is well stocked with aromatic whites and savory reds that know how to get along with layered spices. Mr. Mehrotra shares the title of chef with Vivek Rana, who will eventually take charge of the kitchen. Duck kulcha isn’t on their menu, but the kulcha stuffed with pastrami and mustard helped me see why my New Delhi informants had been so excited. “The chef got the idea for this dish from Peking duck,” our server said as he set down a long wooden tray with a copper pan of shredded lamb at one end, a stack of thin griddled flatbreads called rumali roti in the other, with cucumber spears and four kinds of chutney in the middle. One of those was hoisin sauce subcontinentalized with tamarind, which did bring Peking within shouting distance. But as I folded a roti around some soft spiced lamb and spooned on one chutney or all four — they were great separately and great together — I kept thinking about tacos. Letting China, Mexico and the Carnegie Deli barge into an Indian restaurant without having the dinner turn into a chaotic grab bag is an impressive feat. And fried squid sprinkled with puffed rice and chickpea-flour threads to turn up the crunch factor? Well, why not, especially when the squid is dusted with a spice blend that could make a tongue depressor taste good. I don’t know how to categorize the “sweet pickle ribs.” They are not, in fact, pickled, but, in their tart mango sauce with strips of dried mango on top, these tender baby backs are so good I’d eat them under any name. The soy keema is a marvelous thing, too. This version is less like the original keema, a stew of ground lamb and peas, than it is like an energetically spiced filling for a vegetarian sloppy Joe. I’m seeing a takeout window with lines outside on 57th Street. It’s possible I got the whole idea from the delicious tiny rolls, perfumed with lime leaves, that accompany the keema on a skewer, looking like marshmallows ready for a campfire. Mixed in with the outstanding dishes are some that won’t inspire many international emails. Kolhapuri chicken, a chile-fueled curry from western India, appears as an appetizer of cold chicken salad that you could feed to the least adventurous eater you know. Fried shiso leaves looked impressive standing upright in a pile of potatoes and water chestnuts drizzled with chutney, but the batter was too thick for the herb to have much impact. Indian Accent is a young restaurant, still learning to transplant an approach that worked in New Delhi to Manhattan. It can take time for chefs to sort out their suppliers in a new region. Fillets of sea bass glazed with tamarind had a muddy, bottom-feeder taste that we don’t usually seek in wild saltwater fish. The menu is less confusing than it was at first, although the crossbreeding of a prix fixe setup with à la carte supplements can still be awkward. The lamb, for instance, costs an extra $38. The price is fair enough for a platter that is bigger than many main courses around town, but I wish it didn’t have to be stapled to the already considerable cost of a meal. The complexity of deciding what or how to order is one reason servers are prone to waitsplaining. Dinner requires a lot of patient listening and smiling in these early months. True, the menu is paved with terms some New Yorkers will trip over. I was happy to learn that the sweet potato shakarkandi are tender cubes stacked over shaved kohlrabi in one of the best small starters. But I’m always impatient to start eating, especially if what’s on the way is a dessert as wonderful as the makhan malai. Traditionally a street snack, here it is a fluffy mound of aerated saffron milk sprinkled with rose petals, almonds and palm sugar. The fun of the dessert is in the way these crystallized toppings transform the unsweetened saffron milk once everything meets inside your mouth. It’s the kind of happy collision that few restaurants in town can deliver as well as Indian Accent.",Indian Accent Has a Cosmopolitan Twang,"['email', 'delhi', 'began', 'last', 'spring', 'arrived',

122,Momofuku Nishi,★,2016-05-17,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/18/dining/momofuku-nishi-review.html,Chelsea,"Searching for money, for love and for food, we strike bargains. We may be content with one for years until we begin to be shadowed by the suspicion that the terms aren’t working out in our favor anymore. That doubt nagged me at Momofuku Nishi, which the chef David Chang opened in Chelsea in January. Early in his career, with Momofuku Noodle Bar and Momofuku Ssam Bar, Mr. Chang and his customers struck a deal that made decades of dining tradition look obsolete. He and his cooks could make Asian ingredients bend in new directions. The cooking could be gloriously unwholesome or willfully esoteric or stunningly precise, but it was never quite like anything else out there. In return for tasting these new sensations, Mr. Chang’s customers gave up amenities that used to be automatic at restaurants hoping to be taken seriously. When it comes to inflicting discomfort, Nishi still holds up its end of the bargain. You can make reservations, but not for a table, most of which are long and low; you’re likely to share yours with strangers. Instead, you reserve a chair, which, strictly speaking, is a seat built like a hard, flat crate. Ssam Bar has similar seating, but the lighting is more seductive and the noise level is less throttling. At Nishi, highly sensitive microphones seem to be placed directly above all the loudest people, picking up and amplifying their every screech. Mr. Chang told the Eater restaurant critic Ryan Sutton in March, when Nishi was two months old, that the acoustics “have to get better.” Reading that, I stayed away for six weeks, hoping for improvements. When I returned, the only obvious change was that more sound-dampening tiles had been affixed to the ceiling. If they helped, I couldn’t tell. In a phone interview, Mr. Chang told me he is “going crazy about the sound, but we are working actively to do the best we can.” Nishi is still as loud as the opening face-off of Game 1 of the Stanley Cup finals. Temporary soreness of the butt and throat were always potential downsides of a Momofuku meal. Back when we first agreed to the bargain, though, the food was so distractingly original and good that you wouldn’t have minded eating it while leaning up against a Dumpster in an alley sharing your chopsticks with GG Allin. At Nishi, you mind. The strongest dishes are exquisitely controlled plates of cold vegetables or protein that could easily fit into the lineup of a marathon menu at Momofuku Ko, the tasting counter where Nishi’s executive chef, Joshua Pinsky, cooked for more than five years. Shavings of watermelon radishes and raw beef veined with white fat are sprinkled with ponzu-enhanced dashi and a Spanish olive oil that really stands out. Threads of celery curl around raw mackerel, given a breath of char and bathed in a soy analogue fermented from rye, with a precise flicker of yuzu. Sea scallops dusted with salted, dried kelp rise from a green juice that tastes like cucumbers, peppers and herbs — or maybe it’s just wheatgrass? These dishes and others like them are extraordinarily good because the ingredients are allowed to speak quietly. But when the kitchen reaches for the throttle, the results can be muddled or muted. Snails and anchovies seemed to be straining to keep a $55 prime rib from seeming ordinary and slightly dry. Where was the salted crust? Where was the invitation to give in to fleshy temptations held out by Ssam Bar’s rotisserie duck or its pork shoulder? Mackerel was almost perfectly cooked, but nothing about it made me want to come back for more, not the lukewarm daikon hiding under it nor the barbecue sauce spread on top, a blend so complex and balanced it canceled itself out. Allegedly, Nishi is Mr. Chang’s foray into Italy, although that’s not at all apparent until you dip into the noodles. The clams grand Lisboa is, I guess, a twist on spaghetti alle vongole. The fun of it is the way skinny chow mein noodles have been toasted before cooking, so you get some soft strands and some crackly ones in the same bite. Footnotes on the right side of the menu provide cryptic references to source materials. The one for the chitarra points toward the chef Mark Ladner’s pasta with crab meat and jalapeños. That dish is memorable. The Nishi version is not. Mr. Ladner’s bright clarity is replaced with a confusion of dried squid, XO sauce, fermented chiles and chile paste. One time it was spicy but too sweet; another time it was less sweet but not spicy enough. The dish everybody talks about is called ceci e pepe, a takeoff on cacio e pepe made with chickpea hozon, a fermented paste made and sold in tiny amounts by Momofuku. Hozon does taste a bit like cheese, but not like the pecorino used in a classic cacio e pepe — it’s missing that wild pasture flavor of sheep’s milk. The dish is also missing a few degrees of heat; like some of the other noodles, ceci e pepe has a habit of arriving lukewarm. A homage this far off the mark would be fine if the goal were to avoid animal fats, but butter slips around the strands of house-made bucatini. I don’t know why this dish exists, except to find a use for a proprietary Momofuku product. Too much of the cooking at Nishi is self-referential, inward looking and so concerned with technique that you can’t help being conscious of it. In his early days, Mr. Chang served the kind of food chefs like to eat: intense, animalistic, O.K. with messiness, indifferent to prettiness. Nishi serves the kind of food chefs cook to impress one another. As Mr. Chang’s operation has grown into a global concern with branches in Australia and Canada, his restaurants started to offer amenities that were once unimaginable. The cocktails at Nishi, like the margarita with an absinthe rinse, are clever in the right way. There is satisfying range on the wine list, too; the nuanced Farrside pinot noir from Australia is a far cry from the sparkling shiraz that was one of the only bottles Ssam Bar carried in its first year. If dinner in Changland now includes intelligent drinking, why can’t it also encompass seating and acoustics that won’t leave your lower back in knots and your eardrums in shreds? When we made our original deal with Momofuku, we were all kinds of swept away by the rush of flavors we had never encountered before. Now that Mr. Chang has a dozen years’ worth of protégés and copycats, now that he even seems to be copying himself, now that the rest of us have cooler heads and other options, it’s time to take another look at that bargain.","At Momofuku Nishi, David Chang’s Magic Shows a Little Wear","['searching', 'money', 'love', 'strike', 'bargain', 'content', 'year', 'begin', 'shadowed', 'suspicion',

123,Café Altro Paradiso,★★,2016-05-10,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/dining/cafe-altro-paradiso-review.html,SoHo,"Over the 11 or so weeks Café Altro Paradiso has been open, I’ve taken some photographs that are as awful as the food is good. The restaurant’s carpaccio is simple and marvelous, a single piece of raw bison pounded so thin that when it is laid over small, newly fried potato chips and a mound of arugula salad, it drapes like purple silk. My picture, though, could be a close-up of a skinned knee, or an aerial shot of a dormant volcano made out of flesh. One night, a whole turbot was roasted on the bone until its skin neared blackness. Its upturned mouth and fan-shaped tail hung over the edges of a plain white plate. On the side was an off-white gob of mayonnaise in a small white dish, which did nothing to improve my picture but did taste very good on the edge of a forkful of sweet, slightly sticky fish. If you added a sprig of curly parsley, the restaurant’s lamb chop could come from a 1950s supper club. A meat with two sides, it’s barely photographable, and I’d eat it again in a minute. First, I’d go after the white shell beans cooked to the brink of collapse. Then I’d take a strip of Calabrian chile with a forkful of the chop. I might skip the slices of roasted shoulder on the side of the plate — a little tough — but not the thin curve of meat and fat that, left on the outside edge of the bone, crisped up like bacon. I’d save it for last, like an after-dinner chocolate. This can’t be an accident, the inverse relation between prettiness and deliciousness at Café Altro Paradiso. The kitchen — Aidan O’Neal is the chef de cuisine under the direction of Ignacio Mattos, the chef and an owner — seems to be trying to strip food down to the bare elements of flavor. Dressing it up again would be like tacking vinyl siding to the concrete front of the Met Breuer, where Mr. Mattos plans to open a restaurant this year. Refusing to decorate its plates doesn’t seem to have hurt business. There’s been a steady flow of curious diners who know or know of Mr. Mattos’s first restaurant, Estela. His partner in both is Thomas Carter, a front-of-house specialist with a concentration in wine. Neither man was especially well known when Estela opened in a low-ceilinged and stubbornly noisy space a few steps above Houston Street, but Mr. Mattos had an instinct for cooking that was direct and idiosyncratic without seeming forced, and Mr. Carter put together a list so full of accessible discoveries that Estela could be seen as an unofficial wine bar. The place quickly achieved cult status. (After President Obama took his wife there for a dinner date in 2014, the cult went global.) For their second act, Mr. Mattos and Mr. Carter seem to have fantasized on the theme of a simple Italian cafe. Servers at Café Altro Paradiso wear proletarian button-up jackets of navy blue cotton as they carry amaro and tiramisù on silver trays to the bare wood tables. The high ceilings and the vast windows facing the peeling trunks of plane trees in a cobblestoned SoHo park suggest that eventually the dining room will be a fine place to enjoy a tranquil and possibly solitary breakfast or lunch. Only dinner is served now, and it’s far from tranquil, although the partners have clearly learned a thing or two about acoustic panels since they opened Estela. The greater comfort of this casual spinoff is a paradox, though not one anybody is going to complain about. A second paradox deserves a moment’s pause, though. In keeping with the small-plates regimen followed at Estela, most of the portions at Café Altro Paradiso are deliberately small. Servers make a point of telling you that the pasta is not the size of a main course. This could be a problem for people who walk in under the impression that they are in a normal Italian cafe. Say you were in the mood to sit at the bar with a glass of Lugana from Cá Lojera, a Lombardian white with fresh tropical-fruit overtones, eating ramp pesto over very flavorful whole-grain spaghetti for dinner. Would you be delighted to find that you could transfer all the spaghetti in your bowl into one cupped hand? But for now, just play the kitchen’s game and schedule pasta as a midmeal diversion. Eat the slow-cooked chicken ragù brightened with briny green olives and tossed with skinny, chewy tubes of garganelli and you should be happy. Have the near-transparent sheets of cannelloni rolled up around a light, unsoggy filling of ricotta flecked with greens, and you should be even happier. Before pasta, there is grilled bread with cut-up anchovies, chile oil and parsley on a bed of butter; or pale fennel shavings with orange zest and soft curls of good provolone; or a pink and juicy Italian sausage with fruity mustard and chopped broccoli rabe; or the carpaccio. All of it sounds ordinary but is far from it. After pasta, you might investigate that supper-club lamb chop, or the polenta and stewed onions under a lobe of calf’s liver, so creamy inside it’s like a pink organ-meat custard. I’d sidestep the thickish pork Milanese, no thrill especially when served with unsalted peas and favas. Sometimes Mr. O’Neal and Mr. Mattos manage to push simplicity in directions that seem novel. Other times, they don’t push quite hard enough, and it’s hard to tell Café Altro Paradiso apart from the hordes of other restaurants where you can have cheese and salami followed by a so-so pork cutlet. Like the portion sizes, the interestingness quotient may need fine-tuning as the restaurant grows up. This seems well within the grasp of Mr. O’Neal, who in his last job, running the kitchen at M. Wells Dinette, helped bundles of spaghetti transition into sandwich form, among other exercises in the art of channeling chaos. And it should be old hat for Mr. Mattos, whose cooking at Isa a few years back was at times interesting to a fault. One very encouraging sign is how perceptively the pastry kitchen has located the sensuous side in some traditional Italian-cafe sweets. The dark and bittersweet chocolate-walnut torta is intense without congealing into fudge, and the rhubarb crostata has a crust that’s a pleasure on its own. Even the gelato is a nice surprise. There’s a rich and unusual one with honey and chestnuts, and another with dried figs and vin santo. It reminds me of the classic French ice cream made from prunes and Armagnac, but without the booze on its breath.",Looks Aren’t Everything at Café Altro Paradiso,"['week', 'café', 'altro', 'paradiso',

124,Chaiwali,★,2016-04-26,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/27/dining/chaiwali-review-indian-food-harlem.html,Harlem,"Greeting us when we walked into Chaiwali, the Indian restaurant she runs on the first two floors of her brownstone in Harlem, Anita Trehan had two tables to offer. All the others were taken. It was a busy Friday night. “I have this long wood table here,” she said. “Or,” she continued, extending one arm toward the foot of the staircase leading to a second-story dining room, “I have this beautiful little marble table right there.” She sounded as if it were a prize she had been saving for the first people she thought would appreciate it. Now, this table sits in a tight corner. Its edges are deeply scalloped, so once our samosas and smoked eggplant arrived, it became clear that the marble surface was even smaller than it looked. But by that point, it didn’t matter. The owner, who is also the chef, the decorator and the occupant of the house’s upper stories, had proudly seated us at a piece of furniture she had bought and placed there because she liked the way it looked. What were we going to do but settle in and see what else she wanted to share with us? This must be one reason large, diverse crowds have descended on Chaiwali since it opened last year despite its fairly low profile outside the neighborhood. So many restaurants that draw more publicity seem interchangeable: Nobody would notice if they traded menu items, light fixtures or any employees short of the chef. Chaiwali does not always have their caliber of professionalism; servers are genial but may forget dishes, and when it’s time to clear the table, they may disappear into the vapor. But it does have its own way of looking at the world. Ms. Trehan seems to have built the restaurant on the belief that the things she likes will make the rest of us happy, too. You see this in eccentric bits of decoration, like the stuffed peacock that perches on the upstairs bar. The whole second floor is a bit of a peacock; there’s also a taxidermied antelope head and a flamboyant mural of a tigress and butterflies. A wall of glass looks out over Lenox Avenue, but the real scenery is inside. The downstairs dining room is calmer, with an intricate pattern traced on the exposed brick walls and a row of windows facing the garden, where a big communal table sits inside what looks like a giant birdcage. Maybe the peacock used to live there. The menu feels personal, too. It reminds me of the relaxed, light-handed, modern food that Americans with roots in India, like Ms. Trehan, may cook at home. Her recipes probably aren’t her grandmother’s, but she pays attention to the quality and balance of saffron, fenugreek, ginger and coriander. What comes out of her kitchen looks attractive, but it hasn’t been whipped into stiff peaks of fine-dining artiness. I could imagine being invited to a dinner party where Chaiwali’s smoked eggplant dip, full of garlic and juicy black olives, was put out with hot sheets of flatbread while everybody limbered up over cocktails. “Just Samosas,” as the menu calls them, might appear next. They have a potato-pea filling with a decidedly peppery bite. It’s a treat to find samosa wrappers as thin and greaseless as these in a restaurant. In the winter, the first course could be Chaiwali’s silky carrot soup, intensely flavored with saffron and a few fried curry leaves that float on the surface. In summer, maybe the appetizer would be the Goa shrimp ceviche, sweetened with little cubes of mango; the host would tell everybody to dump the little saucer of puffed rice and fried threads of chickpea flour over the top for crunch. Then, if you were in luck, she might carry vindaloo lamb chops to the table, having marinated the meat with vinegar for tenderness and ginger for flavor. Chaiwali makes vindaloo with complexity and nuance, nothing like the aggro-curry the color of a rusted tailpipe served in generic Indian restaurants. It comes with potatoes softly roasted with whole mustard seeds, a recipe that I am going to steal. Other main courses can expose the kitchen’s vulnerabilities. The small pieces of black pepper chicken were dry both times I tried the dish. The pool of lightly curried tomato gravy helped, though, and I enjoyed the nutty and firm red quinoa served in place of the traditional rice. The okra fries served with the excellent sautéed fish, seasoned with mustard seeds and herbs, then dredged in a delicate rice-flour batter, sounded great in theory. In practice, their crust was going soggy one night, and while it was quite crisp and hot on another, some of the long green pods, cut lengthwise, were a little stringy. Still, I’d order either dish again, which I wouldn’t say about the Desi pasta, which changes night to night but which, when I met up with it, was tossed with a shiitake-cream sauce. I remember nothing about it except the color, which I’d call off-mustard. The clever veggie burger, a tall fritter of kale pakora with avocado, lettuce and tomato on a bun, made a more appealing meatless dinner. Desserts find a happy medium between too basic and too complicated. The one called Alice’s Jamaican rum and biscuit pudding tastes something like a tiramisù spiked with booze. Mango whipped with yogurt and goat cheese is like a lassi turned into a mousse. (There’s an actual mango lassi on the drinks menu, and it’s good, too.) The one dessert that scared me was the one I liked best: the curry cumin cookies. These little ginger-spiked bites, crumbly like shortbreads, are refreshing and bright, with a black pepper finish that took me by surprise in the best way. The cookies worked a small miracle that nothing else has ever accomplished: They actually made me want a cup of chai. But the chai at Chaiwali is not the lukewarm broth of dirty milk in a paper cup that you get in coffee shops. It is a potent mocha-colored drink, like a cortado made with strong black tea and spices. It was Ms. Trehan’s desire for a cup of chai made the Indian way, the way she used to enjoy it in Delhi, that drove her to open Chaiwali. Of the many reasons people have for starting a restaurant, the desire to serve something they themselves want to eat and drink is one of the best.","Chaiwali, an Indian Restaurant That Feels Like

125,The Spotted Pig,★,2016-04-19,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/20/dining/salvation-burger-spotted-pig-review.html,West Village,"April Bloomfield and Ken Friedman’s newest restaurant, inside the Pod 51 Hotel on East 51st Street, is called Salvation Burger. I can’t say that the first word of the name filled me with hope. The last time this chef and her business partner offered us salvation in a Pod hotel, they gave us Salvation Taco, a thronged taqueria designed for, and seemingly run by, people who don’t know what a taco is. That second word was promising, though. Ms. Bloomfield definitely knows what a burger is. There are many good things on her menu at the Spotted Pig, the first restaurant she opened with Mr. Friedman. But each time I ate there recently to see how it was settling into its second decade, it was Ms. Bloomfield’s burger I saw on almost every table, high and proud next to a tumbleweed of shoestring fries. And it’s her lamb patty under feta and onions at the Breslin that is most likely to tempt diners away from the other meaty, fatty delights. At Salvation Burger, she zeros in on what the people want and dispenses with almost everything else. Three of the five main courses are burgers, and all five come on a bun. She also knocks out bar snacks like popcorn and beef jerky, along with salads and pies, but nobody will accuse Ms. Bloomfield of padding the menu. The beef burgers come in two forms, highbrow and lowbrow. Representing the former is the Salvation Burger itself, a tall, tender half-pound patty of ground beef with cheese and mushrooms on a sesame seed bun. Servers like to say this is “cooked like a steak,” but not many restaurant steaks are grilled over a wood fire. Maybe they should be. This burger combines a dark crust that has the specific flavor of charred beef with a soft interior evenly cooked to medium-rare so when you bite down, it surrenders its warm pink juices. Slumped in a dirty tank top in the lowbrow corner is a double-decker burger called the Classic. If the Salvation Burger tastes like a steakhouse, this one tastes like America. The two patties, pancaked to a blackening crunch on the griddle, sprawl beyond the borders of the bun, running with “special sauce” and yellow cheese that works as a second sauce. Pickles are hiding inside, good ones, but everything on this burger comes together in a single impression that bypasses analytical thinking and goes directly to raw, thumping want. The Salvation and the Classic would seem to cover the twin poles of burger lust, but for those who aren’t moved by beef, Ms. Bloomfield makes a vegetarian patty of carrots and lentils threaded by clear vermicelli of sweet potato starch. The spices are Indian and the effect is excellent; it is not a meat substitute but a very flavorful concoction in its own right. Whether you want the fried fish sandwich depends on whether you can be content with the taste of tartar sauce while everyone around you is wiping beef fat from their lips. That the sauce is whipped up in the kitchen probably won’t be the deciding factor either way, just as knowing that Ms. Bloomfield is turning Cheddar into a facsimile of American cheese won’t be a huge consideration for those who want the Classic. (The kitchen’s motto could be “simple food the hard way.”) The house-baked buns, on the other hand, do make a difference. The top-split roll with a Parker House flavor is a major contributor to the all-around excellence of the oversize hot dog that runs with juices like an Italian sausage when you break its seared skin. Buried under a spicy confetti of giardiniera, the hot dog is this restaurant’s sleeper. At $14, will it become a hit? The $25 price on the Salvation Burger doesn’t seem to have hurt it, even though fries cost another $7. (These sagged with oil the first time I tried them, but stood up straight as Popsicle sticks on later visits.) I couldn’t warm up to the incongruous combination of sweet cocktail sauce and garlic butter on the wood-roasted oysters, but I’d come back again just for Salvation Burger’s rich and bittersweet chili, made with the shanks from the sides of beef that are broken down and aged in the kitchen, on their way to burgerhood. For dessert, what else but pie? The standard pies still need work. The crusts are both too thin and too soft, and the ones with a thick dairy layer, like the banana cream pie with translucent banana chips stuck into its surface like armor, aren’t as creamy as they should be. Far more appealing are the fried pies, golden rectangles filled with apples or blueberries. All they are missing is a wax-paper envelope to pick them up with. They taste better when you eat them with your hands. Even with dessert and a wait for a table, a meal at Salvation Burger won’t swallow your entire night. This isn’t the case at the Spotted Pig. The crowds haven’t thinned appreciably since the place opened in 2004, and you still can’t reserve. Once you’re finally seated, a three-course dinner can take a couple of hours. After my most-recent dinners there, I left thinking that there had to be more rewarding ways to spend the evening. One time, my party of four was quoted a 90-minute wait. We passed the time at an extremely pleasant cocktail bar down the street, Orient Express. When no text had come through after an hour and a half, one of us went back to check. “You’re looking at another 45 minutes,” a host said. No apology, no smile. In fact, we were seated much sooner than that, but our moods were scuffed. Another night, another cooling-off period, another what-do-you-want greeting: Our server, when she finally noticed our table, stood next to it and said nothing. This was a little tense. Finally one of us blurted, “We’re ready to order some stuff.” “Some stuff or all the stuff?” she asked. The servers at Spotted Pig give the impression that they are going to get up to something at the end of their shift that’s more interesting than whatever I’m going to do. This can be charming except when they seem in a hurry to get there. When they finally let you eat, the food can be wonderful. The smoked haddock chowder is a creamy bowl of winter solace, and when it was succeeded on the menu by a minted sweet pea soup with soft shredded ham hock, I cheered for spring. I loved being reunited with an old Pig standby, the bitter green salad with lobes of lemon pulp and pigs’ ears fried to a crackerlike lightness, and I have a new appreciation for the plump mussels in a lightly sour curry that tastes of toasted spices. But there can be a haphazardness to the cooking that wasn’t always part of the bargain. The much-praised sheep’s milk gnocchi can be gummy and dense, the chicken liver toasts can be oversweetened with reduced Port and Madeira, and a big slug of horseradish cream was so cold it cooled the skirt steak it was plopped on top of. When the Spotted Pig was last reviewed in The New York Times, in 2006, Frank Bruni added up the pleasures and subtracted the inconveniences to come up with a one-star rating. Ten years later, the equation is slightly different, but the sum is the same.",The Best Comes in a Bun at Salvation Burger and Spotted Pig,"['april', 'bloomfield', 'ken', 'friedman’s', 'newest',

126,I Sodi,★★,2016-04-12,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/13/dining/i-sodi-restaurant-review.html,West Village,"Medium-rare is how I ordered my tagliata, a grilled sirloin that is, like almost everything else at I Sodi, prepared the way it would be in Tuscany. Right away I changed my mind and asked for it rare. I wanted the sliding smoothness of nearly raw beef. The server thought I had it right the first time. “We cook the steak on the lighter side,” he said. “Medium-rare here is like rare in the rest of America.” Although it has been in business on one of Christopher Street’s less rollicking blocks for eight years now, I Sodi seems not to have fully assimilated into the United States. It exists in its own extraterritorial jurisdiction, like the headquarters of the United Nations. To eat there is to abide by the laws of eating that Rita Sodi, the chef and owner, brought with her from the farm north of Florence where she was raised. These private laws dictate a menu that is rigidly Tuscan. In its only previous review in The New York Times, an unstarred notice in 2008, Julia Moskin reported that I Sodi offered one risotto, two pastas, three main courses and “a couple of salads.” The menu has grown since then, but it has not wandered into other regions of Italy. And if you are inclined to pop your head into the kitchen to ask for fettuccine Alfredo topped with grilled shrimp, you may want to make sure that Ms. Sodi does not have a knife in her hand. The laws also require cooking that is mercilessly yoked to the season. When artichokes are good, they will appear on the menu under antipasti (sliced into a clean and guileless salad of pale, papery shavings that squeak between your teeth, dressed with shards of Parmigiano-Reggiano and a peppery young olive oil); contorni (fried until their young leaves are curled, crisp and bronze); and primi (layered with béchamel into a green lasagna, as plump and yielding as a featherbed, with so many thin and tender pasta sheets that I have never been able count them all, though I should say that I am usually preoccupied with eating them). Above all, the laws demand that Ms. Sodi dedicate herself so thoroughly to the Tuscan ways of stewing meat sauce, crimping ravioli or squashing Cornish game hens under an iron weight that her own ideas almost completely disappear. She does have ideas, of course. But they do not scream for attention, and neither does she. In her cooking, her ego disappears into her pride in where she comes from. This, along with the slightness of her opening menu and some early trial and error, may be why Ms. Sodi waited so long for recognition. A small squall of publicity finally rained down on her in 2014, when she opened Via Carota with the chef Jody Williams. (The two were married last year.) But I Sodi is still known, by the New Yorkers who know it at all, more as a neighborhood beacon than as a chef’s turn in the spotlight. The current food scene rewards egotistic gestures of novel techniques or ingredient pairings above rigorous devotion to tradition like Ms. Sodi’s. But there can’t be any doubt that she is one of the city’s great pasta practitioners when you eat I Sodi’s square little chestnut-filled chestnut-flour tortelli in a sauce of butter and grated cheese, or butter-slicked ravioli stuffed with ricotta and spinach under fried sage leaves, or spaghetti cacio e pepe, noodles that twirl up into your mouth with a wiggle, carrying a black-pepper bite that lingers on and on. In I Sodi’s kitchen, main ingredients are prohibited from hiding. Chicken is fried inside the thinnest shroud of crust imaginable, one that fuses with the skin into crunch without substance. The baked branzino is sweet, dense, naked except for olive oil; it doesn’t need even a drop of lemon juice. I used to believe that beef tartare needed to be blasted with lightning bolts of salt, mustard and other seasonings until I heaped some of I Sodi’s on a long slice of grilled bread. It tasted like raw beef — filet mignon in firm pieces the size of a blueberry — and extra-virgin olive oil. It did not taste salty, although it must contain salt. Salt is allowed to hide. Sugar is, too. This makes some desserts more implacable than they should be, like the crostata spread with a layer of orange marmalade so thin that viewed from the side it would disappear. But it’s nice to have the natural sweetness of cream and milk in the panna cotta left mostly alone. As for the laws governing customers at I Sodi, they are lenient. If you want to eat at one of the eight or so tables that are draped in white cloths, make a reservation. If you want to eat on one of the 16 backless leather seats at the bar, show up early. The dining room is spartan, tight, untheatrical and almost always packed. According to some stalkers of Italian flavor, you should stay away from I Sodi’s risotto, for which other regions are better known than Tuscany. Certainly the underseasoned and gummy mushroom risotto I left on my plate recently couldn’t compete with any of Ms. Sodi’s pastas. There is no penalty if you don’t drink one of the seven Negroni variations, only rewards if you do. Drinking two, at $13 to $15 each, will be cheaper than a bottle of wine. There are some real treats on the list, many from exactly the region you’d expect, but very few cost less than $70.

127,Lilia,★★★,2016-03-29,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/dining/lilia-restaurant-review.html,Williamsburg,"My one-sentence review of Lilia for the too-long-didn’t-read crowd: Missy Robbins is cooking pasta again. That is all you need to know before you begin plotting a night at this casual Brooklyn restaurant with Manhattan-level underpinnings. Lilia’s menu has many other very good things, but pasta made by Ms. Robbins is a direct route to happiness that has been shut off to New Yorkers since she left the two A Voce restaurants in 2013. Slip a fork into the pappardelle with veal Bolognese. Shiny with just enough herb-flecked sauce that one noodle peels away from the rest as you lift, they are rolled so thin that they’re almost weightless. Taste them, and you notice their delicacy along with the naked simplicity of the chopped veal gently cooked into tenderness with dark and meaty dried porcini. There is no milk in this Bolognese and no tomatoes apart from some juice, but nothing is missing. Stab an agnolotto, bring a parcel of sheep’s milk ricotta and feta in gorgeously supple yellow dough to your mouth. It’s been rolled in melted butter with honey and saffron threads. The perfume is subtle but insistent, and when it threatens to be too much, you bite into a soft dried tomato. Why did everybody turn against dried tomatoes? At the right time, they’re wonderful, and this is one of those times. The ricotta gnocchi are tender cheese dumplings that seem to be held together by nothing but the force of Ms. Robbins’s will. Their sauce is a crunchy pesto of broccoli and pistachios, spring-green and exciting. The ruffled edges of long belts called malfadini carry melted butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano with the peppermint tickle of pink peppercorns. Some sources call this shape “mafaldine” and say it is named after a Princess Mafalda. Our server said the word meant “badly cut,” but this can’t be right. There is no badly made pasta at Lilia. Like Barbuto in the West Village, Lilia inhabits the shell of an old garage. This one, in Williamsburg, is full of bleached wood and white furniture that seem chosen to reflect the sun coming through the windows and skylights in the early evening. And as with Barbuto, the food is Italian, confident and coursing with energy. The intent of every dish seems to be making you glad you’re there. Ms. Robbins gets across her points using only a few ingredients that haven’t been contorted out of shape. She has the assurance of a chef who has been at it long enough that Barack Obama was a fan of her cooking at Spiaggia in Chicago before he was the president. Now proprietor of her own shop, she stands each night at a bend in the counter separating Lilia’s dining room and kitchen. To her right is a wood-burning grill that runs as hot as a forge. The cooks stationed in front of it look as if they are baking in their jackets, like potatoes. They gulp water from plastic quarts, enduring the heat while out at the tables, eyes go wide over the flavors coming off the flames. One night, there was a quietly smoky chicken leg under spicy olives mashed with capers and brightened with mint leaves. There were thin stems of broccoli rabe, too, tasting unusually sweet against the olives. You could eat this once a week, and it would not stop tasting new. Another night brought a flank steak of veal wearing fresh herbs and olive oil. It had been grilled to the soft pink of medium-rare pork, but its flavor was more precise and nuanced. I wish more restaurants would find veal of this quality and cook it so simply and well. But meat is a minor motif. Grilled seafood is a major one, second in importance only to pasta. The menu separates it into “little fish” of appetizer size and “big fish,” which aren’t all that big; they’re normal main courses. One of these, grilled black bass with exceptional little roasted potatoes, was spread with a really energetic salsa verde that got extra lift from tarragon. Raisin- and sage-fueled Marsala (remember Marsala?) had the right amount of sweetness and zip for a juicy white hunk of swordfish. Under little fish, my favorite turned out to be sardines given a semisweet and citrusy cure, then laid over grilled crostini spread with soft butter. Sardines and butter are a great combination, and here they got along even better than usual. Some grilled scallops got a bit lost in an excess of yogurt-walnut dip. But tender grilled baby squid held their own on top of whole sweet tomatoes, cured and marinated, and so did tiny grilled clams in a tangy dressing of Calabrian chiles. The antipasti don’t always look like antipasti. Most of them are vegetables, some presented like salads (grilled fennel with blood oranges) and others like side dishes (roasted squash with a sticky caramelized surface bathed in brown butter). The bagna cauda, vegetables crowded around a warm dip that, excellently, contains a huge dose of anchovies, is a more traditional antipasto. So is the prosciutto listed under “Cocktail snacks.” You drape it on bread that you spread with butter that’s been creamed with grated Parmigiano-Reggiano. Then you dab it with pickled mustard seeds soaked in balsamic vinegar. Then you shake your head a little at how smart Ms. Robbins is about augmenting classic Italian flavors without stepping all over them. Desserts follow that template. The olive oil cake is luxuriously rich, with a satisfyingly browned crust. A tart of crisp sliced apples is excellent, too. I wasn’t expecting much from soft-serve gelato with mix-and-match toppings, but a swirl of vanilla under a spoonful of walnuts preserved in lemon syrup tasted exactly right. Lilia is the first and, for now, only restaurant owned and operated by Ms. Robbins. This makes it something of a rarity: the sole focus of a midcareer chef who has the maturity to stay away from trends and novelties, the experience to know what will be delicious, the managerial skill to pull it off, and the time to make it work. It’s hard to begrudge her peers’ decisions to leverage success into sprawling empires. Then when you eat at Lilia, it’s hard not to wonder if the rest of us are losing something in the bargain.","At Lilia in Brooklyn, Missy Robbins Is Cooking Pasta Again","['onesentence', 'review',

128,Insa,★★,2016-03-15,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/dining/insa-restaurant-review.html,Gowanus,"From the first soft bite of blood sausage, I knew I would like Insa.  Just seeing the word “soondae” on the menu of this new Korean restaurant had been enough to get my hopes up. Purplish links of coagulated pigs’ blood bound by rice and an arterial network of springy, skinny cellophane noodles, soondae does not tend to travel far from Korean neighborhoods. Insa sits between a moving company and a mechanic’s garage in an industrial patch of Brooklyn near the Gowanus Canal. The area is not crowded with Korean restaurants or, for that matter, Koreans. Soondae here? If nothing else, it suggested that Insa had plenty of confidence. I dragged one dark, purplish slice across a line of salt laced with ground chile and perilla seeds. The seared skin crackled between my teeth: the sign of an animal-gut casing. Blood sausage can sometimes be dry, but Insa’s soondae spilled with tender crumbs that were almost juicy, moistened with braised pigs’ snouts and ground belly meat. The noodles gave it a little bounce but didn’t get in the way of the deep, galvanic taste of iron. It was wonderfully well made, and not quite like any soondae I’d tasted on 32nd Street or on the kimchi belt along Northern Boulevard in Queens. Insa was opened before Christmas by Sohui Kim and her husband, Ben Schneider. He is the designer, woodworker, decorator of the themed karaoke rooms in back, and propmaster of the retro lounge that’s dressed in David Lynch red. She is the chef. Mr. Schneider was raised in Manhattan. Ms. Kim moved from Seoul to the Bronx when she was 10. The couple also owns the Good Fork, about two miles away in Red Hook, Brooklyn, where the menu dips its toes into Korean cuisine. The one at Insa dives straight into it. Chefs trying to get American eaters to fall for another country’s cooking often toss essential flavors out the window. The restaurant crosses over, but the cuisine becomes roadkill. Insa is a rare crossover that limits most of its tweaks to externals. Traditional Korean recipes may be altered, in texture for instance (soondae is not usually pan-seared), but their spirit is largely left intact. For customers who did not grow up with Korean food, Insa puts extra clarity into the way the menu is written and explained by servers, most of whom are lavishly tattooed. Almost nothing on it qualifies as fusion, though. Even the seafood corn dog has antecedents in Seoul, although Insa hasn’t yet copied the impressive Korean idea of incorporating French fries right into a corn dog. Officially, Insa is a barbecue restaurant. Gas burners are punched into the centers of the long mess-hall tables lined up between buffed wooden benches. The tables are about as wide across as a rowboat. This made conversation a challenge — one of my guests, who has a voice that could wake sleeping livestock, later said he wanted to borrow a karaoke microphone to make himself heard — but we needed the space when the rest of the food came. As soon as the blue flames jump up, little dishes (banchan) start to circle the ring. Good banchan signal seriousness in a Korean kitchen, and the ones at Insa are really flavorful, made with care: cabbage and daikon, pink with chile paste and fermented on site; chewy black beans in salty syrup; peanuts with silvery dried anchovies; chewy bands of cuttlefish with time-release flavor. Barbecue was rarely my favorite thing on the table, though. The very fresh-tasting squid and octopus grilled up beautifully, but I missed the scent of charcoal, and Insa’s gas flames seemed too low to give the marinated short rib strips or thinly shaved brisket the crisp edges I like. The dishes I look forward to eating again are those cooked in the open kitchen off to one side. Insa’s yuk hwe is one of the most suave versions of beef tartare any Korean restaurant has served me. The chopped eye of round is chilly and firm, crunchy with Asian pear and fried capers, and deliciously shiny with sesame oil. I would have lapped it up with a spoon, but it was, no doubt, better on gnarled curls of shrimp chips. Insa’s tteokbokki are terrific, too: pudgy little fingers of rice stick blackly seared on the bottom for crunch. They are tossed with tender ovals of seafood sausage and smacked with chile paste. The heat was not incinerating, but it was warm enough. At other times, Insa didn’t supply the burn I’ve come to love at other Korean restaurants. The bibimbap in particular seemed afraid of getting noticed. Spice doses can be recalibrated, though. What sets Insa apart is a modern chef’s sensitivity to technique and ingredients. (The squid that are so good on the grill are just as welcome in the thick and unusually fluffy seafood pajeon.) The chef de cuisine, Michael Stokes, came up with the soondae, and the sous-chef, Yong Shin, is responsible for the seafood corn dog, a fine snack to eat at Insa’s tiki bar. There, no outrigger dangles from the ceiling, and an animated underwater video screen stands in for the tanks of live fish at torchlit palaces like the dearly departed Kahiki Supper Club in Columbus, Ohio. But the bartenders wear aloha shirts as they reach for coconut mugs and Fu Manchu cups for their modernized Polynesian drinks. A tiki bar! Exotica from Polynesia, a land so vaguely defined in the American imagination that it was able to encompass piña coladas, egg rolls and teriyaki chicken, clearly has no business in a serious modern Korean restaurant. But bastardized cocktails are preferable to bastardized cuisine. The cocktail menu looks interesting. To tell the truth, I never made it past the mai tai. The first one I tried was dominated by “local almond milk syrup” (orgeat cooked up in Red Hook from nonlocal nuts), but in my second, the lime juice was prominent, the way it should be. It wasn’t a Trader Vic’s mai tai, but it was all right in its own way, I decided, as I finished my fourth. By that time, I was in the jungle room, clutching a microphone for dear life as if that would be enough to give me the extra octaves I needed for “Blue Bayou.” I hadn’t meant to sing. But one of the servers had opened the door on a room swaddled in orchids and tropical leaves and artificial turf. Then somebody keyed a Dolly Parton number into the karaoke machine. “There’s also a deep-sea room, a space room and a psychedelic room,” the server said, discreetly closing the door. I’d like to describe all the others. To tell the truth, I never made it past the jungle room.",Insa Brings Korean Cooking to Industrial Brooklyn,"['soft', 'bite', 'blood', 'sausage', 'knew', 'like', 'insa', 'seeing', 'word', '“soondae”',

129,High Street on Hudson,★★,2016-03-08,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/09/dining/high-street-on-hudson-review.html,West Village,"High Street on Hudson is an adventurous and often exciting restaurant trying extremely hard to pass for an ordinary West Village cafe. “Philly spinoff providing house-made breads & pastries, elevated sandwiches, coffee & cocktails,” is Google’s capsule summary. The description is factual to the last ampersand, yet it doesn’t go past the camouflage this place wrapped around itself when it sidled into town in December. What is missing, what you may miss at first if you came for breakfast or lunch, the only meals High Street on Hudson served in its first few weeks of life, is the high level of intelligence the kitchen applies to everything it does from morning through evening. The chef, Eli Kulp, is unmistakably trying to make his mark in New York after making his name in Philadelphia. (He was traveling between the two cities last year when his Amtrak train derailed, leaving him with serious spinal injuries.) At dinner, the time when chefs make their big statements, the menu turned out to be full of small oddities and unexpected ripples of flavor when it was finally unveiled in January. Yet his restaurant doesn’t just put on a show at night and wait for you to be impressed. Mr. Kulp and his business partner, Ellen Yin, understand that coffee and a great pastry can be just as meaningful before noon as an artfully plated duck breast is after dark. Restaurants that aim to be useful and interesting all day long are becoming more common in Los Angeles and other cities; New York could use more of them. The view into the windows from Hudson Street says bakery: You can see bread on shelves, a squarish seeded rye and a round buckwheat loaf with dried cherries inside. Baked by Alex Bois, they have the roughness and flavor of whole grains, the complicated taste of slow-rising dough, and the kind of dark, thick, crackling crust you want to feel between your teeth. In a glass case by the door are a few of Samantha Kincaid’s pastries, fewer as the day goes on. The neighbors are especially fond of carrying off the round doughnuts rolled in spiced sugar and filled with salty cider caramel. Unlike Sadelle’s, which also has a retail bakery up front, High Street on Hudson puts virtually all of its pastries on the daily menus. An ideal breakfast could be made of coffee and the witty red-eye Danish, a flaky golden swirl with warm country ham over a bull’s-eye of bittersweet pastry cream made with espresso. Or it could revolve around a black bialy. This oddball creature, dark with squid ink and strewn with sesame seeds, is soft and chewy, with pickled peppers and a mound of tart, uncreamy whitefish salad pressed into its divot. Cooking at breakfast takes the form of egg sandwiches. My choice of these is the Bodega, an incongruous name for a countrified affair of flattened sage sausage and Cheddar on a biscuit with a mule kick of black pepper. Like the other sandwiches, the Bodega arrives alongside a grilled hot pepper on an irregular block of wood. This is both affected and counterproductive; a boring old plate would do a better job of keeping food off the table. (What’s going to happen to all these fancy boards once they stop being cool and everybody admits what a pain they are?) I am tempted to jump from breakfast straight to dinner out of cowardice. I would rather not have to say that lunch is the weakest meal of the day. The sandwiches are the trouble. The pastrami is a buzz kill, an inert mass of cold pink meat sliced too thickly on too much rye. Another is called the Best Grilled Cheese Ever. It isn’t. (Granted, calling a sandwich the Best Grilled Cheese Ever is like naming your child Jesus Buddha.) If a place is going to go to the trouble of baking those first-rate breads, it should keep a closer eye on the laws of contrast and proportion that mean success or failure in the sandwich universe. Sandwich engineering is a skill of its own, or maybe an instinct. When it gets dark, High Street on Hudson doesn’t entirely pack up the bakery. One of Mr. Kulp’s more clever moves is to integrate dinner into the overall program with a few breads and some of the regionally grown grains they’re made from. Vollkornbrot, a dark German rye riddled with sunflower seeds, is a wonderful thing to eat when it’s buttered and griddled and spread with rutabaga hummus, which could double as vegetarian chicken-liver pâté. Slices of anadama, a venerable New England cornmeal loaf sweetened with molasses, are topped with very rich, very tender, very smoky eel. I was happily surprised that sunflower seeds cooked into a creamy mock risotto could be so appealing. A less pleasant surprise was the portion size, too small to be served as a separate course to our table of four. Apart from the breads, the menu is a longish list under a single category, “To Share.” The kitchen decides what to send out when, and it doesn’t always make the right call. Tempura-style broccoli is at the start of that list and, ideally, at the start of your meal. Impressively crisp, it gets a refreshing assist from pickled wood-ear mushrooms and an exhilarating dribble of spicy chowchow relish. Halfway down the menu you come to the pastas. Do not, for any reason short of an allergy, ignore the bucatini with squid and mussels. Mr. Kulp, who was chef de cuisine at Torrisi Italian Specialties before he moved to Philadelphia, knows what he is doing in the pasta department. The bucatini are flavored with seaweed, a terrific idea, and the plate is finished with lobster bottarga shaved into rose-colored petals, an even more terrific idea. It may be the finest use of lobster coral anybody has come up with. Toward the bottom of the menu are what used to be called main courses. Arctic char is sauced with a very smart remix of a gribiche; the eggs are pickled for extra snap. And while the phrase “soured grains” does not make the heart go pitter-pat, I could work up some affection for the thing it described, a tart, almost refreshing porridge served under fat slices of duck breast with especially flavorful skin. You may expect a place serving soured grains to go salty and savory with its desserts. And you’d be correct. I like them, mostly, but I’d rather have a piece of the spiced kabocha cake, or the cream puff, with its soft spill of Meyer-lemon cream, followed by a cookie offered on a tray by a smiling woman at the door.","At High Street on Hudson, Prime Time Starts Early in the West Village","['high', 'hudson', 'adventurous', 'often', 'exciting', 'trying', 'extremely', 'hard', 'pas', 'ordinary', 'west',

130,Little Pepper,★★,2016-02-23,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/dining/little-pepper-review.html,College Point,"Little Pepper began life a dozen years ago in the competitive Chinese nucleus of downtown Flushing, Queens. Five years ago, Cheng Ying Wu and her husband, Gui Ping Huang, the owners, moved it northwest to College Point, where its nearest rival is a graffiti-scrawled storefront across the street selling takeout chop suey and chow mein. Little Pepper is not entirely free of American Chinese food, but its pork lo mein is not one of its chief attractions. The reason to drive to College Point Boulevard (by far the easiest way to get to Little Pepper, about a 20-minute bus ride from the nearest subway stop) is to eat undiluted Sichuan cooking, like silken tofu with scallions. Little chilled blocks of tofu will be covered with scallions and chopped peanuts turned the color of bricks by chile oil. Woven through the burning heat of the oil will be the unmistakable, medicinal hum of Sichuan peppercorns. The crunch and burn and throb of the sauce crashes against the soft and passive tofu; the contrast enhances both. Or the kitchen may take another slab of silken tofu and do something else. This time it will be warm, in bigger chunks that cleave into two pieces at the touch of a spoon. The dressing will be tangy bits of ground pork in black vinegar and a shimmering gloss of chile oil. The dish, of course, is ma-po tofu. At Little Pepper, it combines power and nuance to make other renditions around the city seem heavy-handed. Some New Yorkers grade Sichuan food by its firepower. When their tongues have been reduced to smoldering ruins, they declare themselves (through sign language) to be in a great restaurant. Little Pepper is capable of inflicting great pain when needed. Its Chong Qing chicken, which weaponizes capsaicin in just about every known form and should not be faced without a full glass of water or beer at hand, is proof of that. But what sets Little Pepper apart from the many other good Sichuan restaurants in the city is its skill at bringing spicy forces into tense alignment with sweet, sour and salty ones. It’s possible that the chefs at Little Pepper cook with extra precision because real estate is cheaper in College Point than in Flushing, allowing the owners to spring for the roomy, shipshape kitchen in the back. This at least is what I tell myself as I’m driving past the exit for Flushing and Little Pepper is still another 15 minutes away. I’ve always found a parking space within sight of the front door, which doesn’t often happen in downtown Flushing. Inside, there is art everywhere: a mural of oversize peonies in red and pink; small canvases of an empty, wrinkled red plastic bag and a still life with Spam; a larger painting of a crushed Coke can over the round table where in quiet moments the employees top and tail a heap of beans for the excellent dry-sautéed string beans. English is not one of the restaurant’s core competencies. In the middle of my last lunch there, a waiter handed the phone to one of my guests. What did he want? It was unclear at first. Eventually an odd relay game began; my guest talked to a customer who was trying to place a takeout order, then looked for each dish on the menu and pointed. Finally the waiter wrote it down. It took about five minutes. When the customer walked in to get his food, it was like seeing a minor celebrity. I don’t recall what he ate, but everything I had is bright in my memory. First, super-crisp scallion pancake wedges dunked in a black, tangy, syrup-thick sauce. Then thin, chewy slices of beef tendon in chile oil, classic and great. Thin-skinned dumplings of juicy, sweet pork followed, resting in a pool of vinegar and chile oil. Sautéed snow pea leaves were next, and too salty. At last a big main course: “lamb with hot and spicy sauce,” also known as cumin lamb because that spice dominated the intensely fragrant dry rub clinging to the tender strips of meat. (There was no sauce to speak of, just stir-fried onions and green chiles.) And a whole fish hidden below fiery ground pork sauce, lip-smacking and deeply flavorful, like a Bolognese by way of Chengdu. The fish at Little Pepper often tastes muddy. The sauces, though, are so transporting that it doesn’t matter very much. And while not every dish on the menu is the best in town — the shredded potatoes with green peppers are pretty bland — the overall energy and variety of the cooking more than makes up for it. With so many peppers whiplashing around, the mouth needs something mild for balance. Tea-smoked duck dripping with warm fat is a fine and soothing appetizer. Cold smashed cucumbers with garlic are turning up in non-Chinese restaurants now, but few improve on the ones at Little Pepper. Corn kernels stir-fried with pine nuts are strangely easy to get along with. Fried rice, cooked with so much finely minced scallion that it turns the color of a Shamrock Shake, is a superb mop for fiery sauces. On some days, I have gone giddy for the eggplant, as soft as pudding and slick with garlic sauce. On others, I’ve been sweetly captivated by the riddle of preserved eggs with green peppers. The riddle is not how the egg whites turn dark brown and transparent, while the yolks go creamily soft and ash-colored; that’s explained by the chemistry of a pH shift. What I can’t figure out is why the eggs’ mild whiff of sulfur is so appealing when they are eaten together with chopped mild green chiles and decidedly unmild red chile oil. But this is nothing compared with the enigma of Little Pepper’s “fried potato in hot sauce.” These are crinkle-cut French fries that, as far as I can tell, come out of a bag stored in the freezer. They are dark and ragged with a dry spice mix of coarsely ground cumin, roasted dried chiles, Sichuan peppercorns, salt and maybe MSG. The questions torture me. How did crinkle-cut fries get into a Sichuan restaurant? How can I be so helplessly, irretrievably crazy about them? Why, when they cool and lose their allure, do I want to ask the waiter to drop them back into the fryer again? Is something wrong with me? What is this wild desire? And where is the hot sauce?

131,Pizza Moto @ John Grace Bakery,★,2016-02-16,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/17/dining/pizza-moto-review.html,Red Hook,"David Sclarow built his first wood-burning pizza oven so he could feed guests at the wedding of two cheesemakers. They were getting married some distance from Brooklyn, where he lived, so he layered the bricks and concrete on top of a flatbed trailer that he could hitch to the back of his Volkswagen Doka. The next time he took his mobile pizza oven for a spin, it collapsed, but by that point, he liked it so much that he rebuilt it. It was the second oven in which he started baking small, irregular, alluringly blistered margheritas at the Brooklyn Flea in 2008. It caved in, too. This time Mr. Sclarow got serious, engineering a steel-hulled model shaped like a Quonset hut. The third Pizza Moto oven was stolen last year, but he still has three others designed along the same lines. Clearly Mr. Sclarow is one of those chefs for whom half the fun is playing with fire, not to mention building the fire and a heatproof structure to contain it. When he was ready to open a stationary pizzeria in Brooklyn, a defunct Papa John’s where pizzas were made in a gas oven would not seem to have held much appeal for him. Then he and his business partner, Anna Viertel, looked at the site, on the grim, shadowy, underpopulated borderland between Carroll Gardens and Red Hook. Behind the back wall was a large white-tiled oven from the late 19th-or early 20th century, sealed up and long forgotten. Would it take more than two years of restoration and modification to make the oven work again? Yes. Would Mr. Sclarow and Ms. Viertel undertake most of the masonry, plumbing, welding and electrical work themselves? Absolutely. Would there be a lot of red tape to cut through before the city would grant permits, and the restaurant would open in October? You bet. A perfect location, in other words. In the new restaurant, given the unwieldy full name Pizza Moto @ John Grace Bakery, Mr. Sclarow has room to stretch out. He has an imaginative bunch of appetizers that aren’t bound by the conventions of pizzerias or even Italian restaurants. Most are pretty good, but there’s more joy in the pizzas, which go well beyond the limited varieties of single-serving pies that sustain the outdoor operation. Those are without a doubt the best brick-oven pizzas a New Yorker can find in a schoolyard or park. But the pies at the new restaurant don’t need any such qualification. Despite minor variability, the pies coming out of the old bakery are already among the top tier of New York brick-oven pizzas. The pizzas have grown to a 14-inch size you can share without scowling, and there are more of them. The clam pie is something like a flat clam chowder: It’s topped with sliced potatoes and profoundly smoky bacon. But what makes it hard to put down is the flavor of clams cooked in cream and white wine that suffuses the whole thing. Another tomato-free pizza is a complex and compelling duet for cheese and fungus. It starts with a restrained application of ricotta, fontina, pecorino and mozzarella, which are covered with juicy, springy roasted mushrooms and feathery shaved raw ones. Tomato sauce underlies the very good pepperoni pizza (it’s actually chorizo, slightly hotter, and tangy) and the “eggs in hell” pizza, which has bacon and mozzarella arrayed around the cyclopean eye of a single sous-vide egg. Chile oil makes the eggs in hell a more engaging bacon-and-eggs than the carbonara pizza, a special whose four cheeses melded into a single, not very interesting white blanket. The crust is in the modern Brooklyn-Neapolitan family exemplified by Franny’s and Roberta’s. Other doughs have a more complex flavor, but the one at Pizza Moto is far from bland. The highest bubbles on the sizable outer rim are starting to go black, and there are patches of char on the base. The crust is sturdy, but not brittle or tough. It crackles upon meeting your teeth, but its white interior is delicate, filled with small air pockets. Crackle is the entire point of the nonconformist pie that’s sprinkled with salt, pepper and rosemary, and shellacked with bacon fat. Essentially a hot-pork-drenched cracker, it makes a superb appetizer if you can get over any narrow-minded hangups about eating two courses of pizza. At any rate, it’s a better opening move than the freebie the kitchen sends out, a fried lasagna noodle coated with powdered cheese, tomatoes and pizza seasonings. It sounds more interesting than it is. But a similar frilly noodle, hand-pulled and boiled, was involved in the guinzaglio, one of the most fascinating and delicious appetizers I ate at Pizza Moto. Tossed in beef shank ragù, seasoned with fermented black beans, shiny with bone marrow, dressed with fried shallots, scallions and warm batons of celery, it managed to taste Chinese and Italian at the same time. Fried broccoli is about as crisp as fried broccoli can get, but it’s supposed to be swiped in yuzu-kosho curd that is too cloying; it needs more spice. I would have liked the Caesar salad with smoked trout more if it hadn’t struck me as a lesser version of the majestic herring Caesar at M. Wells Steakhouse. Toast spread with smoked swordfish whipped into a smooth brandade was lovely, though, perked up with pickled onions and dotted with poppy seeds. The restaurant currently won’t take reservations for parties of fewer than five. This isn’t an unusual policy, but here the result is that smaller groups, even when they arrive early, can end up staring at the two big empty tables and the wall art — lightboxes made from vintage pinball playfields — for a long while. Cocktails, which have stiff spines, can make the clock tick faster; so can the fine domestic beers. The two Italian wines I tried were less focused. One night as I waited to be seated, I was parked at a table in the kitchen, under a collection of high-minded cookbooks. The table has a great view of the oven, and the real estate agent who rented the space was sitting next to me, which is how I heard the story of its discovery. Another night I idled at the bar on a leather stool with legs of bent chrome-plated pipe. I had never seen ones quite like them. Later I’d learn that Mr. Sclarow had cut and welded the pipes from some old school desks he had found, matching their height to the bar of soapstone tiles he had pulled out of a Dumpster. Are there easier ways to open a pizzeria? Sure. Would any of them have resulted in anything resembling Pizza Moto?

132,Llama Inn,★★,2016-02-09,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/10/dining/llama-inn-review.html,Williamsburg,"A wedge of light burns in the night on one of Williamsburg’s less picturesque intersections, just below the dark rumble of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. Down the block is an old-school Brooklyn-Italian dining room serving linguine, veal parm and clams casino. All around, there’s hipster bait: fried chicken, pedigreed pizza, cans of Narragansett, tacos from a truck in a bar’s backyard. Behind the windows on this triangular lot, the Llama Inn is something different. There are skewered beef hearts under a red mash of salsa that rattles with the heat of rocoto peppers. Bites of goat neck, thickly seared and braised until tender, are dark under a glaze that gets its mouthwatering tang from chicha, a beer brewed from Andean corn. Together with a fresh cilantro sauce, it makes the goat so compulsively good that we were all clamoring for the last forkful. Chilly and firm pieces of fluke ceviche, starting to go opaque in the acid of a smoky dashi, are wonderful to eat with soft bits of fried sweet plantain and crisp chips of green plantain. Ripe persimmon flesh and strips of raw sea bream under frizzled yuzu threads sit in an instant marinade. The liquid is pale orange, tart, a little fruity, spicy at the edges and generally delicious. You pick up a spoon reflexively to slurp the sauce, even if you don’t know this is the way Peruvians eat tiradito. What’s been happening inside the Llama Inn since it opened in November is not just different but very welcome. A careful kitchen is interpreting the cuisine of Peru, whose vast catalog of ingredients and wild juxtapositions of influences have not been especially well displayed in New York, beyond a few ceviches and a lot of roast chicken. Llama Inn does both, with excellent raw materials, a free hand and a conviction that all of this should be fun. The restaurant’s logo, a debonair llama dressed in black tie, sets the tone. The heart of the dining room, which is uncluttered and geometric in a loosely midcentury way, is occupied by a bar island. Inside it, bartenders mix drinks that are worth starting with and often sticking with. A kind of sangria made with pisco and kept on tap made me smile three times: when I saw three frozen grapes on a toothpick serving as a garnish, when I tasted the cloves and cinnamon in the red wine, and when I asked for the drink by name: the Llama Del Rey. The cocktail called El Chapo combines tequila and vermouth in case you want to know why they’re not combined more often. But the tall, icy, honey- and ginger-flavored Matador Swizzle has to be the nicest thing that’s happened to amontillado in this part of Brooklyn. It and a good number of other sherries are served by the glass, well chilled. “Our Peruvian clientele likes it that way,” my server said when he caught me warming the glass in my palms to help the flavors uncoil. Past some low-lying booths and banquettes is a long counter behind which the 16 items on the menu are prepared. The chef, Erik Ramirez, worked at Eleven Madison Park before running the kitchen at Raymi in Manhattan. His parents took him on trips from New Jersey, where he grew up, to Lima, where they had. But as an adult, he fell out of touch with Peruvian food. He had been cooking professionally for several years when an employer suggested it was time to pull up his memories of ceviche. Sometimes Mr. Ramirez borrows an ingredient or two from Peru. For his surprisingly good beet and goat cheese salad, he takes a minty herb called muña and tart yellow gooseberries, native to the Andes. The most unusual thing about the fluffy drift of quinoa tossed with avocado, bacon, cashews and caramelized bananas is that Mr. Ramirez has come up with a quinoa salad that isn’t depressing. It’s actually kind of lovable. At other times, he lifts and twists entire recipes. The roast whole chicken, with smoke in its meat and blackened chile rub on its skin, isn’t so much an alteration of the Peruvian standard as an intensification. The bird comes with three sauces, each spicy in a different way. One, the creamy yellow salsa huancaína, is also squiggled over a daunting heap of fried potato wedges that comes with the chicken. I would enjoy meeting regularly with this chicken, but it probably won’t happen until Mr. Ramirez starts selling it in smaller portions. Available only as a whole bird for $40, Llama Inn’s chicken is another symptom of the sickness plaguing restaurant menus under the heading “large format.” Sized and priced for more than one person, large-format dishes attract eyeballs online and in the flesh. They can look cynical, though, when they could be scaled down to smaller, cheaper portions as easily as Llama Inn’s chicken or its take on lomo saltado. This jumble of onions, tomatoes, cilantro, French fries and thick, soy-marinated beef tenderloin slices makes a voluptuously good taco when pinched inside a thin, crisp-edge scallion crepe. But it’s sold in a regal $48 platter that takes two or three people to handle. The simplest dessert is hard to argue with, three hot bracelets of fried dough called picarones soaked in a raw-sugar syrup. My server lobbied for a different one with lucuma and chocolate made from Peruvian beans specifically for the restaurant, but it never arrived after I ordered it. I wouldn’t mention it except that an order went missing every time I ate at Llama Inn. The first night this happened, we were presented with dessert menus and we pointed out that the chicken we had asked for still hadn’t been served. When I later told one of the people who had been with me that it had happened again, he said, “What do they have against their own magnificent chicken?” With any luck, they’ll get their orders straight before summer, when the door at the top of a staircase in the dining room will open to the roof deck. It would be nice to sit there with a chicken, or maybe a half-chicken, and raise a Llama del Rey to the trucks on the expressway.",Llama Inn Lights the Way to Peru by Way of Williamsburg,"['wedge',

133,Benoit,★★,2016-02-02,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/dining/benoit-review.html,Midtown,"Like many New Yorkers, I have convinced myself that a rickety fire escape platform is a terrace and that a segment of the Empire State Building’s antenna seen through a sliver of window constitutes a panoramic skyline view. The same capacity for wishful self-delusion must be what keeps us going to bistros that are nothing like anything in France. The chalkboards in painstaking cursive that misspell half the menu; the sad frites and scrawny mussels and refrigerated cheeses; the old-guard dishes put through modern contortions until they end up looking like Gérard Depardieu wearing Jeggings — we put up with these signs of forgery because we want the real thing so badly. To get it, we need to go to France. But right now, the most perfect substitute bistro in New York is Benoit. It took Alain Ducasse, who owns the century-old original in Paris, a few years to get its Midtown incarnation right. “It’s odd the way Benoit does some dishes so well but misses the bull’s-eye with mainstays that should get the most finicky attention,” Frank Bruni wrote shortly after it opened in 2008, pinning one star on his review in The Times. A year later, in an unstarred update, Julia Moskin found a menu that was coming into focus but still carried an occasional “hint of airline food.” She also wrote that the servers “seem to hope that dinner customers will leave early and stay away forever.” Philippe Bertineau isn’t cooking airline food. He is the restaurant’s third chef. With any luck, Mr. Ducasse won’t need a fourth for a long time. The menu works like a season at the Metropolitan Opera. A core of preposterously old-fashioned classics is rounded out with a few modern compositions to keep everybody on their toes. To understand the point of keeping rafter-rattling war horses in the repertoire, all I had to do was eat Benoit’s quenelles de brochet. These two little footballs of happiness are improbably smooth, almost but not quite fluffy, filled with the freshwater richness of pike. Each one is enveloped in a thick brown gravy of Nantua sauce that is 10 times richer, made from crayfish and lobster. I tasted it, and the whole chorus marched out on the stage at once, the orchestra pounding and the fat lady throwing her head back and letting it rip. A standing ovation would have followed if Benoit’s quenelles hadn’t made me feel a bit like the fat lady myself. Even more inimical to hopes of mobility was Mr. Bertineau’s cassoulet. A gleefully debilitating arsenal of duck confit, duck sausage and cured pork, it is also a magnificent pot of tender baked beans soaked in garlic and fat. Either the meat or the beans could slow your speed. Together they act like an anchor. The calf’s liver, an oblong lobe shaped like Argentina, was seared to a dark gold in the copper sauté pan that escorted it to the table. A step beyond the medium-rare the server had suggested, it was still very good. It had no overcooked livery flavor, just the ripe tang of organ meat that dissolved into very soft Lyonnaise potatoes and onions. To begin, there is darkly concentrated onion soup, choked with melted Gruyère that seems never to run out. Snails in the divots of a heavy glazed dish have a wafer of parsley crust on top that’s almost as fun to eat as a rag of bread dunked in their garlic butter. Obviously, like so much of Benoit’s menu, these appetizers predate the electrocardiogram. It is possible to start with something lighter. Regulars often tick off choices on the hors d’oeuvres list, a separate sheet of paper that comes with a golf pencil: a poached and oil-marinated sardine; crisp sticks of celery root in rémoulade that may need more mustard; ham with flageolets and a handful of other dried beans, each cooked until just tender; the egg mayo, on the menu since opening day. Five of these little dishes served together make an excellent $19 lunch, a kind of Lyonnaise bento box. The greatest bistros in France are magnetic because they are invariable; you know the classics will be made the same way they were 15 or 45 years ago. Benoit is not always this kind of bistro, though this may be a symptom of its distance from Lyon. The pâté en croûte, from an 1892 recipe, can be dry and underseasoned. The filet mignon au poivre can be dullish, although the pepper-cream sauce puts up a strong fight. In compensation, though, Mr. Bertineau cooks almost as well outside the bistro canon as inside it. He shows this with seafood especially. One night, my guests, elbow deep in a wild boar stew, threw me looks of pity: poor guy, stuck with king salmon, butternut squash and black-trumpet mushrooms. I didn’t let on, but I was perfectly content. The fish, roasted gently, was crazily tender and the white-wine sauce so appealing that I spooned way more than I needed from the sauceboat left on the table. (The right French sauce can be a dish in itself.) The baba is not as spectacular at it was at Alain Ducasse New York before that restaurant closed. The cake’s halves can be too sober, depending on whether the server applies the Armagnac as if he’s putting out a house fire or baptizing a baby. But other vintage desserts can restore the faith of any New Yorker who’s been brought down by bland mille-feuilles or watery crème caramels or confused tarte Tatins. The servers on my recent visits showed no impatience with lingerers; they simply went about their business with that straight-spined, matter-of-fact French-waiter style. This is sometimes mistaken for rudeness but is closer to pride and a confidence that everybody, including the customers, knows how to act. It’s strange that it took Mr. Ducasse to give New York its most convincing version of this very un-cheflike style of cooking. That a highly traditional bistro survived while the other, more inventive restaurants with which he hoped to conquer Manhattan did not is peculiar, too — a missed opportunity for the chef and New Yorkers, who love French food even when it doesn’t love them back.",Benoit in Midtown Is the Bistro That Will Take You to Paris,"['like', 'many', 'yorkers', 'convinced', 'rickety', 'fire', 'escape',

134,Achilles Heel,★,2016-01-26,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/27/dining/achilles-heel-resto-review.html,Greenpoint,"In its more peaceful hours, Achilles Heel, a revived waterfront bar with a painted stone facade in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, reminds me of McSorley’s Old Ale House. At both places, you can rub the winter out of your hands near a hot stove (fueled by coal at McSorley’s, firewood at Achilles) whose feet are propped on beat-up floorboards. Neither spot is in any hurry, and time there moves at a pace that is decidedly prehashtag. Their light has a faraway, amber quality you could call cheerful gloom. They are among the most soothing places in the city to cradle a glass while the day shortens and slips into the night. One area where the two diverge is food. John McSorley, who founded his East Village saloon in 1854, liked to eat whole raw onions like apples. Possibly for this reason, the kitchen at McSorley’s has always taken a rough-and-ready approach. At Achilles Heel, the short menu is something else: thoughtful, engaging, subtle and intimate. It’s less saloon cooking than wine-bar food. You can knock back some Muscadet and oysters with, instead of a garden-variety mignonette, a few thick, concentrated drops of a dressing that is intensely lemony but not sour. Or you can chase a mouthful of oloroso with a soft bite of a sheep’s milk cheese called Puits d’Astier, wrapped in a charred leaf of cabbage and griddled. It’s a wonderful way to eat cheese. As at a wine bar in France, there are tartines, which everybody in New York decided one recent day to call “toasts.” Fried bread showed through beneath sheets of sweetly melting lardo, uncannily good and flecked with Sichuan peppercorn. Toast jutted out of a bowl of fleshy, delicious black trumpet mushrooms in their own broth. Excellent, densely seeded bread came alongside fluke with pickled chiles; I’d expected raw fluke, but it had been cured in salt and then restored, like bacalao, into an intensely flavored mash. The chef, Lee Desrosiers, cooks on induction burners in a space that looks just big enough to slice a baguette. In fact, it’s the kitchen of a bar that was not supposed to have one. Andrew Tarlow, who restored Achilles Heel decades after the dockworkers who used to drink there heard the final last call, had the spot retrofitted last summer, in its third year of operation. From his butcher shop, Marlow & Daughters, he plucked Mr. Desrosiers, a meat cutter who had restaurant experience. His menu isn’t especially meaty, but Mr. Desrosiers will use his knives in ways that the longshoreman who used to drink here probably didn’t. Minced pork rib became a meditation on the Thai dish larb, with balls of sticky rice and a sauce of fresh green herbs. Early one night, Mr. Desrosiers put a plate of guinea hen galantine down on the bar. “Here,” he told the bartenders, “I want you guys to try this.” They took exploratory pecks at the thick wheels of pale pink meat broken by white windowpanes of fat, then they set upon the plate like vultures. I did the same when I got mine, swabbing it in a purple blob of chopped pickled radicchio and a circle of liver sauce on which he’d laid a slice of the bird’s heart. Having casually slouched into its role as a restaurant, Achilles Heel won’t be everyone’s idea of a dinner destination. Narrow-minded eaters may have a hard time with the limited, highly changeable menu. As the night goes on, the music becomes enveloping and the room fills with people who don’t have food in their thoughts. If they start to crowd you out, finish your smoked ice cream with grapefruit sections and make your way out as you ask, where has the time gone?  For those of us who had greedily dismantled Koren Grieveson’s robust, emphatic cooking at Avec in Chicago, her move to New York a couple of years ago was promising news. She landed at Claudette, on lower Fifth Avenue, and while some of her Provençal dishes were excellent, she seemed slightly miscast and left after a year. Last summer, she took over as the chef of a nine-year-old restaurant on East 29th Street called Resto. It is nominally Belgian, but its covert theme since its opening in 2007, the year Frank Bruni gave it a two-star review in The Times, has always been the glories of animal flesh and fat. This seems to suit Ms. Grieveson, whose cooking there has some of its old Avec swagger. Lamb ribs, a Resto fixture since the days of its first chef, Ryan Skeen, were deeply compelling in a dark, intense honey glaze with rosemary; lime juice gave them a lift that was unexpected and just right. A vadouvan aioli brought subtle harmonies to another bar snack, pink and juicy meatballs fried in bread crumbs. You don’t often meet up with winter salads as dynamic as the one Ms. Grieveson puts together out of endive and celery root with mint, slivers of dried apricots and long twists of lamb bacon; the orange vinaigrette tasted like the sun coming out after a blizzard. Piled on thick rafts of bread, brandade turned out the way I always hope it will, often in vain, but not this time: fluffy and dense at once, with very tender and silky chunks of salt cod. I was really impressed by the Puy lentils served with crisp-skinned dorade; Ms. Grieveson had wonderfully cooked these earthy legumes with sweet and fruity black garlic. Other seafood dishes could be underwhelming; there wasn’t much flavor in tiny remoulade-dressed shrimp served in a scooped-out November tomato, and hard little nubs of mussels undermined all the effort Ms. Grieveson put into steaming them with harissa, fennel, brussels sprouts and spaghetti squash. Desserts can seem like an afterthought, and one night I skipped them entirely because the other courses had taken forever to emerge from the kitchen. Ingredients that once walked on the land were a safer bet. Beautifully roasted duck and grapes were accented with gin underscored by juniper berries. Beef tongue braised in beer had a satisfying sear on the edges and a little extra crunch from flakes of sesame brittle. Nearly everything, whether cooked in beer or not, gets along nicely with it; the wonderful, often obscure bottles and drafts are Resto’s strongest link with Belgium.",Meat Matters at Achilles Heel in

135,Per Se,★★,2016-01-12,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/13/dining/pete-wells-per-se-review.html,Upper West Side,"The lady had dropped her napkin. More accurately, she had hurled it to the floor in a fit of disillusionment, her small protest against the slow creep of mediocrity and missed cues during a four-hour dinner at Per Se that would cost the four of us close to $3,000. Some time later, a passing server picked up the napkin without pausing to see whose lap it was missing from, neatly embodying the oblivious sleepwalking that had pushed my guest to this point. Such is Per Se’s mystique that I briefly wondered if the failure to bring her a new napkin could have been intentional. The restaurant’s identity, to the extent that it has one distinct from that of its owner and chef, Thomas Keller, is based on fastidiously minding the tiniest details. This is the place, after all, that brought in a ballet dancer to help servers slip around the tables with poise. So I had to consider the chance that the server was just making a thoughtful accommodation to a diner with a napkin allergy. But in three meals this fall and winter, enough other things have gone awry in the kitchen and dining room to make that theory seem unlikely. Enough, also, to make the perception of Per Se as one of the country’s great restaurants, which I shared after visits in the past, appear out of date. Enough to suggest that the four-star rating it received from Sam Sifton in 2011, its most recent review in The New York Times, needs a hard look. With each fresh review, a restaurant has to earn its stars again. In its current form and at its current price, Per Se struggled and failed to do this, ranging from respectably dull at best to disappointingly flat-footed at worst. Dinner or lunch at this grand, hermetic, self-regarding, ungenerous restaurant brings a protracted march of many dishes. In 2004, the year Per Se opened, the price for nine courses was $150 before tax and tip; last week, it went up to $325, with service included. Eli Kaimeh, the chef de cuisine, changes the menu all the time, but he leaves a few pieces of heirloom furniture in place: the salmon tartare and crème fraîche fitted into an ice cream cone the size of a triple-A battery; the “oysters and pearls,” a savory tapioca pudding under caviar and warm oysters; the cinnamon-sugared doughnut holes with a froth-capped cup of cappuccino semifreddo; and when it’s in season, lobster poached in butter. These dishes, all of which Mr. Keller made famous years ago at the French Laundry in Napa Valley, show his rare combination of American playfulness and rigorous finesse. One could argue that it’s a little lame that Mr. Keller is still trotting them out. The name Per Se, after all, was chosen to suggest that New York would not simply reflect California’s glory; this would be a landmark restaurant in and of itself. My quarrel with these greatest hits, though, is that they make Per Se’s new material look random and purposeless. The classics would suffer if you changed one element. With the notable exception of some desserts that Elwyn Boyles, Anna Bolz and their pastry team elegantly wove together, I couldn’t say that about many other recent dishes. The kitchen could improve the bacon-wrapped cylinder of quail simply by not placing it on top of a dismal green pulp of cooked romaine lettuce, crunchy and mushy at once. Draining off the gluey, oily liquid would have helped a mushroom potpie from turning into a swampy mess. I don’t know what could have saved limp, dispiriting yam dumplings, but it definitely wasn’t a lukewarm matsutake mushroom bouillon as murky and appealing as bong water. It’s a bit of a mystery what pickled carrots, peanuts and a date wrapped in a soft crepe were supposed to do for a slab of Dorset cheese from Consider Bardwell Farm, but a good first step would have been allowing the washed-rind cow’s milk cheese to warm up to a buttery softness; served cold, it was rubbery and flavorless. Even canonic dishes could be mangled. One time the sabayon in “oysters and pearls” had broken and separated, so fat pooled above the tapioca. Mr. Keller wrote in “The French Laundry Cookbook” that poaching lobster in butter “cooks it so slowly and gently that the flesh remains exquisitely tender — so tender some people think it’s not completely cooked.” There was little danger of anyone’s making that mistake on two occasions when the lobster was intransigently chewy: gristle of the sea. The first time, it was served with a sugary Meyer lemon marmalade and a grainy chestnut purée that tasted like peanut butter to which something terrible had been done. Subsequently, it was paired with a slick of cold oatmeal. Along this gravel road, there were some smooth stretches. Lubina, the European sea bass, was sheathed in handsome golden scales of potato and bewitchingly sauced with a reduction of red wine and port swirled with butter. Bulging agnolotti filled with butternut squash and mascarpone were fat envelopes of pure pleasure. The flavors and colors of roasted sunchokes, vinegared beets, peeled Concord grapes and puréed pistachios came together in vivid harmony. The type of daring — where did that come from? — thrill that you hope to get at a restaurant like Per Se appears rarely, but it was there in a majestic pile of osetra caviar over deeply savory bonito jelly and cured fluke that had been pressed between sheets of kelp, a flavor-enhancing trick known in Japan as kobu-jime. More familiar, but just as transporting, was the risotto, supersaturated with brown butter and creamy Castelmagno cheese. A server appeared with a wooden box and a shaver, and the plate momentarily disappeared under a rain of white truffles. A few minutes later, even more truffles poured down. Both dishes, though, came at an extra charge: $75 more for the caviar and $175 for the risotto. The supplements at Per Se can cause indignation, among other emotions. When my server asked, “Would you like the foie gras”— $40 more — “or the salad?,” the question had an air of menace. When the salad turned out to be a pale, uncrisp fried eggplant raviolo next to droopy strips of red pepper and carrot, it felt like extortion. Some of those prices came down slightly when the baseline cost went up. With or without supplemental charges, though, Per Se is among the worst food deals in New York. Mr. Keller was a leader in the service-included model of pricing, although he muddies the waters by leaving a line for an optional gratuity on the check. Just what kind of service is included? The people who work in Per Se’s dining room can be warm and gracious. They can also be oddly unaccommodating. When one of my guests didn’t like a sample of a red being offered by the glass, the sommelier decided to argue, defending his choice instead of pouring something new. When I asked to see the truffle being shaved over somebody else’s plate, it was whisked under my eyes for a nanosecond, as if the server were afraid I was going to sneeze. I know what truffles look like; what I wanted was to smell it. Wine glasses sat empty through entire courses. Once, the table was set for dessert so haphazardly that my spoon ended up next to my water glass instead of my plate. Sitting down after a trip to the restroom, one of my guests had his chair pushed back into place with a hard shove. Has the dance teacher been replaced by a rugby coach? Servers sometimes give you the feeling that you work for them, and your job is to feel lucky to receive whatever you get. As you leave, you’re handed a gift bag. It’s small, but still too big for its contents, two chocolate sandwich cookies for each person and an illustrated booklet called “Per Se Purveyors.” No doubt this will make useful reading some sleepless night, but it feels like the swag that’s given out after a free press lunch. Except Per Se isn’t free. It’s possible to pass an entire meal in this no-fun house without a single unpleasant incident apart from the presentation of the check. The gas flames in the glass-walled hearth are a cheerful sight, and the view of Central Park’s tree line past Columbus’s marble head is an unbeatable urban panorama. But are they enough? Is Per Se worth the time and money? In and of itself, no.","At Thomas Keller’s Per Se, Slips and Stumbles","['lady', 'dropped', 'napkin', 'accurately', 'hurled', 'fit', 'disillusionment', 'small', 'protest', 'slow', 'creep',

136,Sadelle’s,★,2016-01-05,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/06/dining/sadelles-review.html,SoHo,"Sadelle’s is one restaurant by day and another, completely different restaurant by night. Dinner is calm, unhurried, basted in candlelight. The relatively short menu is inspired by the luxe comforts of czarist Russia, from delicate little veal pelmeni to tins of sturgeon caviar on ice, served with latkes, lavishly buttered pancakes and rye toast on a three-story platter. Breakfast and lunch, on the other hand, can be chaotic. The menu sprawls all over the place, although at its core it’s not so different from Barney Greengrass’s. It strikes almost everybody as overpriced. Servers can get confused as they jostle between small, overladen tables. Right in the middle of the dining room is a small glass cage where bakers work as if they were go-go dancers in white jackets. Every so often, someone will emerge from the cage with bagels stacked on a pole, shouting, “Hot bagels!” like street vendors in a Lower East Side pavilion at Epcot. Yet the kitschy daytime clamor works, while Sadelle’s stab at evening elegance hasn’t come together yet. Open since September, Sadelle’s is the first restaurant from the Major Food Group that doesn’t feel completely worked out. Jeff Zalaznick, Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone, the men behind the restaurant group, first imagined Sadelle’s as a bakery for Melissa Weller. Ms. Weller began experimenting with bagels when she worked at Per Se and later sold them in a stall at Smorgasburg. Starting with the premise that the New York bagel had metastasized into an overrisen, underbaked balloon of flabby dough with a bellybutton where its hole should be, Ms. Weller scaled back. Her bagels are palm size, rolled by hand, slowly risen for flavor, boiled and well baked to a chewy crackle. All the varieties are worthwhile — there’s even a credible gluten-free bagel, no small feat — but my current favorite is the pumpernickel, made from rye and crushed caraway. Sit at a table for breakfast or lunch and order smoked fish, like the wonderful salmon that shines like the inside of a pink grapefruit, and two copies of your chosen bagel arrive on their own peg stand next to a crock of tangy cream cheese and a tower of garnishes. It’s showy and silly, but it’s great. The daytime menu used to offer a basket of some of Ms. Weller’s finest work, including a slice of chocolate babka, some unusually tender rugelach and one of the best oatmeal cookies in existence. Now the basket is gone, replaced by Ms. Weller’s sticky buns. These are phenomenal, swirls of laminated brioche dough under a brown-sugar glaze, but the baked goods sold at the retail counter up front deserve a whole category on the menu. It’s as if Ms. Weller’s partners don’t quite realize what comes out of her ovens is more distinctive and memorable than what comes out of Deegan McClung’s savory kitchen, and more consistently delicious, too. Everything about the matzo ball soup was likable, from the bits of chicken that tasted like chicken, not wrung-out stock fixings, to the golden broth swirled with dill to the single big, fluffy matzo ball. The tomato soup, though, was so acidic it was almost lacerating. A disc of softly cooked eggs and salami set over brown mustard, with crunchy fried shallots on top, had a terrific savory punch. But the grilled cheese — Muenster, American and Swiss on an everything bagel turned inside-out so the cut sides face the griddle — might have come out of a Betty Crocker children’s cookbook. To me, it tasted like somebody else’s nostalgia. At least it wasn’t somebody else’s order. We waited a long time before anyone asked what we wanted to eat. We waited some more before we were brought food meant for the people sitting next to us. More time passed, followed by another attempt to deliver the wrong food. The disarray increased when the right plates finally showed up and we tried to make room on the tiny table. Despite the disorder and the high prices, I’d come back to daytime Sadelle’s for fish, bagels and eggs. I’m not sold yet on the after-dark version. Sadelle’s makes a valiant effort to transform itself to a refined dinner destination from a busy appetizing restaurant. Liquor bottles replace bagels at the front counter. Fat candles flicker on the walls, and tall dripping tapers sit on the tables. The long marble slab of a communal table in the center of the room is set at night with flowers and cut-glass bowls that glint softly in the light cast by candelabras. It all looks provisional, though, like a loft hastily made over by caterers for a charity benefit. That impression is reinforced if you order the pigs in blankets, whose flaky pastry sheaths leave your fingers shiny with butter. They’re out of place alongside sophisticated appetizers like vadouvan-sprinkled lobster in its shell or tight, icy oysters with pickle mignonette and splinters of horseradish. Butterflied trout with brown butter and shredded pickled beets suggests what Sadelle’s could become if the kitchen really committed to suave Eastern European cuisine. So do the seared salmon steaks with a gently creamy mustard sauce and dill threads. Steak tartare, though, is slightly overthought, mixed with so many alliums that the flavor of the beef recedes. Chicken came with a lake of smoky paprika vinaigrette that turned a mound of kasha salad into a dripping, oily mess. It was hard to be unhappy spooning up dense, sticky clusters of Kaviari’s Kristal sturgeon roe with crème fraîche, chives and light, tender pancakes brushed with melted butter. It was also hard to imagine another occasion when I’d pay $400 for the smallest serving, a 125-gram tin, let alone $1,950 for 500 grams of another variety. Not when bliss comes in simpler forms, like the pull-apart loaf of fantail bread, delivered warm before the appetizers, which reminded me that honey and black pepper are a great combination. Or the supremely moist ginger spice cake with juicy raisins and a slouching landslide of whipped cream. But why are there only three desserts? Whenever you go, the music is a peculiar distraction, an unimaginative collection of old songs by the same few artists, over and over. By day, it’s Barbra Streisand, Neil Diamond, Billy Joel, Paul Simon. By night, more gentiles are invited, and we get Led Zeppelin, the Stones, Eric Clapton, Zeppelin again. This is a minor complaint that wouldn’t register if Sadelle’s were put together by anybody other than Major Food Group. As it is, Sadelle’s is packed with more ideas and more good things to eat than we get from most other restaurants. But, like the average New York bagel, its growth needs to be reined in.",What a Difference Daytime Makes at Sadelle’s in SoHo,"['sadelle’s', 'another', 'completely', 'different', 'calm', 'unhurried',

137,L’Amico,★,2015-12-08,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/dining/sessanta-lamico-review.html,Chelsea,"They prowl the city searching for nourishment and members of their own species. Often, they can be recognized by their feeding grounds. Birds of dignified plumage sit two by two in dim bistros and trattorias of upper Madison Avenue. Great beasts of prey stalk their gazelles at the teeming watering holes of the meatpacking district. Furtive, solitary woodland creatures, camouflaged in forest-floor colors, creep after dark into coffee shops all over the city. Then there are the shiny, slender creatures who stream up and down Manhattan in schools of four or more, usually grouped by sex, eyes darting to see who is swimming nearby. They like to feed on Italian food in crowded hotel restaurants, for reasons naturalists don’t fully understand. This fall, they’ve been fluttering their fins at Sessanta, inside the Sixty SoHo, and at L’Amico, south of Herald Square on the ground floor of the Eventi. So successfully do these two restaurants attract this breed that they may have been built for that purpose alone. For other uses, they are not as reliable. Their cooking can be very rewarding at times, but not quite consistently enough to attract creatures who are mainly interested in food. Servers in both places can suddenly fade away; if you were dating, you’d call it ghosting. These are restaurants for nights when company is the point, and if you manage to order a bottle of wine in less than 15 minutes and a few things on the table happen to be excellent, so much the better. Sessanta is the more stylish of the two. Martin Brudnizki Design Studio’s dining room and lounge have a crisp midcentury-Italian confidence, with space left between the tables for added comfort and better sightlines. The aesthetic is polished and urbane, more negroni than Chianti. Jordan Frosolone, the chef, draws on the cooking of southern Italy, as a server explained one night by means of an unstoppable imaginary tour. (“In the north is Palermo. Going around to the east coast, we come to Catania. …”) Recognizably traditional dishes from that region seem more rare than when Sessanta opened in June, but Mr. Frosolone still brings out ingredients and flavors that you don’t taste at many other Italian restaurants. The struncatura spaghetti, with its intense multigrain flavor and rough surfaces that catch the sauce of anchovies in a fermented-fish paste called neonata, could have come straight out of a Calabrian kitchen. Was the sandwich of caciocavallo and thin slices of tender beef tongue a less gnarly version of Sicily’s spleen sandwich, or its own thing? Either way, it was a meaty thrill, like the roll-ups of scallions and lamb belly run through with a skewer and crisped on a griddle. The phase when you couldn’t eat out in Manhattan without running into an ambitious pork chop seems to be over, but luckily nobody told Mr. Frosolone. He cooks a hulking mahogany beast of a chop, glazed with a sour, salty and sweet Marsala sauce. Then there are dishes with flaws you may not notice if you were, like the three men identically dressed in plaid shirts at the next booth, less interested in eating than in braying about your recent adventures, as if speaking to an audience across Canal Street. Tossed with a ragù of dry, too-firm tuna were rings of anelloni, some chewily undercooked and a few almost completely uncooked at the seams where they had fused. Stringy octopus needed a longer braise, though I liked its bed of farro with dried apricots and the mild bite of fresh turmeric. An excellent hunk of swordfish, for some odd reason, was teamed on the same plate with nondescript strands of braised pork shoulder. And a pre-appetizer shot glass of apple-and-celery-root soup arrived lukewarm on a night when I probably wasn’t spotted, though it was steamy on a night when I almost certainly was. The service changed significantly, too, though I wouldn’t say having a server lean all the way across our long, high booth to refill our glasses each time we took a sip of water qualifies as an improvement. On other nights, I got used to being forgotten, waiting for dishes that seemed to arrive from the kitchen by way of Ho-Ho-Kus, or that never came at all.  L’Amico has two speeds, too. One evening, we waited by the door for almost a half-hour past our reservation time before getting a table. It was another 45 minutes before we had anything to eat; meanwhile, we had to hold the wine list in the air like a semaphore flag. Then, without warning, our cloak of invisibility dropped to the floor. Servers posted by the kitchen watched us as if we were about to steal the silverware. About 30 seconds after we got our main courses, somebody came over to ask, with an admirably straight face, “Now that everybody has had a moment to enjoy their food, I trust that it is cooked to perfection?” I wouldn’t go that far, but the food at L’Amico can be very satisfying. The owner and chef is Laurent Tourondel, once the leader of the fallen BLT empire; together with his chef de cuisine, Amy Eubanks, he works up casual Italian flavors that are not greatly innovative but occasionally glint with originality. Among pine nuts and cubes of roasted winter squash, supple, thin-rolled ravioli were stuffed with more squash, sweet and ultrasmooth. Pork sausage and bitter greens worked their way around loose corkscrews of fusilli, shiny with pork fat. Very tender meatballs of pork and veal were baked with red sauce that I happily swabbed up with a long, skinny paddle of toasted focaccia. Pizza with wilted crinkles of toasted kale over robiola and caramelized onions hid a cool surprise, the distinctive, forthright flavor of caraway seeds. L’Amico’s food can be flaccid and dull, too. Other pizzas at other meals, like the undersalted mushroom pie with truffle paste or the spicy soppressata over tomatoes, tasted flat until they had been squirted with Abruzzese chile oil. The heavy dose of iodine in bay scallops undermined otherwise fine seafood agnolotti. Skirt steak was mushy. Duck breast was overcooked under its limp, wet skin. A Bolognese with hard pebbles of veal lacked the savory intensity brought by a long simmer and patient caramelization. Few seem to mind. Between hanging light fixtures the size of kettle drums and a harlequin-tiled floor, the undraped wood tables have been jammed every time I’ve gone. Once, I sat next to four young women who entertained themselves by reading out loud long strings of text messages and brag-complaining about the impossibility of their “brunch schedules.” They jabbed this and that with forks, then slipped into Uber cars to resume their gliding circuits through New York’s wild kingdom.","At Sessanta in SoHo and L’Amico in Chelsea, Italy Is Merely a

138,Vaucluse,★,2015-12-01,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/02/dining/vaucluse-review.html,Upper East Side,"A critic could run out of new ways to express disappointment in Altamarea Group restaurants if Altamarea didn’t keep coming up with new ways to disappoint. Disappointment requires hope, and there are reasons to hope for great things from the latest Altamarea production, Vaucluse. The company, run by the chef Michael White and the finance-and-operations wizard Ahmass Fakahany, has deep pockets and a loyal talent pool to match. A server escorting one of my guests to the restroom told her, “Michael White is a great chef and a fantastic human being.” Maybe she was a plant, but Mr. White does have a gift for turning Italian food, especially pasta, into a hedonistic tumble between silk sheets. He also has a talent for finding and keeping skilled cooks like Jared Gadbaw, the executive chef at Marea and at Vaucluse since it opened on East 63rd Street in late summer. This is Altamarea’s first French restaurant, another hopeful sign. For the last few years, the group’s new Italian places have been little more than remixes of its old Italian places. Costata was the Altamarea restaurant with extra steak; Ristorante Morini was the one for the northern slopes of the Upper East Side. With Vaucluse, Mr. Gadbaw gets to dig around in a fresh patch of dirt. Vaucluse does not try to give us a view of contemporary French cooking the way Rebelle or Racines NY do. Much of the menu lassos the grayest of old gray mares and drags them out for one last trot around the paddock. Some of the mares are revived by the exercise. Others, like the chocolate mousse that has been repeatedly violated by bits of baked cocoa meringue and buried under chocolate ice cream, seem as if they would rather be left alone to live out their retirements in peace. Depending on how you order, Vaucluse can be superb, quietly competent or oddly off kilter. The chilled roasted leeks are a virtually perfect appetizer, gorgeously soft and stripped of all raw-onion harshness; as counterpoints, the sprinkle of almonds and the whole-grain mustard vinaigrette, not too pungent, are just right. Chicken soup, which we usually save for nights when we need to crawl under the covers, is, at Vaucluse, a reason to get dressed up and go out. Tiny elegant gnocchi bob around in a deeply flavored, lip-smacking velouté; cream is piled on top just in case it’s not rich enough. Tournedos Rossini make a glorious comeback in the form of beefy-red roasted veal tenderloin in a truffled veal jus. The veal sits next to an innocent-looking rectangle that turns out to be sliced black truffles between slices of bread crisped in butter. On top of this voluptuous little sandwich is a lobe of seared foie gras. The pâté of pork and duck inside a soft pastry crust is impeccably traditional. As far as I know, there is no precedent in French tradition for Vaucluse’s épaulettes, double-barreled ravioli with rabbit confit and Swiss chard loaded into one barrel and reblochon in the other. They will set their own precedent, because they are preposterously good. The technical work on all these dishes is impressive, but they come to life because a light bulb went off in somebody’s head. In other regions of the menu, the wattage dims. The magnificently simple combination of red wine sauce and a poached egg known as oeuf en meurette has been complicated so much that it’s no fun anymore. The egg is trapped inside a ring of roasted delicata squash, and the sauce has been reduced to a sticky, sharp and slightly too-salty syrup. The poulet rôti grand-mère is dull enough to make you wonder if Grandmother learned to roast chickens at a hotel school, although it comes with a profoundly appealing ballotine that’s something like a chicken-and-foie-gras meatball wrapped in skin. The potato tart is a jumble of sliced fingerlings, lardons, bits of Camembert and truffles waiting for something to happen. Nothing is going to happen as long as they’re all loafing on a crackerlike crust that you could safely serve to a patient on a no-flavor diet. If all you ask of a pork chop is for it to be round, pink and wet, the one at Vaucluse will meet your requirements. Many dishes land somewhere between inspired and depleted. At the happier end of that spectrum is the duck à l’orange for two, which features a fine if somewhat over-reduced sauce and a phenomenal cap of evenly golden skin. Why two people need to order a sliced duck breast is a question I can’t answer. How the price was pegged at $92 is another; the huge gratin of turnips and broccoli that is part of the deal doesn’t quite get you to $46 a person. The pogo-stick vicissitudes of Vaucluse intensify with the stabs at classic desserts made by Alina Martell in collaboration with Robert Truitt, who oversees pastries at all the Altamarea restaurants. I would have kept sinking my spoon into the dark-chocolate soufflé until it was gone if the other people at the table had let me. It was a pleasure to see the scalloped ring of a Paris-Brest, and it would have been even more of a pleasure to eat if the pastry had been crisper. But look out. The caramelized mille-feuille was deeply uninteresting, the buckwheat crust of the mixed-fruit tart rested on a drift of crème fraîche custard as salty as feta, and one night a crème brûlée had been cooked so hard it curdled. It came with a little dish of berries with mint leaves under powdered sugar, the way Belgian waffles are served at an ambitious bed-and-breakfast. Seeing the meal crumple at the last course was the most disappointing thing of all, because the desserts I ate at Costata and Ristorante Morini were precisely turned adventures. It must be a challenge feeding the trim and carefully dressed people who fill the two handsome, proper dining rooms when so many of the recipes seem to contain the instruction “Fold the butter into the butter.” A dizzying slick of it clung to the egg noodles that came with the boeuf bourguignon and the coq au vin, each very well made and rich enough on its own. Perhaps to make things up to us, we were asked if we would like the trout Grenobloise served with the brown butter — the whole point of the dish — on the side. Vaucluse is comfortable and reassuring enough that it will almost certainly find an audience on the Upper East Side. It’s far from a bad restaurant. It’s just not, as my teachers used to say, using its full potential.","At Vaucluse, Michael White Takes a Step Toward France on the Upper East Side","['critic', 'could', 'run', 'way', 'express',

139,Tempura Matsui,★★,2015-11-17,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/18/dining/tempura-matsui-murray-hill-review.html,Murray Hill,"After looking over the menu at Tempura Matsui, the woman at the end of the counter made an announcement that would turn out to be catastrophic for her dinner plans. “I’m allergic to fried food,” she said. She was in trouble, and not just because she may have been the first person in medical history with an allergy to a cooking technique. Somehow she had wandered into a new restaurant serving no-choice, two-hour-long menus that climax with a volley of vegetables and seafood, swished around in batter and sent to a pan of hot oil for a final swim. The white-oak counter where she was sitting, in fact, is bent like an elbow to give all nine chairs around it a view of that oil. Above the pan stood Masao Matsui, who has been frying tempura at one place or another since 1968. Ootoya, the Japanese-based restaurant group, built this serene cloister on East 39th Street for, and named it after, this man. Dinner at Tempura Matsui with nothing fried? Asking Nathan’s for a plate of seasonal organic vegetables would make more sense. After a brief conference with the staff (“You can’t just do some sushi and sashimi?” her date asked), she was off to eat somewhere else. I stayed to see whether the tempura is special enough to build a $200 menu around it. Following the traditional order of kaiseki meals, dinner this September night got off to a light start: a small glass of dashi with spinach and bits of matsutake mushrooms, just coming into season on that week. When they were gone, I knocked back the dashi. It was cool, clear and very delicious. The server said that what came next was a bowl of tofu. My tongue said it was my destiny, the fulfillment of my earthly desires, or at least all the ones that can conceivably be fulfilled by bean curd. Eating it was like spooning up the densest top layer from the neck of a bottle of pure cream. For a few minutes, everything else went away and we were alone, the tofu and I, floating together in a void somewhere. O.K., that was weird! Three little appetizers, the best being two pieces of anago sushi about the size of Chiclets, snapped me back to the normal world. The sashimi that arrived next may have been a little too normal. The tuna belly was definitely too cold by a couple of degrees, and while the squid was exceptionally sweet and the fluke very firm, the ensemble seemed a bit unimaginative for a kaiseki meal costing this much. Then servers ducked in from the wings and moved the scenery into position for the next act, the tempura. There was a square dish for pink miso salt. Another for white salt scraped from a large solid crystal behind the counter that looks as if it will last 1,000 years. Dipping sauce came in a ceramic bowl, shaped by hand and stamped all over with stars or asterisks. A dish next to it held grated daikon, and a spoon for mixing it into the sauce. Finally, there was a squeezer just big enough for a lemon wedge. Martha Stewart has eaten at Tempura Matsui a few times since it opened in July. I’ll bet she thought about pocketing this lemon squeezer. Then, on yet another dish, was a sheet of crisply folded white paper. It is for blotting up any oil that runs off the tempura’s crust. On this night, there wasn’t going to be any. Mr. Matsui skimmed stray dribbles of batter from the pan, looked up, smiled. A few weeks after Tempura Matsui opened, an undisclosed personal matter had recalled him to Japan. Shin Kato, who was 18 when he began to study the ways of the shimmering oil at Mr. Matsui’s side, took over. Now they share the chef title. On this night, Mr. Matsui happened to be in town and was at his station, looking loose and relaxed, like Dizzy Gillespie waiting to take a solo. Two fried heads of Japanese tiger shrimp were placed on the paper, spidery pink antennas and maxillipeds angling out in all directions. They were extraordinary, like eating potato chips at first, then like tasting a plate of shrimp that had been concentrated down to a single bite. The rest of the beast showed up next, slender bodies and trimmed, edible tails in a see-through veil of batter. Mr. Matsui is a minimalist fryer. His coating was less shell than skin, and he heated it just enough to give it a golden blush. The shrimp were dizzily tender and heavy with their own sweetness. So was the fat Pacific oyster that came along a few minutes later: Warmed but not cooked, it gave up a rush of rich oceanic juices and tasted a bit like cucumber. By the time I tasted the nori-wrapped and fried scallop, still pink at the center, I was convinced that this was one of the most exciting meals I’d had this year. The exhilaration of that night was not as intense on later visits. Even that first time, I wondered about the tempura asparagus. Did Mr. Matsui have a special farmer who grew delicious asparagus in September? He did not. Neither did Mr. Kato, who was serving asparagus when he was back behind the pan again in October. I doubted a tempura chef in Japan would bother frying asparagus when pumpkin was in season. I never warmed up to the crunchy onion half both chefs served, either. And while Mr. Matsui fried a Japanese eggplant to a puddinglike sweetness, Mr. Kato’s eggplant was not as softly thrilling. His seafood choices at my last meal — two species of eel and a flaky Japanese whiting — were very fine but a little monotonous. There were eight kinds of tempura at each of my meals. Apparently, some customers expected more fried food from a tempura specialist, so the restaurant recently increased the number. I never wanted more tempura, though; I wanted more interesting tempura. After a funny little salad to wipe the palate clean — Mr. Matsui’s had seaweed with grapes, while Mr. Kato’s grapes came with pickled mushrooms and vinegared apple pulp — came a dish I could eat once a week, a fritter of cut-up shrimp over excellent short-grain rice. At Tempura Matsui, it is served with pickles and a really terrific miso soup. For dessert, I was very happy about soybean jelly with a dark-brown sugar syrup, less enthralled with the grapefruit-flavored Bavarian cream. Experiencing tempura as a serious craft is a thrill, but Mr. Matsui’s style ensures that almost all the pleasure comes from whatever is being cooked inside that diaphanously thin batter. How many people will pay $200 for fried asparagus in fall when we can eat a kaiseki meal with a greater range of truly special seasonal ingredients at, say, Kyo Ya or Kajitsu? Tempura Matsui’s chefs and owners may be underestimating New Yorkers. Many of us are free of fried-food allergies, and ready for an adventure.","At Tempura Matsui in Murray Hill, the Pleasures Lie Within","['looking', 'tempura', 'matsui', 'woman', 'end', 'counter',

140,Jams,0 star,2015-11-10,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/11/dining/jams-jonathan-waxman-review.html,Midtown,"By the early 1980s, New Yorkers knew that something major was happening in the kitchens of California. They had heard about the revolution, but most of them hadn’t tasted it until Jonathan Waxman opened Jams in 1984. Here was a report from the West Coast front lines brought by a chef fresh from Michael’s in Santa Monica and, before that, Chez Panisse in Berkeley. To put it in terms readers born after 1980 will understand, this was a bit like being the first person in town to have cooked at both Noma and Relae, but bigger. Styles in food didn’t get around as fast in those days. Jams had an open kitchen. Mesquite flared under the grill. Vegetables, in their prime, were barely cooked. Salsa, citrus and cilantro breezed in. Low-fat sauces sat beneath the meat and fish, not smothering them on top. Small portions (critics called them “stingy” and “skimpy”) were ringed by arctic expanses of white china. Mr. Waxman brought a loose, unbuttoned American spirit to nouvelle cuisine, still nouvelle at the time, and the city loved it. Andy Warhol went to the Upper East Side to eat at Jams once or twice a week, Factory apparatchiks in tow. Then came overexpansion and the 1987 stock market crash. As the decade ended, one of its most influential restaurants went down with it. I can’t blame Mr. Waxman for dreaming he would bring Jams back from the grave one day. But after a few meals at the Jams that returned to Manhattan in August, I also can’t help wishing it had stayed there. This zombie Jams, at the corner of 58th Street and Avenue of the Americas, inside the 1 Hotel Central Park, trudges ahead steadily, but it’s stiff in the joints and short on joie de vivre. Some writers have seen the return of Jams as a sign that ’80s cuisine is coming back. But anyone who shows up with a Flock of Seagulls haircut expecting to see customers exclaiming over kiwis and Jay McInerney doing lines of Bolivian marching powder in the men’s room will be disappointed. The first sign that this revival will not set any new paradigms is the design of the dining room, which looks like a reclaimed factory. You’ve been in this room before, downtown or in Williamsburg. White pipes and ducts creep along a soaring ceiling, and the walls are scraped down to the bricks and structural terra cotta. The wood tables are bare, the chairs midcentury in style. There are some flashbacks to the original, like visible flames in the open kitchen, and a handful of items branded as Jams classics on the menu. The Jams chicken, half a bird grilled over wood, is charred on the skin and juicy inside, dressed with a little tarragon butter. It won’t eclipse the roast chicken with a crackling skin that has made Mr. Waxman’s downtown restaurant, Barbuto, a landmark, but it could be the centerpiece of a fine relaxed dinner if you are in the neighborhood. Mr. Waxman does not lay the pieces of bird in a nest of skinny, golden fries the way he did in the ’80s, which is just as well because the Jams fries are soggy with oil and can be limp, too. They arrive with the Jams burger, a juiceless, saltless, flavorless flap of overcooked meat that could have come from the most influential Greek diner of the ’80s. It would have been a complete loss without the help of bacon, cheese and aioli. The Jams pancakes, pink with sweet red peppers, were starting to curl at the edges when they appeared and weren’t quite tender. They weren’t cooked four decades ago, but apparently they weren’t cooked four minutes ago, either. There were three, each topped with a twirl of bagel-shop-grade smoked salmon and just enough caviar to cover my thumbnail in a single layer. Only the summery creamed corn with flecks of red pepper spread out under the pancakes had any real flavor. A restaurant that trips over its signature dishes is as hard to trust as a person who misspells his own name. (Good thing there are only four letters in Jams.) The chicken aside, I tended to have better luck when I treated the Jams name as a warning label and ordered things without it. Toasted fregola sarda under a big heap of plump mussels in a tomato broth warmly spiced with chorizo, for instance. Or the seared gnocchi with lots of corn, a little lobster and some cherry tomatoes. Or the hunk of swordfish, gently cooked so the interior still had a tinge of pink, with a smooth and mild romesco. Desserts can be likably retro, such as the simple and very fresh apple turnover made with puff pastry, or the more complicated charlotte with toasted ladyfingers forming a soft fence around a filling of moist, fruity fig jam. Recently the menu promised a “German chocolate angel food cake”; while it was nowhere near as angelically light as the name implied, it still had its appeal. But the non-branded items can also be tricky. Rigatoni with crab in a spicy sauce was fine up to a point, that point being the rigatoni itself. Some tubes were floppily overcooked, others leathery and half-raw at the ends. The ingredients, which do a lot of the work at Barbuto, sometimes seem unwilling to lend a hand at Jams. The cooked fresh tuna tossed with aioli and piled on a bun (a sandwich sold, misleadingly, as pan bagnat) had almost no presence. A raw fluke appetizer with cubes of flavorless, brown-spotted avocado tasted like nothing except salt. Servers do their best to cope with delays between courses that can stretch up to 20 minutes even when the dining room isn’t full. They seem well trained, delivering smart wine recommendations with confidence. But some of the lines they’ve been given are odd. Mine volunteered the information that the aioli on the burger “is a garlic mayonnaise.” For a minute, it really did seem like 1984 again.",Jams Gets a Reboot in Midtown,"['early', '1980s', 'yorkers',

141,Chomp Chomp,★★,2015-11-03,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/04/dining/chomp-chomp-review.html,West Village,"“Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth, whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul,” Herman Melville wrote, “I account it high time to get to sea as soon as I can.” I feel you, Herman. In my line of work, grimness of the mouth sets in after I’ve eaten too many things that are trying so hard to impress that they lose touch with anything that comes close to pleasure. And each time I see a roomful of people handing hundreds or thousands of dollars over to a chef who stopped caring a long time ago, my mood turns distinctly Novemberish. Whaling jobs being harder to come by than in Melville’s day, my sea voyages usually take the form of a short ride to a cheap restaurant where warm flavors from another part of the world will burn off my interior drizzle. Recently, these rides have ended at Chomp Chomp in Greenwich Village for radish cakes, noodle soups with transporting powers, coconut rice, triangles of golden beef-filled roti wet with curry sauce, and other treats from the food courts of Singapore. These are not the franchise-studded cul-de-sacs that fill American malls with hypertrophied cinnamon buns and microwaved despair. Singaporean food courts, better known as hawker centers, are lined with stalls whose proprietors make a small number of dishes, or just a single one, over and over. The appeal of Chomp Chomp, which the chef and owner, Simpson Wong, named after one of the country’s most magnetic hawker centers, is that you can eat your way from stall to stall without leaving your seat. If Chomp Chomp were an actual hawker center, I’d be an expert on finding the line for carrot cake. No carrots were harmed in making it. Daikon radish cakes, similar to the turnip cakes rolled round on dim sum carts everywhere, are fried with little shrimp, garlic chives and slivered arcs of sweet Chinese sausage. Singaporeans, some of the most food-obsessed people on earth, are extra obsessed with this dish, and for good reason. Warm, fresh oysters the size of quarters are softly cooked into an omelet, seasoned with soy sauce, fish sauce and garlic chives. Oh luak, it’s called. The omelet has been doused with chile-spiced vinegar, and there is a small pile of minced garlic on the side. Simple, unthreatening flavors, but eaten together they make it hard to stay grim about the mouth. Both of these are called snacks on the menu. So are the fried whole prawns breaded with cornflakes and curry leaves (just try it, O.K.?); the salad of cucumbers, mango, shrimp fritters and other things that you stir into a deliciously funky-fishy sambal; and the very good five-spice chicken rolled up with taro inside a tofu skin wrapper. Spider webs of light glow behind the carved wood lattices of Chinese temple doors hanging on Chomp Chomp’s walls. They are new to this dining room, but the schoolroom chairs with metal book racks under their molded seats are carried over from Wong, the same chef’s last restaurant in this space. They are comfortable enough for the first 20 minutes. It doesn’t matter much. Dinner moves quickly. Servers weave in and out from tables to the kitchen, where, behind bamboo shades at half-staff, cooks clack away at smoking woks. Noodles stir-fried with shrimp and soy sauce, called char kway teow, produce far more happiness than you’d expect from something that looks like shrimp lo mein. The appearance of another stir-fry, nyonya chap chye, is deceptive, too. Clear rice noodles jostled together with tofu and mushrooms, the dish has almost no color and a mild flavor, but the more you eat the better it gets. The Hainanese chicken rice is another sleeper; it tastes like much more than slices of soy-lacquered chicken over rice cooked in chicken broth. Many dishes are married to their own dedicated condiments. As melamine plates start to mingle around the table, these spouses can become estranged. Try keeping them together; urge them into counseling if you have to, because Chomp Chomp’s condiments are all different, some spicy, some tart, a little shrimp paste here, a little plum sauce there, and energy everywhere. There’s no separating barbecued stingray steamed in banana leaf from its spicy and wonderfully intense sambal, which is daubed thickly on top of the fish, then sinks into it. (Like many in Singapore, Mr. Wong substitutes skate to good effect, but keeps the traditional name.) How much of Chomp Chomp’s food would attract long lines in Singapore? I’m not sure. For specialists working in hawker centers, mastery becomes second nature through repetition. With around two dozen dishes on the menu, Mr. Wong’s kitchen may not get enough practice to turn out a heart-stopping version of any one of them. Flavors can go slightly out of focus from night to night. Lamb rendang was pasty, dry and a bit muffled at one meal. The next time, it was juicier and so richly curried I could almost believe it was cooked in the “million spices” advertised on the menu. A durian cream puff, which the menu once ominously advised you to try “at your own risk,” is now a special only when Mr. Wong can get fresh durian. The remaining two choices are bananas fried in a mochi-like batter or sweet potatoes and taro bobbing in a warm coconut-tapioca soup. As vegetable soup desserts go, it is excellent. A special one night, a potent glop of sea cucumber, mushroom and pork belly, reminded me happily of the wonderfully lunatic sea-cucumber Bolognese from Wong, where the chef indulged his creative impulses. At Chomp Chomp, the goal is faithful translation, and the potent glop turns out to be a genuine hawker dish. The everything’s-better-in-Queens crowd will no doubt argue that you can eat some of the same things for less at Malaysian restaurants outside Manhattan. Not quite the same things, I’d answer. Much of the menu is strictly Singaporean, and some of its Malaysian dishes have a Singaporean edge. Mr. Wong also picks his ingredients with unusual care. Try the kerabu sotong, a squid salad with a spicy Malaysian dressing. Taste how crisp and juicy the peppers and tomatoes are, how tender and sweet the squid.

142,O Ya,★,2015-10-27,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/dining/o-ya-review.html,Kips Bay,"Tim Cushman, the creative and prolific chef of O Ya in Boston and its new spinoff in Manhattan, does not break the rules of Japanese cuisine. He slices them into tiny pieces, fries them to a crisp and heaps them over raw fish. Bite by bite, he gets away with it. But over the course of the two prolonged tastings that are the only options at the New York branch, one for $185 and the other for $245, the rules eventually catch up with him. Physically, the restaurant is an appealing mix of tradition and a loose American style. Attached to the Park South Hotel on East 28th Street, it has a separate entrance veiled by stands of bamboo and an upright boulder. Inside is a long counter where at least a half-dozen cooks slice fish and mold rice. At least as many people are visible in the partly open kitchen, working away at hot dishes. The front of the room is done in pale wood slats and looks Japanese, while the main seating area is a long row of tables with a red tapestry-upholstered banquette under a brick wall and an exposed metal air duct. Mr. Cushman’s chosen medium is sushi and sashimi, but the pristine simplicity of Tokyo’s edomae sushi is not Mr. Cushman’s style. With rice or without, seafood is scattered, smothered and covered with garnishes and sauces from all over, even Japan. Mr. Cushman really goes for it, and what’s surprising is that he almost never loses control. His one-bite dishes unwind into spools of flavor that you don’t quite see coming, even though a server has already told you what you’re about to eat. Turning Japanese convention around, an O Ya meal starts with sushi, then backs into sashimi. Draped over a bed of rice is a small omelet, neatly folded into a thin, soft envelope. Quietly seasoned with garlic-chive flowers, the egg tastes subtle and delicate at first, then goes very deep from the rich and savory flavor of a Wagyu beef fat that’s been turned into a fluffy white powder that looks like confectioners’ sugar. Fatty, ruby-red ocean trout gets a double-barreled blast of Vietnam from a caramel dashi and a salsa of rau ram, the herb that tastes like a minty super-cilantro. A pungent black olive purée and a raw shiso sauce punch up a buttery slice of pike mackerel. Hamachi may seem too delicate for its fiery crown of banana pepper mousse, but it’s not. Halfway through, when the rice threatens to flatten your appetite, it suddenly goes away. One night, the change was announced with a tiny volcano of golden-eye snapper erupting with crisp strands of wild ginger, sitting in a lake of white soy freshened up with yuzu. This is sashimi that resets the taste buds, preparing the way for more intensity to come. Under a dime-size shaving of Burgundian truffle was a small, very good scallop from Hokkaido, surrounded by a sea urchin-sake sauce so bright and delicious that I’d drink it from a hose, a rubber tub, an old work boot or anything else that was handy. Vietnam was revisited in kanpachi with fried shallots in a lean, light, spicy nuoc cham. With dishes like this, you understand why O Ya is one of Boston’s favorite destinations for a blowout meal. (An à la carte option theoretically allows you to get out for less than you’d spend in New York, although in practice many people have a hard time stopping there.) But the dishes are not all like this. The squid-ink foam and yuzu kosho aioli may get along well with a fried oyster sitting on a drum of rice rolled in nori, but the oyster was so overbattered and overcooked I couldn’t tell. It was like a dragon roll that didn’t work out. Three squares of seared Wagyu over coins of confit potatoes should have been a woozy treat, but weren’t. This intensely marbled beef can be very good either chilled and firm or heated and lush with melting fat. At O Ya, it was always somewhere in between: just warm enough to taste greasy. When it comes to sushi fundamentals, O Ya’s rule-breaking returns to haunt it. The rice, which should be warm and fragrant with vinegar, was usually cold and underseasoned. In some pieces, like the fried oyster, this bland rice was densely packed into a drum inside nori. (Traditionally, this would be done by gently wrapping seaweed around a loose ball of rice, but O Ya seems to roll it into a tight cigar.) Bites that began wonderfully would end with a thud. And there were small imperfections, such as the big white scale stuck to one piece of fish or the stringy sinews in a piece of tuna belly, that would cause a minor scandal at a traditional sushi bar charging these prices. Clunky rice was one reason I cheered silently each time the meal marched into the sashimi movement. Another was monotony. After a while, I’d start to wish the kitchen would let me catch my breath with a course that wasn’t more fish covered with more stuff and a sauce or two. Mr. Cushman can throw a mean changeup when he wants to. I had a great, silly time filling my mouth with a spoonful of frozen foie gras pellets and preserved lemon, and I fell into a minor trance drinking matsutake mushroom broth perked up with a squeeze of limelike sudachi. But these breaks from routine come only with the $245 menu. Both tastings downshift from savory to sweet with a remarkable bite that brings the two themes together, seared foie gras sushi dabbed with eel sauce and a bit of dark chocolate with wine-soaked raisins. Even if you have skipped the $95 or $115 wine pairings, the course arrives with a glass of sweet, sherrylike aged sake that doesn’t just complement it but completes it. Then come desserts and the respite that the meal has needed. In early fall, tapioca pudding with Concord grape sauce, cantaloupe sherbet and shiso ice made an appealingly seasonal refresher. This was followed by a ganache of dark chocolate with lightly smoky green-tea ice cream and shards of honeycomb toffee, a sophisticated way to close out. There is one last treat as you leave: a little sardine tin. Peel back the lid, and you find two colorful fish molded from passion-fruit gummy candy. By the time you taste them, you are back on the street, wondering why the whole meal couldn’t be this much fun.",O Ya Riffs on Sushi and Sashimi in Kips Bay,"['tim', 'cushman', 'creative', 'prolific',

143,Bruno Pizza,0 star,2015-10-20,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/21/dining/restaurant-review-bruno-east-village.html,East Village,"Bruno has a few problems. It’s only been open since July, so maybe it will work them out eventually. I hope so. I don’t want to convict the restaurant’s chefs and owner for these problems because the real killer, as O. J. Simpson would say, is other people. More accurately, it’s a small group of people like me whose approval can lift some restaurants from the teeming primordial swamp of contenders, and whose premature praise and willingness to play down discomfort and inconvenience enable problems like Bruno’s. These enablers have given the unusual, original pizzas and visually arresting appetizers at Bruno more media attention than you may expect for a fledgling East Village pizzeria whose chefs have never run a full restaurant kitchen. In the middle of September, New York magazine’s website ran an article claiming that Bruno’s $18 plate of bread and fermented mozzarella “might just be the city’s most impressive new bread course.” This was a scoop; nobody else had written about the bread. It may well be that nobody else had tasted the bread, either. It wasn’t on the menu then. An infrequent special, it wasn’t on the menu the last time I ate there, about a week ago. Rave reviews of items that have yet to be sold to a paying customer are less rare than you may think. A restaurant that hopes to get a respectable P.R. push out of the gate will often make a few of its more striking dishes available for advance photographs and tastings. As soon as the doors open, waves of impressions from bloggers, Yelpers, Instagrammers and others begin to pound the shoreline. Two critics from Eater were among the earliest customers of David Chang’s Fuku, and their “first reactions” were posted about three hours after the first chicken sandwich was sold. There are reasons, though, for paid critics to give a new place like Bruno time to settle in. Pizza is not as simple as it appears. Getting it right takes time. Bruno’s chefs, Justin Slojkowski and Dave Gulino, mill the flour in the basement from whole New York State wheat berries, and ferment it slowly with a sourdough starter. I don’t know another local pizzeria that goes to these lengths, and you won’t taste a crust like Bruno’s anywhere else. What the raised perimeter lacks in crunch it makes up for in earthy, whole-grain flavor. But the crust has been slightly different each time I’ve tried it. Most recently, it had a uniform fluffiness, a cushiony yet chewy softness, without big air pockets or blisters. When it comes to toppings, Mr. Slojkowski and Mr. Gulino don’t play it safe, either. Their nearest approach to a classic pie is their margherita, with a sauce that incorporates sweet, juicy garlic and some fermented tomatoes. These give it a fizzy tang along with a slight saltiness. It takes some getting used to, but it interacts energetically with the white slicks of dense, rich mozzarella. Other pies verged on baked salads, with varying degrees of success. The most satisfying was the one with shavings of country ham and sliced peaches punctuated by melted blots of soft, grassy cheese made from raw cow’s milk. The most confounding started with a base of ricotta, thin rounds of zucchini and a carrot-top pesto that reminded me distantly of za’atar. A mound of raw, crunchy, long-stemmed greens interwoven with bottarga shavings was heaped on top. I studied this foliage for a way in. I tried biting a slice and munched like a cow, while leaves and stems flapped from my lips. I tried eating the greens with a fork. I couldn’t escape the feeling that I had been served at least two different dishes at once. The appetizers were more perplexing. As a lot, they looked more interesting than they were. Seared scallops got almost no assistance from a bright orange raw-carrot sauce. It didn’t have the sweetness of cooked carrots, which might have underlined the shellfish’s own sweetness. Maybe the chefs just like the color. This seemed to be the case with a salad of pink watermelon with green needles of okra. The flavors stayed stubbornly separate, the okra contributing only its interior sliminess. Inexplicably, the chefs also spurted a gray dribble of soaked basil seeds on the plate. It was a real goo party. Then there was the squid, nested above roasted Hatch chiles inside little cups of charred onion. Nothing blended. The undercooked onions were too crunchy, the peppers too dominant. The squid cups looked cool, though, which seemed to be the whole point of this and other dishes. Bruno is one of many new places where building flavor seems less important than composing an image that can rocket straight to the digital billboards. It’s hard to explain how great something tastes, but easy to show how great it looks, and in the short run, contemporary food media rewards the latter. Uncomfortable restaurant seats have become an accepted signifier of edgy seriousness. Seating at Bruno is divided into a long row of tables with chairs and banquettes, and a counter where you sit on upended whitewashed crates that offer no footrest or back support. After squirming on one of these, I knew why prisoners forced to kneel for hours will confess to anything. “The dishes will come out as they’re ready,” our server on another night had said, which sounded like a good thing: lots of food at once! But what he had meant was that it would trickle out slowly, one plate at a time deposited in the middle of the table. One of my companions wanted only her pasta, sitting out the other dishes. It came out last, after a 15-minute pause, only it wasn’t what she had ordered. There was another long wait for the right dish to show up. I’ve put up with this style of service in other restaurants, but the absurdity of it finally hit me here because this was supposed to be a pizzeria. Mr. Slojkowski and Mr. Gulino first came to attention serving tasting menus by night inside an East Village coffee shop. What the critics who lavish praise on tasting menus, including me, never tell you is that it is one of the easiest ways to run a kitchen. Serving a full restaurant where everybody orders different things at different times is much, much trickier. It takes speed and organizational skills that seemed to elude the chefs at Bruno on this night. No doubt this will come with practice. The chefs may eventually prepare plates that taste as interesting as they look. They might start by eating their own cooking blindfolded. The rest of us, the critics and bloggers and Yelpers, might try the reverse. Maybe it’s time to take off our blindfolds.",Bruno in the East Village,"['bruno', 'problem', 'it’s', 'open', 'since', 'july', 'maybe', 'work', 'eventually', 'hope', 'don’t', 'convict', 'restaurant’s',

144,Momofuku Ko,★★★,2015-10-13,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/14/dining/restaurant-review-momofuku-ko-east-village.html,East Village,"If you lived in New York in 2008, taking in an adequate supply of oxygen and any quantity of food media at all, you knew two things about a new restaurant called Momofuku Ko. One was that its owner, chef and chief iconoclast, David Chang, had imposed a reservations website that frustrated everybody except coders who wrote programs to snatch up some of the 12 seats the instant they went online. (Among the frustrated was my predecessor Frank Bruni, who, in order to write his three-star review, “entered into groveling, Ko-dependent arrangements with tireless friends and readers.”) You also knew that Ko served foie gras in a way the city had never seen. A cook behind the counter would rub a frozen cured brick of it across a Microplane held above a bowl with pine nut brittle, riesling jelly and lobes of lychee, showering them with falling pink flakes of airborne pleasure. Mr. Chang moved Ko to an alleyway off East First Street late last year, and it’s a testament to how much more polished and accomplished the new place is that when the foie gras appears toward the end of the night, it doesn’t dazzle the way it used to. In the company of another 14 or so graceful, beautiful dishes, it is slightly flat-footed, a dancer loping across the stage in Chuck Taylors while the rest of the corps balances on pointe shoes. This is no put-down. There’s no shame in being outclassed by a firm, spiced tartare of Japanese sea bream hanging in a sparkling jelly brewed from the fish’s bones in which capsules of finger lime wait, invisibly, tiny balloons of sourness ready to pop. Or in being cast in the shade by a one-bite mille-feuille whose crisp layers of rye pastry, sprinkled with green tea powder, hold lush yuzukosho béchamel and briny little globes of trout roe. Or in being shown up by barely seared, gently smoked lobster tail with the juicy tenderness of a ripe, warm nectarine. Extraordinary on its own, the tail sits on a whorl of spaghetti squash that becomes uncharacteristically exciting as it drinks up a foamy lobster sauce. At last, we know what spaghetti squash is good for. Leading the gang of cooks responsible for these plates and others is Sean Gray, Ko’s executive chef since 2014. (Mr. Chang, often seen wedged behind the counter in 2008, now presumably lurks in an underground lair somewhere, staring at a wall map with pins marking his dominion in New York, Toronto and Sydney.) Momofuku Ko is remembered as a local pioneer of the tasting-counter format that has spread across the country, but the original ambition was bolder. Mr. Chang was leading a daring experiment that asked: If you aspired to serve food as original and refined as anything in an expensive uptown restaurant but wanted to keep prices down, exactly how many amenities could you strip out? The answer turned out to be, “Not quite that many, Dave,” but the question was the right one at the right time. With the move, that experiment officially ended. The new Ko has amenities galore and a price to match. The high degree of finesse in the $175 tasting menus must be due in part to the greater acreage and better equipment in the kitchen, inside a U-shaped counter that seats up to 18. As they did before the move, Mr. Gray and his colleagues take turns delivering dishes. The original crew on First Avenue rarely made eye contact and often appeared mildly resentful, an understandable reaction in those sweatshop conditions. Now, Mr. Gray and his collaborators look relaxed. Sometimes they even smile. They’re not the only ones whose accommodations have been upgraded. We diners can settle our tense, crooked frames into the pliant leather seats and backs of the tall stools arranged around the counter, enjoying space around and behind us. This may not sound like cause to celebrate unless you remember the old Ko, where every time somebody squeezed behind you on the way to the restroom, you had to lean forward and hold your breath. Should you arrive early to this palace of luxury, you can pause at the small and very appealing bar, where the cocktails are highly intelligent without rubbing your nose in it. After the desserts (if you are in luck, one will be a bittersweet cookie-like tart shell filled with Fernet Branca pastry cream and dark chocolate mousse), you can ask for a cup of hearty and well-rounded barley tea, a remarkable concession from Mr. Chang, who in the past seemed to regard tea as a sign of weakness. During the meal, there is wine, in uncannily delicate glasses, from some of the world’s most revered grape stompers. Jordan Salcito, beverage director for the Momofuku group, gives these winemakers’ names and faces prominent play on her 78-page list. She also tries to show stylistic resemblances by noting when one producer has influenced another. This is a more useful, up-to-date way to choose a bottle than the ancient system of memorizing vintages and appellations. It comes at the cost, though, of emphasizing cult stars over new finds whose bottles are often bargains; there could be more choices for under $75. Versatile wines do best with the quick shifts of flavor in the seafood-heavy menu. You don’t want anything to fight with the intense flavor of cured, citrus-glazed mackerel sushi under scallions and grated fresh ginger strands. The skin is quickly blistered with the same blowtorch used to gently toast the bottom of the rice, bringing a wonderfully un-sushi-like crunch to one of the restaurant’s most delicious creations. Dud dishes are rare. There must be better places for exceptionally soft Osetra caviar than in a tomato-and-basil salad, for instance. (There are, and on another night the roe was spooned over an amazing, near-liquid potato purée.) Soy milk chawanmushi and a dark blotch of intentionally burned applesauce would have been puzzling with sea urchin even if the urchin hadn’t tasted metallic and iodine-heavy. This was more surprising because I’d been served exceptional sea urchin on other nights, laid alongside a swoosh of chickpea purée that incorporates fermented chickpea paste. If I told you fermented chickpea paste tastes a little like cheese, you might not want to try it, but you should. Eaten together with the urchin, two soft and orange blobs finding each other inside your mouth, it’s like a door cracking open to a new world of flavor. A few failures don’t necessarily derail a meal that aims this high. But you might, if you were feeling philosophical, point out that the menu’s sensibility could be more unified. Mr. Chang once called tasting menus “chefs’ novels, their big ideas, their statements of purpose and intent.” The menus at the new Ko are more like collections of short stories, not all by the same author. Quills of trofie dressed with Tasso ham, poblano peppers and Mimolette cheese make an odd traveling companion for the mackerel sushi. Elysian Farms lamb with green tomatoes and Calabrian chiles might turn up in any number of restaurants, and so could the excellent sourdough bread. Nobody would say that about the daring chickpea and sea urchin duet. The unifying theme of the original Ko was: “Forget your ideas of fancy dining. Here’s something new.” It was built by and for young, hungry, probably insomniac rebels who chased their craziest ideas. The new Ko was built by a mature chef for customers who have grown up, and it reflects all the comforts and resources and security and extra padding we accumulate in the middle of our lives. Those things can hem us in, putting the 4 a.m. howlings of youth out of reach, or at least making them seem counterproductive. If the new Ko has a message, it is: “Yep. This is what fancy dining is like now.” But those youthful howlings are still in its bones.",Momofuku Ko in the East Village,"['lived', 'taking', 'adequate', 'supply', 'oxygen', 'quantity', 'medium',

145,Wildair,★★,2015-10-06,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/07/dining/restaurant-review-wildair-on-the-lower-east-side.html,Lower East Side,"When serious, reputation-making restaurants run out of room on the walls to hang all the awards, chefs open a cheaper, more casual restaurant nearby. Like a dutiful younger brother, the second restaurant is supposed to work harder, please more people, make fewer demands, be more pragmatic and smile as the firstborn sucks up all the attention. There is rarely any confusion about these roles. Bouchon Bakery & Café doesn’t try to waylay customers toddling toward Per Se’s blue door and tempt them into having a quiche and salad instead. Sometimes, though, younger siblings who follow the rules can still pull off some quiet subversion. This summer, the chefs Jeremiah Stone and Fabian von Hauske opened a wine bar two doors down Orchard Street from their showcase restaurant, Contra. The new place, called Wildair, plays its part exactly as written. And somehow, in a subtle and charming way, the kid upstages his big brother. Contra does laid-back refinement as well as any downtown restaurant, and the two chefs pack an impressive amount of nuance into its six- or seven-course set menus. Wildair is the one I want to go back to, though. I want to camp out at a high table, taste everything new on the menu to see whether it clicks and pillage the stash of natural wines like Genghis Khan. Format matters. Contra’s is a concise tasting menu, and tasting menus are the parchment scrolls on which chefs inscribe their Magna Cartas with goose-quill flourishes. Wildair borrows its format from contemporary European wine bars such as Manfreds & Vin in Copenhagen and Le Dauphin in Paris, places that extend a hand inviting us to try something new, drink a strange gamay bottled by an ornery old hermit, eat a little of this and a little more of that while we catch up, unwind and make plans. You visit Contra. Wildair is a restaurant you can live in. The food isn’t necessarily better, but it’s often more inventive. You wouldn’t guess that from scanning the menu, reading down from oysters and cheese to fried squid and steak. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske are serving familiar, likable food. But instead of tying them down, this seems to have given them permission to lift off with extra altitude. The squid is fried along with sliced lemons and sections of green onion. Everything is contained in a golden shell that is implausibly light and crunchy, with no hint of sogginess. Potato flour mixed with masa is the secret of the batter. A garlic-powered squid-ink aioli gives the dish some staying power. The secret of Wildair’s white shrimp with celery is probably the shrimp themselves, netted off the coast of Georgia. But the kitchen augments their unmistakably wild flavor by patiently stewing them in garlic-pimentón oil, heads and all. On my first two outings at Wildair, I passed up the pork rillettes, suspecting that they were outsourced. They are not. They are beautifully made on site, smooth and pinkish and creamy in a glass bowl sealed with a white blanket of fat. I spread the rillettes on thin toast and took a bite, letting the fat and its warm, holiday flavor of ginger and other seasonings melt on my tongue. I almost skipped the lettuce, too, suspecting that it was lettuce. I was right about that but wrong about skipping it. With squiggles of butter-and-caramelized-lettuce dressing insinuated into its folds and some chopped pistachios on top, the sweet Little Gem lettuce makes for one of those ideal salads that is as complicated as it needs to be and no more. The dream date for that lettuce would be the dry-aged Wagyu steak, slick with melted beef fat and so tender it doesn’t seem entirely real. It might have made me dizzy if I hadn’t already been reeling over the price, $70 for roughly 25 ounces of meat, sliced from the bone, that two companions and I ate while luxuriating in the oak-and-steel embrace of Wildair’s stools. (The discomfort is more acute at the narrow counters on either side of the dining room.) For the average mortal’s budget, the beef tartare is a more accessible lettuce partner. Chopped into bits that are big enough to chew, the meat is crunchy with toasted buckwheat, hot with fresh horseradish, and sharp with gratings of tangy smoked Cheddar. Though the two chefs seem liberated by cooking for a simple wine bar, this freedom sometimes leads them off the path. Wet blobs of below-par sea urchin had no business glopping up an excellent potato cake I ate in the early summer. The texture of whole clams and flabby cubes of lardo over griddled bread with spinach wasn’t as appealing as the flavor. The kitchen may also want to cut the squid and green onions into smaller pieces; you want to eat them with your fingers, but they’re so big you almost need a knife and fork. Mr. von Hauske is the baker of the two. The dense white sourdough with the fantastically crisp crust that he makes at Contra is sold at Wildair, too, this time with a dish of salted olive oil that catches nicely in your throat. For dessert, he has come up with a very likable panna cotta; the sweetness comes from soft shavings of watermelon granite and a crumble of caramelized milk. There’s also a chocolate-peanut butter tart that tastes exactly the way I’ve always wished a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup tasted. One sign of how well Wildair works is that nearly everybody I know who has dropped in has a story about discovering a new wine. The central character in most of these stories is Jorge Riera, the wine director here and at Contra and a soft-spoken but ardent advocate for winemakers who believe in letting nature have its way. I owe him for introducing me to a biodynamic fino sherry from Andalusia and an elegantly honeysuckle-scented grenache blanc from Catalonia, among others. Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske named their wine bar for a prizewinning racehorse that lived in the neighborhood before the Civil War. Mr. von Hauske believes it should be pronounced “willed air,” but almost everybody calls the place “wild air.” Maybe everybody is wrong, or maybe this is just a case of a younger sibling claiming its own identity.",Wildair on the Lower East Side,"['serious', 'reputationmaking', 'run', 'wall', 'hang', 'award', 'chef', 'open', 'cheaper', 'casual', 'nearby', 'like', 'dutiful', 'younger', 'brother',

146,Houseman,★★,2015-09-29,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/30/dining/restaurant-review-houseman-in-hudson-square.html,Hudson Square,"Houseman is a new restaurant where you can get, among other good things, an excellent roast chicken. “Big whoop,” you say. “I can get excellent roast chicken at a place in my neighborhood.” Well, no, you probably can’t, unless you live across the street from Barbuto. But let’s not argue. Let’s talk about Houseman. It’s on Greenwich Street in Hudson Square, on a block that the rest of the city forgot about after the Holland Tunnel was built and then suddenly remembered a few years ago. Across the street is a glass-and-steel apartment house by the architect Winka Dubbeldam. It looks like a venetian blind that got tangled up with the building next door. If I lived there, I would have been happy in July when the lights came on inside Houseman, illuminating the white brick walls and pale wood tables and chairs. By now, I’d know the hosts who stand in the doorway or on the sidewalk. And one of my daily routines would be checking out the changes on the menu, which is laid out like a newspaper’s front page. Print lives! The date runs at the top to the left of the restaurant’s name. A weather report is on the right. (“Gray. Cooler!”) In the middle is a cryptic drawing; one night it looked like a pumpkin with some dangerous ideas. All around the page are boxes. One suggests an inexpensive wine, and another proposes a cocktail made with ingredients you’ve heard of. The rest are occupied by things that I am always very interested in eating. Since the chicken is the above-the-fold story, let’s start there. In fact, it is half a bird, with parsley salad scattered on top and a thick slab of grilled bread spread with roasted garlic on the side. But in every other way, it is a classic Sunday night roast chicken. In restaurants, I manage to get a chicken like this roughly once out of every 50 attempts. At home, my average is closer to one in 12. I tasted Houseman’s on three nights, and it was equally irresistible every time, juicy in every flap and joint. Ned Baldwin, who owns the restaurant and, with Adam Baumgart, runs the kitchen, said they weigh each bird before calculating how much salt to rub into its skin. However they do it, this is a roast chicken that you want to settle down with and take apart piece by piece. Most of the food at Houseman is like that. You don’t taste it in politely appreciative nibbles. You throw yourself at it until there’s nothing left. No menu layout can convey this quality, but when you find a restaurant that has it, you come back. The kitchen grinds sausages and grinds them well. One night, they were made from goat. If the words goat sausage conjure up a dry and wrinkled meat pouch, these were the opposite: pink, broad, juicy and gently spiced, offered up as a main course with a jammy tomato sauce and a bracing salad of dandelion leaves. Another night brought sweet pork sausages grilled then simmered, Portuguese style, with steamed clams, and very good. Houseman had an ideal late-summer dinner in its swordfish salad, a salade niçoise by other means. Hunks of fish, poached and then packed in olive oil and sitting on a mat of tuna mayonnaise, were surrounded by little potatoes, string and shell beans, and some cherry tomatoes roasted so they collapsed on your tongue. The menu is top-heavy with appetizers. Like that swordfish main course, they lean on seasonal produce given a Mediterranean cast. Roasted peaches were yielding and honey-sweet alongside chopped hazelnuts, crumbs of feta and crinkles of grilled pancetta. Drippingly ripe tomatoes, real September beauties, were submitted to a fantastic Middle Eastern treatment of sesame seeds, cumin and parsley, underscored by the tingling sourness of sumac. A long, skinny eggplant, its grilled skin stripped off to expose its pale flesh, was dressed with bright-green basil oil and sat on a swirl of uncannily smooth and lemony tahini. Can tahini be luxurious? This was. Even the snacks, often pandering little throwaways, are worthwhile at Houseman. Salted fried favas, as brown and crunchy as a nut, are a cocktail-hour treat with a Pat Flynn (a rum and Coke you can drink without losing your self-respect). A soft-cooked egg, split and topped with capers, anchovies and fried leek threads, is a fine idea, too. Houseman’s dining room, which has an upright, right-angled, vaguely New England look, provides enough traditional comforts that the scarcity of main courses on the menu seems out of character. Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Baumgart may offer so many more appetizers because they expect a lot of customers to make a meal of them. But when there are typically just four or five main courses, and one of these is a burger, the margin of error is small. Sometimes, Houseman falls outside it. That burger — two flat patties under melted cheese and a mushroom-onion topping — deserves a better bun than the flavorless and somewhat dry one it gets, especially at $17. (Crisp but preposterously salty fries cost an extra $2.) When a fillet of striped bass poached in court bouillon with clam juice is sold at $85 for two people, it shouldn’t be as overcooked as mine was. The dessert menu, which comes to the table written on an abacus chalkboard, runs into the same trouble. One of just three slots was thrown away on a scoop of lackluster blackberry sorbet in a nest of broken-up celery sorbet. The celery was more intense than the blackberry, which did not make it a better dessert. It’s lucky the other two choices were so good: a peanut tart that’s like pecan pie without all the goo, and a sundae of wonderful malt ice cream with cherries in syrup. Houseman is still a young restaurant, with room to grow. A better hamburger bun should not be hard to come by. Already it gives you something that a lot of places never do: a sense that almost everything was cooked for a reason. Until recently, Mr. Baldwin was the chef de cuisine at Prune, which gives you the same sense. Prune’s owner, Gabrielle Hamilton, was underrated as a chef for years because, I think, she never seems to invent anything in the kitchen. She isn’t big on shotgun marriages of ingredients. But she understands the pleasure, part animal and part something else, that we take from food that is direct and honest. Many chefs have ideas about how to cook. The really good ones have ideas about how to eat. Ms. Hamilton does, and so do the two chefs at Houseman.",Houseman in Hudson Square,"['houseman', 'among', 'good', 'thing', 'excellent', 'roast', 'chicken', '“big', 'whoop”', '“i', 'excellent',

147,Gabriel Kreuther,★★★,2015-09-22,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/23/dining/restaurant-review-gabriel-kreuther-in-midtown.html,Midtown,"When the chef Gabriel Kreuther left the Modern in 2014, he seems to have packed up virtually everything except Picasso’s goat in the sculpture garden. He named the place he opened in June, across 42nd Street from Bryant Park, after himself, but it could just as easily be called the Modern in Exile. He took along the Modern’s pastry chef, Marc Aumont, a virtuoso of desserts and breads who worked at his side for the restaurant’s first nine years. He replicated its two-in-one structure, too. In the bar, where gooseneck streetlamps crane out over low tables, he has an approachable menu, some of it Alsatian, like rustic tartes flambées and the greatest liverwurst in the five boroughs. Things get far more elaborate once you enter the dining room, behind a ring of rough timber beams pulled from a Vermont barn. In that space, Mr. Kreuther imported the four-course $98 prix fixe format that was in place when I gave the Modern’s dining room operation three stars in 2013. He has reproduced much of his last restaurant’s tone, too, with formal but cheerful servers raising bell-shaped glass lids from main courses in synchrony and quickly running a silver sweeper over every crumb that falls on the white tablecloths. Mr. Kreuther did not make off with the Modern’s wine cellar, but he charged Emilie Perrier with building a new one that is only slightly less impressive. There are treats from all over, but the excellent bottles from Alsace are a special pleasure. And of course, Mr. Kreuther brought his recipes. Here is the palm-size tart of smoked sturgeon and sauerkraut under a dandelion-colored mousseline with a gleaming black eye of caviar. There is the cushion of foie gras between two firm pieces of squab breast, trickling with red juices, all bundled up inside savoy cabbage and a papery shell of brik pastry. Both are as marvelous as I remembered. Like much of the cooking at this new restaurant, these dishes make an irresistible case for the power of classical European techniques, all the blade-flicking and stock-skimming tricks that Mr. Kreuther swings around so easily. A native of Alsace, his skills forged by the martial discipline of French, German and Swiss restaurants, Mr. Kreuther makes no effort to hide his old-school training. Rising up from a pool of cantaloupe sauce (an idea as cool as the chilled sauce itself) was a foie gras terrine. Any foie gras from Mr. Kreuther’s kitchen is pretty much guaranteed to be wonderful; this one was molded into a dome studded all over with purplish cubes of duck prosciutto, each no bigger than a pinhead. A smaller brunoise may be technically possible, but it would require lasers. Fried frog meat in the lightest sheath of batter was bunched up at the end of a leg bone pared as clean as a toothpick; you dunk these drumsticks in a lemony garlic bouillon so bright and focused that you can almost see the worried face of the cook who watched the pot. Two things about this fine-grained precision. First, it is about as fashionable as acid-washed jeans. Younger chefs are scattering ashes over whole leaves, splashing buttermilk in a bowl and calling it a sauce, and trying to hide signs of human manipulation. Mr. Kreuther’s dishes look as unmistakably man-made as a skyscraper, and his sauces were obviously produced in a stockpot, not an udder. Second, Mr. Kreuther uses technique with purpose. The point of cutting duck ham into microcubes is that you taste some with every bite of foie gras smashed on toasted brioche. So before dismissing this grand Midtown dining room as a horse-drawn carriage in the age of Uber, sit down and see how exciting a little knifework can be. Notionally, dinner is made up of four courses. In reality, new things stream out of the kitchen in an endless slot-machine cascade. Before the first course, three miniature dishes arrive at once. Each is a distinct event. The last time I camped out at a table, I wanted to pocket my guests’ cracker-and-sweet-potato sandwiches. A new bread from Mr. Aumont’s oven shows up every few minutes, each with its own spread. The parade starts with a warm, savory kugelhopf, still in its ceramic mold, with chive fromage blanc. It is so good that one of my guests nibbled on it while telling our server that she didn’t eat gluten. A few minutes later, she was given a plate of the best gluten-free bread I’ve ever met. I don’t think Mr. Aumont can make a dessert I wouldn’t like. He is always toying around with forms and shapes; the high point, so to speak, of his great chocolate-and-cherry dessert is a towering dark-chocolate cone that melts while you watch. But his games never interfere with the flavors, which stay clear and direct. Pineapple carpaccio is hidden under a tuile and a spoonful of herb sorbet (lime leaf, Thai basil), but you’re never in doubt that the fruit is carrying the melody. The savory courses don’t always have the same focus. Mr. Kreuther has a lot to say, but at times you wish he wouldn’t say it all at once. A sweet, charred whole tomato was overcome by its seasonings, especially garlic and black pepper, and by the cup of dark gazpacho that tasted like an unspicy virgin Mary and didn’t add any clarity. Far more distracting, though, is the crazily gaudy collection of tableware. Gabriel Kreuther would be a more elegant restaurant if the simple, well-designed service pieces from the Modern had come along for the trip. Servers place a different set of elongated forks and spoons on a black blotter before every course, and at moments balancing food on the end of one of these feels like a game from a small child’s birthday party. Some courses arrive on crystal dishes with a spike on the bottom; you’re told you can hold it by the spike or nest it into a kind of crystal inkwell, but what you can’t do is eat the food without thinking about the thing it’s sitting on. This pointless eccentricity goes on and on. Tableware salesmen must have scratched a symbol on the door that means “easy mark,” like a hobo sign. At first the interior, designed by Glen Coben, also struck me as too frantic. Mr. Coben juxtaposes those barn pillars with copper panels, glazed tiles and wallcoverings boldly printed with storks and flowers. It’s a little loony, but somehow all these elements together bring warmth and energy to a room that has at its core a deeply comfortable and rewarding white-tablecloth restaurant.",Gabriel Kreuther in

148,Casa Mono,★★★,2015-09-15,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/16/dining/restaurant-review-casa-mono-gramercy.html,Gramercy Park,"Casa Mono has a lot to answer for. Founded by Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich in 2003, it was among the earliest and most influential restaurants to twist the Spanish tapas idiom into what New Yorkers learned to call small-plates dining. The Casa Mono style has spread far and wide, leaving in its wake a trail of cluttered tables, unpredictably sequenced dishes, and diners reduced to asking pathetically, “Will that be enough food?” All of this might earn Casa Mono the historical notoriety bestowed on early tremors of annoying or inconvenient trends, like the first spam email, if it weren’t the case that almost everyone agrees that Casa Mono has always been very good. To that I’ll add a contention of my own. The pleasures of eating there are both richer and more varied than in 2004, when this tiny, perpetually crowded restaurant was last reviewed in The New York Times. (Marian Burros gave it two stars.) Andy Nusser, the executive chef and an owner, kept the tapas fairly uncomplicated in the early days. Roasted piquillo peppers filled with juicy braised oxtail were on the menu then, are there now, and probably will be forever. The seared skirt steak, served with sweet stewed onions and a romesco that crunches with coarsely chopped almonds, is still one of the most elementally satisfying one-course meals near Union Square. It’s even better if you eat it alone at the bar, which may be your only option on those nights when reservations are impossible. But over the years, the kitchen has branched out into cooking that a Catalan tapas-bar proprietor might squint at before deciding that tapas do not always need to be interpreted with a strict-constructionist approach. In this era of sea urchin overload, there is still a wild thrill to be had from the sweet and briny orange lobes at Casa Mono, stirred with chopped walnuts and lime zest into very soft scrambled eggs that have been splashed with colatura. The menu calls this condiment “ancient anchovy oil.” How ancient I have no idea, but from the looks of happy disbelief around the table, I’d say just ancient enough. Or take the section of the menu called “Whole Organic Animals.” You may ask how a small plate can hold a whole animal larger than a quail. What the menu is trying to say is that Casa Mono buys entire beasts that once browsed on Hudson Valley pastures, then carves them up and serves them in portions that in Spain would be called raciones. Casa Mono’s drive into meatier terrain is largely the doing of Anthony Sasso, named chef de cuisine in 2008 when Mr. Nusser shifted most of his attention to other Batali restaurants. Mr. Sasso learned to swing a cleaver at Fleisher’s, the nose-to-tail butcher shop in Kingston, N.Y. This is one butcher-chef who does not try to hand you a dripping bouquet of snouts and spleens. Most of his “whole animal” dishes are ones that even cautious carnivores may try. And try they should, because the reward will be flavors whose depth and complexity are still too rare in American meat. Streaky lamb belly, rolled around tomatoes and raisins, had an extremely alluring balance of chewy lean and tender fat; the quality of the meat made the splash of mint salsa verde seem like a new idea. Lamb leg, with its more untamed flavor, was braised in cider and cinnamon, then folded into a sweet and nutty mole, with a memorable trace of bittersweetness that came from dark Spanish chocolate. A slab of goat confit, patiently simmered in olive oil, had a clear, clean flavor. Goat responds well to extra richness, which it got from guacamole strengthened by goat cheese, and from half an avocado cured in sugar. Bricks of meaty and very tender pork belly came with fried plantains, thin slices of honey-cured ham, pickles, garlic and a honey-banana mustard whose sweetness didn’t go over the top. As loaded with surprises as it was with flavor, this was Mr. Sasso’s tribute to the Cuban sandwich. Seafood is a major theme on the menu, too, and usually a rewarding one. Four razor clams cooked on a plancha and sloshed with olive oil would have been great if one of the four hadn’t been nearly raw. But baby octopus from the same plancha were tender inside and lightly crunchy along their suckers; they were served with shaved fennel and lumps of pink grapefruit, as they have been since Mr. Nusser dreamed up the dish a decade ago. The crema catalana hasn’t changed, either. Burned sugar still tops the custard like thin black ice. It still comes with bay leaf fritters. You still eat these by pinching the stem, biting down and stripping the sweetly scented dough away from the leaf with your teeth. Other desserts have added layers of polyphony. The most rambunctious of all involves bite-size churros, their crisp ridges pressed into chocolate ganache. A scoop of crème fraîche ice cream is painted maroon by a sauce based on Spain’s demented and inspired spritzer, red wine and Coca-Cola, fortified with cherries. It’s a perfectly controlled dessert that seems to be on the verge of total, wanton collapse. Mr. Batali’s other restaurants treat the Hudson Valley as if it were a lost region of Italy. Casa Mono does something similar, using the Greenmarket down the block as if it were the Mercat de la Boqueria in Barcelona, Spain. A softball-size heirloom tomato is dotted with popcorn-flavored aioli; pickled hot peppers are tossed over a voluptuous blob of burrata that sprawls across anchovy toast. The wines, of course, make a longer trip. In a miracle of space management, this micro-restaurant keeps what has to be the deepest, most pleasure-packed trove of Spanish wine in the city. The sherries alone, many bottled by the young, treasure-hunting Equipo Navazos firm, could see you through a solid month of meals. Titans like Pingus and Palacios are available for those who can pay for them, but Rachel Merriam, the wine director, has filled the list with well-priced discoveries, too. I found plenty of them with the help of sommeliers who seem to know instinctively when to stick with tradition and when to go off road. A request for something that would drink like cru Beaujolais was answered with a soft red Txakolina that had a bittersweet finish. And despite the crowds, the sommeliers always had time to talk. If you have questions about fractional aging, as we did, Casa Mono is the place for you. The sommeliers are so attentive that I didn’t feel neglected one night when I couldn’t quite figure out which server was in charge of our table. Service can be a little diffuse at times. In a place this size, though, help is never far away. Only three items (including a rabbit, in multiple parts) are listed at more than $20 on the menu, which runs from noon to midnight. The dining room, with glass doors on 17th Street that swing open in warm weather, is at its most charming in the slack hours between lunch and dinner. Even when packed, though, the little room has pockets of, if not privacy, then at least intimacy. The mosaic tile floors are now so worn down they look like Roman ruins. It’s hard to remember when they were new. Hard to recall a time before small plates, too, and harder still to find a New York restaurant where they are satisfying, one after another, as at Casa Mono.",Casa Mono in Gramercy Park,"['casa',

149,Superiority Burger,★★,2015-09-01,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/02/dining/restaurant-review-superiority-burger-in-the-east-village.html,East Village,"We all know restaurants where the menu changes daily. Last week at Superiority Burger, a vegetarian medium-fast-food outfit in the East Village, it changed in the middle of my meal. I was eating a tofu wrap and a salad of tender red-veined chard with pickled onions and juice-heavy blackberries at one of the six seats. These have swing-down desktops that remind me of college lecture halls and the old Prime Burger that used to sit across 51st Street from St. Patrick’s Cathedral. You can occupy an individual burger desk in a popular restaurant for only so long before the urge to let somebody else sit down becomes overpowering. So when I got back in line to place a second order at the counter, I asked for takeout. The chard salad, served like most of the vegetables in a paper boat, was no more. Taped to the spot on the white-tiled wall where its name had been written on a white card in black marker was something new: juicy green heirloom tomatoes with chopped corn. I wondered if one of the cooks had just tried out a new dish on Brooks Headley, the chef and owner, and he’d said, at 7:30 in the evening, “Let’s do it.” That was not far off, it turned out. “We’ve come up with a lot of our specials during little lulls in service,” Mr. Headley, who was the pastry chef at Del Posto until he opened Superiority Burger in June, told Lucky Peach recently. “Everybody runs down to the basement and picks up a project.” New ideas fly through the kitchen so quickly, you can almost hear them buzz by. This is what elevates Superiority Burger above what it appears to be at first glance, a Shake Shack for vegetarians. And it’s why going back regularly, as I’ve been doing, is an adventure. The avid experimentations of Mr. Headley and his cooks remind me of what was going on in the first year at Momofuku Noodle Bar, when David Chang and Joaquin Baca were on the edge of giving up and came back by cooking as if it were their last chance. Nothing at Superiority Burger contains meat, and most dishes can be made without animal products on request. Some of them you can be sure of finding every time, including the veggie burger that was famous from pop-ups before the restaurant opened. Others arrive out of nowhere and disappear a day or a week later. When it is among the specials taped to the wall, a meatless analogue of the Philadelphia cheesesteak interests me keenly. Shaved steak had been traded in for strips of yuba, the immortal Cheez Whiz for a smooth, subtly flavorful species of cashew cheese. The yuba mostly worked as texture; the flavor, which was strong and lasting, burst out of a spicy swirl of soft, deeply browned onions and green peppers. That sandwich did not mimic the flavor of a cheesesteak but conjured up enough of the sensations touched off by a cheesesteak to be an honest variation, not a fake. It was both heartfelt homage and its own, craveable thing. It wasn’t on the wall last time; I look forward to our reunion one day. The same goes for the ice-cold smashed cucumbers that seemed to have collided, in one of those fortuitous you-got-chocolate-in-my-peanut-butter accidents, with what tasted like spicy rice pudding. (Personal and confidential to the roasted fingerlings and eggplant last seen wearing capers and pine nuts in a radiant lemon vinaigrette: Please come back. I won’t ask where you’ve been if you don’t ask me about the chard salad.) When it comes to Mr. Headley’s gelati and sorbets, I try to adopt a Buddha-like state of nonattachment. These appear in a different two-scoop duet each night, one sorbet of ripe fruit straight from the market sharing a small paper cup with a dairy-based gelato. Last time, it was peach sorbet under gelato made with toasted hamburger buns; there were roasted peaches between them and a powder of the toasted buns, soaked in milk and dried, dusted over the top. When my Zen intentions weaken and I find myself wanting it again, I meditate on the impermanence of life as represented by a seductively lush nectarine sorbet I tasted a month ago. Wearing the paper cap of an old-time burger flipper or soda jerk, Mr. Headley takes care to serve his ice creams just cold enough to slide when they touch your tongue. But they won’t be melting; if you have ordered it with dinner and sat down at one of the burger desks, he’ll wait until you’ve finished before he picks up the scoop. I can’t think of a better, more meticulously put-together $4 dessert in the city. To my taste, it outshines the sandwich for which the place is named. The Superiority Burger is indeed superior to many other veggie burgers, but truly loving it may require a built-in desire for veggie burgers that I lack. Filling out its small Martin’s potato bun, layered with melted Muenster, iceberg lettuce, roasted plum tomatoes, brown honey mustard and pickles, the patty is seared to an energetic crackle and has a satisfyingly tender bulk. The buildup is almost too convincing, because the patty itself, which tastes of mashed beans, nuts and grains, breaks the illusion. For a ground-beef fan, the Superiority Burger takes you almost all the way, then stops. Among the sandwiches on the permanent roster, I prefer the Sloppy Dave. This is, of course, a meatless sloppy Joe, a sesame-seed roll filled with tofu in a marvelously spicy tomato sauce, with fried onions on top. I should say “usually filled with tofu”; the sandwich was almost all sauce on a first encounter, but it had more substance on subsequent tries. The menu’s nicest surprise is the Superiority Wrap, a whole-wheat tortilla encasing tofu and brown rice. A similar item is a staple of earnest vegetarian restaurants, where it typically tastes like a paper-towel tube packed with pulverized drywall moistened with Morrissey’s tears. The Superiority Wrap is a much more rewarding proposition. The rice has an excellent nutty taste. Shredded cabbage has a refreshing effect. A streak of bright tahini whirred with roasted sweet and hot peppers cuts through the tofu like a searchlight. And I loved the playful sweetness provided by a vein of candied sunflower seeds. The aesthetics of Superiority Burger are half-White Castle, half-punk. The menu board and signs borrow the stencils and ransom-note lettering from rock’s safety-pin-and-spit era. Music swerves from Wire and the Clash to proto-punks like the yé-yé singer Karina. The prices, which peak at $9 for the wrap, are as democratic as it gets. Mr. Headley, a hard-core-band drummer, leads his restaurant with the collaborative spirit of a musical style that gave up peacock guitar solos for blitzkrieg-bopping ensemble playing. He’ll tell anybody who asks that the cucumber salad isn’t his, but the work of a sous-chef, Julia Goldberg, and his menu is loaded with shout-outs to other chefs and restaurants. The chard salad had “Zuni pickled onions,” and raspberry sorbet came with “CF cream cheese gelato.” “Does CF stand for cruelty free?” a customer asked. “No, Claudia Fleming.” Another name you may hear, if you go more than once, is your own. The woman at the counter surprised me one night by remembering not just my fake name but the real one of the last person I had brought. This was more than standard critic-spotting. She showed me a stack of yellow Post-it notes with the names of repeat customers. “I’m trying to learn them all,” she said.",Superiority Burger in the East Village,"['know', 'change', 'last', 'week',

150,The Clocktower,★★,2015-08-25,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/26/dining/restaurant-review-the-clocktower-in-midtown-south.html,Midtown South,"If you hope dinner at the Clocktower will get you a backstage view of the ticking cogs at the top of the former Metropolitan Life Tower, forget it. The restaurant is on the second floor of the New York Edition hotel, which opened in the skyscraper at the foot of Madison Avenue in May. Marriott and Ian Schrager, who run the place, brought in the restaurateur Stephen Starr to operate the Clocktower. To get there, you can take the elevator from the lobby, or you can disappear up what looks like a big white cocoon into a tight spiral staircase. Upstairs, burning candles in glass lanterns flank the floor of the elevator bank. Somebody, maybe you, will notice this too late and kick one over. “Don’t worry, it happens all the time,” a host says, not all that reassuringly. She leads you past the billiards table upholstered in felt the color of grape jelly and into the bar, where you rescue a female friend who has been sent there to wait for the rest of your party. She has been there just long enough to stand uncomfortably while every man in the room checks her out. The Clocktower plays a familiar game, the private club that has accidentally let you in. There are three small, connected dining rooms. Yours has a dark green marble fireplace big enough to roast a goat. Above the wainscoting of book-matched burl and below the wedding-cake crown moldings, original fixtures ordered up by some long-dead insurance executive, hang framed photographs in black and white, one above another, gallery style. They show celebrities from the 1950s, ’60s and ’70s, dozens and dozens of them. When you ask about one, a server brings you an explanatory booklet printed on heavy paper stock. Your waiter wants to talk about the menu. Seafood is listed under Seafood and salads under Salads. You nod. Orders placed, you get a small round loaf of bread, cut in quarters, steaming. “I.P.A.-rye sourdough with buttermilk and butter.” The crust shatters on impact; the crumb has a prickle of tartness. In five minutes, you want another loaf. When the seafood-under-Seafood arrives, you know the bread was a preview of what’s in store. There’s citrus-marinated shaved fennel, so bright that it tingles, over the chilled lobster salad served in its shell. A sweet king crab leg with cucumber-pickle curls and dashi jelly rides high on chipped ice spread out over a silver pedestal. Cubes of raw scallop and hamachi are spread over a chunky pesto that’s surprisingly right. This chef can cook. Who is he, anyway? His name is Jason Atherton. You’ll read later that he was raised in an English resort town on the North Sea, where his parents ran a small hotel. That he spent five years working for Gordon Ramsay. Like Mr. Ramsay, he now has restaurants in London and around the world. Unlike Mr. Ramsay, he is not a magnet for controversy, which may be why his landing in New York has been less bumpy than his former boss’s. Also, there is very little egotism in Mr. Atherton’s cooking. He seems to have the peculiar idea of cooking to make other people happy, not to reflect his own glory. You’ve heard that he serves contemporary English food at the Clocktower. It doesn’t taste much like England to you. There are exceptions, like the suave and gentle Lancashire hot pot, a traditional mutton stew that Mr. Atherton makes with rabbit, to excellent effect. It’s so good that you ignore the other, fancier half of the dish, a pastry-wrapped bullet of spongy rabbit loin and slightly overcooked foie gras. How to describe the rest? It’s festive and generous, and it looks exciting. Classic sauces and techniques are used, but they don’t feel like old hat. Mr. Atherton’s cooking is not pretentious, but it has the celebratory elegance that traditional hotel dining rooms promise to deliver and rarely do. A beurre blanc, taking its gentle heat and berrylike flavor from pink peppercorns, is genuinely exciting over gleaming braised halibut; so is the carrot purée that’s somewhere between a sauce and a vegetable. You’re even happier with the roasted king salmon that gets along wonderfully with its sauce of chives and chopped oysters. Of course, there is Dover sole, and you appreciate the time-honored treatment of brown butter, lemon and capers. You admire the duck à l’orange, too, the chew of the breast pieces, the concentration of the confit and the way the sauce conveys the fragrance of oranges without the sweetness. These sauces are spooned or poured when the dish is served, a formal gesture that the Clocktower pulls off without stuffiness. Maybe the stage business ought to stop there, you think. While one server points out each variety of raw oyster, another stands off to one side holding a tray of condiments. He stares into space, no doubt wondering where on the small table he is supposed to put all this stuff. A terrific piece of smoked thigh that comes with chicken breast, nicely roasted with herb stuffing under the skin, is served in a drawer that slides out of a little box. Some of this hyperactivity may fall away as the restaurant matures. Perhaps somebody will also toss out half the bottles at the bar; a lot of the cocktails have two or three more ingredients than they need. You took a few sips of a cloying pineapple-rum concoction garnished with glow sticks and a temporary tattoo, then ran for the sanity of the wine list. When the stock market stops correcting itself, you may splurge on a $400 Bordeaux; this week calls for a bottle in the $40 to $60 range. Clocktower has scores of them. Now you want dessert. You want all the desserts, in fact, so it’s a good thing you brought a crowd. The pastry chef, Sébastien Rouxel, has the same solid hold on classic technique and proven flavors that Mr. Atherton does. His pistachio soufflé, with a lump of chocolate-yogurt ice cream dropped through its roof at the last minute, is virtually perfect. You wish he would get the ice crystals out of the vanilla ice cream that comes with a tarte Tatin, but the sticky caramelized apples make you unreasonably happy, and while it’s billed as a portion for two, it’s easily enough for four. The table is still jammed, and here come some treats in a vintage McVitie’s biscuit tin. You make room because everything in that tin is good, from the crumbly-tender shortbread to the toffee brittle coated with dark chocolate and chopped peanuts. The check comes. You do the math, not just the tip, but the more subtle calculation of whether this is a fair deal. The Dover sole was more than $50, but it always is. Other main courses were in the $20s, which is rare in this style of restaurant. And there were great little surprises all through the meal. You sign your name. You’ll be back.",The Clocktower in Midtown South,"['hope', 'clocktower', 'backstage', 'view', 'ticking', 'cog', 'top', 'former', 'metropolitan', 'life', 'tower', 'forget', 'edition', 'hotel',

151,Oiji,★★,2015-08-18,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/19/dining/restaurant-review-oiji-in-the-east-village.html,East Village,"I’ll get to the heftier items on Oiji’s menu. I’ll praise the pine-smoked mackerel that a mackerel-conscious friend and I have been emailing each other about for a month now. I’ll reminisce about the bowl of buttered rice and stewed beef that seemed boring at first and then not boring at all. I’ll try to explain what makes the bubble-cluster of crust on the fried chicken so good. All in due time, all in due time. First, I need to tell you about the honey butter chips. As faithful readers of the South Korean dailies know, about a year ago the snack company Haitai introduced the country to a new potato chip flavored with “sweet, sweet honey from beehives” and “gourmet butter” from France. Mass hysteria ensued. Few stores could keep them in stock and those that did rationed one bag to a customer. The snack’s social media presence was Kardashian-esque. On eBay, two bags of the chips sold for more than $100. An anxious nation was soothed to learn that Haitai is building a chip factory outside Seoul, and disappointed to hear that it will not be completed until next year. Frustration was mounting in the East Village as well, where Oiji’s two chefs, Brian Kim and Tae Kyung Ku, wanted to pay homage to honey butter chips, but couldn’t get their hands on any. Undaunted, they took to the kitchen. The chips they came up with have not ignited a citywide panic, but they are not a joke. They come to the table straight from the fryer, translucently thin and shimmering all over with honey and brown sugar melted into butter. Cayenne keeps the syrup from overstaying its welcome. They are crisper and more lovable than wet potato chips have any right to be. The chefs grew up in South Korea in the innocent times before honey butter chips. They met in culinary school in the United States, then went off to learn their trade — Mr. Kim worked at Bouley, and Mr. Ku at Gramercy Tavern and at his family’s restaurant back home. Getting back together years later, they leased a room with a lineage, the former site of Dok Suni, the pioneering modern Korean restaurant on First Avenue. Made over as Oiji, it is a warm and orderly space of exposed brick and wood. Half the dining room is taken up by a table that looks as if it came from the reading room of a college library, with benches on either side. Oiji helps take the sting out of Dok Suni’s demise. In some ways it continues its predecessor’s mission of updating and translating Korean cuisine with respect. It may also remind you of the chef Hooni Kim’s places, Danji and Hanjan; like them, it adjusts traditional recipes for the small-plates era. Those places draw harder on Korea’s more intense flavors, while Oiji aims for a little French-style nuance. I promised you buttered rice and beef. Oiji’s braised beef is a variant on a classic banchan, but its version is less salty and soy drenched. You take your wooden spoon and stir it into the rice with half a soft-cooked egg and some low-key radish pickles. The mixture is so subtle it barely registers until the butter’s tractor beam switches on and you find yourself thinking that you could eat this every night. The mackerel that Mr. Kim and Mr. Ku smoke over pine needles may fit into your Sunday mornings. It’s soft, a bit creamy, and tastes like something Barney Greengrass might sell if it relocated to a forest in Maine. The fish comes with a soy-based sauce. You’re supposed to brush this on using a cluster of pine needles tied with a string. I liked the mackerel very much but this tiny broom made me feel as if I were having dinner under the floorboards with the Borrowers. As for the chicken, it’s a genuine achievement. Typically Korean fried chicken has a hard, crackling shell, but Oiji’s is dressed in a puffy, pale, blistered cloak that crunches like newly fried chicharrones. At the other end of the texture spectrum is the superb terrine of pigs’ feet, firm pink meat held in a thin lattice of gelatin. The terrine is underpinned by French aromatics (thyme, maybe allspice). Korea enters the picture through the precise, clear flavors of the spicy citrus vinaigrette. Mr. Kim and Mr. Ku have a spin on yuk hwe, but in their kitchen the chilled raw cubes of beef with egg yolk and sesame oil are augmented by pickled mustard seeds. It’s very good, although cooking the yolk to a soft jelly seemed like an unnecessary flourish. A hot soup of ground perilla seeds is gloopy and grainy in a way that some guests at my table never got used to. I wouldn’t put it at the top of my list, but I liked the way the chefs used oyster mushrooms to deepen the flavor of the seeds, which can taste a little flat on their own. The risk with this kind of cooking is that people who know their way around traditional Korean restaurants, where the only small plates are the free banchan, may walk away feeling they’ve paid more for less. I didn’t get as much of the tender squid, shrimp and mussels in truffled seafood broth as I wanted. And if the gochujang-braised drumsticks were twice as spicy I doubt shrieks of pain would fill the dining room. But most of the time, when I knew the Korean original, it helped me enjoy the renovations Mr. Kim and Mr. Ku have made. The cocktails aren’t quite as clunky as names like Thyme to Samba suggest. Wines are respectable, but the most rewarding thing to drink is soju. Oiji offers more styles and prices than you usually see in one place, including a garnet-colored soju made backstage with pomegranate vinegar. All but two dishes are under $20. Most can be shared by two or three people, but if you make a solo dinner of the mackerel for $14 and the house-made cold soba with pickled ramps for $10, you’ll be eating and spending well. Another $5 will get you honey butter chips and the satisfaction of finding a bargain not available on eBay.",Oiji in the East Village,"['i’ll', 'heftier', 'item', 'oiji’s', 'i’ll', 'praise',

152,Untitled,★★,2015-08-04,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/05/dining/restaurant-review-untitled-at-the-whitney-in-the-meatpacking-district.html,Meatpacking District,"If you can get past the name, a graduate-school groaner that I am supposed to underline, but won’t, there is nothing pretentious about Untitled. Untitled is on the ground floor of the Whitney Museum of American Art. The Whitney is the second major art museum in the city to choose Danny Meyer to run a big, semiformal restaurant — the Museum of Modern Art is the other — and yet Mr. Meyer is resolutely uninterested in arty food. When Eleven Madison Park began its swerve toward the conceptual, he sold it. The remaining holdings in his Union Square Hospitality Group are polite restaurants where polite people are in very little danger of being challenged or provoked. Although Mr. Meyer has worked to make his name synonymous with hospitality, what his restaurants sell above all is reassurance. Imagine his relief that the Whitney decided against installing Charles Ray’s sculpture of a naked Huck Finn, bending over next to an 8-foot full-frontal Jim, on the plaza in front of Untitled. (Next door at Santina, which plays Nicki Minaj to Untitled’s Taylor Swift, they would have rearranged the tables for better views.) The restaurant is slotted into a narrow quadrangle with glass curtain walls on three sides, designed, like the rest of the museum, by Renzo Piano. Untitled treats the architect deferentially. Too deferentially, I think: In its near-total lack of ornament, the dining room can look like an espresso shop. If Eero Saarinen’s cardinal-red chairs weren’t so comfortable, you might get antsy after an hour. An architect friend spent the night admiring Mr. Piano’s meticulous engineering, but also pointed out that interiors with curtain walls are only as beautiful as the building across the street. At Untitled, you look at a hulking industrial slab across Gansevoort Street. At least it is an improvement on the view from my old desk at Mr. Piano’s New York Times building, where I peered into the dark soul of the Port Authority Bus Terminal. All the energy and beauty at Untitled are on the plates. They throb with color. It’s not just decoration, either. The color mostly comes from fruits and vegetables so ripe they’re ready to pop. Michael Anthony, the chef; Suzanne Cupps, the chef de cuisine; and Miro Uskokovic, the pastry chef, use market produce flamboyantly, as though they were trying to get the purse-lipped farm-to-table puritans who solemnly hand you a single baby zucchini to crack a smile. A slice of the tender, rich poundcake is virtually swallowed up by ricotta, sabayon, strawberries and violas. More strawberries — and nearly every other berry under the summer sun — ring the gloriously slouching chamomile panna cotta in a great purple landslide. Around a towering ship’s-prow wedge of cake with sesame brittle and peanut-butter icing, servers pour a blueberry sauce with the spicy buzz of ginger, which rockets the dessert right out of PB&J territory. The four menu categories aren’t labeled, but it’s obvious that the third section is turned over to vegetables. A few are best as side dishes, like the spoonable potato purée liquefied with melted Cheddar, too salty for more than a few bites. Most of the vegetables, though, have enough contrast and sophistication to be appetizers or even main courses. Pickled wine-colored cherries, sunflower seeds and orange splashes of carrot vinaigrette make every bite of a kale-and-cabbage salad taste like a new dish. (If we are sentenced to see raw kale everywhere we go, every restaurant should dress it as exuberantly as Untitled does.) Earlier this summer, there were roasted and griddled leeks, as dark as roasted Japanese eggplants and almost that soft, with an intense, sweet-sour salsa sauce of citrus and pasilla chiles; I’ve never wanted to cheer for a plate of leeks before. Every taste tells you how carefully (and recently) these chefs have done their shopping. A dinner companion was convinced that some ingredient had been injected into the flat beans to make them taste so alluring, and she didn’t think it had anything to do with the baby squid, hazelnuts and ancho chile sauce on the plate. But no, these were just excellent beans, grilled quickly so they still had some snap and juice. You can tell that the rotisserie chicken had great flavor down to its core before it took its turn on the spit. If you’re not sure, try the fried chicken that comes on the same plate. Under the airy, crackling crust that owes something to Japan and Korea, there’s very fine meat. If every dish were this good, Untitled might rank up there with Gramercy Tavern, where Mr. Anthony and Mr. Uskokovic hold the same titles they do here. But the kitchen isn’t there yet. One night I’d brought along a native of Owensboro, Ky., the smoked mutton capital of the world. But it didn’t take a barbecue authority to know the smoked pork ribs were tough and undercooked, and coated in a paste that didn’t taste of anything but salt. It was the only real disaster. In other dishes, the worst you could say is that the cooks packed too much into their shopping bags. The flavor of swordfish steaks disappears into a mashed eggplant that was a little too sharp and salty, and the taste of sea scallops can’t hold its head up in a bowl of sweet watermelon gazpacho with lemon cucumbers and peaches. At times the plates had so much going on that they left you with only a blurry impression of deliciousness. But as blurry impressions go, that one is hard to beat. At the end of one dinner, Mr. Anthony stopped by my table. (I’d been spotted long ago.) He was enthusiastic about how the gray limestone floors and white-oak counter catch the light during the day. He was slightly less enthusiastic about the kitchen, which is as narrow as a scallion. When he said he and Ms. Cupps were taking inspiration from the overflowing planters up on the High Line, I understood the botanical profusion of their plates. Maybe the wine director, Eduardo Porto Carreiro, can find some inspiration up there, too. Native plants grow on the High Line, and American art fills the Whitney, but Untitled’s wine list genuflects toward Europe. You can drink very well without spending a fortune, but it could get interesting if Mr. Porto Carreiro took his cues from the location. Untitled is not really meant for museum visitors, who are much more likely to recuperate with an avocado toast at Mr. Meyer’s Studio Cafe on the eighth floor. Instead, the restaurant is one of the attractions the museum is peddling, part of its multipronged campaign to be seen as a neighborhood hot spot and not just some boring shed where there’s nothing to do but look at art. Sometimes I miss those boring sheds, though I don’t miss the school lunchroom smell of their cafeterias. And at least the Whitney’s urge to pump itself up with crowds has given us Untitled.",Untitled at the Whitney in the Meatpacking District,"['past', 'graduateschool', 'groaner', 'supposed',

153,Noreetuh,★,2015-06-23,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/24/dining/restaurant-reviews-noreetuh-the-eddy-in-the-east-village.html,East Village,"Any Hawaiian honeymooner who’s been off the plane for more than an hour can tell you that poke rhymes with O.K. and that tuna poke typically means raw ahi cut up and mixed with soy sauce, seaweed and so on. But the people at the next table were stumped when they saw it on the menu of Noreetuh, which has been offering tastes of Hawaii in the East Village since March. “What’s poke?” one of them asked, rhyming it with Coke. After a silence, a man sitting with her spoke up. “It’s a fish,” he said. Pause. “A kind of tuna.” This exchange suggested some of the challenges facing Noreetuh’s chef, Chung Chow, along with his partners, Jin Ahn and Gerald San Jose. Island seafood and produce fill the walk-ins at contemporary Honolulu restaurants like MW or the Pig and the Lady, but they rarely reach the island of Manhattan. A knowledgeable audience can’t be imported, either. While islanders can be counted on to know exactly which local dish Alan Wong is playing around with, the average New Yorker has almost no idea what the residents of the 50th state eat. Don’t they like … Spam? Sure, among other things. Mr. Chow, who was raised in Hawaii and cooked at Lincoln Ristorante and Per Se, goes out of his way to treat Hormel’s arrestingly pink canned meat product as if it were an heirloom ingredient. Stuffed into supple agnolotti and accessorized with hon-shimeji mushrooms; semi-juicy, soy-cured spring almonds; and a mob of bonito flakes (waving their hands in the air like they just don’t care), it could almost pass for mortadella. It may be the most elegant dish on Mr. Chow’s menu, although it gets stiff competition from the monkfish liver torchon, a pink button surrounded by jellied passion fruit. Lightly pickled pears soften the passion fruit’s brassy tendencies. Mash the fruit and fish liver together on a sweet dinner roll from King’s Hawaiian bakery, and you have one of the most exciting tastes to wash up on Manhattan’s shores this year. With prime ingredients, carefully organized plates and nonviolent menu prices, Mr. Chow seems intent on making Hawaiian classics presentable for their introduction to New York. Four or five garlic shrimp stand side by side on a long column of rice, offering the same pleasurable assault of garlic-flecked butter that you’d get from a big messy pile slopped onto a paper plate by one of the shrimp trucks of Oahu. And however you pronounce it, Mr. Chow’s poke is classical, generous and slightly Japanese-leaning, made from firm, cool bigeye tuna, diced and slicked down with sesame oil. Frills of seaweed carry the heat of tobanjan, the spicy Japanese bean paste. Neatness counts for only so much, though, and some dishes are more fastidious than flavorful. The pork in panko-crusted croquettes isn’t very emphatic, and the katsu sauce on the side needs more kick, too. A different poke, with octopus and fingerling potatoes, has only a flicker of the tuna’s personality. White asparagus looks very nice alongside crumbled Chinese sausage and chopped eggs, but the combination doesn’t go very far. Noreetuh has plenty of dishes for a successful first visit. Dinner will be particularly fun for wine lovers because Mr. Ahn has compiled an overachieving list of German rieslings, Burgundies in both colors, grower Champagnes and more far-flung treats. Better still, the prices are low; just by sticking to your budget, you can drink at a higher level than usual. Noreetuh may have a trickier time converting new diners into regulars, though. The two dining rooms, while tasteful enough, don’t have anything you could really call atmosphere. Noreetuh means “playground” in Korean, and the owners seem to want to give a party. But where did they find their DJ.? A Motown hit parade is followed by “Yellow Submarine,” and then by Taylor Swift, Natalie La Rose and, gosh, is that really Taylor Swift, twice in one night? At the moment, there’s something a little cautious about the whole enterprise. But the last time I went, I ate a bowl of spaghetti, new to the menu, that points in the right direction. Richly oily smoked butterfish was folded in among buttered noodles, bright orange with fiery little capsules of spicy cod roe. This wasn’t a polite exercise in cultural diplomacy; it was a shut-up-and-eat dish, and if a third Taylor Swift song had played right at that moment, I wouldn’t have cared.  Another small, modest looking restaurant called the Eddy sits right around the corner, on East Sixth Street’s disappearing row of interchangeable curry spots. The Eddy is so small and modest looking, in fact, that after it opened last spring, I almost decided not to review it at all, on the theory that when a restaurant has just over 30 seats and doesn’t seem to have any trouble filling them, there isn’t much point in driving more people there. The chef is Brendan McHale, and I wasn’t always sold on his cooking. I would have liked some of his dishes better if they hadn’t reminded me of slightly better things I’d eaten elsewhere, like the burrata served, as at Estela, in an herbaceous puddle of chlorophyll. Others, like the strangely bloated gnocchi or the dull, spongy lamb loin served with pellets of teff spaetzle that looked like rabbit feed, were easy to forget. But other dishes were wonderful. There were unimprovable roasted potatoes with strips of rib-eye whose dry-aged intensity was amplified by the low-key funk of melted Brie. And the soft-shell crab with a peppery arugula pesto that I kept eating after the crab was gone. And the jiggly, just-set cardamom panna cotta with crystals of rhubarb granité on top. And the airy chips of fried beef tendon, spread with Greek yogurt and dotted by smoky trout roe. Like Mr. McHale’s bacon tater tots, which wear little bright-green berets of puréed sweet peas, the tendon puffs disappeared with a crunch and left behind a strong desire for more. I would say that both hors d’oeuvres were smart cocktail party food, but I have never been invited to a cocktail party this smart. And then I thought about how extremely pleasant everybody is at the Eddy, starting with the bartenders, who look up and smile each time a new customer walks in, as if they lived in the opening credits of a sitcom. I remembered the drinks they made, which are as good as the ones at a dedicated cocktail bar. I recalled the compact well-priced wine list, and how I never picked a bottle that I didn’t enjoy a little more than I’d expected. When I went back to the Eddy, I noticed how quickly the people I brought settled in and got comfortable under the timbered rafters and low ceiling that make the dining room look like a well-kept old tavern. And how easy it was to hear one another, even when the place was crowded. The Eddy, in other words, is one of those restaurants that gets so many little details right that your main course can be a little shaky and you can still walk out happy. That’s a rare thing, no accident when it happens, and the reason all those seats are so often full.",Restaurant Reviews: Noreetuh and the Eddy in the East Village,"['hawaiian', 'honeymooner', 'who’s',

154,Blanca,★★★,2015-06-16,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/dining/restaurant-review-blanca-in-bushwick-brooklyn.html,Bushwick,"When Blanca opened in 2012, a 27-course tasting menu served at a counter behind a pizzeria in Bushwick sounded like the setup to a joke. (Second prize is 30 courses.) The restaurant does have its sense of humor, but it quickly proved that about cooking for maximum pleasure, it was unswervingly serious.  Carlo Mirarchi, the chef and an owner of Blanca and its sprawling mother ship, Roberta’s, was a rigorous miniaturist, combining a few ingredients at a time into two- or three-bite compositions that were utterly complete, even if they left you wanting more. At 31, he already had an impressive sense of what to put on a plate and what to leave off. What he didn’t have yet was a repertoire deep enough for the length of the meals he served. My early dinners at Blanca were marked by dishes that seemed like placeholders, and there were moments when the kitchen’s reach exceeded its technical grasp. It was as if Mr. Mirarchi were giving you a tour of a mansion he’d bought before the contractor had finished the punch list. Most of the place was spectacular, but there were rooms where you would not want to spend the night. Being a critic, I had a suggestion, hinted at in my two-star review that year: make the meal shorter and cheaper. Being a chef, Mr. Mirarchi ignored me and kept refining his marathon tastings, very gradually. “The menu changes so slowly that for us it’s like watching your hair grow,” Leslie Vinyard, Blanca’s welcoming and gracious service captain, remarked one night from behind the countertop. So it may have taken a while, but every time I’ve settled into one of the padded brown-leather captain’s chairs recently, nearly everything I’ve tasted has been remarkable in one way or another.  One dinner this spring got rolling with a fat little Pacific Northwest oyster. Sharing its deep cup-shaped shell were juicy round cells of finger lime that popped in my mouth like citrus caviar, and a pool of green juice pressed from roasted asparagus, an ingenious combination that teased a mild cucumber flavor out of the oyster.  At the end of the night, asparagus came back. Samantha Short, the pastry chef, had made a sort of coconut semifreddo, silky on the tongue, which hovered over a spoonful or two of white asparagus soup seasoned with sugar and salt. Sweet and savory, tropical and vegetal flavors crashed together and bloomed into something daring and great. The desserts after some mega-tastings are gradual diminuendos. This was a mike drop.  Over three meals since October, I’ve experienced all sorts of flavor detonations: a streaky fold of raw pancetta with a burst of black peppercorns; a salt-roasted Japanese sweet potato with an unexpectedly dreamy dressing of macadamia milk and ground espresso beans; a crunchy wedge of tart apple carrying a small, remarkable payload of garlic, olive oil, anchovies, fried bread crumbs and cardoons cooked in apple juice.  I have also started looking forward to sunchokes, a vegetable that has a hard time getting more out of me than grudging acceptance. Blanca caramelized them deeply, steeped them in soy milk, then whipped them into a cream. A ragged leaf of toasted sea lettuce supplied a bottom note, and the crumb of beeswax and honey at the bottom of the dish made my eyes go wide, every time. Then there are the agnolotti parcels that are like Freshen Up gum from the dark side. They burst when you bite down with an oozing, inky-green liquid made from melted taleggio and phytoplankton. The flavor is like a distillation of spinach, seaweed and squid ink. It’s a totally disorienting sensation, and while I love it, not everyone will. I think of this course as the one guest-directed by David Lynch. It is when the dwarf starts to dance. One of Mr. Mirarchi’s sillier conceits in the early days was making you wait more than two hours for an ordinary slice of filone, presented as its own course. You still wait, but now it’s worth it. The breads made by Nina Subhas may include a soft Hawaiian sweet roll with pineapple juice in the dough and black salt on top, and a flaky garlic knot that’s like a savory Danish. Or you may be given a chunk torn from a squat round loaf made from Roberta’s pizza dough. Brushed with olive oil, this steaming-hot pizza bread doesn’t need the house-made butter, not that I let that stop me. Once, grilled snow crabs were served with a deliciously funky crab-innards sauce. Now the steamed legs of very recently living king crabs come with a saffron-colored slosh of melted butter sauce whipped with shaved bottarga. The sauce is an upgrade, less likely to step on the sweetness of the shellfish, and I’ve never again been served gelatinous, half-raw crab legs as I was in 2012. This has become one of New York’s essential dishes, along with the ’nduja raviolo, an explosion of spicy pork lava, the one item that has been on the lineup since opening night.  Mr. Mirarchi’s notion of what al dente means seems to have softened. So has the pasta, slightly, but I’ll deal with the extra-chewy core of tightly hand-rolled noodles to taste his creamy, yolk-rich carbonara with lamb fat and cured lamb breast.  Beneath the body of Blanca’s menu is an Italian chassis, so after pasta come the meat courses. There may be a few rosy slices of roast duck placed beside a slow-burning beet mole, followed by porchetta with chimichurri. The servings are never very large and never as hot as I’d like, but the meat is always juicier and more concentrated than almost any other restaurant can manage.  When you say “savory desserts,” some people look for the exits. None of these people have tasted Ms. Short’s intermezzos and finales. She can make the heat and the vegetal taste of poblano peppers seem like sensible, delicious additions to a cake. One night, her parting shot was a chocolate-Parmesan ice cream with shaved white truffles. It was another mike drop. One could, and come to think of it one will, complain that Blanca offers no wine bottles under $80 and no glasses under $18. Customers who have torn a hole in their budget to afford the $195 for dinner, before tax and tip, shouldn’t have to drink beer all night. Not that this would be a terrible fate; Blanca’s beers are as varied and full of character as the sakes and wines. A course-by-course wine pairing can be had for $95, but Shanti Carson, the sommelier, excels at working with people who aren’t that thirsty.  Ms. Carson is also the one who placed the vinyl on the turntable when I decided to prove to the other 11 people at the counter that “New York Groove” isn’t the only good song on Ace Frehley’s first solo album.  The record collection, which Mr. Mirarchi may well have lifted straight from the garage of his childhood home, is one of the ways Blanca deflates high-end dining’s gassier pretensions. His aim has always been to run a restaurant that is both a luxury and a weird adventure. The entrance tells you everything. You walk into a cinder-block bomb shelter of a pizzeria, past the crowds eating pies with names like Lamb of God. You turn left at the bar, go out the door, take another left at the radio studio and a right at the tiki bar. Keep going past the shipping containers and the outdoor oven, walk down a couple of steps, through the door, and you’re inside Bushwick’s first three-star restaurant.","Blanca in Bushwick,

155,Mission Chinese Food,★★,2015-06-09,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/10/dining/restaurant-review-mission-chinese-food-on-the-lower-east-side.html,Lower East Side,"When it appeared on Orchard Street in 2012, Mission Chinese Food was slightly unreal. It didn’t seem to follow the rules, or even know that there were rules. The health department and other city agencies knew, though, and after just 18 months, they pulled the plug on Danny Bowien’s hallucinatory all-ages chile-pepper party. At its new address on East Broadway, there is a host behind a lectern instead of a dude handing out plastic cups near the beer keg. While the old space looked as if it had been built by Mr. Bowien and his friends with two-by-fours, a staple gun and a paper dragon, the new two-level dining room with half-moon booths of brushed red velvet under bistro mirrors was inherited from an earlier restaurant that seemed to have employed a licensed architect and a professional designer. Now there is a well-appointed kitchen in the basement, not Orchard Street’s narrow galley behind plexiglass, where the heat and flames were so ferocious that Mr. Bowien seemed intent on turning himself into the nightly special, grilled chef. He still wears shorts on his trips to the dining room, but now it looks like a fashion choice, not a matter of survival. While very few items on the old menu couldn’t be knocked together by one person with a wok in less than five minutes, many dishes now speak of ample counter space and many hands, including those of Angela Dimayuga, the executive chef. (Mr. Bowien is the chef and owner.) Of her many contributions to Mission Chinese Food, the one everybody wants to talk about is Josefina’s house special chicken. Josefina is Ms. Dimayuga’s grandmother, a Filipina, and her chicken is no short-order stir fry. The bird is roasted with a stuffing of fresh chorizo, raisins, olives, sweet pickles and butter. It is carried to the table on a silver platter, feet splayed out, head tucked in. When the torso is cut into thick slices, the center of each one has the white-and-yellow ring of a hard-cooked egg. Everything about Josefina’s chicken is great. The recipe is most likely of Spanish descent. This should make it an idiosyncratic fixture in a Chinese restaurant, but idiosyncrasy is to Mission Chinese Food what the Bloomin’ Onion is to an Outback Steakhouse. In the original San Francisco incarnation, as well as in the first New York location, most of the idiosyncrasies looped around Sichuan cuisine. Many of the old dishes, marked as much by Mr. Bowien’s freethinking approach as by the burn and tingle of chiles and Sichuan peppercorns, have migrated to the new restaurant: the kung pao pastrami; the galvanizing lamb ribs with sweet, gooey dates; the Chongqing chicken wings so acutely spicy and flavorful they make Buffalo wings seem as dangerous as an animal cracker. But this kind of scorched-tongue cooking has become a minor motif in Mr. Bowien and Ms. Dimayuga’s menu, which goes on for pages. Fewer than a third of the items are marked by red flames blazing from what looks like a pair of cheeks, and not the ones you kiss your grandmother on. The rest is not just less fire-spewing but more varied than before, drawing from regions beyond Sichuan and countries beyond China. Some of it is even nuanced. Splashing around in a gentle, aromatic pool of chamomile, almond milk and saffron, the steamed Napa cabbage has more in common with a chai latte than with Mr. Bowien’s pork-drenched mapo tofu. There is a startlingly well-calibrated, nori-sprinkled salad of red cabbage in a Caesar-esque vinaigrette of soy, miso, sesame and anchovy. Konnichiwa, Caesar! Another salad waves toward Vietnam, with green papaya threads, roasted peanuts, sliced banana blossoms and shreds of lightly smoked chicken. The perfume of dill, mint and basil rises up from a bowl of cellophane noodles in deeply aromatic lamb soup. Grassy, astringent matcha is sprinkled over green-tea noodles with scallions and ginger. Fried rice with sweet and tender lumps of lobster is fragrant with coconut oil. Whole dorade can be cooked two ways: roasted in the wood-burning oven with turmeric and pickled chiles, or deep-fried and plopped down on a sheet pan over fat noodles and hunks of purple taro, with an armful of fresh herbs thrown on top. All of these are smart, layered and vibrant enough to win over anybody who shows up thinking that Mission Chinese Food is still in the business of knocking your head against the wall until you smile or pass out or both. It’s easier to taste the quieter flavors now. With the extra space and staff, the kitchen pays some attention to the order in which dishes arrive, so it can keep the more antisocial ones in solitary confinement. Nobody is going to mistake Mission Chinese Food for a rarefied tasting room, though, not when you can get a pepperoni pizza. Mine was too soupy, but the same sourdough starter is the base for two different puffballs of bread, both tossed into the wood-fired oven, both with a natural-yeast flavor that rewards slow, appreciative chewing. One makes a fine platform for smoky pickled chiles and excellent oil-cured anchovies straight from the can, but my favorite way to eat it is to swipe it through a little dish of softened kefir butter in its own buttermilk. On Orchard Street, the throttlingly loud music, the elbows-in-your-ribs seating, the chile-induced sweats and the improbably low prices (nothing cost more than $15 when I gave the restaurant two stars in 2012) conspired to cover the kitchen’s lapses. You registered the bumps, but as on the Cyclone, they were part of the ride. They matter more now that the menu is rich with check-goosing banquet dishes and the restaurant aims for a degree of finesse. There is a wine list now, stocked with semi-obscure natural wines. In the five months the restaurant has been open, servers have memorized a few stock phrases, like “it goes well with our food” (imagine that), but have not learned which part of the corkscrew will remove a metal bottle cap, or when to stop pouring an unfiltered wine to keep sediment from sliding into the glass. I liked taking a hammer to a clay brick to reveal a whole duck confit stuffed with sticky rice and chestnuts, and liked the rich and oily meat I tore from the legs, but I didn’t love the dry breast meat, and I wouldn’t mind taking a hammer to the $100 price tag. I also won’t be handing over another $150 for a smoked prime rib topped with a king crab leg, a garnish that just seemed like bait for the hedge-fund crowd. For far less money, the celery with hazelnuts that was so nicely stir-fried one time was nearly raw the next. I might have loved the just-cooked black kale with pickled plums if not for the overpowering brininess. But these are normal lapses for what has become, against the odds and to almost everybody’s benefit, a nearly normal restaurant. The hallucinations may have stopped, but Mission Chinese Food is still a trip.",Mission Chinese Food on the Lower East Side,"['appeared', 'orchard', 'mission', 'chinese', 'slightly', 'unreal',

156,Aquavit,★★★,2015-05-26,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/27/dining/restaurant-review-aquavit-in-midtown.html,Midtown East,"Time to cheer for Aquavit and its power to defy the forces of gravity.  Time drags down restaurants in New York. It turns hot spots into castoffs and grand dining rooms into whispery museums. Hakan Swahn opened Aquavit in 1987. Over the last 27 years, it made the reputation of one Marcus Samuelsson and transferred from a light-drenched atrium with a defining waterfall to a more prosaic space in a pink-granite tower in the East 50s.  The move happened a decade ago, but Aquavit still seems to be struggling to find the right tone in its dining room, which still isn’t as comfortable as it could be. Its kitchen is soaring, though. Emma Bengtsson, who took over as executive chef last spring, is cooking modern Scandinavian cuisine as delicious as any I’ve ever had in this restaurant.  In three-course prix fixe menus as well as five- or eight-course tastings, she juxtaposes flavors and textures in ways that are both complex and finely tuned. Even more crucially, her ideas are fresh without aping fashionable Nordic tropes, which would have been the wrong way to bid for relevance. Ms. Bengtsson sprinkles enough sea buckthorn around to show she’s perfectly aware of what’s happening in Copenhagen, but she is in no apparent danger of disappearing inside a cloud of hay smoke. She is her own chef. Almost every dish is denoted by a pair of ingredients, but there is always more to the story. For “scallop and radish,” slices of raw scallops are given extra depth by white soy and fish sauce, and shaved breakfast radishes are tucked around them. Unannounced, but pivotal, is a brightly flavored froth of ramps. This green fluff has been sprinkled with puffed buckwheat kernels, whose slightly earthy crunch completes the picture.  Ms. Bengtsson builds contrasts of color and shape that underscore ones of flavor and texture. She pairs creamy white buttons of delicate asparagus panna cotta with crisp ribbons of raw asparagus. Against both forms of the vegetable she pits salty-sweet gravlax in ravioli-esque pink bundles, sheets of cured salmon draped over chopped mounds of it.  When a fillet of grilled Spanish mackerel shows up, you can see its slashed black-and-silver skin through a glossy apricot-colored sheath of jellied gooseberry. The gel is also tart enough to offset the mackerel’s rich oils, a clever way of adding acidity without a sauce. There’s a hint of sweetness in the candied pistachios and in the lacy umbrellas of fennel flowers, and more tartness in the poached red gooseberries strung along the plate with cauliflower florets — some raw, some pickled and lightly charred.  When Sam Sifton wrote the last Times review of Aquavit, in 2010, Marcus Jernmark was the chef and Ms. Bengtsson was in charge of breads and desserts. (Mr. Jernmark is now cooking at Restaurant Frantzen in Stockholm.) It’s tempting to see a pastry chef’s training at work in Ms. Bengtsson’s dynamic handling of color, her appreciation of things that go crunch, her use of fruit in savory dishes, and her sense of sugar as a seasoning, on full display in the caramelized walnuts and drops of birch syrup with curls of an aged Swedish cheese called havgus.  But it’s foolish to push that argument too hard. I don’t blame her background in the sugary sciences for the one savory dish of hers I could not force myself to like, a pâté of calf’s liver encased in unnervingly sweet cucumber jelly. It looked like an expensive paperweight and tasted, to me, like a Jell-O salad concocted by a deranged ’60s housewife. But I suspect it wouldn’t seem nearly as strange to somebody raised in Sweden, as Ms. Bengtsson was. No matter which menu you get, there are extra treats all along the way, from a traditional potato dumpling in smoked lingonberry broth to intensely flavorful rye crackers. I was so happy spreading soft brown butter on the seed-packed Danish rye that I probably wouldn’t have minded had the meal stopped right there.  The climax of the eight-course menu is a stunning imitation of nature that sets yolks of sea-buckthorn curd inside eggs made of goat cheese parfait; snowflakes of yogurt foam dust a bird’s nest of honeyed tuile strands. Eating the dessert called “chocolate and texture” is like sneaking into a box of leftover chocolate cake and quietly spooning up all the crumbs and frosting before anyone notices.  In short, Ms. Bengtsson’s food is wonderful. I only wish there were a little less stiffness involved in eating it.  Aquavit is, among other things, a showroom for the graceful curves of Scandinavian design, from Erik Bagger’s elegant flatware to Arne Jacobsen’s swooping egg chairs. But one night, as the meal rounded the corner into its third hour, my lower back began to understand that the spindly armchairs were not necessarily conceived with the rigors of 21st-century tasting menus in mind. My dining companion was perched in an uncomfortable yoga pose because her banquette cushions were too far from the table for her to sit back and relax. Lumbar support wouldn’t be a major issue if Aquavit were not so eager to push the longer menus. The choices on the three-course prix fixe are limited, and servers like to say that the eight-course menu provides the fullest expression of the chef’s creativity, or something like that. Whatever the exact words, they were always spoken as if the meaning of life were about to be revealed.  At times the servers had the somber expressions and postures you’d see at a funeral — on the pallbearers, if not the deceased. This becomes unnerving when they stand in a row at the back of the dining room, all dressed in black. Once I could have sworn I heard a captain snap his heels together as he stood at attention, like Colonel Klink. My preliminary diagnosis is Michelinitis, an excessive stiffness caused by a desire to get or keep Michelin stars. Aquavit has two now, and I worry that if it ever gets to three, the servers will have been replaced with wax figures. But life still breaks through often enough. Sarah Blau, the beverage director, is natural and confident, and she sifts through an abundance of fine choices on the wine list. And the lounge, one of the most civilized harbors in Midtown, has a relaxed tone that the dining room could stand more of. I’d almost suggest turning the bar into a tasting-menu counter if it weren’t such a fine place to chase Swedish meatballs with one of the many so-called aquavits that are really house-infused vodkas. Both have been fixtures for years, holding steady in a restaurant that in many ways seems to be getting younger all the time.",Aquavit in Midtown,"['cheer', 'aquavit', 'power', 'defy', 'force',

157,Javelina,0 star,2015-05-19,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/20/dining/restaurant-review-javelina-in-gramercy-park.html,Gramercy Park,"I like Texans. I love their food and their music and their boots. I admire their ability to tame landscapes that are hostile to human life. I respect how quick they are to stick up for their state and its culture. In fact, I may be slightly afraid of Texans. I have no desire to mess with them. I can read the bumper stickers. Reviewing Javelina, which bills itself as “New York’s first authentic Tex-Mex restaurant,” may have presented me with an unusual conflict of interest. My interest in telling the truth about this establishment could come into conflict with my interest in not having my butt kicked by angry Texans. What if something I didn’t like at Javelina turned out to be the very thing that Texans most love about authentic Tex-Mex? It may get in the way of my earnest desire for my next trip to Texas to be a safe and peaceful one. Lucky for me, I have only good things to say about Javelina. Javelina, near Union Square, is a godsend for anybody who loves to eat before 6 p.m. or after 9:30 p.m.; since opening two months ago, the restaurant has been talked up so much in the press that those are usually the only reservation times available, even if you book a week or two ahead. You may worry that at those hours the dining room would be depressingly quiet, but that’s not the case. Javelina’s 58 seats always seem to be taken by large groups of people shouting with youthful animation. It always sounds as if somebody were telling a woman at the far end of the table that he had just found $1,000 under the menu, and the woman were shouting back that Ryan Gosling had just texted and he’s coming to the restaurant in, like, five minutes! How anybody gets drunk enough to act this way is one of several fun Javelina mysteries to keep you entertained. Fresh or frozen, the margaritas have a slight chemical taste that I was thankful for because it tended to keep my own alcohol intake to near-Mormon levels. I also stayed alert and sober when faced with the Tijuana Manhattan, made with tequila in the place of whiskey and served in a rocks glass with no ice at all, even though it was the temperature of a freshly killed snake. While bartenders elsewhere have become insufferable bores on the subjects of ice and proper shaking techniques, the ones at Javelina are refreshingly free of such pretension. Even the water is sometimes served at room temperature.  One night, the bar made me a Paloma in a pint glass, while a woman at my table got her Paloma in a much smaller glass. Everybody knows women drink less than men, so we appreciated the thoughtfulness. To avoid making her self-conscious, I suppose, the restaurant even charged us both the same amount, $13. At most restaurants, you are served what you ask for so routinely that your eyes glaze over with boredom. Javelina does not fall into the trap of dull predictability. One night after I left, I realized the guacamole I’d ordered had never arrived; it’s not every restaurant that gives you something to think about on your way home. Meanwhile, people at the next table were presented with a dish they insisted they hadn’t asked for. “You didn’t order brisket?” the server asked, keeping up the playful spirit.  One of Javelina’s calling cards, queso, is usually suggested by the servers when taking orders. Occasionally this Tex-Mex cheese fondue is served hot, but more often it arrives lukewarm, which prevents trips to the emergency room. The cooler temperature offers the added benefit of allowing a latex-like film to congeal on top, which provides an interesting contrast in texture with the liquefied cheese below.  Queso is short for chile con queso, so named for the hot peppers that are stirred into the melted cheese. Javelina’s traditional yellow queso is supposed to be flavored with serranos, while a white version is said to come with both jalapeños and roasted poblanos. But spicy food can be hard for many people to digest, so I am relieved to report that both colors are quite bland.  A premium queso called the Bob Armstrong does have some flavor: It tastes like ground beef, which in fact it contains, along with guacamole and chopped tomatoes. The menu said that another loaded queso, the Mag Mud, was supplemented with black beans. I didn’t see them, so I probed the cheese with tortilla chips, digging way down to the bottom. Black beans shouldn’t be easy to lose in a bowl of white cheese. Where were they? About five minutes later, a server placed a bowl of beans on the table. “This is supposed to go with the queso,” he said. Mystery solved! The chef is Richard Caruso, and his menu looks unmanageably long, but fortunately only a few items on it are worth getting. Puffy tacos, a San Antonio specialty, come out well, with bits of pork shoulder and other taco toppings piled into a deep-fried corn tortilla, crisp outside and soft in the middle. The steak enchiladas are good, too, with a mouthwatering sour-cream sauce all around them. The cilantro-cream gravy around mahi-mahi is comfortingly thick and rich, and the fajitas are just what you’d expect them to be, with one difference: The flour tortillas are outstanding. Every time I went to Javelina, in fact, those flour tortillas were the best thing on the table. Tender, yielding, pressed in the kitchen and freshly browned on a comal, they are both thicker and lighter than the kind most places use as packing tape to seal up burritos. They are so good that if you happen to accidentally order the tacos filled with pale, cold brisket that tastes more like boiled pork than beef, you can simply tear off chunks of the tortilla and eat them on their own. Corn tortillas are used in the enchiladas de Tejas, and they really made me appreciate how good the other tortillas are, because these are as stiff as a new pair of jeans. They were filled with equally sturdy melted cheese and blanketed with a chile sauce that would make a wonderful way for Mexican cooking teachers to show students what happens when you try to toast dried chiles and end up burning them instead. There is no dessert menu, so every table is supposed to get a plate of sopaipillas, on the house. I got mine once out of three visits, just the right ratio to bring a tremor of anticipation to the end of the meal.  The best news of all, for anybody who hates waiting around to settle the tab: There is no need to ask for the check. It is dropped without warning as soon as the last dirty plate has been cleared, and sometimes even earlier.",Javelina in Gramercy Park,"['like', 'texan', 'love', 'music', 'boot', 'admire', 'ability',

158,Mu Ramen,★★,2015-05-05,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/06/dining/restaurant-review-mu-ramen-in-long-island-city-queens.html,Long Island City,"Before telling you how impressed I am by the new Mu Ramen in Long Island City, Queens, I want to clear up my role in the demise of the first Mu Ramen. Last March, I wrote an article about New York’s quickly diversifying ramen landscape. One place I discussed was Mu Ramen, which had found a temporary home operating after-hours inside a bagel shop. Almost as an afterthought, I made a list of the 10 ramen bowls I had enjoyed the most during my reporting, putting Mu’s suave and creamy tonkotsu at the top.  The article and the list appeared online on a Tuesday afternoon. On Wednesday morning, Mu Ramen canceled all future appearances, saying it had been deluged with requests for reservations. Immediately, I was blamed in some quarters for killing the pop-up. One person on Twitter, accusing me of stoking a demand that the place could not handle, went so far as to call me a “herb.”  If I knew how to make money, I wouldn’t work for a newspaper. Still, I had a sense that this is not how capitalism works. Last week, Joshua Smookler, Mu Ramen’s chef and its owner, told me “the real reason” he had decamped from the bagel shop. “I was scared of the government finding out what we were doing,” he said, even though he believed it was legal, “and was afraid that would have an effect on our doing a brick-and-mortar.”  He had just signed a lease on the current site, and he and his wife, Heidy He, wanted to concentrate on getting it ready. Others can judge whether that makes me a card-carrying herb. For my part, I’m just happy to report that the new, bagel-free Mu Ramen is a great place to smooth over any hard feelings caused by its nine-month absence.  Of all the restaurants in the city where you are expected to make loud slurping noises while you eat, Mu may be the most civilized. The 22 seats half-fill a space that could easily hold more, and if you have to wait for one of them (after an experiment with reservations, the place is now first come first served, except for the tasting menus that will begin later this month), the deep built-in benches by the front door are a pleasant change from, say, the steps in front of Totto Ramen in Hell’s Kitchen. Six of the seats face a counter. The rest surround three slabs of reclaimed wood. These communal tables touch but don’t quite line up, creating little pockets of semi-intimacy, along with a sense of roominess. Running along the ceiling are thin wood slats bent into waves. They look like noodles swimming out of the kitchen. Before you face down the ramen, the appetizers may call your name; they definitely called mine. One of the best things to eat at Mu comes not from the streets of Tokyo, where Mr. Smookler has never been, but from his apartment, where he and his wife steam mussels when friends come for dinner. At the restaurant, he cooks clams instead, spooning a hypnotically aromatic saffron aioli over them. Then the dish takes a leap that makes no sense until you try it: You pick up a clam and scoop up some Vietnamese nuoc cham with the shell. Why the flowery musk of saffron reacts so well to lime and fish sauce I cannot say. Every clam was a fresh surprise and a fresh mystery. He also makes a tender, airy corn pancake, squirts some foie-gras-fortified maple syrup over it, then covers it with smoked trout. It’s wonderful, especially if you like the sneaky feeling of eating breakfast at night. The only Japanese thing about it, other than the flyingfish roe dotting the trout, is the name. Mr. Smookler calls it an “okonomiyaki” (quotation marks his). For a fuller immersion in Japanese flavors, try the chirashi variant called U&I, named for the uni and ikura that are mounded with spicy raw tuna over sushi rice. U&I is far from groundbreaking, which does not at all detract from its pleasure. But the two times I tried the fried chicken wings stuffed with foie gras and brioche, they did not stop traffic, which they are clearly meant to do. The crust and meat were superb, but the stuffing was dull, and the quince paste that might have brought it into relief was bunched up at one end of the wing.  Mr. Smookler trained in the meticulous rigor of Per Se’s kitchen, and his gift, those wings notwithstanding, is his Keller-like drive to find a better way. This usually means a harder and more costly way. When his supply of pork for tonkotsu broth suddenly dried up last year, he went to the Midwest and persuaded nearly 40 farmers who raise Berkshire hogs to start a cooperative. Then he arranged for a small slaughterhouse to butcher the four cuts of pork he wanted and ship them to Long Island City, where he would cook 120 pounds of bones at a raging boil for most of a day. This is a long way to go for a bowl of soup. (Metaphorically speaking, it is also a long journey for Mr. Smookler, who was born in South Korea and raised in New York as an Orthodox Jew.) If $15 seems a fair price for those ingredients, the conviction only grows once you start eating.  Like all of Mu Ramen’s broths, the tonkotsu has a flavor both deep and long, with extraordinary balance and a rounded profile that has no jarring, gamy edges. Without being greasy, it’s gorgeously full-bodied and almost chewy; as you wind the noodles into your mouth, the droplets that cling to them feel like heavy cream. The flavor is very good, but it’s the texture that can rock you back on your three-legged stool. Mr. Smookler pulls a similar consistency out of boiled beef bones, veal bones and oxtails for the soup he calls Mu Ramen. He drew the inspiration for the stock from the Korean dish seolleongtang. For the toppings, he went to the other side of his upbringing. He corns beef brisket, brines cucumber ribbons and shaves raw cabbage into threads that cook when they hit the bowl. The half-sour pickles are juicy and refreshing, and at the same time they transport you to your favorite delicatessen. More meetings with more farmers produced the chicken skin, feet and giblets that go into the shoyu ramen that just strutted onto the menu. The broth is another full-bodied knockout, and the chicken flavor is pure and intense.  The weightiest, richest possible broth is not necessarily the ramen ideal. Ramen Lab, on Kenmare Street in Manhattan, makes a more traditional shoyu with a chicken broth that is very pure but more restrained than Mr. Smooker’s, so it blends with the soy more willingly. Mr. Smookler’s ramen is so compelling in part because it’s an exception. My praise for it should not be taken as a signal to other chefs to try to make soups as robustly silky as his. Speaking of praise, if I had it all to do over again, would I still tell the world how much I admire Mu Ramen? Do I feel the same way now? Absolutely.","Mu Ramen in Long Island City, Queens","['telling', 'impressed', 'mu', 'ramen', 'long', 'island', 'city', 'queen', 'clear', 'role', 'demise', 'mu', 'ramen', 'last', 'march', 'wrote',

159,Minton’s,★,2015-04-28,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/dining/restaurant-review-mintons-in-harlem.html,Harlem,"The revolution ran on grits, ham hocks, ribs, black-eyed peas and biscuits. When he opened Minton’s Playhouse in Harlem in 1940, Henry Minton, the first black delegate to the local musicians’ union, knew that jazz players were frequently in need of a meal and a place to give their instruments a workout. He gave them both. Minton’s extended a tricky welcome to its jam sessions: Musicians could eat free soul food and take a solo as long as they could keep up with the house band, anchored by Thelonious Monk and Kenny Clarke. (The house band!) This gang of nonconformists delighted in bizarre chord progressions, obscure keys and melodies that ran upside down.  Their bucking-bronco tactics threw some musicians right off the stage. The ones who stayed put included Dizzy Gillespie, Coleman Hawkins, Don Byas, a Juilliard student named Miles Davis and Charlie Parker, who had a notable ability to put away fried chicken. Writing in Esquire years later, Ralph Ellison described Minton’s Playhouse as “a musical dueling ground,” and quoted a bartender who remembered when “Lester Young and Ben Webster used to tie up in battle like dogs in the road.” The radical sounds that came out of the duels at Minton’s and a few other clubs made a sharp break with the swing of the big-band era and formed a new style that would be called bebop.  When assessing the role that Henry Minton’s soul food played in the birth of bebop, it is worth keeping in mind that most of the testimonials to it come to us from hungry jazz musicians whose meals were on the house. Still, African-American music and cooking were a potent mix at Minton’s once, and this was one reason to pay attention to the revival of Minton’s as a jazz supper club that opened 18 months ago.  Another reason came along in November, when Joseph Johnson, known as J J, took over as chef de cuisine after making a name for himself at Minton’s sister restaurant next door, the Cecil. And a third, highly compelling reason takes the form of Mr. Johnson’s Lowcountry gumbo. At the bottom of the bowl are broken grains of Carolina rice, with its irreplaceable flavor. The meat is smoked chicken and the seafood is wild shrimp, as tender and sweet as you could hope for. Two shrimp lie on top, crisscrossed, and their heads are still on. The base that holds it all together tastes of shellfish and tomato, of course, but a deep, mysterious oceanic note lurks down there. It comes from dried shrimp, and it makes for a haunting bowl of gumbo. Mr. Johnson does some bold, original cooking at Minton’s. There are also dishes, particularly some appetizers, that could use more verve, and others that can go seriously out of tune when the kitchen has an off night. In the face of that unpredictability, the success of dinner at Minton’s depends on how much you like to hear jazz musicians skittering around a tune, toying with a rhythm, tying and untying knots of harmony.  If your ears don’t bend that way, you have no business paying the cover charge at Minton’s. If they do, I don’t know a better place in the city to get them reshaped while you eat. The place is extremely welcoming, and manages an old-fashioned graciousness without strain. A dress code for men urges but doesn’t positively demand jackets; the website boils the advice down to three words: “Dress Sharp Gents.”  No customer outsharps the front of the house, though. Male servers wear black bow ties and vests, while the managerial types favor tailored suits and pocket squares. One of these, spotting a recently drained cocktail glass on our table, stopped short in mock indignation. “This is empty. This is an outrage!” he said, and came back in a minute with a freshly mixed drink. The tables are lined up along walls hung with cocoa-toned curtains and framed photographs of Billie Holiday and other innovators, in black and white. At one end of the room are the stage and the only item from the original Minton’s that wasn’t ruined by water used to put out a fire upstairs decades ago: a 1948 mural of a late-night jam session in a small bedroom lighted by a kerosene lamp. On the brass bed, a woman in a red dress has passed out, face down. If she ever comes to, she may want to fortify herself with a plate of warm biscuits and whipped butter sweetened with sorghum and vanilla. Or, if she’s lucky, the kitchen will send out some hush puppies, with black-eyed peas and pickled okra mashed into the cornmeal. Black-eyed peas are a refrain in the kitchen; lightly fried, they sit alongside the crab cake appetizer, an excellent deviled version, racy with lemon juice and mustard. When she is firmly on the ground again, I’d suggest the smoked pork chop with a lightly candied glaze of pralines and a scoop of bourbon yams. Mr. Johnson works out his menus with Minton’s executive chef, Alexander Smalls. Both men are African-American, as are the restaurant’s principal owner, Richard Parsons, and pastry chef, Mame Sow. Mr. Smalls, a South Carolina native, is a particular exponent of Lowcountry cuisine, which carries lasting imprints of West African and Caribbean cooking. There are direct quotations from South Carolina, like smooth she-crab soup or the crab and shrimp on fat, fluffy grains of grits. And there are riffs on the African theme, including collards cooked so they keep some of their crunch and dressed with a spiced peanut sauce. It’s just a side dish, but I haven’t stopped thinking about it. The less said about the kitchen’s weakest night, the better. I’ll just express my doubts that octopus and unripe strawberries were meant to be joined in ice-cold union, along with my strong feeling that tiny, dense, sweet corn muffins are neither “popovers” nor a good thing to eat alongside smoked trout, and leave it at that.  What matters is that we left the table happy, an unusual outcome after a rocky meal. Ms. Sow’s desserts helped, especially her elegant baked alaska with a foundation of graham cracker cake and a filling of smoked and toasted marshmallow ice cream — s’mores with a Dress Sharp attitude. So did the young musicians working out nuanced, intricate compositions in this sophisticated Harlem room. When you hear Harlem, you picture one of two places: the great hive of African-American ideas and culture that flourished and disappeared, like Atlantis, or the modern neighborhood of wine bars, construction cranes and million-dollar apartments. The two Harlems meet at Minton’s when a serious band is onstage and gumbo is on the table.",Minton’s in Harlem,"['revolution', 'ran', 'grit', 'ham', 'hock', 'rib', 'blackeyed', 'pea', 'biscuit',

160,Santina,★★,2015-04-21,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/22/dining/restaurant-review-santina-in-the-meatpacking-district.html,Meatpacking District,"The calendar said January when Santina opened early this year. The temperature outside hovered just above freezing. That said January, too.  But almost nothing inside did. Santina’s new glass-box building sits under the High Line like an unwisely located greenhouse, but oranges grew on the branches of a little tree, potted palms sat in the corners, heliconia and other tropical flowers gushed from glazed urns above the bar. Servers wore jelly-bean-colored polo shirts and slim-waisted chinos, like Dean Martin reaching for his 9-iron at Pebble Beach.  People were sharing fritto misto, as crisp and fresh as any in town, and pulling apart multicolored bouquets of crunchy raw vegetables radiating from bowls of chipped ice. They were sipping cocktails through straws stuck into pineapple mugs, as if on a Waikiki honeymoon. Even when the front doors opened, the building is so painstakingly designed by the architect Renzo Piano (with the firm Beyer Blinder Belle) that its vestibule kept the cold winds of the meatpacking district from invading the dining room. Inside Santina, it was summer in January. It’s summer there now, and unless the landlord turns off the heat, it will still be summer when Christmas gets here.  Almost all the food at Santina pulses with the bright, refreshing flavors we crave in hot weather and, it turns out, in other months, too: jolts of chiles, sparks of citrus. Fresh herbs are tossed around frequently and enthusiastically. Chives, mint and basil turn a wonderfully gentle tomato-free minestrone garden-green; Thai basil leaves are flattened over the mint-and-parsley salsa verde applied to a juicy, sweet grilled porgy; tortellini sorrentina (delicate eggy pasta sheets stuffed with soft sheep’s milk ricotta) are surrounded by raw marinara sauce and some olive oil mixed liberally with, what else, fresh herbs. Individually, none of Santina’s tricks are really new, but the kitchen throws them all together in ways that are fun, energizing and mood-altering. Santina comes to us from Mario Carbone, Rich Torrisi and Jeff Zalaznick, busy restaurateurs who somehow find the time to endow each place they open with the thematic complexity of a Paul Thomas Anderson movie. The food, they have said, is coastal Italian, in part because the corner of Washington and Gansevoort Streets where the restaurant sits used to be shoreline.  The three restaurateurs take their concepts further than anybody else in New York, though. They have elaborated the coastal-seafood notion to the point of seeing Santina as a seafood restaurant in an Italian beach town somewhere, maybe along the Italian Riviera during the 1950s or ’60s. This gets them to the palm trees and the servers’ resort-wear costumes. It also inspires a hilarious playlist, mixing sambas and cha-chas (Remember how the same Perez Prado tune pursued Marcello Mastroianni in “La Dolce Vita” wherever he went, even at the seaside village by Fiumicino?) and period Italian pop tunes from singers including Fred Buscaglione, the gangster impersonator who always seemed to get gunned down by a vengeful woman in the last verse.  Mr. Carbone, who leads the kitchen with Dan Haar, the chef de cuisine, has said that the restaurant is named after his Sicilian grandmother. But Liguria plays a bigger role in the kitchen, providing pistou and the chickpea pancake, called a cecina, crisp on top with a soft white underbelly, ready to be spread with crushed, exuberantly seasoned avocados or an excellent salad of tiny shrimp or cold cubes of raw tuna humming with herbs and Calabrian chiles.  The Carbone-Torrisi-Zalaznick team doesn’t let its themes get in the way of a fun idea, though. The bartenders stock plenty of Italian aperitifs for their excellent run of cocktails, but they also let their grass skirts sway to the ukulele strains of tiki drinks in concoctions like the pineapple-and-banana-flavored Manganelli punch. While Italian seafood dominates the main courses, the grilled chicken comes in a sensational robust guajillo sauce that is as Ligurian as Rand Paul.  These are not the kinds of two-ingredient recipes that you would throw together when it’s too hot to cook. It’s fairly complex stuff, and occasionally a heavy hand gets the better of the kitchen and the summer sun turns oppressive. Blue crab meat with spaghetti became mired in an oily glop of tomato sauce, and excess pork fat dragged down a bowl of warm rice salad tossed with guanciale and heaps of black pepper. Sea bass Agrigento, though cooked just right and buoyed by herbs and orange sections, sank under suffocating amounts of red peppers.  Josh Ber’s desserts, on the other hand, almost seem underthought. Filling three cannoli with cream in the Italian-flag colors — green pistachio, white coconut and red maraschino cherry — is a cute idea, but the pastry tubes are limp. So is the tart shell that’s filled with a pond of dark, rich pudding to make a chocolate diplomatico; it’s thin without being crisp. All the desserts are gluten-free, a worthwhile goal, but the substitutions entail more sacrifice than they probably should. The meringue puff topped with lime custard is very good, but it could use company. By the end of the meal, though, if the noise ricocheting off the glass walls hasn’t gotten to you, you’re likely to be in a frame of mind that isn’t much bothered by limp pastry. Most of the food, particularly toward the top of the menu, is charming and playful in a way that’s hard to fight. The rice-salad concept applied to shrimp zingara is a lively, spicy hit. Beyond seafood, Santina has a very winning way with vegetables. Even when it stoops to using seasonal produce, it gives them a warm-weather brightness. Butternut squash discs, lightly scorched to char and soften their edges, get a topping of cracked pink peppercorns, pumpkinseeds and honey agrodolce that almost turns them into candy. Even the kale and sunchoke salad, with pomegranate capsules strewn around like buckshot, tastes cheerful. Santina’s eternal sunshine is a kind of rebuke to dogmatic seasonality. It feels like an answer from Mr. Carbone, Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Zalaznick to the wintry Scandinavian visions that are now in fashion; to the chefs whose bleak, gnarled plates of sunchokes look like scenery left over from one of Ingmar Bergman’s gloomier excursions. If the people at Santina ever meet Death on the beach, they’re ready to kick sand on his blanket and challenge him to a game of volleyball.",Santina in the Meatpacking District,"['calendar',

161,Estiatorio Milos,★,2015-04-07,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/08/dining/restaurant-reviews-limani-and-estiatorio-milos-in-midtown.html,Midtown,"After a long and grueling winter, nothing lifts the spirits in springtime quite like an old-fashioned fish fight.  Limani opened in November around the corner from the Rockefeller Center skating rink. Its menu is Greek, and its strength is formidably expensive seafood, which up until the moment it is laid on the grill can be found spread out on a small mountain of ice at the edge of the open kitchen. The modern dining room subliminally evokes the Aegean and has space for nearly 200 people at tables draped with white cloths.  It all sounds peaceful enough. But four blocks away is Estiatorio Milos, which has operated on West 55th Street since 1997. It serves Greek food with a strong emphasis on formidably expensive seafood, which is displayed on a bed of ice near the open kitchen. The décor is modern and suggests the Aegean, the tablecloths are white, and there are easily enough chairs for 150.  You might write this off to an uncanny coincidence if you didn’t know that this Milos is a branch of one in Montreal and that this Limani is a branch of one in Roslyn, N.Y., whose founding manager worked in the Milos company for 16 years. The first chef in Roslyn was the original chef at Milos in New York. The owners have kept up traditions in Manhattan. Their kitchen is in the hands of M. J. Alam, who used to be the executive chef at Milos. Release the spiny lobsters: We have a fish fight.  By longstanding tradition, a fish fight needs a referee. So, to begin with the most crucial item: As a rule, the array and quality of seafood at both establishments can give a seafood lover a happy case of vertigo. American standards like red snapper, bigeye tuna and black sea bass can be had, but there are far cheaper places to eat the standards. You go to Limani or Milos for creatures that circulate in the Mediterranean and the eastern Atlantic and generally migrate to New York only when somebody buys them a plane ticket. Among other species, both restaurants recently had the firm-fleshed John Dory, with its false eye staring out from its flank; rascasse, or scorpion fish, mild tasting and a traditional component of bouillabaisse; lavraki, or branzino, long and silvery and delicately sweet; and barbouni, or red mullet, a small fish whose full flavor is out of proportion to its size.  Even more luxurious are the shellfish: firm and exquisitely flavored langoustines; spiny lobsters the size of a leg of lamb, with an intense taste that suggests a wild-game cousin of langoustines; live scallops, presented on the half shell with the slightly chewy, frilly band of mantle; and the heart-stoppingly sweet and supple red shrimp called carabineiros. Both restaurants serve red shrimp with a glass of sherry for the heads, although Milos suggests dunking the heads before sucking out the fat, while Limani advocates pouring the wine into the head and knocking it back, fat and all, like a Jägermeister shot.  In a perfect world, I would eat like this three times a week, with no regrets and no plaque in my arteries. In Midtown, which is still striving for perfection, a life like that would cost buckets of money.  Limani is the cheaper restaurant, both in the menu prices and in the fish, which is sold by weight before cleaning. It charged me $85 a pound for those red shrimp, or about $17.50 each. Milos gave them to me for $95 a pound. Barbouni was $43 a pound at Limani and $61.50 at Milos.  Limani is nobody’s idea of a cheap night out, but the somewhat less fearsome seafood prices are a firm point in its favor. And it was only at Milos that I was served a fish that had stayed slightly too long on the flames, a whole fagri costing just over $80. It was also Milos that let scorched oil from the grill mar the lush taste of a $270 spiny lobster. On the rest of the menu, Limani’s prices are merely expensive, while the ones at Milos read like a long series of typographical errors. The French fries are certainly worth $8, and by Manhattan standards $49 isn’t out of line for three meaty, tender, very good double-cut lamb chops. But why $32 for a Greek salad, even if it had enough juicy, red, almost-summery tomatoes and creamy feta for four? And while the signature appetizer, a stack of fried zucchini and eggplant over a mound of tzatziki, was far lighter and more delicate than Limani’s copycat version, paying $33 sucked the fun out of it. Prices seem to have doubled at least since 1997, when Ruth Reichl gave Milos two stars in its last New York Times review. Today, considering what happened to the fagri and spiny lobster, one star is more appropriate.  But here things get complicated. Limani doesn’t always duplicate its finesse at the grill throughout the kitchen. Gigante beans there were stewed in a tomato sauce that might have passed for canned soup. Desserts, except for a thick slab of yogurt with excellent honey or the fried dough balls rolled in cinnamon and honey syrup, called loukoumades, were not hard to pass up. At lunch, a tuna burger seemed determined to leave no impression at all, and a chicken kebab had me looking out the windows for the nearest halal cart. The afternoon was saved by an ideally cooked dorade royale. If money is not at the top of your pile of worries, or if you’ll move it to the bottom of the pile for red shrimp and John Dory on the grill, then the choice between Limani and Milos may come down to style.  Milos’s décor is a one-of-a-kind blend of exposed structural columns in bare concrete and weathered Greek artifacts, including amphorae big enough to hide a pair of rodeo clowns. The split-level dining room is loud, lively and full of people who act like regulars. Service is practiced, and can be charming. A few years ago, when I was seated between a pillar and a low concrete wall, a server popped up on the other side of the wall and said with a winning smile, “You have my favorite table!” Limani, which in nearly every other respect swims in Milos’s wake, darts off on its own in the interior-design department. The floor of the dining room is done in blinding white marble, and the leather seats are a softer white. In the center is an infinity pool that keeps changing from blue to violet, the colors glinting off the small metal fish on a mobile that hangs in a double helix from the ceiling overhead. Some people will look at it and see a Greek fishing town taken over by millionaires. I saw South Beach.  By now, though, readers who give any thought to their dinner budgets have no doubt decided to run screaming from Midtown and head straight for Astoria, Queens. For starters, let me suggest Astoria Seafood, which is like Limani or Milos but with no luxuries, fewer kinds of fish and check totals that don’t rival the round-trip fare to Athens.

162,Little Park,★★,2015-03-24,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/25/dining/restaurant-review-little-park-in-tribeca.html,TriBeCa,"It is as colorful and otherworldly as a coral reef, this row of fried cauliflower knobs in purple, ivory and marigold yellow. Wrapping each floret is a pale-gold skin of batter. It’s almost invisible, but you feel it as you bite, its soft snap reinforced by the full-on crunch of chopped almonds. Poached before it is fried, the cauliflower is nicely salted all the way down to its tender core, but it is still cauliflower, so it needs a little support. This is supplied by a lush green tomatillo, pistachio and fresh herb sauce that gets in a quick, peppery jab before it signs off. Where does this dish come from? In the proximate sense, it is from Andrew Carmellini’s latest restaurant, Little Park, inside the Smyth hotel in TriBeCa. The ultimate inspiration, though — where is that from? The batter is related to tempura, and I think I might have caught the rustle of Mexico in the sauce. Beyond that, it is hard to say. The fried cauliflower seems to be one of those dishes that happen when a chef’s imagination is allowed to roam. Mr. Carmellini once dreamed of owning an Italian, a French and an American restaurant. In less than four years, starting with Locanda Verde in 2009, he and his partners built all three. Then, after the Dutch and Lafayette, he knocked out a fourth, a drop-in pasta place called Bar Primi that seemed to come together in less time than it takes the rest of us to watch a cat video on Facebook.  Since becoming his own boss, in other words, Mr. Carmellini has cooked in and around the traditions of one country or another. At Little Park, he and his chef de cuisine, Min Kong, the executive sous chef at Carbone until last year, are working out their ideas from scratch. This may be why the best dishes there seem more fresh, natural and intuitive than what’s on his other menus and why Little Park has less in common with Locanda Verde than it does with forward-leaning places like Estela or even the modern-Mexican Cosme. It is Mr. Carmellini’s most contemporary restaurant. In a sense, it’s his first. In the modern fashion, most dishes are of roughly the same size and complexity. There are no second-class ingredients and almost no side dishes. The vegetables are as intriguing as the animals on plates, like steamed black bass with bracingly vinegared lentils or the intensely beefy hanger steak under broccoli whose thin stems had been judiciously charred.  Beets are, insistently, the point of the earthy and velvety risotto made from them, although crème fraîche and goat cheese do put extra wiggle in its walk. Flowers and shaved bull’s-eyes of Chioggia beets on top keep the shockingly red plate from looking like a crime scene. It’s a lucky carrot that ends up in Ms. Kong’s kitchen; rarely is the vegetable lavished with so much attention. Some are roasted to a smoky sweetness, some are juiced and whipped into an airy orange custard, and still more are slivered into ribbons. All are flattered by the molasses notes in sticky black garlic and by a patch of cocoa nibs and toasted crumbs. At lunch, Mr. Carmellini and Ms. Kong send a stunning little sandwich down the runway, a celery root schnitzel with creamy, incisive mustard and apple-brussels sprout slaw on a sesame-seed bun. The celery root is not the most flavorful I’ve had, but it is soft in all the right ways, augmented by generous bookends of golden breading. I ate one and wanted another. Another small marvel: the first worthwhile spaghetti squash I’ve ever met. It was baked with garlic and a stealthy dose of lobster butter and upstaged the protein it was meant to support, half of a tiny lobster tail that wasn’t warm enough to melt the herb butter slapped on top.  There was other evidence of inattentiveness, like the oily mop of oversauced whole-wheat spaghetti with cabbage and red wattle pork. (The menu calls the poor hog “red waddle.” No doubt it was a large animal, but why add insult to injury?) Little Park’s servers also push the popular contemporary con that small plates are meant for sharing. As one of my dinner guests remarked, “That’s like saying: ‘This is a studio apartment. It’s perfect for a family.’ ” I know I wanted more than one of the frilly kale-filled ravioli sitting on a sauce of sweet roasted winter squash.  In most other ways, though, servers are poised and helpful. They are quick to demystify the peculiar cocktails, like the gin sour dusted with beet powder, and the even more peculiar wine list. Josh Nadel, the beverage director for Mr. Carmellini’s restaurant group, has divided bottles by topography (“river valleys,” “lakes and slopes,” “mountains and terraces”). This is an illuminating way to learn about viticulture, but it’s a confusing way to find a red that goes with duck. Additional subdivisions into light-, medium- and full-bodied are easier to grasp. A bit of explanation may also be required with some of Jennifer Luk’s desserts. What is frozen lemon fluff? It’s a delicious white block of dense citrus meringue around which orange sections and candied ginger can happily revolve. How about cinnamon toast ice cream? It’s something like crushed Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal sprinkled over ice cream that tastes like sweet bread, and it’s as charming as it sounds. As for the “winter sundae” of apple and beer, it’s slightly more charming than it sounds, but maybe not quite enough more.  When you think of Mr. Carmellini’s restaurants, quiet and civility are not the first qualities that come to mind. Little Park has them. Desert-toned fabrics seem to soak up excess noise in a dining room designed by Gachot Studios that walks the line between midcentury chic and expense-account bland. Anyone who has faced down the unwelcoming committee at the door of Locanda Verde, or showed up on time at Lafayette only to be sent to the bar, or waited on the Bowery to get into Bar Primi, will appreciate the more hospitable greeting at Little Park. Some of my guests, arriving early for a 9 p.m. table, were already seated when I showed up. The calm atmosphere may be the least fashionable thing about Little Park.",Little Park in TriBeCa,"['colorful', 'otherworldly', 'coral', 'reef', 'row', 'fried', 'cauliflower', 'knob', 'purple',

163,Eleven Madison Park,★★★,2015-03-17,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/18/dining/restaurant-review-eleven-madison-park-in-midtown-south.html,Midtown South,"Can a restaurant still succeed when it fails at what it says it wants to do?  This is not a question critics ask every day. But then the place in question, Eleven Madison Park, is not a restaurant where most of us would or could eat every day.  This, in fact, is one of the sticky issues raised by the drastic changes its two driving spirits, Daniel Humm and Will Guidara, have made since its last review in The New York Times, in 2009. Back then, when Frank Bruni promoted it to four stars from three, most customers still selected three courses from Mr. Humm’s menu at a cost of $88. Today, lunch or dinner is $225 for more than a dozen courses. All but two are typically chosen by the kitchen. A few days in advance of a recent reservation, the head maître d’hotel, Justin Roller, sent an email warning, “Our tasting menu lasts approximately three and a half hours, so please plan your day accordingly.” The last time I got a message like that, it was from my doctor, shortly before my colonoscopy. Meals at Eleven Madison now cost more, take longer and offer less variety from one week to the next. As might have been predicted, this took the restaurant out of regular rotation for many locals. Perhaps to make up for the loss of actual New Yorkers in the dining room, Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara turned the restaurant into a theme park about the city. In its very early days in 2012, the result was the most ridiculous meal I’ve ever had.  Nearly every course began with a clunky, humorless history lesson about steakhouses, appetizing stores, clambakes, cheesecakes and even Times Square scam artists. The patter overshadowed and undermined the food. Notably, it had no voice, in a city full of them. “Three-card monte is now illegal, but along the same lines, we had a deck of cards made for us,” my server recited, before doing a magic trick. I never figured out how it was done, but the greater mystery was just why a restaurant charging hundreds of dollars for such kitsch would want to lecture diners about “hustlers and scammers.”  Some of this gab has been dropped, but not all. Even now, when any ingredient is grown in New York State, someone is sure to point it out. Hang on, New York has farms? And chefs can cook their stuff just like the ingredients I get at the supermarket? Wait, I need to write this down. Constantly mentioning the region only underlines the shallowness of Eleven Madison Park’s approach to it. (A server announced that the oysters grew “upstate” in Greenport, N.Y., which will be news to Long Islanders.) Mr. Humm doesn’t dig down into the natural and cultivated landscape of his region the way, say, Christopher Kostow, Sean Brock and Dan Barber do. He practices entry-level locavorism. Objections like this buzzed before my eyes so insistently that at times they blinded me to what was going on in the soaring Art Deco space across from Madison Square Park. Which was: a roomful of people almost goofy with happiness. The woman dining alone with her camera shyly accepting an invitation into the vast and gleaming kitchen for a special course prepared a few inches in front of her; the couple watching, as if seeing their first sunrise, a sommelier who removed a cork by melting the bottle’s neck with red-hot tongs; the guests at my table going limp as they tasted a crazily good braised pork collar and cheek in a dark sauce that was like pig marmalade; and finally even me, the overthinking picker of nits and finder of faults. Under the restaurant’s relentless, skillful campaign to spread joy, I gave in.  What Eleven Madison feeds your intellect can have the value of junk food, but what it feeds your mouth, stomach and spirit is something else. The restaurant tries as hard as any I know to bring delight to the table with every course. It succeeds so often that only the most determinedly grumpy souls could resist. Even the spoken intros have a role. They serve to tee up the surprises that emerge from the kitchen, which reliably turn skeptics into swooners, especially as Mr. Humm has axed some of his sillier gimmicks. (Back to Times Square with you, three-card monte.) More crucially to this restaurant’s intent, the patter opens a window between customers and staff. The dopey speeches work like pickup lines; you may smirk, but at least you respond, and once you’ve done that, a conversation can start.  Mr. Guidara, a front-of-house man who rose to become Mr. Humm’s business partner in the restaurant when it broke off from the Union Square Hospitality Group, is a creative partner, too, working to establish a loose, entertaining tone in the dining room that sets Eleven Madison Park apart from its competitors. The servers are deeply attentive to details. As a manager told New York magazine, “It takes 10 months to learn how to pour water.”  The remote formality that typically comes with punctilious service has been banished. Servers want to make you an active collaborator in the fun. As Bacall said to Bogart, it’s even better when you help. At the center of the collaboration is, of course, Mr. Humm’s cooking. He is, at heart, a neo-classicist, a master of pruning the old-fashioned curlicues from the traditional haute cuisine of his training to make the pleasures more modern and direct. This isn’t always clear when he is trying to keep up with path-blazing chefs like Grant Achatz and René Redzepi. But it’s the force that drives his best innovations, like globes of celery root braised in a pig’s bladder, inspired by the classic French dish poulet en vessie.  The white globes will be bathed in a truffled chicken reduction and set beside a circle of celery root purée that has been spooned over, guess what, more truffles. And Mr. Humm, always alert to opportunities for spectacle, knows that beyond forming an airtight vessel for steam, an inflated pig’s bladder shimmying around a copper sauté pan makes a great conversation piece in the dining room. Recently, the cheese course packed into a picnic basket was retired. A fondue has taken its place, and it is both homey and spectacular. The serving bowl is a baked carnival squash and the utensil a hot, soft pretzel stick from the protean pastry kitchen. There is no homily about the glories of the street-corner pretzel cart. You are left alone to revel in the melted cheese, to mash the pretzel against cubes of sweet squash, and to imagine anything you like. I decided to imagine that the fondue came straight out of Mr. Humm’s upbringing in Switzerland, because it worked on my senses with the deep, soulful pull of a childhood memory. There are no printed menus at the start of the meal, just a conversation led by the table’s captain. Once allergies and aversions are out of the way, two choices remain. One concerns the main course; the other is about foie gras. Mr. Humm is a virtuosic handler of fattened duck liver, so either the hot or cold version is likely to produce altered states of consciousness. He brings out foie gras’s sweet and silky traits by layering it with braised red cabbage and serving it in a chilled wedge that looks like a slice of marbled Bundt cake; its meatier and robust qualities come through in a seared slice under fried brussels sprout leaves and smoked eel.  Many people will choose no foie gras at all. I don’t know what you can give a meat-avoider to make her feel she’s not missing out as her dinner partner goes bug-eyed over foie gras, but the watermelon and goat cheese salad served to a guest of mine last fall was definitely not it. So much attention goes into the showstoppers that substitutions do not always measure up. By now, a more glamorous alternative may be in the wings. Many things are in the wings at this restaurant, which is defined above all by its fluid movement into the future. The New York theme may wind down, though I hope the manhattan cart stays, stocked with mixers for the classic cocktail and its five variants to be stirred up at your elbow. Whatever new theme rolls to the table after that may be only partly baked, like the initial New York menu, but Eleven Madison Park’s true theme will stay the same: convincing you that you’ve been lifted to some better world until the man in the top hat outside whistles for your cab.",Eleven Madison Park in Midtown South,"['still', 'succeed', 'fails', 'say', 'want', 'question', 'critic', 'ask',

164,Bowery Meat Company,★★,2015-03-10,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/11/dining/restaurant-review-bowery-meat-company-in-the-east-village.html,East Village,"I’m starting to worry about the steakhouse. It used to be a rock of stability. The shifting winds of fashion did not bend it. Its basic formula was so firmly set that you could go to a steakhouse in San Bernardino and then one in Baltimore and have the same meal without looking at the menu.  Now steakhouses are swerving all over the road. Their menus read like competitions to see who can stray furthest from plain beef and potatoes. The more desperate they grow in their attempts to prove they’re not like the staid steakhouses of yore, the more they seem to converge.  Take two examples that opened last year: Knife, in Dallas, and Bowery Meat Company, in Manhattan. Knife has duck risotto on the menu; Bowery Meat Company has duck lasagna for two. Knife has a whole roasted chicken; Bowery Meat Company has half a roasted chicken. Knife has half a roasted pig’s head with Mexican salsas and tortillas; Bowery Meat Company has pork belly Chinese-barbecue style. After a while, reading these menus is like seeing your dad twerk.  But the hey-we’re-cool-no-really menus aren’t as troubling as the way these places insist that they don’t want to be called steakhouses anymore. Knife, according to its website, is “a reinvention of the steakhouse experience.” And here on First Street just off the Bowery, the chef Josh Capon and the restaurateur John McDonald, the team behind Lure Fishbar and El Toro Blanco, have brought forth a “meat company” whose website says it is “not a traditional steakhouse, but a balanced meat-centric menu.”  Just between us, Bowery Meat Company is not, in fact, a menu, balanced or otherwise. But it does have a menu, and on it you will find seven cuts of beef and a burger, potatoes cooked at least four ways and a spinach side dish. Mr. Capon appears at certain tables presenting masses of raw beef draped on a cutting board. And while the wine list has admirable and enticing range, its foundation is a cache of broad-beamed cabernets that are obviously meant to be married off to bricks of dry-aged beef.  Is it possible that Bowery Meat Company doesn’t know it’s a steakhouse, the way Bruce Willis in “The Sixth Sense” doesn’t know he’s a ghost? The dining room, by Meyer Davis Studio, could go either way. The right angles, the horizontal grain of the glossy paneling, the broad stretches of simple geometric curtains and the collection of midcentury chairs by Eames and other designers call up the heyday of Palm Springs and gibsons and Pall Malls and, yes, steak, along with other meats.  In this retro room, prime beef makes as much sense as Mr. Capon’s swell nods to old-school Italian-American classics, like shrimp scampi, woozy with garlic and butter, or broiled oysters under slightly scorched bread crumbs, New Orleans style. His zucchini carpaccio dotted with creamed feta, chopped pistachios and fresh mint is very good now; it will be excellent when squash is in season. He also makes a terrine of chicken livers and foie gras, smooth in all the right ways and served with onion jam and toasted brioche. This is true luxury, not the mock luxury of a garden-variety deviled egg trying to pass itself off as a $25 appetizer by dressing up in caviar.  Mr. Capon is not given to rash experiments. He knows where the pleasure centers are and how to tickle them. (So does his pastry chef, Katie McAllister. Her desserts are unabashedly sweet, sometimes to the point where you lose interest, although the s’mores sundae is uncannily precise, down to the ice cream that tastes exactly like a campfire marshmallow.) So his duck lasagna is not some bold invention but a gooey casserole in which the duck ragù is essentially a seasoning and the bulk of the work is done by loads of melted caciocavallo. It is meant to serve two but could probably bring four people to a dead stop.  And there is more. Much more. In the end, I barely put a dent in the menu, though it left its mark on me.  Connoisseurs of ultratender burgers will go wild for Mr. Capon’s hefty but loosely packed version on an extremely yielding bun. I like a burger that puts up more of a fight, but I loved the flavors of the melted raclette and caramelized onions. The most imposing of the meats is the veal chop, thick and quartz-pink. It’s rubbed with paprika, coriander and fennel seeds for a whiff of the souk, but what gives it energy is the juice of a grilled orange half. That citrus-spice alchemy is a terrific solution to the boredom sometimes caused by plain broiled lumps of animal muscle.  Another solution may be a smaller chop costing less than $52, but Bowery Meat Company understands that one of the jobs of any steakhouse, traditional or not, is to help carnivores spend lavishly. There is, as you’d expect, a proprietary cut of meat from the celebrity butcher Pat LaFrieda, the $54 “Bowery steak.” (Imagine the things “Bowery steak” might have been a euphemism for 20 years ago.) A mosaic of trimmed rib-eye cap, it’s intensely flavorful, but I wish Mr. Capon would leave the garlic-heavy raw chopped herb sauce on the side. The 14-ounce New York strip is $55, is served naked except for some roasted shallots and has a fine dry-aged tang. It was missing only a rough, satisfying crust of the kind the kitchen put on the côte de boeuf, a 38-ounce marvel of careful dry-aging and extensive marbling that costs $138.  Demand for expensive beef rises with bull markets in stocks, and the current one just charged into its sixth year. The natural outcome of this is more steakhouses, but lately there have been complicating factors. Women don’t take to the traditional steakhouse the way men have. Many people have ethical and environmental concerns about beef production. The most recent challenge is the rise of the small-plates culture, which has made portions of meat larger than, say, half a pound look a bit unseemly.  This is why (he said, adopting a Viennese accent) the steakhouse has been acting so peculiar lately: It is trying to unite what’s left of its core audience with the new herd of refugees from the small-plates revolution. Maybe Bowery Meat Company and places like it should just forget about defining themselves in relation to the steakhouse. Instead, they could come up with a new name for a place where you eat an appetizer followed by six or more ounces of meat, poultry or seafood.

165,Via Carota,★★,2015-03-03,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/dining/restaurant-review-via-carota-in-the-west-village.html,West Village,"Hanging from Via Carota’s ceiling, menacing a large farmhouse table that had been surrounded by smiling customers just a few minutes earlier, was a row of long iron spikes, bent into hooks at their ends. They’d been retrofitted with light bulbs to make a functional if terrifying chandelier, but what was their original purpose? Several possibilities suggested themselves, from medieval torture device to a particularly inhumane way of catching fish. “You’ll have to ask Jody,” a server said after admitting that she didn’t really know what the thing was either. “Every day, she brings in something else that she’s just found. She’ll say, ‘Don’t think about it, but that olive bowl is 200 years old.’ ” Jody is the chef Jody Williams. She shares responsibility for Via Carota’s Italian menu with the chef Rita Sodi, her partner in both business and domestic matters. When it comes, however, to buying antique nail barrels, china hutches, silver teapots, seltzer siphons, porcelain creamers, glazed cheese crocks, woven wood baskets, woven metal baskets and other stuff to fill a restaurant, Ms. Williams does it all by herself. Her eye for dressing a room is well known by the many people who swear by Ms. Williams’s other restaurant, Buvette, a hop and a skip to the west on Grove Street. Buvette is filled with antiques and flea-market triumphs, starting with the black Raleigh bicycle left unchained on the sidewalk, as if the owner had just popped in for a croque-monsieur on the way to buy an armful of leeks. Buvette is French, and its premise seems to be that everything about France and the French is deeply adorable. The tables, the plates, even the silverware are about two sizes smaller than normal. Many people, some of whom live in Paris, where a second Buvette is a big hit, find all this irresistible. But it always makes me feel as if I’m on the set of a Wes Anderson film wearing a large trash bag while everybody else is dressed in vintage Boy Scout uniforms. Fortunately, while Via Carota has been energetically propped, it avoids the preciousness of Buvette. There is an ambient cuteness level, to be sure, but it is balanced by an Italian severity; the spiky iron chandelier (made by the sculptor Warren Muller from a clam rake) hanging over the charming cocktail coupes. The beechwood chairs with built-in pockets for books, for instance, came from a chapel in Wales. They make you sit up straight. Best of all, Ms. Williams and Ms. Sodi are cooking deeply appealing food, without mugging.  Ms. Sodi is a stickler about classic Italian pasta, which forms the foundation of her own small restaurant nearby, I Sodi. You can tell she is a stickler because her pastas taste the way they are supposed to taste, the sauces not too complicated or heavily applied, the noodles not too tight and not too flabby.  I might have liked a little more wildness in the wild-boar ragù over pappardelle, but I could not have asked for a more rounded, balanced, mellow ragù or more supple noodles. And while pasta with black truffles may not sound modest, there was nothing ostentatious about the irregular patches of pasta called stracci (it means “rags”) turned with melted butter, Parmigiano-Reggiano and truffle shavings; it seemed, in fact, like the only sensible thing to do with a truffle. Apart from calling it a svizzerina and topping it with rosemary and whole garlic cloves, they make no attempt to prettify the chopped New York strip steak. Molded into a puck and seared on cast iron, it is both simple and amazing. Those of us who believe that the best burgers are chopped with knives, as this one is, will especially love the way the svizzerina feels in the mouth, substantial and even slightly luxurious, a quality that steak loses the minute it goes through a meat grinder.  Like most of the meat and fish dishes, the bunless, French-fry-less svizzerina stands more or less alone, Italian style. Under the very simple and very good rabbit, patiently pan-fried, you will get a slice of fried bread to take care of any oil. If you like the taste of rabbit, this is the dish for you. A stub of grilled octopus leg gets a mound of green-olive relish. If all this pasta and protein sends you looking for vegetables, you will find yourself in one of Via Carota’s strongholds. There are vegetables of all shapes and sizes, and with them the chefs give up a bit of their severity and start to play. Twiglike salsify roots were caramelized in brown butter, almost candied, and wonderful. A fennel bulb, cooked until tender, was dressed in orange pulp and orange zest. Shafts of leeks, poached and served cool, were topped with shavings of cured mullet roe and grated hard-cooked eggs; suddenly, I did not want to see leeks served any other way. Only with the grilled radicchio did they go over the top, piling on sweetness with currants and balsamic vinegar, then enriching everything with soft caprino cheese. But that kind of excess is just what Via Carota typically and gracefully avoids. Creamy stracchino cheese may seem too rich to stand in for fresh mozzarella on crostini with cherry tomatoes, especially tomatoes that have been sun-dried to a raisin-like sweetness. As things turn out, it’s phenomenal. So is the mash of walnuts, honey and lardo that the chefs spread on another crostino, one that would be just as good at breakfast or dessert, or with cheese or yogurt. It would probably be good sold from a vending machine at the Port Authority. But then you would miss the short and no-nonsense list of drinks made from as few ingredients as possible (Italian-style, again). Or the much longer but still no-nonsense wine list, which covers a lot of ground without letting the prices get too out of hand. (Do keep an eye on the bottom line, though. It’s surprisingly easy to reach $100 a person if you decide to taste something from each category on the menu.) Or the very tender crostata with a thin, sticky layer of raspberry jam.  Most of all, you’d miss the chance to see the West Village take to this restaurant as if it had been around as long as one of Ms. Williams’s olive bowls.",Via Carota in the West Village,"['hanging',

166,Shuko,★★★,2015-02-17,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/18/dining/restaurant-review-shuko-in-the-east-village.html,Greenwich Village,"“You like spicy?” Jimmy Lau asked from behind the counter at Shuko, the new restaurant just below Union Square where he and his partner, Nick Kim, prepare an elevated and memorable species of Japanese food. Before I could answer, he handed me a spicy tuna roll that would casually knock over my ideas about spicy tuna rolls, and spice, and tuna. Pickled red Thai chiles sat on top of the roll, chopped to bits and ready for action. The tuna underneath was soft sinew cut from the belly of a bluefin. It was grilled until the fat ran, until it soaked through the rice in its crisp nori wrapper and dripped out the bottom of the roll and into my palm. “Actually, it’s not too spicy,” Mr. Lau said. Ten seconds later, Mr. Kim leaned over and said almost the same thing: “Actually, it’s not that spicy.” Actually, gentlemen, it was really pretty spicy. In run-of-the-mill sushi bars, the spicy tuna roll is a cheap firecracker of questionable provenance. Nobody who has had Shuko’s version, though, is going to forget it. The heat comes in gusts that keep getting stronger until you can’t do anything but hold on. The chiles scour your tongue, cauterizing it. The melting oils from the tuna belly blanket your entire mouth, trying to restore the peace. The two sides, almost evenly matched, fight for control, and you are the battlefield. Mr. Lau and Mr. Kim were last seen sharpening their knives at Neta, a few blocks away. It was their first perch after leaving the truffled nest of Masa Takayama, who put Mr. Lau in charge of the kitchens at Bar Masa in New York and Las Vegas and made Mr. Kim head chef of Masa itself. Neta, though excellent, had a well-defined comfort zone right from the start. Compared with Shuko it looks like a restaurant on training wheels. Meanwhile, Mr. Takayama’s operations, particularly now that the overpriced and underperforming Kappo Masa has been added to the fold, have begun to look like assembly lines where golden hooks are baited with two- and three-figure delicacies to dangle before whales. (Would you like the truffle maki roll topped with caviar or the caviar roll topped with truffles?) Those and other guaranteed bell-ringers do put in appearances at Shuko. Fat-streaked tuna belly, prone on a bed of rice, was one in a long volley of sushi pieces chosen by the chefs, at a cost of $135. Toro appeared again in the $175 kaiseki meal, a string of mesmerizing little plates followed by a shorter sushi recital. This time it took the shape of a homage to Mr. Takayama, a pure and tightly chilled tartare under a green-gray hump of Osetra caviar. During the five minutes or so it took to smear this on toasted milk bread and eat it, no force on earth could have stopped me short of hot lava flowing under the front door, and even then I would have made a guess at its speed before deciding to get up from the counter. What’s impressive about Shuko, though, is how many times the chefs ring the bells without resorting to clichéd indulgences. One of the most memorable pieces of nigiri in my sushi omakase was an intense, livery, chewy bite of squab cartilage with sansho pepper. Another was a slab of Mediterranean dorade so rich and fatty it reminded me of shrimp. Another was simply a grilled shiitake cap folded around a pinch of warm rice. On the kaiseki menu another night, finely shredded Japanese mountain yam, burdock and carrot had been flattened with slivers of scallop beard to make a crisp, airy, hand-held latke. Toward the middle of both meals, a chef began to lay down pickle slices, silently, one after another, like a blackjack dealer. Shuko had piled these carrots, radishes and so forth into wood barrels to ferment when they were still in season, not just to save their flavor but to expand it. New York State produce preserved by traditional Japanese methods makes a fine emblem for Shuko’s blending of cultures. Another may be the facade on East 12th Street, where the windowless wall is finished with sand and particles of hay, and the door is marked only by a handful of dried flowers tied with a string. It could be an ancient house in Tokyo, if not for the classic New York cast-iron column running right down the middle. Open the door and you enter what could be downtown’s latest version of cocktail hide-outs like Angel’s Share or Milk & Honey. And in fact, once you sit down at the long and carefully buffed ash bar, a bartender in a beard and necktie will offer to stir up a drink for you. This is an offer worth accepting. Another server, in ripped bluejeans, pours house-made sparkling water. The music is very slightly louder than in most sushi bars and spans the decades from Debbie Harry to Sky Ferreira. Ice Cube is having a good day, but Lorde is over getting told to throw her hands up in the air. Some purists may feel that all this desecrates the temple of sushi. They can go eat in a temple. Mr. Lau and Mr. Kim, both young and fluent in several cultures at once, have taken all the preciousness out of omakase and kaiseki dining and replaced it with a relaxed, sophisticated cool. They were already moving in this direction at Neta, but with Shuko they’ve arrived. Everybody seems to feel comfortable here. (Some feel a little too comfortable; one night, a couple who seemed to have been married for several centuries carried on a long and inscrutable argument, while a young tycoon at the opposite end of the bar rattled off his company’s revenue figures for the last five years.) Both menus offer an in-depth look at how good these two chefs are at bringing out flavors without appearing to be doing much to them. My sushi omakase, but not my kaiseki meals, included a flight of sea urchin, starting with pale, creamy blobs from Santa Barbara, Calif., then moving to Monterey, where the lobes were more compact and had a cleaner sweetness, and ending with uni topped with a lacy swirl of shirako tempura, the hot and buttery seminal fluid of a cod. The kaiseki doesn’t delve as intimately into marine biology, but in recompense it offers a slightly wider variety of surprises. One of them is an ending too good to give away, a dessert that is so unluxurious and un-Japanese and wonderful that the chefs seem to be smiling to themselves every time it’s served.",Shuko in the

167,Cosme,★★★,2015-02-03,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/04/dining/restaurant-review-cosme-in-the-flatiron-district.html,Flatiron,"A woman I once worked with had a facility for languages that was matched by her self-assurance. The rest of us had a hard time keeping track of her various proficiencies, and one time we asked her to remind us whether she knew Chinese. “Oh, I would love to learn Chinese,” she said. “But I just don’t have eight weeks to spare.” Too bad she isn’t a chef. Very few have eight weeks to spare these days, but that doesn’t stop them when, in pursuit of empire building, they decide to learn some other nation’s food. By the time the news releases are ready, a week’s vacation has become a research trip, and a snack bought with pocket change has become a $13 appetizer. Mexico is a favorite destination for these immersion courses. This has led to the illusion that New York is enjoying a boom in serious Mexican cuisine, when in fact what the city is experiencing is a handful of restaurants that present, some more convincingly than others, a chef’s south-of-the-border fantasies. Before he opened Cosme on East 21st Street in October, the chef Enrique Olvera reversed the process. He already had a pretty good handle on the cuisine of Mexico, having grown up and now owning a flock of restaurants there, including the globally acclaimed Pujol. Mr. Olvera’s research trips were to Manhattan instead. He studied its dining rooms, its menus, its cocktails and its customers. He was clearly taking notes, because he shows an uncannily state-of-the-art instinct for what New Yorkers want when they go out for dinner. Cosme is cool, but isn’t trend-chasing. It’s crowded and lively, but isn’t painfully loud. It’s comfortable, but isn’t coddling. Most of all, the cooking is a thrill, largely because it sails right over ideas like tradition, authenticity and modernity. Many underpinnings come from Mexico, while a lot of the ingredients were bought locally. The flavors are here and now, though; you connect with the dishes right away. In the style of places like Estela, many seafood and vegetable dishes turn out to be salads, or something like a salad, approachable, simple-seeming assemblages with a jolt of the unexpected. White ayocote beans, which look like cannellinis and are as creamy as any bean I’ve tasted, are surrounded by mixed greens and sliced radishes, all looking innocent enough; it’s the habaneros and charred cucumbers in the dressing that get you. The raw hamachi dabbed with lime and jalapeño sounds like another crudo variation, but the jalapeños are fermented and the limes dried until they turn black; together their flavor is so intense it could walk through bricks. Scallops and poached jicama, cut into white discs that you can’t tell apart until you bite down, are dressed with lime juice and cucumber; it seems like a traditional aguachile, but the sneaky, sideways heat comes from grated wasabi. Mr. Olvera doesn’t use heat and spice as weapons; he uses them like a pen, to sharpen and define the outlines of a dish. Dried ground chiles provide some backbone to a sweet pineapple purée served with firm, flavorful cobia and warm tortillas, for making an exhilarating seafood version of tacos al pastor. Whenever a stack of fresh tortillas arrived, I would pull one from its folded napkin, hold it up to my face and inhale. It was a motion I hadn’t made since grade school, when I would bring the purple-smudged handouts still warm from the Ditto copier up to my nose to breathe in their sweet, forbidden, chemical smell, like rubbing alcohol mixed with danger. The aroma of these tortillas was completely wholesome — like flowers, bread straight from the oven, and a baby’s cheek at the same time — but I still wanted to fall headfirst into it the way I did with Ditto solvent. There are no tortillas remotely like this in New York. Cosme makes them downstairs in the kitchen from old strains of blue, yellow, purple and white corn grown in Mexico. The tortillas are one of the few reminders around if you forget for a moment that Cosme is a Mexican restaurant. Many of the kitchen’s innovations probably shouldn’t be copied, because they depend on Mr. Olvera’s deep knowledge of Mexican food together with his understanding of what’s being cooked in Copenhagen, Chicago and Lima. But one idea that I hope other Mexican restaurateurs steal is the decision to go without all the props (sombreros, grinning calaveras) that say, “Hola, amigos, have a margarita!” The furthest Cosme goes in that direction are the small potted succulents on every table. Yana Volfson, Cosme’s drinks mastermind, reacted as if we’d stepped on her foot when we asked if mezcal (she has quite a collection) would be poured into rustic clay cups; no, she said, it goes into clear, modern glasses. The dining room hangs in a pool of darkness, where black ceilings and walls recede while shafts of light beam down onto the tops of the tables. You see what you’re eating and whom you’re eating it with; that’s about it. The menu is not built around familiar Mexican signposts like enchiladas, either; it’s just a long list of dishes, all of roughly the same size, running down the left side of the page. In the lower right corner, by itself, is guacamole. It’s the one landmark every customer is sure to recognize, and it is literally marginalized. Mr. Olvera might as well train the servers to roll their eyes like April Ludgate if anyone orders it. The menu, in fact, isn’t a lot of help when it comes to suggesting how to put together a meal. Servers will suggest sharing about three dishes for each person at the table. Follow this advice, and you will not go hungry; unlike many chefs, Mr. Olvera takes the trouble to plate food so that it divides easily. But you will pay for the experience. Cosme is an expensive restaurant, where dinner for two with dessert and wine can easily creep beyond $300. A few dishes leave you wondering momentarily if it’s worth it, like the stodgy, compacted eggplant-lard tamal. And while there is an absolute classic on Jesús Peréa’s dessert menu, the cracked meringue made with burned and pulverized corn husks and filled with corn mousse, the rest of them tend toward a blandly pleasant sweetness. There aren’t many problems like that, though. More often you get something like the fried pork skin, as big and brown and open as a catcher’s mitt, covered with sliced radishes and avocados. It doesn’t sound like much, but it’s sensational. So are the duck carnitas, slowly braised in the meat’s own fat with orange and Coca-Cola (the Mexican one, no corn syrup). Or the lobster paired, boldly and unerringly, with fresh chorizo and refried black beans. Almost everything you taste at Cosme seems new without being forced or mannered. It isn’t the kind of Mexican cooking that can be learned on a vacation. It has to be lived, and for that there are no shortcuts.",Cosme in the Flatiron District,"['woman', 'worked', 'facility', 'language', 'matched', 'selfassurance', 'rest', 'u', 'hard', 'keeping',

168,Blue Smoke,★,2015-01-27,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/28/dining/restaurant-review-blue-smoke-and-north-end-grill.html,Kips Bay,"If you hooked a seismograph to Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group, the readout for most of the last two decades would be boringly predictable. Regular spikes would indicate the orderly arrival of restaurants, with just a few aberrant tremors here and there: the closure of Tabla and, very rarely, a change of chef.  But since the summer of 2013, one quake after another has jolted the needle. The chef of the Dining Room and the Bar Room at the Modern stepped down. Then the same thing happened at the two Blue Smoke locations. Then North End Grill. One at a time, replacements were named. Recently came word that when Untitled moves downtown with the Whitney Museum of American Art, it will get a new chef, too. This cluster of seismic activity could be a coincidence. Or it could mean that pressure was building for a while; suddenly, the tectonic plates moved. What is clear is that a company with a healthy respect for loyalty and stability has taken advantage of the turnover. The new chefs are far from cautious caretakers; they’ve moved decisively to refresh menus that, in some cases, had begun to stagnate.  Today I’ll take on Blue Smoke and North End Grill; the Modern is a complicated case of two restaurants, each holding three stars from The New York Times, and is best saved for another time. Even fans of Blue Smoke would not have described it, before Jean-Paul Bourgeois took over the kitchen last March, as a beacon of innovation. From its birth in 2002 on East 27th Street through the opening of a Battery Park City location 10 years later, Blue Smoke tried to replicate every major American barbecue style. This guaranteed that its meat would be compared to Texas brisket, Carolina pulled pork and St. Louis ribs, and also guaranteed that the verdict would not favor Blue Smoke. Mr. Bourgeois has tried to extract himself from that trap by dropping the regional aspirations from the menu, which now offers “seven-pepper rubbed beef brisket” and so on. It’s a start, but today Blue Smoke also faces competition from local pitmasters who produce great barbecue more consistently than it does. At their best, Blue Smoke’s pulled pork can run a close second to the one at Mighty Quinn’s Barbeque, and the brisket isn’t far off the one at Hometown Bar-B-Que, which has gotten better and better. On off days, you may get a pulp of gray, lifeless, smokeless pork or a tough, stringy sparerib. But while Blue Smoke’s barbecue lags, as ever, a few paces behind the front-runners, when it comes to contemporary Southern cooking in New York Mr. Bourgeois’s menu is at the head of the pack.  An appetizer called the Preservation Plate recently gave a survey of his range. He had used the smoker to turn a duck breast into very fine ham. His kitchen had put up pickles in the warm weather, string beans and red grapes tasting of cloves. He’d made a blackberry and root beer mustard to go with chicken liver pâté on toast, and tender, juicy pickled shrimp. This is a platter that summons thoughts of Frank Stitt or Hugh Acheson. Mr. Bourgeois is a native of Thibodaux, La., and some of his best dishes have been yanked, still wriggling, right out of the bayou. You know he means to do things the right way when you see the soft French bread that comes with oysters roasted in smoked garlic butter under crackling bread crumbs. His seafood boil is outstanding, every ingredient cooked the way it should be: the little potatoes, the crisp baby carrots, the fat, wonderful gulf shrimp and a head of boiled garlic that is delicious spread on Saltines. The comeback sauce goes with all of it, just as the chunky and aromatic tomato sauce goes with the very fresh pan-seared red snapper, gulf shrimp and crab meat to make a Cajun court bouillon, or coo-bee-yon.  Over two visits at each location, it became clear that missteps can occur at either, although the worst service I’ve ever had at one of Mr. Meyer’s restaurants took place in the Flatiron branch. My table repeatedly seemed to disappear for 20 minutes at a time. After one long absence, our server seemed to think we should have been finishing our desserts. “How are your ...” he began. “Oh, you still have your menus.”  Blue Smoke’s desserts themselves seemed to have dropped behind a fog of oblivion until very recently. Two months ago, banana cream pie had lost its custard or pastry cream, so scraps of brown banana sat naked on a pie shell; the kitchen tried in vain to hide them under whipped cream. Late last year the pastry chef Emily Isaac rode in to the rescue, and while she is only beginning to introduce her own desserts, the recipes she inherited are already greatly improved.  It’s less clear that North End Grill needed a course correction. I gave the restaurant two stars in 2012, but even then I thought Floyd Cardoz’s menu was hard to pin down: It had an egg section, but also lots of fish, and meat cooked on the wood grill seemed to be important, too.  Eric Korsh, who started last spring, has a more unified approach, one tilting toward France. The level of cooking may not be different now, but Mr. Korsh hits more high notes, and hits them more often. His charcuterie is worth a visit all by itself, whether for the slippery, salty and gelatinous torchon of trotters or the thin slices of lightly pickled beef tongue with gribiche sauce, tangy and smooth. And he served a loup de mer the way I’d like to see it done at La Grenouille, with a terrific lobster sauce, a tangle of simple spinach and a huge glittering knob of caviar. I loved the way Mr. Korsh had seared and deeply scored the skin side of a raw Spanish mackerel, leaving intact the rest of the slab; to lighten the oily fish he had brought together pink grapefruit, hot chiles, cucumber and radishes. I admired how precisely each piece of seafood in his bouillabaisse was cooked, although I thought the broth tasted a little too much like clams. And he seems to get the most out of the wood grill. Smoke and char bring a primeval thrill to a splayed-open, nearly rare squab; now that I think about it again, my pulse is racing. And the Berkshire pork, said to serve two but enough to subdue at least four, is a piece of meat for the ages; it could do for the pork chop what Peter Luger did for the porterhouse. Desserts, now by Tracy Obolsky, still weave sophisticated threads into classics, like chocolate cake with crunchy malt or the tribute, in ice cream, to the Almond Joy. Try it, even if you think the original can’t be improved.

169,Upland,★★,2015-01-13,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/14/dining/restaurant-review-upland-on-park-avenue-south.html,Kips Bay,"“Go to Upland” is my current answer to anybody who asks for a good new place to eat in Manhattan. It will probably remain my answer for some time. The recommendation is the same for fetishists who unwind by reconstructing recipes from the court of Catherine de Medici as for parishioners in the Church of St. Rachael. It holds for drinkers who are on the lookout for unexplored grapes and for those who call all white wine chardonnay. The only diners I would not send to Upland are the ones who categorically refuse to take any meals along Park Avenue South. Their loss. Upland’s owner and impresario in chief, Stephen Starr, has opened jostling, thumping, nightclub-slash-restaurants such as Morimoto and Buddakan, as well as intimate stages for chefs like Serpico in Philadelphia. Upland occupies the middle ground, a big restaurant where the set dressing feels like an event but doesn’t compete with the food.  For the kitchen, Mr. Starr recruited Justin Smillie, whose intensely flavorful spins on Italian cuisine at Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria won him national notice. Upland’s 88-seat dining room and vast menu would make some of his peers, serenely accustomed to arranging brassica specimens at tasting counters the size of egg cartons, collapse in a swoon. Lucky for us, Mr. Smillie is made of sturdier stuff.  His menu splashes around in the gentle, sun-dappled river of classic California cuisine, with special attention to its junctions with the Jonathan Waxman and Jeremiah Tower tributaries. (Upland is the name of the town in San Bernardino County where Mr. Smillie was raised; Mr. Waxman was a mentor.) Mr. Smillie’s pizzas, built on a tender crust with puffy lips, are freewheeling, like the very good one with pears, arugula and soft stracciatella cheese underscored by aged balsamic and a pesto that crunches with chopped pecans. His pastas can be tried and true, like the firm and well-peppered bucatini slick with tangy pecorino or the long, star-shaped tubes called estrella tossed with a just-right sauté of chicken livers with rosemary and sage. Or they may surprise you, like the spicy spaghettini that get their potent oceanic flavor from invisible baby sardines. Either way, they’re further confirmation that Mr. Smillie is one of the city’s pasta savants. As he showed in his last kitchen, he’s something of a vegetable sage, too. Celery root never struck me as a showstopper, exactly, until I tasted the one at Upland, slowly roasted into an intense and creamy globe and brushed with black truffle butter. Everybody at my table always wanted to try his deep-fried hen-of-the-woods mushroom, and everybody was always happy swiping it in herbed Cloumage, a charming cousin of ricotta brought down from southern Massachusetts. And a main course of Tasmanian sea trout was made memorable by its vegetable side, a section of sweet, ivory-colored cone cabbage permeated by smoke.  The burrata purist at my table was dubious about the heaps of trout roe and frizz of fried leeks Mr. Smillie piled on top of the near-liquid cheese, but the rest of us spooned it up, wishing we had a toasted everything bagel to complete the picture. When it was gone, we weren’t sure we would have the energy for the plate of duck wings, like confit with a bone handle. But the sparks of heat and citrus in the yuzu kosho vinaigrette on the skin kept us going until we began to think that Upland deserves a place in the annals of poultry wing cookery alongside the Anchor Bar in Buffalo. Among the main courses, the grilled branzino with a scallion-heavy salsa verde was solid if unsurprising. The pork chop, though, half-moons of sweet persimmon and hot red peppers on top, was a sensation. I thought about Mr. Smillie’s gift for building flavor upon flavor as I chewed on the tiny squares of crackling that wrapped around the bone. His menu rambles a bit, and it’s no surprise that not all of the 30 or so dishes glide with swanlike grace. Chilled and decidedly al dente farro spaghetti seemed like an odd choice for a cold sea urchin sauce, and the whole notion is unlikely to melt anyone’s heart in the dead of winter. Wads of spicy grated radish smothered the sweetness of just-shucked raw scallops. And the short rib with walnuts and unruly curls of shaved celery that was roasted on a rotisserie at Il Buco Alimentari hasn’t fully acclimated to being cooked in an oven on East 26th Street; there seems to be less of the deeply caramelized meat around the edges, and it’s less satisfying to chew on, while the bite of the peppercorns is more bullying than I remember. And I wondered about the size of the dining room when two out of three pastas showed up lukewarm one night. After some early critical grumbling about the desserts, a new pastry chef from Thomas Keller’s fleet, Sébastien Rouxel, was installed shortly before Christmas. I hope he sets the whisks and rolling pins in order quickly because I’ve yet to meet a dessert at Upland that I’d come back for, let alone one that suggests the easy rapport Mr. Smillie has with his ingredients. For now, there is more excitement to be had in slaloming around Chantelle Pabros’s wine cellar. She has assembled one of the most accessible, least dogmatic lists in town, with dozens of bottles under $50, as if that were the way all wine lists worked. (It isn’t, but it should be.) New Yorkers can challenge their parochial disdain for California wines with classics like Chateau Montelena and leaders of the modern style like Cathy Corison. Or they can dip into one of several affordable Bordeaux, so unfashionable, so delicious. There is more than a token sampling of reds from Portugal, and three Canadian Chardonnays, patiently waiting for America to notice.  The interior is lined by shelf after shelf of preserved lemons in jars, each one illuminated by three tiny LEDs until they become something like citrus lamps. When their marmalade glow hits the copper trim around the dining room, it gives off a light warmer than anything I’ve seen in a restaurant before. The tables in the dining room are generously large, the seats the kind you want to stay in all night. Not so in the bar, where two of my guests, arriving early, were deposited on hard-backed wood benches near the after-work mob. When I appeared, there was a whispered conference by the coat room. “I’m sorry,” a host finally said to my guests, “I forgot to ask if you’d like to sit in the dining room.”  If she forgets to ask you, too, tell her I said the dining room is the place to be.",Upland on Park Avenue South,"['“go', 'upland”', 'current', 'answer', 'anybody', 'asks', 'good', 'place', 'eat', 'manhattan', 'probably',

170,Kappo Masa,0 star,2015-01-06,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/07/dining/restaurant-review-kappo-masa-on-the-upper-east-side.html,Upper East Side,"Galleries owned by Larry Gagosian, the powerful and well-connected dealer who has spent his career goosing the prices of contemporary art higher and higher: 14. Restaurants owned by the chef Masayoshi Takayama, who has spent his career charging more for Japanese food than anyone else in the United States: five. Restaurants the two men own together: one, Kappo Masa, in the basement below Mr. Gagosian’s Madison Avenue gallery. The dining room, furnished with teak tables and seating upholstered in buttercup-yellow leather, wraps in an L shape around the large, well-populated kitchen. Mr. Takayama is known for sushi, but Kappo Masa presents a general overview of Japanese cuisine, so in addition to the raw-fish counter, there are stations for grilling, frying, simmering, steaming and assembling marinated seafood plates and cold salads. He runs the kitchen himself, but I failed to spot him. Now three months old, Kappo Masa is not the most expensive restaurant in New York. That distinction belongs to Mr. Takayama’s home base, Masa, in the Time Warner Center. (Price of dinner for one before tax, tip and drinks: $450.) Still, it is expensive in a way that’s hard to forget either during or after the meal. The cost of eating at Kappo Masa is so brutally, illogically, relentlessly high, and so out of proportion to any pleasure you may get, that large numbers start to seem like uninvited and poorly behaved guests at the table. Price of a maki roll of chopped fatty tuna wrapped in rice with caviar piled on each of the eight pieces: $240. I could never bring myself to order it, or two dishes filigreed with white truffles: the fried rice with mushrooms ($120) or the Ohmi beef tataki ($150). So I can’t tell you how any of them taste, but I can tell you that by the time I spotted something for less than $80, it struck me as a steal. Amount I spent for 5.5 ounces of grilled steak raised in Australia: $78. The beef had a species of tenderness that I associate more with bluefin tuna than steak. It tasted something like teriyaki without the sugar. I liked it very much, but mostly I thought, “Why $78?” In fact, Mr. Takayama charges similar prices across town at Bar Masa. But the food and service allow Bar Masa to pass for an à la carte version of Masa itself. Kappo Masa is nowhere near as good. The raw ingredients may well be the same, but they are often handled carelessly, seasoned indifferently and served inattentively. Price of bland, watery cauliflower florets with maitake mushrooms that were grilled over far too much heat so their insides were raw and woody while their exteriors was burned to a char that peeled off in blackened flakes: $28. Price of yellowtail collar left on the grill until it lost the silky, puddinglike richness that is the whole point of this cut: $28. Price of noodles extruded from ground shrimp, a gluten-free invention of Mr. Takayama’s, sloshing around in a greasy pond of way too much melted butter and not enough of the serrano chiles that may have given the dish a little spark: $24. Price of four tiny, cold flour tortillas filled with roast duck, floppy matchsticks of uncrisp duck skin and batons of overcooked foie gras: $26. Every once in a while, something genuinely remarkable would arrive, as if from another kitchen. Cubes of superb raw tuna ($34), seasoned with soy, sake and minced wasabi, were served polar-vortex-cold on a chilled white ceramic drum designed by Mr. Takayama. Butterflied grilled octopus ($24), soft and a little smoky in its dressing of sesame oil and lime, was something like Japanese shrimp scampi, a terrific surprise. There was “baby dancing shrimp,” in a shattering, exquisite batter dusted with ground chiles ($26), and a sea urchin risotto with springy grains of rice, some very fresh chanterelles and almost enough urchin to silence any protests about the price ($48). If the whole meal were like this, Kappo Masa would be a fantastic splurge. It’s not, though, and those prices start to seem like very expensive lottery tickets. They got into my head in other ways, too, warping my normal sense of value. Menu price for cress with wasabi dressing: $18. Amount I paid: $38, making this the first restaurant where I have actually looked over the check before paying and missed a $20 overcharge for a salad. I hadn’t been drinking that night, either. If I had, I might have become even more numbed to gouging. Approximate retail price of a bottle of 2012 Napa Valley chardonnay from Far Niente: $55. Price of the same bottle at Kappo Masa: $190. This was typical. The markup that New York restaurants customarily add to retail wine and sake prices is about 150 percent. The average markup at Kappo Masa is 200 percent to 300 percent. And I don’t need to shop around town to know that a cocktail of unnamed vodka infused with pineapple, even if it is as fresh tasting as Kappo Masa’s, should not cost $25. It doesn’t seem possible that Mr. Gagosian and Mr. Takayama just made up these prices out of thin air, diabolically chortling like Batman villains, late one evening at Masa. (Number of times each month Mr. Gagosian eats there, by his estimate: two.) And yet if you are one of those people who suspects that Manhattan is being remade as a private playground for millionaires who either don’t mind spending hundreds of dollars for mediocrity or simply can’t tell the difference, Kappo Masa is not going to convince you that you’re wrong. Superficially, the servers seem to belong in a restaurant offering casual luxury. They can act out a solemn, respectful greeting or a deep genuflection of apology. What they don’t always do is care. Servers who rushed to our side and fluttered about and acted distressed after one of them bumped a votive candle off the table’s edge: three. Servers who asked if anyone had been hit by the candle or checked to see if we had wax on our clothes: zero. Also, bowing at one side of the table holding a cocktail menu open may have broadcast a desire to please, but it made the text impossible to read. When I asked which “long-stem mushrooms” came with the grilled asparagus, the server very obligingly promised to ask the kitchen but never returned with the answer. One night the standard finger napkins didn’t appear until halfway through the sushi course. A restaurant of Mr. Takayama’s that forgets how to serve sushi seems unthinkable, but then the sushi itself was no prize. The rice was a gummy clump (though, on another visit, it was close to perfect). Kappo Masa provides a pantomime of service without the substance, and the restaurant itself is an imitation of luxury, not the real thing. Stars I might have given Kappo Masa if the prices were, say, 20 percent lower: one. Stars I am giving it: zero.",Kappo Masa on the Upper East Side,"['gallery', 'owned', 'larry', 'gagosian', 'powerful', 'wellconnected', 'dealer', 'spent', 'career', 'goosing', 'price', 'contemporary',

171,Dirty French,★★,2014-12-09,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/10/dining/restaurant-review-dirty-french-on-the-lower-east-side.html,Lower East Side,"A new restaurant from the chefs Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone and their partner Jeff Zalaznick tiptoed onto the Lower East Side in September, demurely announcing its name with two eight-foot-high neon signs in peep-show pink. DIRTY, says one. FRENCH, reads the other. Diners who have reservations for Dirty French, secured with a credit card and a gentle warning of a modest $50-a-person cancellation fee, will find a dining room inside the Ludlow hotel that is decorated with a few shoestring-budget items, like a wall-length antique carnival mirror shipped from France. A few weeks ago, the partners had the artist Rashid Johnson, a frequent guest, throw oozing slicks of wax blended with West African black soap against the mirror’s glass. (Around the same time, one of Mr. Johnson’s wax-and-soap works sold at auction for just under $200,000.) Across from the mirror, over the bar, is a wide French flag that Julian Schnabel splotched with ink. Down on the tiled floor, in another humble little gesture, servers lope around in squeaky-fresh limited edition Air Jordans from the ’80s, some of which probably cost more than I paid for my first car. Ever since Carbone and its neighbor, ZZ’s Clam Bar, came along, swagger and money have been to Torrisi-Carbone-Zalaznick establishments what blinking lights and sitars are to Sixth Street’s Curry Row. If the word for flaunting cash and art-world connections like this doesn’t occur to you immediately, look at the strutting crowd of ceramic roosters that Mr. Zalaznick spray-painted in screaming pink: Dirty French is one cocky restaurant. It can also be an immensely enjoyable one. That sounds contradictory, but the same self-confidence that can get on your nerves also allows this crew to mess around with French cuisine with a hugely energizing lack of respect. In unnatural crossbreeding experiments, they force bistro cooking to mate with haute cuisine. To make dinner less stuffy and formal, they bring back stuffy formalities like cut-glass wine carafes and frilly oyster plates. They smudge the pages of Escoffier with strange foreign spices. It may sound like run-of-the-mill fusion, but it is a top-to-bottom remix, and nearly every weird mongrel idea leads in the direction of more flavor or more fun. Chefs more deferential to custom may not have ditched the hallowed basket of levain or baguette à l’ancienne in favor of a flatbread inspired by the mahjeb Mr. Torrisi ate, one loaf after another, in a North African neighborhood of Paris. It’s no innovation, this bread, just pita dough griddled in plenty of olive oil, buried under Provençal herbs and sent out with a snowbank of fromage blanc, but people tore it up with greedy, greasy fingers at every table, mine included. Not that the chefs hide their training. (Mr. Torrisi worked for years under Daniel Boulud and takes the lead in this kitchen.) The mille-feuille is a technical showstopper, an accordion of ribbon-thin king trumpet mushroom stems folded over and over. It looks like pastry but pulls apart like buttered noodles, and when you drag them through a pool of green curry, the scene shifts to Thailand. It’s a disorienting dish, and makes your head spin in a wonderful way. The restaurant creates a parallel world where French pastry turns into Thai curry; it’s as if the chefs have imagined an alternative history in which the leading kitchens of France turned left instead of right several decades ago. What if nouvelle cuisine had embraced maximalism instead of minimalism, full-frontal abandon instead of lean precision? And what if, instead of teaching Americans to make puff pastry, the country’s chefs had taken cooking lessons from the rest of the French-speaking world? For one thing, they might have come up with Dirty French’s glorious lamb carpaccio. Brushed with a slow-burning raz al hanout oil, sprinkled with tart sumac powder and fresh herbs, dotted with sheep’s milk yogurt and preserved lemon and wheels of roasted eggplant, the slices of lamb loin are saddled with as much flavor as they can reasonably be asked to carry. Or, though this probably needed a push from the roast-chicken gold rush started at the NoMad, they might have hit upon Dirty French’s $72 poultry feast. First to arrive is the sneakily rich (translation: you can’t see the foie gras) white meat in mustard-herb sauce. Then the bird’s hindquarters show up on a cutting board. They’ve been soaked in a Vietnamese marinade of soy, fish sauce and lemon grass, slowly cooked in melted chicken fat (oh yes they have), then grilled and freshened up with lime zest. The chicken comes with crepes, irrelevantly; just pick up a drumstick and get to work on that burnished skin. The chefs have an instinct for the right kind of too much, but some dishes trip into the wrong kind. A deeply aromatic and fairly traditional bouillabaisse was thick with octopus, mussels, monkfish and one small, whole, wonderful red mullet. Cuttlefish ink took the broth to the outer edge of intensity, but the medicinal taste of fresh marjoram in some spoonfuls went beyond it. And while duck heart kebabs unloaded at the table added brawn to a frisée and lardons salad, the blast of mustard in the dressing was an excessive use of force. A programmatic rollout of the formula — Something Clearly French Under Heaps of Post-Colonial Exotica — doesn’t guarantee a sprinkling of magical pixie dust on every plate. Baked clams seemed perplexed by their thick jackets of almonds and Ethiopian spices, and so was I. A beautifully cooked trout meunière was speckled with sesame seeds and herbs, a mix that came across as an oddly neutered za’atar. Still, you can eat extraordinarily well by calling your shots and rolling with the loose, genial decadence of the place. The mood is set when a server comes over and says, in as laid-back a tone as anyone can manage while lugging an enormous 19th-century sterling silver punch bowl filled with ice, “I wanted to let you have a look at tonight’s oysters.” Oysters: Why not? It continues when Lelañea Fulton, who assembled a wine list that is all French, and fun for all kinds of budgets, shows up dressed like one of Charlie’s Angels working undercover as a sommelier. Old Châteauneuf-du-Pape? Sure. It goes on through dessert, under the assured hand of the pastry chef Heather Bertinetti, who gracefully threads her way through the French-exotic conceit with a delicately architectural coconut-passionfruit Napoleon and a very short but very good pineapple tarte Tatin, rum-raisin ice cream on top. Mr. Torrisi, Mr. Carbone and Mr. Zalaznick, cautious and retiring as ever, plan to open three original restaurants next year while continuing to build new Parm locations. The question is whether this will leave them the energy to keep refining their mongrel bistro on Ludlow Street while rolling out its breakfast and lunch menus in the coming months. Dirty French needs time to grow into its ideas, and maybe to grow out of a few of them.",Dirty French on the Lower East Side,"['chef', 'rich', 'torrisi', 'mario', 'carbone', 'partner', 'jeff',

172,Marta,★★,2014-12-02,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/03/dining/restaurant-review-danny-meyers-marta-in-nomad.html,Midtown South,"Nobody goes to Rome for the pizza. Rectangles of pizza bianca cut with scissors on the Campo de’ Fiori from long planks shaped like diving boards, yes, but not for regular pizza. The standard circular pie is something travelers eat only after saltimbocca, puntarelle, spicy tripe, salt cod fritters, semolina gnocchi, porchetta, artichokes fried alla giudia and the holy pasta trinity of cacio e pepe, amatriciana and carbonara have all been checked off the list. It is food for the fifth night of vacation. And now the chef Nick Anderer has come to make this lesser stop on Rome’s culinary pilgrimage route the main event of his new pizzeria, Marta. For the last five years Mr. Anderer has been a faithful custodian of the more famous Roman landmarks at Maialino, in the Gramercy Park Hotel. Marta, opened in September, is a continuation of that project, a spinoff that might have found a space next door if Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group had not decided to place it about a half-mile away in the soaring, stately lobby of the Martha Washington Hotel. Marta has Roman appetizers and entire Roman dishes repurposed as toppings for pizzas with thin crusts in the Roman style. Hold on, you say. Thin-crust pies are wall to wall around here. It is the house style of New York, a city to which people actually do travel for pizza. The style came from Naples with America’s earliest pizzaioli more than a century ago, and it’s been rejuvenated by modern obsessives who precisely calibrate their flour blends. What do we have to learn from Rome? Let’s keep local pride in check for a minute. Marta’s crusts are even thinner than what we think of as thin. Cooks in gray baseball caps press the dough flat with rolling pins on a marble counter. Slipped onto the floor of one of the hulking ovens whose black-tiled chimneys disappear into the hotel’s second floor, the pies bake next to flickering stacks of firewood. The crust at first-rank Roman pizzerias like Da Remo in Testaccio is often compared to a cracker, but crackers crumble. This doesn’t. It is more like the crust on a loaf of peasant bread from which all the soft crumbs have been stripped. It is durably crisp, unbendingly flat, and when you hold a slice by the edge, the rest of it juts out above the table like a cliff. Because everything I know about cliffs was learned from Wile E. Coyote, I kept waiting for the tip on each Marta slice to give way, but it never did. The pleasure of biting down on this pizza is both physical and auditory. The noise detonates along the jaw and plows right into the inner ear. Every bite sounds and feels like that. There is no soupy middle of steamed dough under wet tomatoes. It’s pure crunch, all the way. What you lose with this style is the soft, springy, baguette-like curls at the edges of a Neapolitan pizza. The outer crusts of a Marta pie don’t puff up; they stay hard and round, like grissini. When a pizza crust is all crackle, what’s on top has to bring the flavor. This is where you see Mr. Anderer thinking like a cook. He has a great pizza-fied version of carbonara, with dots of egg and grated pecorino over crumbled, starchy potatoes and baconlike curls of guanciale. For a while, he was doing an enjoyable two-dimensional trippa alla Romana, too, spreading the rich, chile-boosted tomato sauce around the pie and arranging tender, not too chewy bands of tripe on top. In a more classical vein, the margherita, spread with flavorful tomatoes that are more pulp than sauce and punctuated with mozzarella, is superb. At $16, the buffalo mozzarella, richer and with a faint taste of the barnyard or wherever it is water buffaloes pass the time, is worth the $4 upgrade from the cow’s milk variety. And if $18 seems high for a funghi pizza, note that the funghi in question are quartered chanterelles and frilly hen-of-the-woods, seasoned with thyme and just enough salt. Like almost all the toppings, the mushrooms are beautifully cooked with an insinuation of smoke; only the shoulder ham, layered between fontina and arugula, seemed to want more time in the oven, or maybe it needed to be sliced thin, so the edges could crisp and curl. Few pizzerias invest heavily in atmospherics, because pizza and the people who love it come and go in a few minutes. Still, it’s a surprise just how little atmosphere the Union Square Hospitality Group has tried to conjure at Marta. The dining room, with its majestic high ceilings and blocky fluted columns, has the cold, empty monumentality of a 19th-century bank. There’s some energy at the counter that faces the ovens, but very little in the rows of square tables behind it. The restaurant is open to the hotel lobby, and after a while, the comings and goings can make you feel as if you’re eating in the waiting room of a train station. Lingering over a long series of courses is not advised. Marta works best when treated as a pizzeria, not a restaurant. Main courses are available, but they are not as trustworthy as the pies. Pork ribs managed to be both charred and undercooked, while a slow-roasted short rib needed a more potent infusion of flavor than gremolata could give it. The mixed grill of lamb chops, ribs and sausage was a magnificent exception, but in general the larger plates are best for those who can’t eat pizza. (Marta does not make gluten-free dough.) A quick appetizer while the pizza bakes is absolutely recommended, though. Wood smoke wraps around rabbit meatballs, heavily peppered and herbed. The kitchen does fine work with hot oil, swathing vegetable fritters or seafood fritto misto in a translucently thin, light-gold batter and gently browning the bread crumbs around green supplì shaped from very good basil risotto. After pizza, there is an affogato that is exactly right, an ice cream sandwich that’s harder to like than it should be (the salted chocolate cookies could be thinner or softer, the pistachios crisper) and a cup of tiramisù that’s bracingly drenched in espresso. It costs just $5, which is helpful because pizza and fried food both need bubbles. Marta has a few Italian sparkling wines, but the real action is in the stockpile of nearly 40 Champagnes, from a $66 Roger Pouillon Cuvée de Réserve to some $300-plus vintage treats. Nobody goes to Rome for Champagne with pizza, either, but this isn’t Rome.",Danny Meyer’s Marta in NoMad,"['nobody', 'go', 'rome', 'pizza', 'rectangle', 'pizza', 'bianca', 'cut', 'scissors', 'campo',

173,Bar Bolonat,★★,2014-11-25,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/26/dining/restaurant-review-bar-bolonat-in-the-west-village.html,West Village,"Some restaurants hit the ground at full tilt. This review concerns one of the others, a place that stumbled at the start, as ungainly as a day-old giraffe, and only recently found its footing.  Bar Bolonat opened in the West Village in March in what seemed an auspicious location, a corner spot looking out on Abingdon Square Park through yards of windows. Two months in, Einat Admony, the chef and owner, was on the verge of closing it, she said in a phone interview. Nearly half of her 54 seats had been taken away after the city ruled that one wing of the dining room was an unpermitted sidewalk enclosure. The disputed area was quarantined behind a velvet rope, although it was hard to imagine a crowd lining up for admission to this patch of bare cement floor. This put a strain on revenues, no doubt, and made the place look pretty weird. Even with reduced capacity, Bar Bolonat was afflicted by suboptimal acoustics. When I ate there early in the summer, the screeching in the dining room could have crushed scrap metal. It nearly crushed my desire to come back, too, but I held on because Ms. Admony was up to something original in the kitchen.  The  daughter of an Iranian mother and Yemenite father,  she was combining the flavors of contemporary multiethnic Israel, where she grew up, with the idioms of modern restaurants in New York, where she has been cooking since getting a job in Bobby Flay’s kitchen at Bolo in 1999. I’d never tasted anything exactly like her shrimp in a Yemenite curry, with a fiery shot of green zhug and a small round of fried bread called malawach to soak up the spicy, turmeric-gold coconut milk. I wanted more food like this in my life, but I wasn’t in a big hurry to face the decibels again. Now, with sound-absorbing tiles up above, Bar Bolonat is a quieter restaurant, though it’s not entirely library-like. (One small section of ceiling, without tiles, is angled like the soundboard of a grand piano, with a similar effect.) It’s also bigger. In September, Ms. Admony finally appeased the bureaucrats and returned all her seats to active duty.  While fixing up the space, she made other changes, replacing executive chefs until she found Molly Breidenthal. When I ate there this month, the cooking was more assured than it had been, the spices applied more fearlessly. The giraffe is on the move. Energetic seasoning drives Ms. Admony’s cuisine at Bar Bolonat, as it does at her exemplary falafel shops, Taïm, and to a lesser extent her Mediterranean comfort food restaurant, Balaboosta. One of Bar Bolonat’s most likable dishes since the unsteady early days has been the lemony grilled baby artichokes with a creamy band of pistachio yogurt under a pale-green powder of dukkah. That blend of chopped nuts and herbs can get tired if it sits around too long, but Bar Bolonat’s is extremely fresh, the pistachios still sweet and bright green. A swipe of corn purée takes its seductive, toasty flavor from turmeric, cardamom and ground cloves, Ms. Admony’s version of a warming spice blend called hawaij that Yemenis stir into soups. Together with the creeping heat and sweetness of a red pepper sauce, the spiced corn makes something exciting out of a grilled octopus leg.  Nearly everybody orders the Jerusalem-style sesame bagel, so light and fluffy it’s almost an anti-bagel. Nearly everybody is right about this. What makes this racetrack-shaped bread so hard to pass up is the spoonful of really fragrant and complex za’atar that you dunk each piece into after giving it a preliminary bath in peppery olive oil. When dishes were underwhelming, as several were one August night, timid seasoning could be to blame. “Za’atar ravioli,” stuffed with smoky eggplant, might have been interesting had it included some actual za’atar. On the other hand, Bar Bolonat’s zabzi, an Iranian fresh-herb stew served with soft specks of fresh couscous, was fantastically vivid, and it could have become one of my favorites if the short rib in the stew had not been tough and dry. The dishes at Bar Bolonat are meant to be shared — everybody sing along — and come out of the kitchen as they’re ready. Or so the servers say. The menu is split into small, medium and large plates. As common sense would tell you if the servers weren’t telling you otherwise, the bigger ones, like the lamb neck braised with dates and chestnuts until it is pull-apart tender, are a lot easier to split than the few mouthfuls of fluke ceviche with dried pomegranate seeds and juice. The kitchen could do more to help by, say, carving the pomegranate-glazed poussin instead of sending it out whole with a serrated knife.  The bit about the dishes’ showing up at random times is misleading, too, but in a good way. My table was never laden down with more plates than it could hold. This ought to go without saying, but in restaurants these days nothing does. Apart from one or two unscheduled leaves of absence one night, the service was generally excellent, with a professional bearing that signals Ms. Admony’s intent to have Israeli cuisine taken seriously. The white napkins, polished stemware, sheer curtains and understated modern furniture are all a determined bid for the kinds of diners who would steer clear of anything resembling a hummus hut. For dessert, Ms. Admony makes a homey, from-scratch version of Milky, a chocolate pudding brand so central to Israeli life that it became the symbol of a protest this fall against the high cost of living. The halvah crème brûlée tastes more like butterscotch than sesame, but it is worth getting for the tuft of halvah floss on top. The most entertaining and probably the best dessert is a fried envelope of baklava with ice cream sealed inside, although the ice cream should be colder and the pastry hotter if Ms. Admony wants to live up to the high standards once set by the fried ice cream at Chi-Chi’s. Having fought City Hall and the screaming demons of dining-room noise, she’s probably ready for a new challenge.

174,Dumpling Galaxy,★,2014-11-11,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/12/dining/restaurant-review-dumpling-galaxy-in-queens.html,Flushing,"When I am on my way to a big dinner at a restaurant in Flushing, Queens, I like to limber up by eating a dozen of Helen You’s dumplings.  For the last eight years, Ms. You has been the chef and proprietor of the Tianjin Dumpling House, which is not so much a house as a narrow shaft of elbow room behind a sneeze guard in the basement of a Chinese food-vendors’ market on Main Street. The first dumpling of hers that I tried had a sea-bass stuffing cut with minced ginger, which gave bracing clarity to the few drops of broth sealed inside. It was so satisfying that at first I felt no need to branch out.  The dumplings were irresistibly priced, though, at about $5 a dozen, and I began to experiment with new ones: lamb and chopped zucchini humming with Sichuan peppercorns, maybe, or pork with threads of fresh dill. These were wildly good, too.  One day, I noticed a sign inviting me to pick my own custom dumpling fillings from a grid of 24 ingredients. This paralyzed me. Ms. You clearly had a kind of genius for creating miniature worlds of flavor. Who was I to tell her what she ought to fold into her circles of dough? It was as if somebody had handed me a box of feathers, bones, beaks and flesh and said, “Here, build a parrot.”  What I wanted was more of Ms. You’s recipes, not mine, and I got my wish earlier this year when Ms. You opened Dumpling Galaxy a few blocks from her original stall. Dumpling Galaxy sits back from the street, inside a shiny new mall it shares with a Korean-French bakery and a purveyor of sparkly false eyelashes. Ms. You designed the striking, modern interior herself, splashing bold Chinese red across walls with a basket-weave relief and building deep semiprivate booths, each with its own TV screen showing highlights of the 100 dumplings on the menu.  The Dumpling Channel goes heavy on cross-section shots that reveal the central core of filling. Take a good look, because this is a sight you should never see if you want to get the most out of a meal at Dumpling Galaxy. Resist the exploratory nibble. Dip one side in black vinegar and soy, and paint it with chile oil if you like, then pocket the whole thing in your mouth. It won’t gush with a waterfall of broth. It will, however, hold a few drops of liquid shed by the filling as the dumpling boiled. Those drops belong to you. Sometimes those juices taste like fresh green herbs, as when Ms. You mixes cilantro with minced lamb, or dill with excellent softly scrambled eggs. Sometimes they combine those qualities with a whiplash of heat, as in the head-twistingly good spicy beef dumpling, seasoned with scallions, fresh red and green chiles, and searing dried chile sauce.  As a young girl in Tianjin, China, Ms. You was taught to cook by her mother and grandparents. Her dumplings are sturdy, knobby, domestic creatures in the Northern Chinese tradition. Sometimes you see the ghostly outline of the fillings through the shiny white skins, and sometimes you can’t. But her dumplings are stuffed to order, and Ms. You fine-tunes them with the sensitivity of a natural cook who listens to her ingredients. Mixing shrimp with two varieties of celery, the more bitter and self-assured Chinese and the sweeter, shyer Western kind, and using both stalks and leaves, she builds exhilarating harmonies.  It would be a miracle on Main Street if all 100 varieties at Dumpling Galaxy were equally lovable. They aren’t. The one with shrimp, scallops and crab meat didn’t deliver the sweet seafood luxury it promised. Steamed har gow were less juicy than those wheeled around on the best dim sum carts. My strategy is to seek out the proprietary blends, which justify prices that can be slightly higher (as much as $7.95 for six) than those at other places in Flushing, including Tianjin Dumpling House. I’ve eaten entire meals that delivered less flavor than a single one of Ms. You’s dumplings stuffed with terrific little meatballs of duck and shiitakes. And if those hadn’t cheered me up, the fried dumplings would. Ms. You pours watery cornstarch into the pan, which bubbles and browns into a shatteringly thin, dumpling-studded pancake. Cracking that crust, I felt like the happiest guy in the galaxy.  That feeling wavered whenever I had to lean out of my booth with one arm extended for minutes at a time to ask for water or the check or for empty dishes to be cleared. It was like hailing a cab on Broadway at 5 p.m., but less effective. As time dragged on, I wondered why nobody had invented Uber for waiters.  Looking at the tables of Chinese families, I noticed that their dumpling consumption was considerably less piggish than mine. They might share a single order, a mere six dumplings, before moving on to the dishes from Northern China, Hunan and Fujian on the rest of the menu. (One cook specializes in each region.) I came to see the wisdom of allowing fish and vegetables to supplement all the boiled flour I was ingesting. The Hunanese preserved pork stir-fried with stubby lengths of pickled long beans was superb, both fiery and tart. Triple delight vegetables (green chiles, barely tender potato and eggplant so creamy it may as well be pudding) was an unusually good version of the Dongbei standby. Whole fish with spicy bean sauce was a hit at my table, even if we did use the marvelous sauce to obscure the fish’s slightly muddy flavor. You can find these dishes elsewhere, but no other kitchen offers such an embarrassment of dumpling riches, including dessert. Some sweet dumplings are pinched in dough like the savory ones, such as tart dried hawthorn berries with white wood ears, or pear with eight treasures, which I now think of as fruitcake pirogi.  Others, called tang yuan, are tinted orbs of dough that are springy and chewy, like mochi. My favorite was the pumpkin-flavored globe with a sugary paste of black sesame at the core.

175,Tuome,★★,2014-11-04,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/05/dining/restaurant-review-tuome-in-the-east-village.html,East Village,"Look inside the head of a bright young chef and you’ll see a beehive of swarming ideas, a few of them just hatched and others that buzzed in from somewhere else. It can take time to sort out which are borrowed and which have the sting of the new. Thomas Chen, fresh from the trenches at Eleven Madison Park and Commerce, opened his first restaurant in August, called Tuome. Like so many other places in the era of Noma, it is tastefully spartan in appearance. Its two small dining rooms are furnished with small tables set with small menus printed in small type. The wood chairs and metal bar stools are unsoftened by fabric or cushions. The lights are dim — not flattering, first-date dim but I’m-too-young-to-be-going-blind dim. In terms of glitz and glamour, Tuome falls somewhere between a yoga studio and Thoreau’s cabin. I’ve eaten in plenty of rooms like this over the last few years. And I’ve seen any number of dishes resembling these: the Nike swooshes of ultra-blended vegetable purées; the green leaves the size of chipmunk ears arranged just so over a deviled egg; the row of scallops all crouched together as if hiding from some scallop-hating predator on the other side of the plate. Clearly Mr. Chen and I have been following the same Instagram feeds. That egg, though. Wait a minute. This is something different. There is half of a hard-cooked white, deep-fried in panko. Spooned into the divot is a dot of deviled yolk, sharp with pickles and Dijon mustard. On top of that is a spoonful of fried garlic and dried chiles in their spicy red oil. It’s fun to feel the temperatures and textures, creamy and crackling and slippery, meet in your mouth, and to taste the strange collision of church-picnic-style eggs with a Chinese condiment. How can half an egg do three or four things at once? Later, a server points a siphon into the crook of an octopus leg. Out comes a suede-colored snowdrift. He says it’s brown-butter-and-potato espuma. I say it’s foam and I say the hell with it. I focus on the octopus, which crunches emphatically and has a rounded, slightly fruity flavor. With it is a chewy, chunky, lightly gingered XO sauce. Chopped caramelized pork and Chinese sausage give it the sweetness of bacon; fish sauce and dried shrimp take it broader and deeper. I can’t get enough of it. The foam will not be ignored forever, though. While it is not the most original notion, it does add something, unlike most foams. What it adds is a fluffy wave of toasted butter, like the frosting on a caramel cake minus the sugar and the heft. The dish is peculiarly good; it makes an extraordinary indulgence out of the octopus. And it shows off the clear and fresh point of view Mr. Chen brings to his cooking, particularly when he interprets Chinese flavors. Before working at Eleven Madison Park and Commerce, Mr. Chen was an accountant. The idea was to stay as far from restaurants as possible, and it came from his parents. After moving from China to New York City, the Chens operated a Chinese restaurant outside of the city. They wanted something higher for Thomas (he was Tommy at home, but on his parents’ lips the nickname came out “tow me,” which is how Tuome is pronounced), but after shepherding balance sheets by day and attending culinary school by night, he came to see cooking as the higher calling. A little more than two months in, Tuome is already starting to feel mature. The one-page wine list is seriously eclectic, but it’s not too cool for a Napa Valley cabernet and an Anderson Valley chardonnay. The servers take their jobs seriously, although I’m not sure the point has to be underlined by forcing them all to wear tailored T-shirts the color of wet cement. Mr. Chen doesn’t need to make his staff look like a modern dance troupe to tell people Tuome isn’t your average East Village spot; his cooking does that for him. (And the East Village average is getting higher every year.) He has terrific control over salt, spices, texture and contrast, weaving them together until you ask, why hasn’t anyone done this before? Adding slick duck fat to packets of Cantonese sticky rice steamed in lotus leaves seems like an obvious good idea. So does the extra crackle he puts into the Chinese sausage bits to save the rice from gummy monotony. But they aren’t obvious until you taste Mr. Chen’s version. A few dishes show off Mr. Chen’s technical command more than his originality. The scoop of chicken liver mousse with maple syrup pooled in a hollow on top, like the gravy on mashed potatoes, is exquisitely done, but feels familiar. Another dish fell out of focus between meals, when the carrot-miso purée accompanying seared scallops lost its savory, salty depth and became merely sweet. And there’s one I’d like to forget, a dully sweet squash soup impaled with frogs’ legs that were both mushy and stringy. But a striking number of dishes at Tuome are memorable for the right reasons. Serving sous-vide chicken on soupy rice cooked with garlic chives and shiitakes, Mr. Chen doesn’t try to sex up his homey inspiration, congee; he just makes it more layered and modern, surrounding the chicken with a dark basil jus, and lets the flavors quietly win you over. I wish he would take the same approach with pork belly instead of forcing it to do double-duty as a marketing event. Right now it’s called the Pig Out (a name meant for hashtagging), and it marches to the table as a $49 feast for two, 10 bite-size squares of pork belly riding on a slate shingle with a parade of sauces and bowls of spicy-peanut noodles following behind. The crashing cymbals can’t disguise how easily the dish, and its price, could be divided in half. But Mr. Chen has done something amazing to this pig. His inspiration may have been Cantonese roast pork, but these compressed, intensely flavorful squares of well-rendered belly partake of Peking duck, too. After I’d topped the reflective pane of skin with ginger-scallion sauce and a few drops of sambal from a squeeze bottle, I wanted to tuck the pork into a steamed bun or a crepe, and then chew and crunch and chew and crunch some more. Forget the gimmick. There are fresh ideas in this dish, and they are all Mr. Chen’s.",Tuome in the East Village,"['look', 'inside', 'head', 'bright', 'young', 'you’ll', 'see', 'beehive', 'swarming', 'idea', 'hatched',

176,Blue Hill,★★★,2014-10-28,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/29/dining/restaurant-review-blue-hill-in-greenwich-village.html,Greenwich Village,"Halfway through dinner at Blue Hill, my server presented me with two squashes. One was the common football-size butternut that weighs down shopping bags at this time of year. The other had the same shape but was about as big as a sparrow. I held it in my palm. It felt good in there. Without thinking about what I was doing, I began petting it. The couple at the next table asked if they could see my tiny squash, and I let them stroke its smooth, cool skin. Before things got too weird, our server took my pet squash back to the kitchen.  When it came back, it had been roasted and cut in half. Specks of white pepper and strands of grated chestnut lay against its dark orange insides. It was sweeter than a normal butternut, but what I mostly noticed was that it tasted squashier, as if all the flavor had been compressed. Selective breeding was responsible, our server explained. Dan Barber, Blue Hill’s executive chef and a co-owner with his brother, David, had asked a Cornell agriculture professor to design a squash for him, making it as small and tasty as possible. The result is the 898 squash, served exclusively at Mr. Barber’s two restaurants, Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Pocantico Hills, N.Y., and this one, just off Washington Square Park. Mr. Barber opened the one in Manhattan first, in 2000, with the idea of using local seasonal produce, including some from his family’s farm in the Berkshires. This put him in the company of, oh, several hundred other chefs. A few years later, though, he was chosen to lead an ambitious project at Stone Barns that combined a farm and a restaurant with research and education programs. It turned out that he was born for the job. Patient, intense, curious, enthusiastic, articulate, Mr. Barber has become a dirt poet and kitchen philosopher whose time outside with the pigs and the beans has had a deep, lasting effect on the way he cooks. Today no other chef has the information he keeps in his head (how to make pure carbon out of a cow’s femur) or the vegetables he puts in his ovens (sparrow-size squash).  To get the Full Barber, you have to go to Stone Barns for a $198 menu-free, open-ended meal that may include, if you’re lucky, a tour of the manure shed where hot compost is put to work as cooking fuel. The original Blue Hill sits in the English basement of a townhouse in Greenwich Village, a historically tolerant neighborhood whose tolerance does not extend to manure sheds. The city doesn’t afford the time or space for the leisurely unfurling of Mr. Barber’s complete vision of how our appetites should fit into the land and the climate. The low-ceilinged space is too much like a saloon, the tables too close together, the restaurant’s many ardent admirers too accustomed to treating it as a place to catch up over an excellent weeknight dinner.  If Blue Hill had as many cooks and servers as its more favored sister upstate, they would probably iron out wrinkles like the long, stranded layovers between courses; the wineglasses that sat empty and were finally cleared with no offer of fresh ones; and the $23 glass of Rully poured ice-cold, so it was clenched and astringent. It also seems far out of character that this intensely local restaurant sells just two New York wines on its Francophilic (and not very value-minded) list, and that its only cider comes from California when there is a cider revival going on in Mr. Barber’s own, apple-rich state.  But while it may give you only a Half Barber, Blue Hill is still an exceptional restaurant. Mr. Barber’s long search for flavor out of town pays off downtown, where you find yourself thinking, again and again, that each new ingredient may well be the best example of its kind you’ve ever tasted. For this reason and others, Blue Hill is one of the few New York restaurants that seem to get better and more original as time goes by. This was true the last time it was reviewed in The New York Times, in 2006, when Frank Bruni brought it from two stars to three, and it is true now. Dinner at Blue Hill can go in one of two directions: a four-course, $85 menu that you choose, or a longer, free-form “farmer’s feast” chosen by Mr. Barber or his chef de cuisine, Shingoon Hong, for $98 or $125, depending on how hungry the farmer is. Either way, the night will include a couple of surprise cameos by fruits and vegetables that drop in like the kooky neighbors in a sitcom.  A meal in September started with wispy young fennel stalks that had a clean and pure licorice sweetness and ended with firm, green-skinned, yellow-fleshed plums on ice. Both made me happy I had come to Blue Hill then, not a week sooner or later, which is the effect that certain fruits and vegetables can have when they’re picked at the right time. In a more recent meal, the kitchen sent out a raw hakurei turnip as big as an apple. In fact, it had been pushed through an apple slicer. I picked up a white wedge, swiped it through a pool of tarragon vinaigrette and braced for the harsh turnip aftertaste that never came. I won’t tell you that I ate the whole thing, or that it was as sweet and juicy as an apple, but it came much closer than I would have thought possible. When it comes to actual cooking, Mr. Barber’s approach is to intensify ingredients that are pretty intense already. Looking at the saturated orange color of fat slabs of roasted carrot “cutlet,” I could tell it was going to taste richer and rounder than any carrot I had met before. The approach works on things that once had a pulse, too. Grass-fed, dry-aged veal, carved into a sampler of cuts, some fattier, some leaner, was ruddier and more bloody-tasting than most veal, but it still had a focused, refined taste that set it apart from beef. The caramelized outside edge of a slowly roasted neck from a Blue Hill Farm goat had a profoundly satisfying chew; the meat hiding under it was astoundingly tender and juicy. It had some of the primal pleasures of barbecue, and I wanted to tear into it with my hands. In the early days of Blue Hill, I respected the cooking but didn’t want to wallow around in it the way I do now. The whole complicated web that Mr. Barber oversees has many purposes, spinning off in all directions, but if you just sit down to dinner, you can believe that the point of the entire operation is to provide you with one delicious taste after another. And maybe it is.",Blue Hill in Greenwich Village,"['halfway', 'blue', 'hill', 'presented', 'squash', 'common', 'footballsize', 'butternut', 'weighs', 'bag', 'shape', 'big', 'sparrow', 'held', 'palm',

177,Blenheim,★,2014-10-21,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/22/dining/restaurant-review-blenheim-in-the-west-village.html,West Village,"Morten Sohlberg designed the tables for Blenheim, the West Village restaurant he and his wife opened in May. The concrete tops are polished smooth with beeswax, and the sides are edged with copper. The shapes look irregular, but the sides are slightly bowed so that a pair of two-tops can spoon against each other and become a four-top. “That’s the idea, anyway,” our server said. “But they don’t all fit together.” Blenheim is like that, too. A tremendous amount of thought and effort has gone into the food, drinks and design, but they don’t always connect. This seems to have been an issue since the beginning. The first chef left about three weeks in because of what the owners called “irreconcilable differences.” In July, they hired Ryan Tate, who had been the chef at Le Restaurant in TriBeCa until it suddenly closed. I admired the $100 set menus he served there enough that I happily gave the place two stars in a review last year. Mr. Tate has set his ambitions even higher this time. Besides a sizable à la carte menu, he offers a $115, nine-course tasting loaded with extra dishes. At times, his cooking is as thoughtful and transporting as it was at Le Restaurant, but with a higher degree of intricacy. At other times, the kitchen is obviously struggling to keep up. Meanwhile, the service runs the gamut from charming and slightly lost to nonexistent. On my first night there, the disparity between the two was the widest I had ever seen in any restaurant. That is not the only disconnect. When tables are set up outside next to the cobblestone streets, Blenheim looks as if its only desire is to be your drop-in-and-hang-out corner tavern. The dining room, with an antique tree saw, a wooden yoke and a whole array of carpentry tools on the walls, looks like the historical society of some upstate village, where it would be the only tourist attraction. Underlining the point, servers tell you right away that this is a farm-to-table restaurant, that ingredients are trucked in from Blenheim Hill Farm in Schoharie County, southwest of Albany, owned by Mr. Sohlberg and his wife, Min Ye. You might reasonably expect pork cutlets, creamed corn, maybe pie. Mr. Tate has other ideas. Terrific ideas, often, even if they have as much business in a rusticated farm-to-table tavern as white tie and spats. The stream in Schoharie County where tilefish and sea urchin splash around together hasn’t been discovered yet, but at Blenheim they swim happily side by side on one plate. The tilefish falls into big, sweet white flakes that taste of shrimp. The urchin is whipped into a creamy, slightly briny sabayon that is like a richer, more luxurious taramosalata. Also on the plate are fat blueberries and carrots roasted in coffee bean oil. I can’t explain why blueberries taste so good with sea urchin sabayon, but they do. Alaskan king crab meat had been made almost as sweet and tender as some tropical fruit, but the midnight funk of squid ink sauce brought it back to the sea. With dense roasted chanterelles and wands of naturally pickled sea bean scattered around the plate, this was an appetizer you could go quietly crazy over. And it would take a crazy person to complain that Alaskan crab and sea urchin are insufficiently farm-to-table when they’re cooked this skillfully. Not that Mr. Tate turns his back on the owners’ land entirely. The carrots and the chanterelles come from Blenheim Hill Farm. So does the pork loin, which is slowly roasted until it drips with juices and then sent to the table with a cast of cool Southern characters: pickled peaches, okra charred to a crisp husk, and sorghum syrup, like molasses cut with espresso. Those are Blenheim lettuces and crunchy chips of smoked Blenheim ham in the gloriously crisp and fresh salad, and that’s creamy Blenheim pork fat spackling the side of the bowl. The lemon balm, thyme and pineapple sage in a sensational group of herb sorbets: Blenheim-grown. The gap between the farm-to-table ethos and Mr. Tate’s style is minor compared with the gulf between the restaurant Blenheim could be and the restaurant that currently sits at 283 West 12th Street. The same dish can be stunning one night and a contorted mess on another. The first time I had the roasted king mushrooms with spaetzle and sauerkraut, the mushroom stems had something like the flavor and texture of weisswurst. A German-inspired vegetarian main course with mushrooms standing in for sausages is a fantastic notion, and I couldn’t wait to taste it again when I returned. But when I did, the stems were watery inside and rubbery outside, like a steamed hot dog wrapped in a balloon. An unusual dessert soup of cooked barley and Champagne grapes in a chilled barley-jasmine tea went out of whack between visits, going from fascinating to weird. And there were glitches that were surprising in such a technique-focused kitchen. The grapefruit pearls with cured Tasmanian sea trout were meant to burst with juice, but they had solidified. Eating them was like chewing on the drippings of a grapefruit-scented candle. On Blenheim’s better nights, I might have ranked the food among the most exciting and interesting I’ve eaten in the last year. But it came to the table so very, very slowly that it was hard to stay excited or interested. It took more than three hours one night to order and eat appetizers, main courses and desserts. I wondered if the kitchen was overwhelmed. I was sure our server was. We had to flag him down to ask for more of the soft, warm and yeasty rolls made with Cheddar and Marmite. They never came. It took two tries and about 20 minutes to get a second glass of wine. We were left alone with menus for three-quarters of an hour before we waved like drowning sailors and begged him to take our order. “There are some additions to the menu tonight,” he began. Additions? When the kitchen can’t send out more than one course an hour, the menu needs subtractions. And Blenheim has no business offering nine-course tastings unless it is ready to provide pajamas and sleeping bags. Maybe its pieces would fit together better if there weren’t so many of them. I hope so, because I’d like to see it transform itself from a puzzle to a restaurant.",Blenheim in the West Village,"['morten', 'sohlberg', 'designed', 'table', 'blenheim', 'west', 'village', 'wife',

178,Huertas,★★,2014-10-07,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/08/dining/restaurant-review-huertas-in-the-east-village.html,East Village,"“They say we’re looking at two hours. They’ll call us.” This was the grim report from inside the latest East Village restaurant to have turned its no-reservations policy into a viral marketing campaign. A small, hungry mob was gathering on the sidewalk. Hoping to find a pleasant place to drink and snack until the phone rang, I herded my group to Huertas, a new Basque-leaning tapas place a few blocks away. The room smelled like garlic and smoke. A cured pig’s leg sat at the end of the bar, its ankle held tightly in a clamp. A sharp knife had exposed its interior architecture of meat and fat and sinew. Later, we ordered a few slices of this Iberico ham, and as it melted on our tongues, warm and salty, we all traded looks. We did it again when we ate crumbly shards of aged manchego that tasted of brown butter and caramel. The looks meant: This kitchen knows where to get the good stuff. That applied to many things we ate that night. Jonah Miller, Huertas’s chef, has written a concise menu of Basque-inspired tapas, not all of which could be called cooking and a fair amount of which is canned. I am not revealing any secrets here. Some food is still in its can when it comes to the table, like the dense mackerel in olive oil, which we ate, happily, on sliced baguettes with pimentón aioli. “All the best Basque seafood goes straight into cans,” our server told us, and she was so convincing that we asked if she knew a store that sold these marvelous cans. She did. She also knew where we could buy the manchego, which she was as excited about as we were. From the front door to the table, our service had been proactively friendly and enthusiastic. In New York, servers who learn that night’s menu are rare enough; here was one who seemed to know everything about every ingredient. She told us about a restaurant in San Sebastián, where the chef had come out of the kitchen to point out the most delicious parts of a turbot, showing her how to scoop out his favorite part, the cheeks. Then she took a deep breath and said: “Spain, you guys.”  It wasn’t all cans and hams in Mr. Miller’s kitchen, not that I would have minded. We asked for something called Huertas rotos, which turned out to be the Basque dish huevos rotos interpreted as a kind of pasta dish. Skinny threads of potato were cooked al dente and tossed with chorizo and its oil, with a soft-cooked egg on top. It was gone in 30 seconds. We drank vermouth, made on site, while every few minutes somebody came around with a tray of small bites straight from the kitchen. There was egg salad on a slice of baguette, with a sweet red shrimp on top; a golden croqueta of rice with creamy mushrooms in the center; and sweet roasted piquillo peppers stuffed with a cheesy, porky froth of fresh sausage whipped into goat cheese. These came in single servings that you could take or decline, depending on how good they looked and how hungry you were. Each plate you took was marked down on a card, dim-sum style, by servers.  Huertas calls these items pintxos, a Basque term for snacks smaller than tapas and pinned together with a toothpick. In Spain, pintxos do not circulate like dim sum. (Mr. Miller got the idea from State Bird Provisions in San Francisco.) Yet we felt much closer to the Spanish tapas-bar spirit than if we had ordered 10 or 15 “small plates meant for sharing” at once, passed them around the table and called it dinner. This is rarely a satisfying way to eat, but it’s how many Spanish restaurants in New York deal with tapas. The Huertas modified dim-sum approach was perfect for people like us, who want to start with drinks and see how the night goes without being forced to turn tapas into dinner.  The way this night went was that by the time the other restaurant called, we didn’t want to leave.  I went back to Huertas a week or two later. I had made reservations for the small, square back dining room, where Mr. Miller serves a set menu for $55. In the front room, the plates are unconnected episodes, and you supply the narrative yourself. In the back, you settle in while Mr. Miller tells a story in five courses. He started with a nod to the front room, a plate of little bites. There were gildas, found in every tapas bar in San Sebastián, sharp, clean and salty skewers of white anchovy threaded with spicy green pepper and an olive. There was a blistered mound of Padrón peppers and garlic shrimp on toothpicks, too, not the sweetest or firmest I’d ever eaten. This was an anomaly; in general, the cooking at Huertas stands out for its pure, fresh flavors. Then a separated egg. The white, fried, lay under a jumble of corn and tomatoes cooked quickly with crisp-chewy pimentón-cured bacon. The yolk, raw, sat on top and served as sauce.  Next was skate, sweet and still a little juicy inside, with roasted turnips and a pale-green, herbaceous sauce of puréed turnip greens and fennel. The seasonal Greenmarket aesthetic was familiar to me. Would any Basques recognize the dish? They would know the next course, wonderful garlic-and-pimentón-scented lamb hot dogs called chistorra, even though they would be used to seeing chistorras made with pork or beef. Alongside these house-made sausages, Mr. Miller had a wonderful succotash of late-summer beans. Dessert was a dream, a round and closely packed little goat-cheese cheesecake with a topping of candied almonds instead of a bottom crust. More tangy than sugary, the cake took beautifully to a sauce made from ripe nectarines. This night and a later one made it clear that dinner in Huertas’s back room ranks among the best deals in town, up there with the how-do-they-do-it bargains at Contra and Delaware & Hudson. Mr. Miller shapes his menus so skillfully that it’s hard to imagine wanting more. Still, once the familiar conventions of the modern tasting menu kicked in, I did steal a few looks at the front room, where a tray of hot croquetas always seemed to be going around. Maybe I wanted more spontaneity. Or maybe I just wanted a croqueta.",Huertas in the East Village,"['“they', 'we’re', 'looking', 'they’ll', 'call', 'us”', 'grim', 'report', 'inside', 'latest', 'east', 'village', 'turned',

179,Sammy's Roumanian Steakhouse,★,2014-09-23,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/24/dining/restaurant-review-sammys-roumanian-steakhouse-on-the-lower-east-side.html,Lower East Side,"“I want everybody to sing on this one,” the man behind the Casio at the far end of the dining room calls out. “Come on, the two North Korean Jews in the back!” Do I have to fill in the picture? To know where we are, do you need to see the smeared pitchers of schmaltz on every table? Smell the chopped garlic on every steak? Hear the yip of the small child whose head hits the ceiling as he is hoisted on a chair by adults drunk on “Hava Nagila” and Stolichnaya? Did you think the person commanding the imaginary visitors from North Korea to get up and dance the hora was the maître d’hôtel of Per Se? No, the only possible setting is Sammy’s Roumanian Steakhouse, the most wonderful terrible restaurant in New York. What happens at Sammy’s doesn’t happen at other restaurants, and vice versa. The rest of the Lower East Side can obsess over filament light bulbs and salvaged barn beams; Sammy’s, virtually unchanged since opening in 1975, will be ready when fluorescents and drop ceilings make their triumphant return to fashion. Inside the dining room, lighted like a bail bondsman’s office in Detroit, are hundreds of faded business cards, yellowed newspaper clippings and curled snapshots taped and tacked to every surface. Outside on Chrystie Street, scaffolding obscures the faded red and yellow painted signs in front of the building, which looks as if it has been marked for demolition. Like a Mississippi juke joint, Sammy’s seems to have been put together under the theory that nobody is likely to stay sober long enough to inspect the décor. (Known for selling vodka bottles encased in ice, Sammy’s is New York’s original bottle-service restaurant, and still the only tolerable one.) Other steakhouses can drive themselves crazy over internal temperatures. At Sammy’s, the meat will be cooked. If you have something more specific in mind, if you want it medium or black and blue, then write your request on a sheet of paper, tear it into small pieces and throw them into the air when the piano player sings “Happy Birthday.” Two times I asked for garlic-smeared skirt steak, called Romanian tenderloin at Sammy’s, cooked medium rare. One steak arrived medium well, and the other time a single steak ranged from well done to bloody, and every degree in between. I wasn’t asked how I wanted a broiled veal chop. It was seared on the outside and raw inside, the way other places serve tuna. When nobody asked how I wanted sweetbreads broiled, I feared the worst. Another surprise: Scored and blackened on top, they were close to perfect. The servers follow a template unique to this restaurant, too, dressed in Sammy’s T-shirts and jeans with a dishrag swinging from one pocket. Speed trumps ceremony. Standing over a metal bowl of chopped liver, they pour a cascade of schmaltz from on high, go at the liver with forks to mix in the shredded radishes, fried onions and lumps of fried chicken skin, and do not necessarily notice the stray bits that escape the bowl and land on the table. The ritual ends, not with “bon appétit” or “enjoy your meal” but with, “O.K., start eating.” The classic style of waiting tables at Lower East Side Jewish restaurants, by turns cranky, funny and crankily funny (discerning one from another could take decades of practice) probably died with Ratner’s, but flashes of it still surface at Sammy’s. One night, when we kept asking our server if we’d ordered enough, he rolled his eyes, checked his watch and said, “Tell you what: If you’re still hungry, the Chinese food will be here at 9:30.” Hungry we weren’t. As always at Sammy’s, I walked out feeling as if I had eaten a football stuffed with chicken fat and beef. The kitchen, so unpredictable when it comes to meat temperatures, is absolutely consistent in its ability to produce starch that detonates inside the stomach. The fried kreplach are grenades of dough with a tiny core of chopped meat that tastes like dough, too. The latkes are flavorless and textureless, but not weightless. Better than either, the kishke could stand some gravy and some salt. In fact, with the exception of the grandmotherly sweet-and-sour stuffed cabbage, almost everything at Sammy’s needed salt. Once it was added freely, the chopped liver was beyond reproach, the skirt steaks and lamb chops were excellent, and the fried silver-dollar potatoes were worth talking about. I can’t figure out why Sammy’s is cutting back on sodium after all these years, unless it is suddenly trying to atone for decades of treating schmaltz as a dietary supplement. The menu is less distinctively Romanian than it once was. The last review of Sammy’s in The New York Times, written by Mimi Sheraton in 1982, praised the Romanian salad of whipped eggplant with green peppers; the broiled brains; the mush steak; the pitcha, a seasoned gelatin made from calves’ feet and garlic; and the baked unborn eggs. The recent menus, stapled inside manila folders as they have been since the Koch administration, haven’t offered any of these specialties. This is how a culture disappears. But if Romania has faded, Sammy’s is still loudly, raucously, endlessly, embracingly Jewish, a permanent underground bar mitzvah where Gentiles can act like Jews and Jews can act like themselves. One night, I went with a woman who had spent the summer in Europe, as synagogues and Jewish-owned shops burned in one city after another. In Sammy’s basement, when strangers joined their hands in the air and danced between the tables, eyeing our food as they passed, I could see her grow less tense every minute. “It feels so good to be back in a place where I can be out,” she finally said. And if this is not your heritage — if you aren’t quite sure what is happening when the man at the keyboard belts out “Sing us a song, you’re the schmatte man” — the entertainers at Sammy’s will still get to you. Dancing and singing along to some dumb old tune being played by a musician in the corner: This is how people had fun in the Old World, by which I don’t mean just the parts of Europe where the Lower East Side’s Jews came from, but also the world before amplifiers and apps and first-person-shooter video games and all the forms of entertainment that drive us into ourselves. Sammy’s forces you out of yourself; I don’t think there’s another restaurant in New York where people talk to strangers as readily as they do here. “Would you like me to take your picture?” somebody at the next table asked one night. “Do you want our seltzer charger for your egg creams?” another asked us. As a table of about two dozen people filed out, a woman in the back called to them, “Thank you for dancing with us!” Is this a three-star restaurant, as Mimi Sheraton thought in 1982? By today’s standards, of course not. It is closer to one. But if you need stars to tell you what to think of Sammy’s, I’m not sure I want to share my seltzer charger with you. I’ll give it to those nice North Korean Jews instead.",Sammy's Roumanian Steakhouse on the Lower East Side,"['“i', 'everybody', 'sing', 'one”', 'man', 'behind', 'casio', 'far', 'end', 'call', '“come',

180,Claudette,★,2014-09-16,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/17/dining/restaurant-review-claudette-in-greenwich-village.html,Greenwich Village,"The age of French dining in New York that blossomed in the unpromising soil of the Corona ash dumps during the 1939 World’s Fair, at the French Pavilion’s restaurant, seemed to come to its close about 10 years ago as mastodons like Lutèce lumbered into the fossil record. Today, that seems less like the end of an epoch than a salutary cooling-off period.  If you are having trouble getting a reservation at a new place this year, odds are high that the menu is speckled with accents grave, acute and circumflex. Dirty French is turning away customers at the door. Keith McNally sent frogs’ legs marching to the rescue at Cherche Midi after his pizzeria there fizzled. And just north of Washington Square Park, at an address that had started to look like a certain restaurant-killer, the doors at a new Provençal spot called Claudette have been thrown open to reveal closely packed rattan chairs, none of them empty. Claudette’s charms are many and begin with those doors, which replace the woebegone sidewalk enclosure that used to make it look as if nobody were home. Losing a few seats has made reservations harder to land, but the reward is that the doors have let in the atypically cool breezes all summer, along with a view of lower Fifth Avenue’s wide, leisurely sidewalks, where somebody is always walking a bichon frisé.  Inside, Claudette looks like an expensive summer rental that is being used as a French street-corner cafe. (Rattan connects the two motifs.) The beach rental aesthetic is supplied by the whitewashed tables, throw pillows and shelves lined with books that are arranged by color and separated by anonymous knickknacks. Contributing to the cafe look are the compact bar and the winning cast of aperitif cocktails, which all seem to be named after Roger Vadim’s wives. Small, gentle and very appealing, the Brigitte and her cohorts cheerfully buck the trend toward potent, convoluted cocktails that don’t know how to behave at the dinner table.  Claudette’s food follows the example of the aperitifs; it is light, approachable and unlikely to impair your ability to stand up at the end of the meal. If you are in the mood for an intelligent salad, Claudette has plenty: green beans and vinegared hearts of palm with heaps of fresh mint; a nest of freshly shredded zucchini, still crisp under its anchovy vinaigrette; a crunch-fest of raw radishes and snap peas tugged in an unexpected, intriguing direction by cumin.  Even less expected was the cinnamon-laced raz al hanout spice blend dusted on the bistro-style fries. More brushes with North Africa lay ahead. Claudette makes an unleavened, layered flatbread, similar to traditional kesra, that is good when hot from the griddle, especially with a thick smear of pistou. (I couldn’t see the point of another spread, the bland and expensive hummus with chopped truffles.)  Gradually, it becomes clear that Claudette’s chef, Wade Moises, and chef de cuisine, Koren Grieveson, have made a smart decision about Provence. Rather than treating it as if it were frozen in time and sealed off from the world — Peter Mayle’s “A Year in Provence” repeated forever — they cast a few glances at the North African immigrants who live and cook there.  Claudette’s owners, Carlos Suarez and Mark Barak, were traveling in Provence when, like many English-speaking tourists, they fell under the sunny spell of Lourmarin. They had a charmed meal in that town at a restaurant founded by Claudette Sammut, a Frenchwoman who lived in Tunisia until the 1950s. Before it was over, they had asked her family if they could take her name back to Manhattan.  They brought her bouillabaisse, too, an eccentric white version that has a puff-pastry hat and lemon juice but no tomatoes and an undetectable quantity of saffron. I was not as smitten by its tenaciously sour broth as they were. As a sauce for the monkfish, baby octopus and shellfish, it might get by, but as a soup, it lost its appeal after a few spoonfuls, and even sooner the time it was oversalted.  A somewhat more successful souvenir from Lourmarin is the pieds paquets. Traditionally an all-day stew of sheep’s trotters and tripe, it has been de-trottered for New Yorkers. Or, as a server with an oratorical flair put it, “we absented the feet for cleanliness of flavor.” What we get instead are tripe-wrapped bundles of pork shoulder braised in white wine and tomatoes. Tender but polite, they are upstaged by the grilled bread, fantastic when dunked in the expanse of rust-colored sauce. As the absented feet suggest, Claudette’s exploration of Provence can be undercut by its impulse to play it safe, to water down the pastis. Braised chicken thighs on a bed of nutty toasted bulgur arrive in a tagine, but they aren’t cooked in one. When servers lift the glazed lid, the mint and other aromatics don’t rush into your lungs the way they would in Tangier. The tiny dab of harissa doesn’t go far, either. But the chicken is moist and well browned, the sauce gets sunny Mediterranean sweetness from oranges, and for complexity and originality, the dish leaves the other main courses in the shade.  After making its opening moves so gracefully, Claudette grows oddly clumsy at the end. The most reliable dessert is the pistachio cake sandwiching a layer of citrus cream, smartly accompanied by candied orange peel. But a chocolate pot de crème with harissa was grainy, and a supposed bread pudding of chocolate-almond croissants looked and tasted exactly like a stack of stale pastries.  Most of the time, though, the kitchen does what it sets out to do, even if it seems to be holding back. If Mr. Moises and Ms. Grieveson choose to dive a bit deeper into their vision of an African-tinged Provence, they could make the Gallic revival more interesting by cleaning the dusty windows of nostalgia through which New Yorkers like to view French cuisine.

181,Barchetta,★,2014-09-09,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/10/dining/restaurant-review-barchetta-in-chelsea.html,Chelsea,"You can count on one hand the chefs in New York who serve bluefish. Narrow the list to those with the confidence to serve it raw, and you’re probably down to one finger and one name: Dave Pasternack. The challenges of bluefish are formidable. If it isn’t iced right after it’s hooked, if it isn’t killed and chilled properly, if too much time goes by before it arrives at the table, bluefish has a habit of tasting and smelling like discount cat food. Its flavor is strong but its flesh is soft, and when it is raw, a dull, unsteady knife can reduce it to a bruise-colored pulp.  Of course I had to have it when I spotted it under the crudo section of the menu at Barchetta, which Mr. Pasternack opened in Chelsea in April. And of course it was immaculate: firm slabs of bluefish, standing at attention on a cold plate with olive oil, a few drops of lemon juice and inky green shreds of caper leaves. The rich oils melted while I chewed, and I was convinced that this particular specimen must have been slashing through the Atlantic while I had been brewing that morning’s coffee. In 14 years as the chef at Esca, Mr. Pasternack has proved to be one of the city’s most resourceful and skillful seafood cooks. It goes without saying that Barchetta, where Mr. Pasternack’s partner is John Meadow and his chef de cuisine is Christian Goerner, is a seafood restaurant. It is a very good one at times, but not at all times. There were encouraging nights, including the one that started with raw bluefish, when I was sure that Barchetta would become one of the first places I’d send people who really love the taste of fish. And there was one when it seemed mired among all the also-rans. Inconsistency in a seafood restaurant presents a quandary. Great ones are rare enough that seafood lovers will feel a strong tug to check out Barchetta and hope for the best, but they’ll also be tempted to stay away out of fear that they’ll hit it on an off night. This is not a problem that plagues diners who simply want a grilled pork chop. Fish cooking tends to be an all-or-nothing game, though. An extra day between the ocean and the table or an extra minute in the sauté pan can mean the difference between a memorable dinner and a wasted evening. The chefs who understand the factors that make that difference, and can navigate them, are in shorter supply than bluefin tuna.  I knew I was in the hands of one of those chefs on my first and second meals at Barchetta. Monkfish liver was treated like foie gras, darkly seared on the outside but as wobbly as pudding within. On the side were figs roasted into a jam-jar sweetness. The idea was both obvious and inspired.  The crudi were just the way I remembered them from Esca. Each fish was carved with a sushi chef’s sensitivity to fish anatomy, then given only as much added flavor as it could handle. To bring out the minerality and sweetness of pink snapper, there were plum-red grains of sea salt blended with Long Island merlot. Subtle, supple halibut belly was splashed with sunflower oil that was so mild it almost wasn’t there. Golden spotted bass, slightly more forceful, was given a light application of olive oil and lemon, while bluefish got a similar treatment but in the stronger dose that it needed. Main courses like wonderfully rich grilled kingfish steak, a roasted whole black sea bass and a bread-crumb-crusted hunk of pumpkin swordfish were pulled from the heat precisely at the moment their thickest sections had firmed, before they had a chance to seize up into a tough fist that would chase away their sweet oceanic juices.  On the night when the kitchen seemed to fall behind the beat, though, the skin on a grilled Spanish mackerel was too severely charred and the flesh had been heated a few degrees beyond the ideal. Toasted cracked hazelnuts and orange sections helped make up for it, and the dish wouldn’t have raised eyebrows in most other restaurants, but it lacked the finesse that I knew by then Barchetta is capable of. A handsome, thick cut of cobia had been left on the grill until it had the first signs of squeaky overdoneness and the grate had burned the bread-crumb coating. Raw blackfish dotted with pine-bud syrup was tougher than the crudi had been on other nights. Some greens in a relentlessly dull salad were showing their age. A bowl of pasta with mullet bottarga was swimming in olive oil that took the crunch right out of the toasted bread crumbs. A few excellent dishes surfaced from the murk, like the gently fried spearing and the appetizer of velvety marinated herring with raisins and cauliflower. The evening’s most memorable dish was a grilled lamb porterhouse, though, which says less about the lamb than about the kitchen’s struggles landing its catch. When dinner is less than transfixing, you have time to notice how incoherent Barchetta’s dining room is. Gone are the nightclub intimacy of Bette and the Riviera sparkle of Bistro La Promenade, the last two tenants. In their place is a mishmash of ideas: old nautical flags hanging beside new art from Chelsea galleries; Danish modern chairs mixed with tan simulated leather banquettes that would suit a Midtown coffee shop. On good nights, you’re more likely to notice how thoughtful the service is. Setting the tone is the outstanding rosemary focaccia that shows up while you’re still scanning the menu. Assistance with the wine list, about half Italian and priced to sell, is quick to arrive, too, and unusually perceptive. The general manager and wine director, George Hock, always seemed to know what my table wanted, translating a few vague adjectives and a not-so-vague price limit into a bottle that was just what we were looking for and then some.  At a fairly casual restaurant like Barchetta, wine service of this caliber is a gift. The total check, of course, is no gift, but it is very fair for fish at a place that never stoops to flabby farmed salmon. Barchetta could still turn out to be the seafood restaurant that downtown needs. If a nautical flag were flying over Barchetta’s door on West 23rd Street, it would be the one that means “Proceed, but exercise caution.”",Barchetta in Chelsea,"['count', 'hand', 'chef', 'serve',

182,Bar Primi,★★,2014-09-02,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/03/dining/restaurant-review-bar-primi-in-the-east-village.html,East Village,"Main courses are never as good as the starters, people like to say. I’ve always argued that a good chef won’t let that happen, but I have to admit that it does seem true for a lot of Italian restaurants, at least in New York City. There are exceptions, of course, but as a general rule, it’s all downhill after the spaghetti. One of several reasons to like Bar Primi, Andrew Carmellini’s new restaurant at East Second Street and the Bowery, is that there is almost nothing on the menu but appetizers and pasta. You can eat all the things you go to Italian places for without ordering a $35 grilled salmon simply to prove that you know fusilli is not considered a main course in Milan.  Mr. Carmellini and his partners (Josh Pickard, Luke Ostrom and Sal Lamboglia) have not exactly discovered life on Mars with this concept. After all, this is the founding principle of cheap Italian restaurants across the country. It’s unusual, though, to see it endorsed by a chef who knows better. Pasta is the whole point of Porsena, which the chef Sara Jenkins calls her “pasta-centric restaurant,” as you know if you’ve had the firm, chewy rings of anneloni tossed with fiery lamb sausage and bitter greens. But then her menu proceeds to a full roster of secondi. To be fair, Mr. Lamboglia, a longtime Carmellini cook who leads the kitchen at Bar Primi, does offer one main course a night on a weekly rotation. (On Wednesday, it’s the Italian sausage served at Mr. Carmellini’s Sausage Boss kiosks in Madison Square Garden.) Each time I was there, the servers also pushed a special, a grilled branzino “muffaletta,” which they said meant the fish comes with chopped green olives, like the sandwich. I ordered it once. It was fine. I preferred the pasta. The menu divides them into “traditional” and “seasonal.” We would be here for hours if I tried to figure out what is seasonal about orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe, a widely known classic from Southern Italy, or which tradition gave us spaghetti with a sauce inspired by clams casino. The important thing to notice is that there are 12 choices in all, and one of them is almost certain to be exactly what you feel like eating.  For me, on almost any given night, that would be the linguine with golden bread crumbs and garlic that’s been slapped around in hot olive oil for a minute or so. It may be because the kitchen is using this season’s garlic, but the sliced cloves (four of them, the menu says) tasted as juicy and fresh as corn and, in their oniony way, almost as sweet. For this, I paid $14 and counted myself lucky. Spaghetti pomodoro, also $14, is just as uncomplicated and just as right, with green basil clinging to plum tomatoes cooked to the halfway point between fruit and sauce.  Mr. Lamboglia makes those dishes with dried imported noodles. Most of the other pasta is fresh and very good. Its finest use may be the fiore di carciofi, a long, fat spiral filled with creamy artichoke and mascarpone. The sauce (a hot ladleful of fried bacon, garlic, chopped parsley and white wine) works mysteriously well with this mutant, vaguely flower-shaped cannelloni.  Bar Primi applies its sauces more liberally than a place in Parma might. Italian verisimilitude is not the goal. Mr. Carmellini and Mr. Lamboglia, who was raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, by a father who cooked for years in restaurants on and off Mulberry Street, have given the menu a red-sauce generosity, even when the sauces aren’t red.  Sal’s Antipasti Salad is basically an antipasto sampler of the kind usually seen on a checkered tablecloth — sliced salami and provolone, raw celery and radishes — thrown into a tossed salad with a small blizzard of Parmigiano-Reggiano. It’s impossible to dislike. Shrimp and octopus with boiled potatoes and pickled cherry peppers make a cold seafood salad that few checkered-tablecloth joints could rival. There are even meatballs filled with melted fontina in a rough tomato sauce. You want them to taste handmade, honest and delicious. They do. Grilled broccolini dressed with stewed onions and Aleppo pepper sits on a shiny, smooth brick-colored emulsion. It looks creamy and soothing. It is fierce, fiery and garlic-drenched, a fantastic trick played by the kitchen.  The menu has minor dips but no major sinkholes. That disassembled clams casino over spaghetti could do with more clams and less cleverness. The day I had orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe, the divots of dough weren’t as shiny with pork fat and olive oil as they might have been.  The idea for Bar Primi came to Mr. Carmellini years ago, before he left A Voce and built his fief of a half-dozen restaurants in New York and one in Miami. The chance to do it finally came along when Peels quietly shuffled out of business this year. Taavo Somer, an owner of that restaurant, was hired to rework his Peels design, mixing domestic idioms like white paneling and mullioned windows at tree-branch height with rustic Italian motifs, like wine shelves of unfinished wood. The result is an inviting, civilized spot, one that reaches back over the Bowery’s skid-row period to the brief age when the East Village was on Edith Wharton’s map of New York society. Within Mr. Carmellini’s fleet, Bar Primi is more a neighborhood hangout in the spirit of the Dutch than a big, booming circus like Locanda Verde or Lafayette. Like all of those places, and unlike the stereotypical linguine slinger, Bar Primi has a deeply affordable wine list you could happily get lost in. Off topic for a linguine slinger but very much on topic for a hangout, there is at all hours a great hot roast beef sandwich, shaved thin and kicked into action with spicy red pepper sauce. So sure of itself it is known simply as the Sandwich, it deserves to join the venerable epitomes of the genre found at Brennan & Carr and Roll-n-Roaster in Brooklyn. New Yorkers who have watched Mr. Carmellini’s game throughout his career may complain that he now rarely drives to the basket for the spectacular dunks he used to throw down when he was coached by Daniel Boulud. I made that complaint myself about the unimaginative, stubbornly un-French cooking at Lafayette when it opened. But a well-timed layup like Bar Primi can win games, too.

183,Bâtard,★★★,2014-08-26,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/27/dining/restaurant-review-batard-in-tribeca.html,TriBeCa,"A few minutes into my first dinner at Bâtard, it became obvious that the chef, Markus Glocker, has a sniper’s accuracy at the stove. Nothing on his gracefully composed plates was chewier or crunchier or softer or saltier than it wanted to be. Mr. Glocker’s kitchen chops were not exactly a surprise, given that he worked in Vienna for Heinz Reitbauer, in Chicago for Charlie Trotter and in London and New York for Gordon Ramsay, none of them ever known to have smiled indulgently at a young cook and said: “Don’t worry about burning those onions, kid. The customers won’t notice.”  Technical prowess is a fine thing for a chef to have, but it’s no guarantee of memorable, expressive cooking, just as a big vocabulary doesn’t necessarily mean an author will write books worth reading. In both cases, you need to have something to say.  Mr. Glocker has many things to say, and he says them clearly and with charm, as I learned over three excellent meals since Bâtard opened in May. Some dishes were so successful they seemed destined never to leave the menu. One was the springtime-sweet bowl of minted pea soup with fried sweetbreads that seemed more flavorful than anybody else’s sweetbreads. Another was a kind of bouillabaisse in which rabbit (a roasted loin, a perfectly cooked kidney and saffron ravioli with a light and delicately herbed rabbit filling) splashed around in the tomato-fennel-saffron broth. A month later, both dishes had been retired, and in their place was something new and just as wonderful.  A fried zucchini flower, filled with bits of poached prawns and served with lightly candied lemon zest and whole pieces of poached lobster, was a full immersion in summer, a swim in a clear pond in the pines. A slab of octopus terrine, small circles of leg pressed together with smoky pastrami spices and dabbed with whole-grain mustard, evoked an entirely different terrain, nodding to the delicatessen, though the nuggets of braised ham hock, as rich and seductive as tuna belly, won’t be found at Katz’s.  The complexity of Mr. Glocker’s plates never blurs the focus of his flavors. Every drop of sauce and pinch of seasoning extracts some new pleasure out of the main ingredient. There is joy in his cooking. There are high spirits in Bâtard’s dining room, too, which hums and at times roars with the sound of people having a fine night on the town. This was not frequently heard during this restaurant’s last incarnation, Corton. Everyone whispered as if a baby were sleeping in the next room. Even Drew Nieporent, the avuncular saloonkeeper who has held the lease on this address since he opened it as Montrachet in 1985, seemed to tread across Corton’s carpet on tiptoes. The carpet is gone. Mr. Nieporent and his partners in Bâtard, Mr. Glocker and John Winterman, last seen as maître d’hôtel at Daniel, had it replaced with herringbone floorboards. The white tablecloths have been whisked away, too.  The architect Glen Coben gently raised the temperature on the interior that Stephanie Goto designed for Corton, which was elegant but aloof, more like a modern-art gallery than a restaurant. The walls that lean in and their twirling vines in bas-relief are flush with a tobacco-resin hue borrowed from Keith McNally’s crayon box. Banquettes that had been covered with scallion-green fabric are now dark leather and mohair.  If the bare tables and floors weren’t enough to raise the decibel level, the amount of drinking going on would. Mr. Glocker’s cooking plays well with others, and his flexible à la carte menu, with a choice of two courses ($55), three ($65) or four ($75), encourages you to get to know a bottle or two. For some drinkers, it will be impossible not to order Burgundy at a restaurant called Bâtard, and Jason Jacobeit, the head sommelier, is happy to oblige. Swimming alongside the white whales, the La Tâche and Romanée-Conti grand crus, are some lesser-known Burgundies at what are, by the region’s standards at least, reasonable prices. (The list, however, needs more bottles under $60, no matter where they come from.) Nonconformists will find blue-chip Napa Valley wines and a deep pocket of whites from Alsace, Germany and Austria, where Mr. Glocker was born. Bâtard is hardly a cruise down the beautiful blue Danube, but the kitchen can give you an excellent Viennese dinner in the form of the Poussin schnitzel, a special in perpetuity, and the Sacher torte, a special on occasion. Both are classical, the chef’s fingerprints visible only in details like the mouthwatering sea buckthorn jam and unaccountably exciting potato salad with the schnitzel. When Bâtard begins serving food at the bar, I suspect that every stool will be taken by a schnitzel-eater.  Full of ideas, Mr. Glocker comes up with the desserts, too. His caramelized milk bread with berries and brown-butter ice cream is already a certified hit, the song of the summer that radio failed to provide this year. A slice of white bread, rich like brioche, has been glazed on both sides with a shatteringly thin shell of melted sugar. It looks like the simplest thing in the world, but if it’s so simple, why isn’t everyone making it? Other desserts are good, but not so good that the restaurant can do without a full-time pastry chef forever. The flat-footed key lime pie should be repaired or replaced, and the poached fruit in a moat of sparkling wine was a little too Ladies Who Lunch for me. Mr. Winterman, the general manager, has put together a lovely little cheese cart, although he hasn’t figured out how to show it off. “We have several goat cheeses,” my server said one night. “Some cheese from France, of course. Some cheese from Vermont.” Finding this picture a little vague, I asked to see them. This seemed to catch him off guard. “I could bring the cart over,” he said, “but it would be a little tight with these tables.” The cheeses are much too good to be stranded on a landlocked cart. For now, you have to rely on Mr. Winterman to choose, and hope you’ve come on a night when he has the honey made by downtown bees who do their buzzing above a Shoegasm store.  There is another dance routine that needs practice. Maybe somebody imagined it would be fun for customers who get the vast, pink, terrific lamb chop to serve themselves lamb confit out of flame-colored Le Creuset pots. It’s an awkward fishing party. The confit is some kind of new achievement in flavor and tenderness, but to get it out of the pot, you have to lift your butt off the seat. A few cards have yet to fall into place, but Mr. Glocker and Mr. Winterman are reshuffling the deck to get a fresh combination of refined and relaxed dining, a game Mr. Nieporent has played for years. One night, Mr. Winterman showed me a cross-section of a tree trunk. (Neither he nor Mr. Nieporent pretended not to recognize me.) He thinks it would be fun to drag it out to the dining room and let customers test their skill at Hammerschlagen, a game Germans play with a hammer and nails. If the baby isn’t awake yet, that should do the trick.",Bâtard in TriBeCa,"['minute', 'bâtard', 'became', 'obvious', 'markus', 'glocker', 'sniper’s', 'accuracy', 'stove', 'nothing', 'gracefully',

184,Ivan Ramen,★★,2014-08-05,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/06/dining/restaurant-review-ivan-ramen.html,Lower East Side,"Years from now, when PBS runs its six-part documentary about David Chang, Roy Choi and the other American chefs who over the last decade have cracked open Asian cooking traditions and hosed down the pieces with pork fat, I hope an episode will be devoted to the triple pork triple garlic mazemen at Ivan Ramen. The camera will pan majestically across “The Art of the Slurp,” Nathan Fox’s manga-style strip that hangs over the counter and starts with a fat boy in a Batman mask snapping his chopsticks apart, as a narrator intones: “In 2014, Ivan Orkin, a Long Island native who grew famous cooking ramen in Tokyo, opened his flagship restaurant on the Lower East Side.” The plucking of a samisen fades out; punk guitar chords clang; the screen is filled with a close-up of a noodle bowl. “Developed in Japan around the turn of the 21st century, mazemen is a drier variation on ramen, more like pasta than soup. Mr. Orkin dressed fresh whole-wheat noodles with a slab of simmered pork belly, chopped bacon and enough pork-bone stock to moisten the noodles. Then came the garlic: raw, pickled and roasted.” Cut to a heavyset, white-haired, unshaven, downtrodden man in pajamas, identified as a former restaurant critic for The New York Times. “Actually, there was a fourth pork and a fourth garlic in there,” he says. “Garlic oil and pork fat. Maybe Orkin thought ‘quadruple pork’ sounded too much like ‘quadruple bypass.’ Those ingredients could have gotten into a shouting match, but they were harmonious. It was like a summation of all the lard-wallowing and umami-slinging that had rippled through American food since the first drop of grease ran down the chin of the first customer who tried a Momofuku pork bun. I could eat a bowl of that mazemen right now, if they would let me have anything besides kale pellets.” Get that old guy off the screen. He’s bringing me down, though he’s right about the triple pork triple garlic mazemen. It’s an undeniably intense dish that shows how energetically and skillfully Mr. Orkin colors outside the lines of Japanese cuisine. Since Ivan Ramen opened in May, there is usually a line for the single restroom but rarely one to get in the door. Some of the pent-up steam in the ramen community may have escaped late last year, when Mr. Orkin opened Slurp Shop, in Gotham West Market. A quick-service counter with a noodle-dominated menu, Slurp Shop is a fine introduction to Mr. Orkin’s ramen philosophy (essentially, make everything — noodles, broth, droplets of fat on the surface of the soup — better), but not to his full breadth as a chef. For that, you need to go to Ivan Ramen, where he invests in creativity well outside the scope of standard ramenyas. Mr. Orkin supplements the noodles with dishes that cover many bases, though not the sweet one just yet. Desserts are promised down the line. As suggested by a dining-room collage made of hundreds of pictures of Asian and Western pop icons and foodstuffs, Mr. Orkin’s cultural allusions are quick and funny, and come from several directions at once. He makes a whacked-out vegetarian chili dog with fried tofu in place of the frank, a rich and intense stew of mushrooms and miso as the chili, and a squiggly line of American yellow mustard. (There’s no substitute for yellow mustard.) Called a Tofu Coney Island, it’s a joke that tastes great. That was true for the JFC, too: deep-fried chicken hearts and livers with a honey-mustard sauce that tasted similar enough to the traditional McNugget garnish to make me laugh, and different enough (sharper, stronger and enriched with ponzu) to make me want more. The Japanese borrowed ramen from China, and Mr. Orkin keeps up the custom. There is steamed Chinese broccoli with soy-pickled garlic, as well as a salad of crunchy daikon threads topped with spicy, funky XO sauce. On tables that could become laden with pork very quickly, each was a cool, welcome oasis. The pork tended to disappear as quickly as it arrived. True, the scrapple waffle, a takeoff on Japanese okonomiyaki, hadn’t moved beyond the gimmick stage; it was all crisp, bland surface without the peculiar bits of fat and face that excite scrapple fans and terrify everybody else. But the improbably fluffy tofu-pork meatballs catapulted themselves into my mouth at the slightest encouragement, and little do-it-yourself handrolls of nori spread with sushi rice and pulled roast pork, as slick and rich as carnitas, were gone almost before I noticed the bright, sweet-sour relief they got from roasted tomatoes. As our server promised, roasted tomato performed the same favor for a cheese mazemen, a kind of Japanese alfredo. Servers at Ivan Ramen are always pushing add-on garnishes for the noodles for an extra $2 or $3. “All our ramens are improved by an egg,” we were told one night. If Mr. Orkin thinks his ramen is better with an egg, he should put an egg on it, and charge accordingly. Value is a sticky issue with ramen. Because it is served in a minute and eaten almost as quickly, it seems to call for fast-food prices. It takes more than a minute to prepare, though, particularly at Ivan Ramen, where the noodles are made in the kitchen from rye or whole-wheat flour. Springy and hearty, they are exceptional. The broths are painstakingly simmered until their flavors are deep and focused, particularly in the vegetarian ramen’s soy-mushroom stock and the shio ramen’s base of dashi stirred into a golden chicken soup that a grandmother might want to steal credit for. The most expensive ramen is $15, or $17 with the suggested egg. The mazemens, a form Mr. Orkin has mastered more fully than anyone in the city, justify the price. (The red-hot cold mazemen, dressed with salty, spicy sesame and accessorized with two prawns, should settle any doubts.) The soup ramens do not, at least not yet. Several times, the broth arrived well below the scalding heat that gives ramen its temporal dimension, as you race to eat the noodles before they go from slightly undercooked to al dente to overdone. The soups at Ivan Ramen barely changed, so there was no rush, no need to illustrate the art of the slurp. Maybe mine sat too long in the kitchen. The ramens shouldn’t stop just short of the finish line when so many other items on the menu sail right over it.",Ivan Ramen,"['year', 'pb', 'run', 'sixpart', 'documentary', 'david', 'chang', 'roy',

185,Russ & Daughters Cafe,★★,2014-07-29,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/30/dining/restaurant-review-russ-daughters-cafe.html,Lower East Side,"Because the kippered salmon, the slippery pink lengths of matjes herring and the shiny white sturgeon at the new Russ & Daughters Cafe are the same products you can take home from the old Russ & Daughters shop a few blocks away on East Houston Street, a cynic may say that the restaurant offers nothing more than an opportunity to eat the proprietors’ fish on their plates instead of yours.  To which I’d say: What’s wrong with that? The cafe, which opened in May, is modeled on the store, to an almost obsessive degree. Backlit signs in black and white proclaim the presence of sardines, chubs, rugelach and pickles by the barrel. Below the signs are boxes of matzo and jars of chocolate-covered jelly rings. In the center of the restaurant sides of salmon and whole, golden-skinned whitefish with their slit bellies pointing up wait in a refrigerated case until they are sliced to order by a counter worker in a white jacket, just as on Houston Street.  But Niki Russ Federman and her cousin Josh Russ Tupper, the fourth-generation owners of the family business, have added to, elaborated on and deviated from the store in ways that make the cafe a three-dimensional restaurant, not just a theme-park homage designed to cash in on the original’s popularity. Take, for example, the rye bread. Everybody talks about good Jewish rye but hardly anyone has tasted it. To get a rye that deserved to share the table with their smoked fish, the owners imported a baker from Massachusetts known for his artisan loaves, Gordon Weissman. His rye is dense and rugged, with a crisp, ragged crust, a sourdough depth and a generous strafing of seeds, not just caraway but also onion-scented nigella. Called shissel, the bread is as different from most ryes as bourbon is from light beer.  Or take the way that items the store is known for have been worked into the menu. Halvah is sold by the block, but shouldn’t be eaten that way. It should be eaten this way: broken into chewy bits and scattered over rich sesame ice cream along with salted caramel sauce and a spackling of sesame seeds.  Or take the new line of dishes from the Eastern European Jewish canon that are not sold at the store, like the baby knishes stuffed with potatoes and caramelized onions. Over the years the New York knish has become so dense it could be used as an anchor for a small boat. These little specimens are light and fluffy, and they taste not like flour and grease but like baked potatoes.  Or take the bar, situated by the front door on Orchard Street. How does a 100-year-old temple to sturgeon get into the cocktail trade? With a reimagined old-time soda fountain of the kind that would have blasted jets of seltzer into egg creams when Joel Russ, newly arrived from Galicia, in what is now Poland, was selling herring from the barrel on the Lower East Side. The white-jacketed bartender makes fresh cucumber soda, cherry shrubs, egg creams and excellent Bloody Marys.  He looks as if he belongs there, and the drinks, with Eastern European flavors like caraway, taste as if they belong, for the most part, although my egg cream was not as volcanically fizzy as it might have been. There is a small but well-considered wine list, too. The sparkling wines, especially the less expensive ones from outside Champagne, might have been made to go with smoked-fish platters like the Anne, which collects some of the store’s most luxurious treats on a briefcase-size board: its famous sable and Western nova smoked salmon, its underrated brook trout, its extraordinarily fine wild salmon roe and its “private stock” sturgeon. I asked our waiter what made it private stock.  “They get a lot of high rollers at the store, some very particular customers,” he said. “This one lady came in and asked for sturgeon, but when they started to slice it, she said: ‘No, no, no. I don’t want your regular sturgeon. I want your private stock.’ ” This private stock of sturgeon did not, as of yet, exist, but the slicer obligingly found her an unusually sleek specimen. From then on, the fattiest fish would be kept under the counter for customers who would not settle for the regular sturgeon. (As with many stories about Russ & Daughters, the waiter’s account has the ring of folk legend. When I asked Jen Snow, who has the title of Yenta at the company, whether it was historically accurate, her response was long and began with “Oy vey.”) At the restaurant, private-stock sturgeon is advertised but is still a high-roller item; the Anne platter goes for $90. The Anne feeds three or four people. And it does come with a basket of the excellent rye and other breads; a very good, crisp salad of thin-sliced potatoes with mustard; the house cream cheese, which sets the standard for the rest of the city; and all the usual fixings. Still, $90 is not bupkis, and it is not the only disconcerting price at Russ & Daughters Cafe.  Forget the caviar service, which starts at $105 for 50 grams of paddlefish and inclines swiftly from there. At the store, long admired for competitive prices on tins of fish eggs, the same 50 grams cost about half as much. The markups are an unpleasant surprise, and guarantee that for most value-minded diners, the caviar section of the menu will be strictly a curiosity.  At $60, the scrambled eggs with paddlefish caviar may seem like a more reasonable splurge. But when I had it, Mr. Weissman’s challah, although toasted, was going stale and the eggs didn’t have the voluptuousness achieved at, say, Jean-Georges. Some everyday items seem out of line, too, like $22 for four slices of sturgeon with butter, capers, tomatoes, onions and a serviceable bagel.  For most people, fish on a bagel may not be enough reason to go to a restaurant at night. Russ & Daughters Cafe is open from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., with the same paper place-mat menu day and night. You could certainly make a light supper from one of the egg dishes, especially the creamy and soft scramble with onions and lox. (How did the Lower East Side get along without this?) But that is a meal best enjoyed alone with a book. The kitchen offers very little that will provide enough traction for a group of friends engaging in a round of cocktails followed by a bottle of wine.  Unlike most New Yorkers, the menu looks best by daylight. Most helpings are modest, good for noshing. Salmon roe and crème fraîche with latkes, with hard-shell exteriors and fluffy white interiors, seem like breakfast. So does the sturdy bagel chip piled up with whitefish and salmon salads and flying-fish roe infused with wasabi. At lunch the excellent cold borscht could lead up to the herring sampler featuring rollmops, Swedish matjes and pickled herring, which has immediately joined the small list of dishes whose flavor helps define New York.  The cafe might have a stronger nocturnal allure with a separate dinner menu or beefed-up portions of plates like the latkes. And it might look into slicing Mr. Weissman’s breads closer to the dinner hour so they aren’t as fatigued. I’m not expecting to see any big changes right away, though. This is, after all, a business that took a century to give its customers a place to sit down.",Russ & Daughters Cafe,"['kippered', 'salmon', 'slippery', 'pink', 'length', 'matjes', 'herring', 'shiny',

186,Racines NY ,★★,2014-07-22,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/23/dining/restaurant-review-racines-ny-in-tribeca.html,TriBeCa,"You can’t get mad at a macaron, but with all due respect I’d suggest that there are other French ideas about eating that would benefit New York more than balloon-weight sandwich cookies in sidewalk-chalk colors. We could, for instance, use a few wine bars of the type that began sprouting around Paris about a decade ago.  Like traditional bars à vins, they have closely considered wine lists whose length and prices are geared for the curious drinker, but they championed winemaking’s noninterventionist avant-garde before that was the thing to do. They also flicked the dust off the traditional menu of ready-to-go standbys like hams, cheeses, terrines and open-face sandwiches. Sure, there is excellent charcuterie, but there is some cooking, too, and it betrays care and originality. For the chefs of small restaurants like Septime and Frenchie that are full nearly every night, the wine bar next door has become the preferred way to expand. Racines, which the chef Pierre Jancou opened in 2007 under the glass roof of a 19th-century shopping arcade on the Boulevard Montmartre, was an early example of this breed and one of the most militant. It poured only wines made without sulfur, which even most purists admit can keep good bottles from going bad. Mr. Jancou was a believer, and he could be intolerant of those who didn’t share the faith. If you thought one of his wines smelled like a running shoe filled with Gorgonzola, fine. You could go elsewhere and drink Bordeaux with the rest of the heathens. If not for the name, you would never guess that Racines NY, which appeared in TriBeCa this spring, is any relation. It’s three times the size of the 20-seat original. The service is solicitous. The sommelier, Arnaud Tronche, genuinely appears to care whether people like what they’re drinking. Sulfur, in minimal doses, is tolerated. This being New York, prices at the low end of the long, mostly French list aren’t as low. And although wine will be the main event for many people, Racines NY is not a wine bar. It’s a restaurant — or “neo-bistro,” in the words of the owners: Mr. Tronche; David Lillie, a partner in Chambers Street Wines, down the street; and David Lanher, who bought the first Racines from Mr. Jancou in 2009. In other words, the menu is meant for dining, not snacking. Nor for sharing, either, although my attempt to keep my fork out of my wife’s plateful of whole, warm Oregon morels on a pool of half-liquid burrata failed miserably.  For the most part, the chef Frédéric Duca’s appetizers are opening moves, and very elegant ones. Mr. Duca served a length of barely seared wild salmon, the raw flesh inside the intense orange-red of a persimmon, with a scoop of cucumber sorbet and a schmear of warm cauliflower cream. These are two of the mildest vegetables in existence, so combining them would not seem like a formula for excitement, but it was like watching summer and winter meet for the first time. Raw veal with warm mayonnaise probably doesn’t sound like a bell-ringer, either. But with pine nuts and tarragon folded into cubes of meat, it made a delicious tartare, unorthodox but unmistakably French.  Mr. Duca, who grew up near Marseille, had begun to win recognition as the chef of L’Instant d’Or, in Paris, when Mr. Lanher talked him into moving to Chambers Street. Transplanted chefs often need time to find the right suppliers. But almost every ingredient I tasted at Racines NY was fresh and swimming with flavor. If you haven’t fully wallowed in berry season yet, go and get the full, dark-red strawberries layered over basil panna cotta. It’s currently the star dessert, outclassing a tart of chocolate and salt caramel that comes across as a knockoff (though as knockoffs go, it’s very well made). And his main courses are events: the hanger steak over a smoky eggplant purée with blistered shishito peppers and a rustle of cumin somewhere in the background; the red snapper with octopus and fantastic mussels fried in herbed bread crumbs, one of the nicest treatments I’ve seen anyone give a mussel in a long time; the lamb cooked two ways, most impressively as a braised shank with a deep, almost gamy intensity that fought it out with a teasingly bitter salsa verde made from arugula.  All of these dishes are brought to a pitch of refinement that is somewhat at odds with the wine-bar spirit. True, Racines NY doesn’t claim to be a wine bar. Neither does its Parisian ancestor. But New Yorkers keep talking about it as if it were one, and it’s easy to see why. A big, open bar dominates the dining room, which doesn’t have the sense of occasion you expect from a restaurant or bistro. In fact, it’s pretty generic. The walls are white or brick; the light fixtures are black and simple; the small vineyard photographs are black-and-white on white matte inside skinny black frames. Bottles, an easy and cheap decorative motif, are inexplicably absent from the shelves behind the bar’s barren white surface, which could be mistaken for the cosmetics counter at Barneys. Not every French restaurant in New York needs to look like Bofinger, but does this one really have to look quite so much like a spread from the Restoration Hardware catalog? Especially if you are spending $35 for the morels or $38 for the lamb, prices that approach those of the entry-level wines, you might hope for a room that you could picture when you close your eyes the next day.  Some New Yorkers will keep Racines NY out of their regular rotation because it doesn’t look French enough. This would be, to put it kindly, dumb. Dinner and drinks at Racines NY come as close as anything in Manhattan to the flavors of Paris today.  The last night I ate there, the wine directors for Piora and the Momofuku group were in the house, cherry-picking the list. It doesn’t take an expert to get a great glass at Racines NY. Stuttering a few disjointed syllables to Mr. Tronche, I ended up drinking a rich, almost tropical Sancerre from Sebastien Riffault, poured from a magnum; a dessert wine from François Pinon, a Vouvray with acidity and sweetness so closely balanced I found it hard to believe; a Reagan-era verdelho, a mere toddler as Madeiras go, that is one of the best companions for a cheese course I’ve ever met. Mr. Tronche could probably even find a wine to get me excited about macarons.

187,Grindhaus,★★,2014-07-15,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/dining/restaurant-review-grindhaus-in-red-hook-brooklyn.html,Red Hook,"On April Fools’ Day 2008, a former music publicist and retired dominatrix named Erin Norris signed the lease on a derelict Brooklyn storefront where she intended to open a sausage restaurant called Grindhaus. Almost immediately, the universe began sending her a message: don’t.  The space had structural weaknesses, and propping it up would become a long, expensive project. Gas burners would not be an option. Nor would the grinding and stuffing of sausages in bulk; as it turned out, there wasn’t enough room. Ms. Norris ran out of money, raised more, blew through that, scraped up a little extra, spent it on the best kitchen equipment she could afford, and announced that she would open soon. The universe, surmising that the message wasn’t getting through, sent a flood. The night of Hurricane Sandy, water filled the streets of Red Hook and filled Grindhaus, too, wrecking all that kitchen equipment.  By this point, the signs had to be clear. Evidently Ms. Norris didn’t care, because she mucked the place out, banged in new, mold-free walls, began a Kickstarter campaign to fund repairs and fresh equipment, and hired Aaron Taber, a chef she had met at the dog run.  The 20-seat restaurant she opened last December, without the sausage theme, is still called Grindhaus. This may be a sign of Ms. Norris’s stubbornness, or it may show that she grasps a basic principle of business: When you have a restaurant name that suggests a lost Russ Meyer film set in a German wurst hall staffed by karate-kicking supervixens who are barely contained by their black-leather dirndls, you don’t give it up because you can’t serve sausages. Grindhaus is not entirely sausage-free. I did eat a few pinches of fresh merguez there once. It was terrific stuff, rich and spicy, folded inside fresh cappellacci. Around these pasta bundles, Mr. Taber had set a snake-curve of charred scallion, confidently seasoned chickpeas and yogurt for a sauce. There were also balls of chickpea cakes called panisses. Panisses may not seem to go with pasta, but these were good enough to go with any dish they wanted.  In his short cooking career, Mr. Taber has worked at the Pines in Brooklyn and made dough for a mobile pizza oven. At Grindhaus, his first post as chef, he cooks alone in a kitchen almost exactly the dimensions of the restroom. He makes the kind of earnest, fashionably austere, handsomely arranged food that is signified on menus by sans-serif lists of ingredients, with no capital letters, verbs, articles or hint of how one thing may relate to the next. In some restaurants, they don’t relate. At Grindhaus, they do.  The first thing I ate there was written this way: rutabaga  carrot, sorrel, grapefruit Was it a salad? A soup? A purgative juice blend? No. It was a delicious and ingeniously simple vegetable tart. A buttery pie shell was just big enough to contain a thick, soft wheel of rutabaga held in place by a layer of puréed carrots. The lemonlike bite of raw sorrel and the true citrus of grapefruit acted as welcome rays of sunlight breaking into this ode to the root cellar. Mr. Taber’s style of cooking is often found in druidic, wood-filled restaurants with tasting menus, cupboards stacked with hand-thrown pottery and painfully earnest names derived from natural materials, like Resin. Grindhaus isn’t as high-minded as those places. It has some rock ’n’ roll in its trousers.  A steel silhouette of a broken wine glass hangs in the front window, and the jagged shards attached to the stem look like the fingers of a hand raised in a heavy-metal salute. The framed sketches of the heads of Keith Moon and Brian Jones were drawn in high school by a friend of Ms. Norris’s whose later work, under the name Cynthia Plaster Caster, would depict other regions of rock-star anatomy.  On the bar is the stuffed head of a white horse, its gaping mouth now a vase for eucalyptus branches. Like most things in Grindhaus, the head has a story. It was made to Ms. Norris’s specifications by a taxidermist who waited three years for a dead horse in the right color to come along. “The throat was to open up so it could have a lot of ephemera and antique drug paraphernalia, prescriptions from the 19th century,” Ms. Norris said. Even if you never figure out what’s in the horse’s throat, the head with its flowing mane still works its spell as part of Grindhaus’s invitation to let it loose and come on down. It’s not a rowdy place, but it is one where classic rock may play all night. It’s a place where I felt quite at ease singing along to “Volunteers” while tearing off a fistful of sourdough bread, which Mr. Taber bakes inside a cast-iron pot to give it a crust that is as stiff, crisp and dark as bread crust can get without being burned. It’s a place where certain flavors, like the seared foie gras with ripe strawberries in warm strawberry-rhubarb juice, or the duck breast with morels and rye berries, were so intense that I called over the server and asked for the same dish again, please, before another course left the kitchen. Ms. Norris buys the wines. Almost all come from the natural school, and a few were chosen with more enthusiasm than discernment, so it’s wise to taste before committing to a bottle. As they are all poured by the glass, this is easy to do. Wines that didn’t seem quite ready and a slightly undercooked monkfish were the only tastes I regretted. I could also wish for more than one dessert on the menu. Recently it was a chocolate mousse with a caramel-like strawberry cream, cacao nibs and puffed rice; I liked it just fine, but the people at my table who didn’t would have appreciated an alternative. Mr. Taber, no doubt, would appreciate a bigger kitchen and someone to share it with. Like the romance in a screwball comedy, though, Grindhaus gets its energy from the meeting of opposites: Mr. Taber’s large ambitions and his tiny work space, the carefully considered cooking and Ms. Norris’s wild paraphernalia. She hasn’t decorated the place with canes or masks from her dominatrix days, but she believes the dungeon helped shape Grindhaus. “That’s also the hospitality industry, in a way,” she said, adding: “So it finds its way into how things are run and taking care of people. Making sure no one leaves scarred. Or unhappy.”","Grindhaus in Red Hook, Brooklyn","['april', 'fools’', 'former', 'music', 'publicist', 'retired', 'dominatrix', 'named', 'erin', 'norris', 'signed', 'lease', 'derelict', 'brooklyn',

188,Tavern on the Green,0 star,2014-06-24,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/25/dining/restaurant-review-tavern-on-the-green.html,Upper West Side,"Restaurant critics are supposed to be impartial, but I can’t help feeling some proprietary interest in Tavern on the Green. Not a financial interest, except insofar as a profitable Tavern is good for the city’s budget, which, in a fractions-of-pennies way, is good for me as a grumpy taxpayer. It’s more like a civic interest. Tavern on the Green belongs to the city and sits inside the most beautiful public park in which I’ve ever rowed, cycled, struck out in softball, misidentified a confusing fall warbler and illegally consumed alcoholic beverages. I’d let the city keep those fractional pennies if that helped Tavern on the Green live up to its setting.  So you may detect an extra cup or two of enthusiasm in my voice when I say that under its new management, the building is woven into the life of the park more fully than in its last incarnation, a wedding-cake palace as imagined by a 6-year-old princess with a high fever. And you may hear a few teaspoons of added regret when I say that it’s not a good restaurant yet by any measure.  The place reopened just two months ago, which may not be enough time to get a 700-seat Winnebago like Tavern up to highway speed. In time, the kitchen may figure out how to get plates on the table while they are still hot. The chef, Katy Sparks, may rethink some of the overworked, underdelivering recipes. The hosts may learn how to read their reservations screen so they don’t tell a customer he’s the first to arrive and ask him to wait while the rest of his party is already in the restaurant’s inner recesses, wondering if he’s gone for a carriage ride. Somebody may tell the servers not to drop the check while people are still eating dessert. The sommeliers may turn down the thermostat so that red wines aren’t the temperature of a kiddie pool.  Still, compared with its last days before its death from insolvency in 2009 made it the subject of countless dry-eyed eulogies, Tavern on the Green is much, much improved.  One of its real joys is seeing the exuberant Victorian building, constructed in 1871 as a dormitory for the grass-munching residents of Sheep Meadow, restored down to the last copper drainpipe. The snaggletoothed slate roof has been to the orthodontist. The Parks Department, determined to end the Tavern’s sparkly isolation, tore down the Crystal Room, which used to galumph halfway across the courtyard. The Berlin Wall of giant topiary animals that blocked the view of Sheep Meadow is gone, too. Now if you eat on the terrace, you can see the runners and the pedicab drivers on West Drive, and they can see you.  The restaurant’s new operators, Jim Caiola and David Salama, have tried to put the tavern back into the Tavern. Ms. Sparks’s plates are substantial, and any leanings toward fanciness are confined to the perimeters of the plate. The menu does not say, “Aunt Althea’s 80th birthday” as much as it says: “Hi there. If you happen to be going to Lincoln Center, don’t forget about me!”  The glittering, un-tavernlike interior encrustations have been scraped off. Next to the entrance is a bar shaped like a racetrack next to a convincing artificial marble fireplace flanked by carved rams’ heads. It’s dark and reassuring, just the kind of sheltered saloon you’d want to end up in after working up a thirst in the park.  In the main dining room, though, the tavern motif explodes in a whiteout. Everything is bright and off-white: tables, chairs, banquettes, floors. It looks like the indoor-outdoor, all-day, casual-dining option at a family-friendly resort in Florida. The servers have the determined enthusiasm of counselors poached from a summer camp in Maine and given a crash course in big-city restaurant customs during the bus ride down Interstate 95. One of them thought everything we did and said was “wonderful”: our clever preference for sparkling water over still, our bold decision to look at dessert menus. Another picked up a few crumbs from the leather-topped table with his fingertips, then left the rest. Somebody showed up the instant the plates had been set down to ask brightly, “How does everything look?” I can’t blame her for not asking how it tasted. The answer may have made it hard to stay chipper. Prying tiny quail bones away from meat that was griddled until it was as dry as a week-old English muffin wasn’t very wonderful. Neither was the greasy scattering of mushrooms and gummy, flavorless farro strozzapreti baked under a mound of ricotta that had no idea it was supposed to act like a sauce.  The ceviches aren’t ceviches; they’re rough-sawn carpaccios of seafood covered with garnishes that are either thuggish (harsh pickled onions and acrid, stale fried garlic chips on yellowfin tuna) or useless (avocado lumps on salmon). Then acid is thrown at them. The directive seems to be: terminate with extreme prejudice.  Is it too late to bring back the sheep? No, no. Patience. Maybe the food, which isn’t especially ornate, still needs to come down a notch or two. The pork chop could lose the stringy, sour, half-raw roasted rhubarb. The brisket in a sweetish barbecue sauce, which you’d be happy enough to find at your local brew pub, could do without the comatose potato salad. And the menu would be easier to handle if Ms. Sparks didn’t organize it by heat source. (“I don’t really care what I eat, as long as it was cooked on a plancha!”) The most enjoyable dishes tend to be the simplest. The Serrano ham and melted Gruyère sandwich was totally likable, which is my clever way of saying it was fried in butter. I couldn’t taste any wood smoke in the hearth-roasted mussels, but they were tender and flavorful in their Spanish-leaning sauce of garlic and chopped almonds. The $56 strip steak was excellent, too, although it probably helped that it was the only main course that arrived hot that night. (It is by far the most expensive of what the menu calls “large plates.” The others hover around $30, which might squeak by as reasonable for dinner in the park if the cooking didn’t get away from the cooks so often.)  The prize dessert is also the most modest: the birthday cake. White and soft, with whipped ricotta between the layers and whipped cream on top, it’s exactly what a plain-vanilla American layer cake should be. The other desserts are fine, but they could learn a thing or two from it. The berry shortcake needs a richer, creamier biscuit, and if the fudgelike brownies want to graduate to sundae status, they deserve more than a single scoop of ice cream. The best of my four meals at Tavern on the Green was brunch at a shady table in the courtyard, where I watched Sheep Meadow slowly fill up with weekend layabouts. The food wasn’t so wonderful that it would lure crowds, but it wouldn’t keep them away, either. No doubt the restaurant is aiming higher than that, but it wouldn’t be a bad place to begin.",Tavern on the Green,"['critic', 'supposed', 'impartial', 'can’t', 'help', 'feeling', 'proprietary',

189,Gato,★★,2014-06-10,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/11/dining/restaurant-review-gato-from-bobby-flay.html,NoHo,"Gato galloped into town in March, pursued by the food media and Bobby Flay fans in a thundering cloud of hoofbeats. The first new restaurant Mr. Flay and his business partner, Laurence Kretchmer, have opened in New York City in nearly a decade, Gato is nominally Mediterranean, but the chef rides herd on pastas and pizzas and romesco sauces with a go-for-broke intensity that’s 100 percent American. Mr. Flay brushes flavor on his ingredients in thick impasto strokes, making each plate a three-dimensional aggregation of char, smoke, capsicum, sugar, acid and fat. The cooking at Gato is many things, often all at the same time, but it is rarely shy. “Tons of olive oil,” Mr. Flay promised in a January interview in The New York Times as the space in NoHo was under plywood. “Tons of salty flavors like anchovies and olives and capers. Lots of citrus. Tons of things like tomatoes and peppers, both hot and sweet.” Stand aside, all you chefs fiddling with tweezers and eyedroppers; Bobby Flay is backing up an 18-wheeler loaded with anchovies. Of the first generation of gunslinging Food Network chefs, Mr. Flay is the only one who stayed in the saddle as the channel’s mission shifted from dump-and-stir cooking lessons to ticking-clock gladiator contests. He also kept his dignity; he acts like a professional, not a cartoon. Still, playing a chef isn’t the same as being one, and as the real estate market picked off first Bolo and then Mesa Grill, his New York presence was whittled down to just Bar Americain, a Whitman’s Sampler of American regional favorites. To audiences who don’t remember how skillfully he conjured up bursts of sunlight in Mesa Grill’s prime, Mr. Flay was in danger of becoming another Old West sharpshooter who’d joined up with Buffalo Bill Cody to delight big-top crowds by blasting holes in playing cards. With Gato, he’s a grizzled sheriff pinning on his badge again and returning to the precincts where he first laid down the law. He’s out to prove he’s more than just a big hat. But the frontier is a-changin’. The townspeople expect all kinds of newfangled foolishness. If they aren’t amazed by every bite, they’ll yelp like coyotes. Worse, they can’t live without small plates. Fine, Bobby Flay can do small plates. He can crush small plates with one hand. His bar snacks, three porcelain bowls lined up on a slate for $17, are compact flavor bombs that detonate quickly and leave a vivid afterimage. He’ll stuff cubes of tuna tartare inside a piquillo pepper, pitting cool and raw against roasted and mildly spicy. He makes a tiny powerhouse of fresh chorizo wrapped in caul fat, and gives it some shaved pickled fennel to calm its hotheaded tendencies. Many chefs leave burrata to its own, oozy devices; Mr. Flay piles on roasted beets and a vinaigrette made from oil in which black olives have stewed, and suddenly it’s a dish with something to say. I’m omitting some other stuff on these plates both for brevity and because they never swamped the rest. The size of the bar snacks may limit how much flavor-troweling Mr. Flay can do. Some of the bigger plates show his maximalist embroidery at its bring-it-on best; others seem to leave too much space for his BeDazzler. Rabbits have a famous love for carrots, but I’ve never seen one take to the vegetable the way Gato’s juicy braised rabbit leg takes to its carrot hot sauce, which tastes like sweet fire. Nor have I tasted a tarragon chicken in which the minty-licorice character of the herb had the flute-note brightness it has at Gato, which carpets the bird’s crisp skin with a variety of salsa verde made from chopped raw tarragon. Mr. Flay can put a crust on a paella like nobody’s business, and the crunchy grains of rice, once you unstick them from the bottom of the pan and mix them with a steamed egg, fried artichokes and big, tender leaves of sautéed kale, have a flavor-texture dynamic that’s just fun to eat. Steamed halibut promises all the thrills of curling up in bed with a bond fund’s quarterly report. Mr. Flay plunks the fish into a bowl of saffron-tomato soup made from halibut stock and bulked up with couscous, and if it’s not quite thrilling, it still has a winning depth of flavor, and some nuance, too. Nuance has never been Mr. Flay’s middle name, but he can achieve it, particularly in the main courses. With some of the more hyperactive dishes at Gato, though, it’s as if his years of competitive cooking have trained him to go for the knockout punch right away. He’ll funnel every ounce of flavor into the first bite, and he seems to be afraid that if he leaves out some trick, the judges will have enough taste buds left to notice what his rivals are up to. Fettuccine was soaked with potent, briny squid ink and mussel broth until it elbowed everything else — red prawns, mussels and a quiet green-onion purée — right off the plate. A side of pimentón-dusted potatoes fried to shattering bits, like crumbled bacon, was oily enough on its own without the extra richness of a runny poached egg and salty enough without a frosting of Parmigiano-Reggiano. Cheese is wheeled out again and again: soft shreds of fontina in a chicory salad; crumbs of pecorino over asparagus and fava beans whose spring freshness would have been better off with just the yellow romesco; goat cheese with crunchy potatoes alongside that tarragon chicken; gobs of bucheron in a plate of scrambled eggs blitzed with romesco. Sweetness can turn up where it’s not needed, too, whether in the romesco with an unprepossessing pork chop or in the apricot-almond dressing in that chicory salad. But if Mr. Flay sometimes lights up the tilt sign on his pinball machine, there is still a lot to love on the menu. There is a lot, period. Gato shows an all-too-rare generosity in its flavors, its eager service, its good-tempered desserts, like the summery blackberry crostata and the fromage blanc cheesecake whipped into a froth by the pastry chef, Clarisa Martino. Seeking a decent bottle of wine for $50 or under at an ambitious New York restaurant is becoming a lost cause, but there are more than a dozen of them at Gato. The wine list brings together affordable, everyday bottles with others that will sing their song to advanced drinkers. (It makes a happier hunting ground than the humdrum cocktail menu.) Given Mr. Flay’s fan base, the dining room might have been a pack-’em-in nightmare, but there’s space to flex your elbows. The architects at Rockwell Group, past masters at injecting life into big, boxy rooms, have turned this onetime homeless shelter into a flickering lair where the heat-lamp glow of hanging lights is set off against receding pools of darkness. It looks like a set for a TV show about sexy young downtown vampires who unwind over blood sausages — “Cheers” for the undead. All the reviews of Gato note that Mr. Flay is really, truly working in the glassed-in kitchen. I saw him, too, not twirling cilantro sprigs at the pass but facing the burners, his back to the audience, like Miles Davis. He says he’s sticking around indefinitely. Nobody can say he’s giving us anything less than the full Flay.",Gato From Bobby Flay,"['gato', 'galloped', 'town', 'march', 'pursued', 'medium', 'bobby', 'flay', 'fan', 'thundering', 'cloud',

190,The Simone,★★★,2014-06-03,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/04/dining/restaurant-review-the-simone-on-the-upper-east-side.html,Upper East Side,"The chef Chip Smith and his wife, Tina Vaughn, moved to New York in 2012 after shutting their restaurant in North Carolina, but the Simone, which they opened in November, doesn’t feel like a transplanted Southern flower. It is a classic Manhattan restaurant that seems to have emerged on East 82nd Street fully formed out of a time capsule sealed in the last century. When you call the restaurant, which is the only way to reserve one of its 11 tables, Ms. Vaughn will write your name in something called a “book,” holding an implement known as a “pen.” She applies the same antique tool to the menu, which she writes out in cursive and photocopies each time Mr. Smith changes it. The Simone’s search-engine strategy is the opposite of optimized. The restaurant is not on Open Table, Menu Pages, Twitter or Facebook, and an Internet search will turn up an unrelated martini bar’s website before the Simone’s. I often think that restaurants with outdoor-concert noise levels, backless benches and no-reservations policies are deliberately trying to scare off older diners. The Simone seems to be attempting something like that in reverse: If you wanted to keep away anyone under 35, this is how you’d do it. But as some of those youngsters know, the worn grooves of an old LP can sound richer than the shimmering precision of an MP3. And the Simone has the kind of textured, lived-in, analog warmth that has become rare in Manhattan’s increasingly corporatized, professionalized restaurant scene. Though expensive, with main courses fluttering into the low $40s, and formal, with waiters in vests and neckties primping white tablecloths, the Simone isn’t starchy at all. It’s a living, breathing mom-and-pop outfit where Ms. Vaughn will gush with bubbly pride about the Provençal bottle she spontaneously offered to work into a flight of rosés, while Mr. Smith, no showboat, channels his pride into the cooking. (A third owner, Robert Margolis, keeps a poker-faced watch on the dining room.) Like the rest of the Simone, Mr. Smith’s kitchen is a bit of a throwback. The winds of New Nordic and modernist cuisines do not ruffle the surface of his stockpots. He works within French tradition in a manner that was almost the default New York style 15 to 20 years ago. Mr. Smith, who trained under Patrick O’Connell and Jean-Louis Palladin, is not rewriting the rules of French cooking. It’s simply the language he speaks, and he’s fluent enough that he can use it to talk about the ingredients in his part of the world. If you were designing a dish to go viral on Instagram, you’d start by ruling out flounder, which has the must-see quotient of a “Matlock” marathon on TBS. The fish is a favorite of Mr. Smith’s, who served me two flounder dishes that rank among the best seafood I’ve tasted this year. In late winter, he rolled juicy, big-flaked fillets around a mousse of flounder and black truffle flecks; I would have burrowed into it until spring if I hadn’t also wanted to eat the whole thing. The flounder’s cold-weather swaddling disappeared a few weeks ago, and a jaunty new May outfit appeared: a golden sheet of bread crumbs speckled with fresh green herbs on top of the fish, a platform of crushed, minted favas below. Mr. Smith’s main courses often pair two takes on a protein, one very good and the other exceptional: a juicy roasted chicken breast with fried croquettes of dark meat, ham and foie gras so hard to ignore that dinner came to a dead stop while we passed them around; a drum of braised lamb shank with a single rib daubed with a Moroccan spice blend that landed with a menacing uppercut of heat; a crisped boneless duck thigh with thin slices of breast that were pink right out to the edges and almost surreally tender. One time, Mr. Smith doubled down and lost. The grilled loin and braised thigh of rabbit, both on the dry side, must have been a fluke, because he usually showed the intuition of a chef who knows just how his ingredients want to be handled. He has good sense with appetizers, too, and an admirable sense of restraint; he doesn’t turn them into scene stealers that leave the main courses nowhere to go but down. The first king salmon of the Alaskan season were shown off handsomely in a tartare with crisp cucumbers and bright preserved lemons. His goat-cheese soufflé was more warm custard than eat-it-now atmospheric condition, but it was still an excellent custard. He carves sweetbreads into long planks, creating more surface area for the crunchy coating of bread crumbs and Dijon mustard that was more than half the point. House-made charcuterie sits at the top of the menu, and it belongs there. Mr. Smith treats the tradition with a rare classicism, as in his recent bacon-wrapped terrine of pork, chicken liver, pistachios, pink plugs of foie gras and Armagnac prunes. I wished that the brioche toast served with it had been a little softer and lighter, but I was happy enough eating the terrine alone. It was like a rousing chorus of “La Marseillaise” made of meat. One night, Ms. Vaughn explained that during some lean times at a previous restaurant when they had to let the pastry chef go, Mr. Smith taught himself to make desserts. He has more of a feel for the last course than many chefs, although there were a few false moves, like a lemon tart that wasn’t puckery enough to withstand a sugary overload of meringue. But other desserts fell right into line, like a tart of Mr. Smith’s own marmalade with a crushed almond topping, and a little tower of Lord Baltimore cake, the yellow layers filled with pecans, dried fruits and coconut that were addled with bourbon, the way Lord Baltimore intended. There is no bar “program” at this restaurant, no list of nine-ingredient cocktails with dingbat names like Simone Says. But if your drink request is normal enough, it will materialize on the staircase in the hands of a waiter who presumably got it from some unseen, unheard Jeeves on the second floor. The Simone is a personal restaurant, and it has some personal quirks. The sophisticated-lady playlist can push nostalgia a step too far; raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens, on the original cast recording, may not be everybody’s favorite thing at dinner. And Ms. Vaughn has a funny habit of sidling up to the table to ask single-word questions: Delicious? Lovely? The thing is, there was always a single-word answer: yes.

191,Narcissa ,★★,2014-05-27,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/28/dining/restaurant-review-narcissa-in-the-standard-east-village.html,East Village,"Gather around the old Victrola, kids. Grandpa wants to tell you a story about wealth, power, real estate, pornography, carrots and a sweet-faced dairy cow named Narcissa. About 90 miles north of Manhattan is a 76-acre triangle of land on the Hudson River whose owners over the centuries have acted out the history, in stop-frame animation, of social power in New York. When Dutch families ran half of the Hudson Valley, it was farmed by the son of a settler from the Netherlands. He sold the place to one of the Livingstons, an aristocratic Scottish family who ran the other half.  As Gilded Age capitalists crashed New York society, the property was bought by William B. Dinsmore, a founder of a company that was the U.P.S. of the Civil War era, but with stagecoaches instead of brown vans. The Dinsmores had a Gatsbyesque time there, entertaining trainloads of weekend guests with a private golf course and a greenhouse full of orchids. Pipe down, I’m getting to the porn.  There are always fun new ways to get rich in America, and in the prolonged group grope between the invention of the Pill and the Meese Report, Bob Guccione got rich by printing photos of Penthouse pets, who exposed things that the blushing Playmates didn’t. With his earnings, Mr. Guccione bought the old Dinsmore estate. But when we chased pornography off our streets and onto our laptops, Mr. Guccione wasn’t rich any more, and his country retreat was seized by creditors.  Now we save our soft-focus pictures for pork chops, and restaurants are one of the last places where moaning in public is still acceptable. So of course the person who bought the property at auction is a restaurateur, André Balazs. Renaming the estate Locusts-on-Hudson, Mr. Balazs rents it out for weddings (the website tastefully passes over the gold-chained Guccione years) and farms the land again. Today it is home to vegetable plots, laying hens and a retired cow, Narcissa. She gave her name to Mr. Balazs’s latest restaurant, inside his Standard East Village hotel, and her moony eyes look down at the dining room from framed photographs. Narcissa the cow has no role in the restaurant’s rib-eye steak, but the farm is supposed to help in other ways. Last fall, Narcissa’s chef, John Fraser, started planning this summer’s menu by choosing the vegetables he wanted from illustrated seed catalogs. These books, he said, were “food porn in and of themselves.”  Whether teenage boys will hide pictures of undressed kohlrabi under their mattresses remains to be seen, but Mr. Fraser has already come up with one of the year’s most photographed carrots. A take on beef Wellington, it has salt-cured roasted carrots inside the puff pastry where the meat should go. It’s a startling success. The carrots are tender without a trace of mushiness, and a walnut paste darkened with cocoa and coffee gives them a brooding, bittersweet depth. Mr. Fraser is known for his refined, thought-out vegetable tasting menus at Dovetail, on the Upper West Side. His vegetable plates at Narcissa are more unbuttoned and generous. They’re complex, but in a relaxed way that fits this casual, many-things-to-many-people dining room, where tables of chef chasers sit next to narrow-waisted colts who look as if they get their nutrients from air kisses. Beets are spit-roasted for hours until their outsides are charred like grilled steak and the insides have a focused, waterless intensity; then they’re lightly crushed into deep-ruby hunks that drink up a horseradish crème fraîche. Plum-size sweet potatoes go on the rotisserie, too, getting a hot allspice-heavy jerk sauce completely right for their sugary flesh, which can taste flabby on its own. This kitchen knows how to build a salad, mixing vinaigrettes that have a switchblade edge and tossing in sophisticated-hippie handfuls of sunflower seeds (with saucerlike leaves of brussels sprouts) or crunchy chopped pistachios (in the mixed-greens Narcissa’s salad).  Side dishes are often a crass adventure in check-padding. That’s not the case at Narcissa, although the carrot fries — overdone carrots in a greasy battered shell — just made me miss the Wellington. (This is why magicians never repeat a trick.) But I could eat Narcissa’s steamed new potatoes in green garlic and olive oil all summer long, and I wish steakhouses would steal its “supergreen spinach,” wilted leaves folded into a béchamel-fortified purée that has a Sprite-bottle gleam.  I’m giving these vegetables lingering close-ups because they have a swaggering originality that the meat and seafood rarely match. Hake with a south-of-France trio of tapenade, oranges and artichokes, and a poussin the size of a mango with legs, in a vaguely truffled chicken reduction, were extremely pleasant, but wouldn’t get Narcissa noticed on their own.  Other dishes seemed designed for jet-lagged hotel guests who don’t want any back-talk from their dinner, like the not-quite-juicy roasted branzino with a standard-issue salsa verde. Mr. Fraser could use a few more main courses like the steamed black sea bass, which worked up some excitement — an uphill battle for steamed fish — by means of a toasty coconut-curry broth and hollow cross-sections of green almonds, squeaky-crisp as an unripe pear.  Deborah Racicot’s desserts are just clever enough; if you’re paying attention, you can tell that she is, too. To go with a round chocolate tart, like a brownie with a melted center, she lightly curries bananas, using slightly green ones so they’re not too cloying. The nicest thing I can say about the long winter is that it allowed her citrus salad with tapioca pudding and orange-blossom granité to stay on the menu until May. Tableside patter can be strange. A server one night talked up the “day-trip scallops” (lucky them) and pushed carrots Wellington as a mid-meal “palate cleanser.” There was no song and dance from the wine staff, led by Ashley Santoro, only to-the-point advice on a very appealing list. The design has a disjointed feel. Wooden chairs hang from pegs, in the aspirational Shaker Zen style, but the low zigzag partition along the bar could come from a Vegas coffee shop. Then there’s the steep staircase to the restrooms with crazy diagonal stripes reflected in the mirrored ceiling. It looks as if the director of “The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari” had remade “The Lost Weekend.” If you’ve been drinking, tie a rope around your waist and have a friend slowly lower you down.",Narcissa in

192,River Cafe,★★,2014-05-20,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/21/dining/restaurant-review-the-river-cafe-at-fulton-ferry.html,Fulton Ferry,"Back in the 1960s, when nobody except rats, longshoremen and gangsters needing to dispose of a wayward bookie saw much value in the Brooklyn waterfront, Michael O’Keeffe saw romance. He saw enough flowers for a year of proms, he saw a piano player massaging a Steinway, he saw a curtain of glass framing the Brooklyn Bridge and the lights of Fortress Manhattan on the other side. All of this he saw floating on a barge in the East River. After pleading for permits for 12 years, he persuaded City Hall to see it, too, and in 1977 the River Café dropped anchors. Did Mr. O’Keeffe see men producing diamond rings from their jacket pockets? He has seen it hundreds of times since. So have I, sitting at the bar one summer a few years back when a young man talked his date into catching the view from the deck outside then dropped to one knee, right next to the swiveling mounted binoculars. I’ll never forget it, or the look in the couple’s dewy eyes when they discovered that the door to the dining room had locked behind them.  No questions were popped at the River Café for more than a year after Hurricane Sandy dished out a surge tide that even a barge couldn’t stay on top of. When the River Café opened again in February, the walls, ships’ deck floorboards, the grand piano, most of the wine cellar and nearly everything else was new. You’d never know it. Mr. O’Keeffe paid for a museum-quality restoration.  As before, you reach the River Café by traveling down a cobbled driveway with lanterns and a miniature forest of plants on either side, as if Snow White’s cottage were at the end of the road. The entrance casts its fairy-tale spell on a good number of wanderers who follow the winding road only to be sent away because they don’t have jackets (for the men) or reservations (for everyone). Those who are allowed inside cross a short gangplank to the floating dining room, where captains in black tuxedos stand guard. On the right, flowers; on the left, a pianist who gently spoons out ballads for hours on end without ever seeming to need a break. He doesn’t sing, but memory dredges up the words: When I’m close to you, dear, the stars fill the sky. So in love with you am I.  This trickling brook of melodies babbling away in the background is more pretty than beautiful. Like many things about the River Café, it is white-limo elegant. But so few New York restaurants today reach for elegance of any kind that the resurgence of this one is a gift to the city.  Even harder to find are restaurants where tourists can go to gape at the view and New Yorkers can go without being embarrassed. Windows on the World, once straight across the river, is gone for good, and the return of the revolving dance floor at the Rainbow Room, scheduled for October, can’t come soon enough. No place in the city combines spectacle with hideaway intimacy and undiluted romance the way the River Café does.  And if more customers will take photographs of the Brooklyn Bridge’s steel underbelly than of their plates, the food is still much better than you might fear if you’ve been to other restaurants with souvenir views. “The kitchen aims to please but not to shock,” William Grimes wrote in his two-star review 12 years ago, the last time the restaurant was assessed in The New York Times. That hasn’t changed. Neither has the chef, Brad Steelman, who has been in his post since 2000.  The sailor’s “steady as she goes” might be the River Café’s motto. An opening salvo from the kitchen, a single shrimp on a Southeast Asian papaya salad with crushed peanuts, makes it clear that flavor epiphanies are not in store. The rack of lamb I ate recently, which was inside a skinny ring of mint jelly zipped up with mustard seeds, appeared to be the same dish Mr. Grimes described. (We both liked it.) Radiating like spokes from a hub of firm, hand-chopped steak tartare are lines of mustard, chopped capers, shallots, cornichons and chives: the usual suspects.  Mr. Steelman doesn’t need his garnishes to provide hologram moonwalks, though. His main ingredients are almost always good enough to be their own special effects. For his shrimp Oscar, he sets hollandaise boosted with blood-orange juice against beautifully sweet Pacific blue shrimp and meaty white lumps of crab. In another appetizer called Three Shells, strips of abalone dunked in a yuzu-kaffir bath and firm little kumamoto oysters in a classic mignonette had the shining immediacy of great seafood, too, even if the third shell, Taylor Bay scallops ceviche, didn’t quite keep up. And while poached lobster could probably find more exciting companions than celery root purée and slightly sweet-sour butternut squash dice, the lobster itself was tender and sweet enough to be a solo act. A duck breast whose skin has a terrific crisp shellac, seasoned with lavender and a trace of dried chiles, was better served by the cozy Eastern European comfort of glossy braised red cabbage and crisp squiggles of sweet-potato spaetzle. Some of Mr. Steelman’s ideas can be questioned. His extremely good Barolo-braised oxtail appetizer would get along nicely with either polenta or pasta, but perhaps not with polenta stuffed inside pasta. And he piled too much breading on fried oysters, which were rescued from dryness only by their topping of smoked salmon and caviar. In general, though, he sticks to classic notions and we get the rewards; his mushroom Wellington turns the obligatory vegetarian main course into a real event. Desserts, included in the three-course $115 fixed-price dinner, could use refreshing. Vanilla ice cream and vanilla ice milk turn up on several, with no noticeable taste of vanilla. But that didn’t hurt the milk-chocolate soufflé, already sweetened by a melting cap of toasted marshmallow, or the chocolate marquise straddled by a dark chocolate replica of the Brooklyn Bridge’s towers and cables.  Maybe a chocolate bridge is a little hokey, but so is dropping to one knee in front of the Manhattan skyline. In both cases what counts is not the originality of the gesture but its sincerity. In its desire to sweep us into its secluded, flower-strewn island, the River Café is sincere in a way that restaurants hardly ever are these days. At the end of a night there, I always regret that it’s time to come back to the mainland.

193,El Quinto Pino,★★,2014-05-13,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/14/dining/restaurant-review-el-quinto-pino-in-chelsea.html,Chelsea,"The name means “the fifth pine,” a Spanish idiom for the boondocks, which was probably a stretch even seven years ago when El Quinto Pino opened on West 24th Street, across from the canyon wall of London Terrace. The thumbnail curve of the sardine-can tapas bar is just the way it’s been since the beginning, packed, every seat there and on the opposite wall a few inches away taken almost any time you show up.  Turn right at the door, though, and you’ll find something new. Last fall, El Quinto Pino’s owners and chefs, Alex Raij and her husband, Eder Montero, took over the lease on the apartment next door and filled it with tables, making their sardine can a real restaurant. “It won’t make a bid for your entire night: You will snack at El Quinto Pino and almost inevitably eat more somewhere else,” Peter Meehan wrote in a “$25 and Under” column in 2007, its last review in The New York Times. With a reservation for that side room you won’t need to go anywhere else for dinner. You won’t want to, either, once the food starts zooming out of the kitchen. Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero also own Txikito, across Ninth Avenue, which digs into Basque cuisine, and La Vara, in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, where the menu is a master’s thesis on Moorish and Jewish imprints upon Spanish cooking. A short “menú turístico” at El Quinto Pino investigates a different region of the country every few months, which gives regulars a reason to keep coming and gives the kitchen a launching pad for dishes that may hit the permanent roster. Other than that, the two chefs haven’t tied themselves down. Having laid down their Iberian credentials in their other restaurants, they’ve given El Quinto Pino a passport to roam around. Among the bar sandwiches tightly wrapped in paper is a visitor from New Orleans, a po’boy with closely packed, terrifically crunchy fried squid legs at its core. Another is a fortified Cubano, in which the ham and crisp pickle have more oomph than usual, the cheese doesn’t taste processed, for once, and the braised pork is supplemented with a red wallop of blood sausage. The chefs do a takeoff on Catalonia’s version of the croque monsieur, the bikini, but they aim a double-barreled blast of Mexico at it, topping the melted cheese with roasted poblanos and huitlacoche, the flamboyantly weird, mushroom-tasting black fungus that grows on corn ears.  Geographic freedom between pieces of bread was written into El Quinto Pino’s charter from the start, when Ms. Raij brought out (all rise, please) the uni panino. A pressed ficelle filled with creamy sea urchin, melted butter and a lashing of mustard oil, it became one of the city’s essential sandwiches. It still is, even though one night mustard-oil supplies must have run low and the panino wasn’t the same without its throat-catching rumble. The rest of the menu is made up of tapas-style plates, and the servers are careful not to overload the small tables, bringing just one or two at a time. The kitchen mostly presents these dishes as tangles that are easily shared, and resists the impulse toward multicomponent platings. With Raij-Montero portions, four people seems to be the breaking point at which you’re not so much eating as nibbling. I enjoyed El Quinto Pino more in a party of three, and best of all with just one accomplice.  Some of the seafood is so appealing and out of the ordinary that dividing it can test your ability to play well with others. I hated surrendering the last fried lump of sea anemone folded into soft scrambled eggs. Called ortiguillas, they tasted almost like fried oysters, but not quite, and I wanted to get to the bottom of that “not quite.” My curiosity and my appetite also wanted a few more runs at the Catalan salad xató, which mixed chicory and canned bonito with raw salt cod, soaked to pull out the salt and to reveal a flavor of quietly intensified fish. Dressed with both romesco and an uncooked tomato sauce, this salad seemed to get more lively with each bite. Tender, apple-blossom-pink gambas al ajillo get a little fresh ginger along with the garlic, an addition that made me want to eat them twice as fast. (Mashed and sliced avocado don’t have the same effect on an oddly inert salpicon of shrimp.) Smaller shrimp from Cadiz, the size of a paper clip and intensely flavorful in their shells, are pressed into a tortillita, a wonderful fritter that looks like a latke cooked under a brick. Fried on their own, these shrimp turn up again to bring a marine undertow to a jiggly poached egg with slivered snow peas.  The kitchen’s hand is so steady that it’s easy to pass over its occasional bobbles, unless you’re unlucky enough to be served two or three in a row. My disappointments were spread out: dully spiced lamb skewers; underseasoned bits of fried pork whose name, “bag of bacon,” raised undue expectations; seafood fideua, like paella made from noodles, that lacked the oceanic depth I loved when I had the same dish at La Vara. And it’s unclear how the xocolata dessert is meant to be served. One night the salt-sprinkled ingot of chocolate ganache was filled with fruity green olive oil that spilled out at the touch of a fork; I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed the pairing of the two ingredients more. On another, the oil was cold and congealed like Vaseline. Fortunately I had the excellent crema catalana, roused from its usual custardy slumber by cinnamon and lemon zest, to fall back on.  Everything I know about dating could be carved onto the head of a pin with a butter knife, but a younger man who lives down the block from El Quinto Pino assures me it’s a great date place. He didn’t mean the bar, with its was-that-your-foot? dimensions, but the new dining room. Separated from the drinkers by a galley kitchen, its 30 seats feel secluded and romantic, but not in an obvious way. The architect Silvia Zofio gave it a quietly domestic, midcentury look, with an earth-toned tapestry covering one wall and a chandelier that suggests the swoosh of a flamenco dancer’s skirt in mid-twirl. It’s a room for talking, and if it’s not exactly the boondocks, it’s easy enough to get lost there for an hour or two.

194,Cagen,★★,2014-04-29,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/30/dining/restaurant-review-cagen-in-the-east-village-and-ristorante-morini-on-the-upper-east-side.html,East Village,"“The chef calls this one the gun, because it hits you,” our server at Cagen said promisingly as she set the night’s last bite, a stubby little handroll, on the table. Glossy and dark, it looked, if you had a suggestible turn of mind, something like the barrel of a snub-nose revolver, with a metallic sheen it got from its seaweed wrapper, a rare blend of green and black kelp. The gunpowder was inside: an extra-hot, nostril-punishing slug of wasabi implanted alongside strands of sweet squash, waiting to go off when I bit into it. The maker of this nifty loaded firearm is Toshio Tomita, the chef and owner of Cagen, which opened last summer in the East Village. Mr. Tomita worked for 16 years for Nobu Matsuhisa, and he has his mentor’s ability to bend Japanese tradition in his own directions. If you’ve tasted the shiso chimichurri at Nobu, you won’t be surprised to hear that Mr. Tomita serves it with sashimi at Cagen, but this is his own version, made not just with shiso but also with wild Japanese wild ginger, yuzu juice and more than a little jalapeño. Next to it is a dish of soy cooked with mirin, but it was the chimichurri I kept coming back to, basting it on pliant slices of skipjack, sea robin or suzuki, the Japanese sea bass. One minute Mr. Tomita will do the unadorned, noninterventionist thing you expect from a Japanese chef. His ingredients, especially the fish he brings in from Japan, are often exceptional. Three broiled fillets of ayu, a Japanese trout, wore nothing but their shimmering skins, the better to show off their delicate freshwater taste. The next he will throw a curve. A plate of small appetizers offered ham deep-fried katsu style with a splotch of Worcestershire on its panko crust, along with a single mouthful of the Nobu classic, miso-marinated black cod, as irresistible as ever. But then there were two little flavor bombs of grape tomato halves barely cooked in white wine and yuzu. Were they pickles or candied fruit, or both? Either way, I wanted more. And what was inside this little paper parcel secured with a twist-tie? A pea-size speck of goat cheese, white chocolate and wasabi. It tasted like an after-dinner mint from another planet. Cagen inhabits the empty shell left behind by Kajitsu when it moved to Midtown. Kajitsu specializes in the vegan cuisine of Japan’s Zen temples, and the two basement-level dining rooms of the East Village original had a monastic severity; the walls were coated with sand from Kyoto, and everything else followed that color scheme. Mr. Tomita appears to have moved in and gotten right down to work, without putting too much energy into redecorating. Time has not brightened the interior’s subterranean charms, which could use a fresh coat of good cheer. You notice this more at the tables than you do at the counter, where Mr. Tomita’s samurai intensity supplies extra atmosphere. Cagen is a kappo ryori restaurant, in which the chef prepares most of the food facing the diners across a counter. (Mr. Tomita’s son, Rei, works on hot dishes out of sight in the kitchen.) You can pick a path across the à la carte menu or just free-fall with a seven-course, $120 omakase meal. It’s a question of budget and time, but the big splurge shows off all the things Cagen does very well: sashimi with that nervy chimichurri, sushi wrapped in grilled seaweed that crackles like autumn leaves, and zaru soba, served as three small ponytail bunches of cool soba noodles. The first is plain, the next is dusted with yuzu peel, the last is freckled with kuro shichimi, the black seven-spice blend. They all get dunked in a soy dipping sauce. When they’re gone, you get a pitcher of the hot, cloudy water they were cooked in, for pouring into the dipping sauce. Good as this fancy Cup-a-Soup was, I always wished I had more of the firm, nutty noodles. Then I would look over the counter at the two matching stones that grind each day’s soba flour out of whole buckwheat. Each stone is the size of a birdbath and they are powered by hand — Mr. Tomita’s hands. The thought of all that labor was the only thing that stopped me from asking for seconds. *** Given the rate at which Michael White’s Altamarea Group spits out restaurants these days, this column has adopted a new policy. The amount of time spent critiquing each Altamarea place will be proportional to the time Altamarea spent coming up with the idea. This review of Ristorante Morini, open since December, will be brief. The name, a tribute to Mr. White’s mentor in the kitchen, has been used before, at Osteria Morini, which this new restaurant doesn’t resemble in any way. The downtown osteria serves the fun, lusty food of Emilia-Romagna, while the ristorante, on the Upper East Side, is not defined by Italian geography or, really, much of anything. The website promises “pan-Italian regional cuisine with a menu that covers various seasonal specialties, both inland and coastal.” Well, that narrows it down. The menu is most similar to that at Mr. White’s Marea, and while seafood isn’t the only choice, in my experience it tended to outshine other options, like the fine but slightly dull sage-roasted chicken or short rib braised in red wine. Main courses were mostly memorable for their prices, which start at $35 and inflate from there. But dull dishes are rare. Gordon Finn, the executive chef, is turning out the most carefully prepared and well-considered food that the Altamarea Group has given New York since Ai Fiori opened in 2010. You should get an excellent meal if you stick to the cured and raw crudi, like the wonderful bay scallops with bits of pink grapefruit and dots of pistachio purée; the pastas, which are as good as they are at any Michael White restaurant, which is to say they are as good as at any place in the city; and dessert, overseen by Altamarea’s corporate pastry chef, Robert Truitt. What you won’t get is a solid argument for going there and not to another Altamarea subsidiary. If you want refined, expensive seafood, you can get it in much more attractive surroundings at Marea. Inside Ristorante Morini’s split-level space, the chandeliers look like grotesque experiments in stretched skin, and the artwork is the type that speaks eloquently of corporate tax write-offs. Ristorante Morini hasn’t bestirred itself to become a unique destination; it seems to want nothing more than a piece of the action in a neighborhood whose residents proved long ago that they don’t

195,Telepan Local,★,2014-04-22,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/23/dining/restaurant-review-telepan-local-in-tribeca.html,TriBeCa,"Something happened to me recently at the Cleveland, a small restaurant downtown, that struck me as both unprecedented and inevitable. After a friend and I had finished a small opening snack, the server brought our appetizers and main courses. At the same time. It’s impossible to imagine any kitchen, even the most tragically inept one, making the same mistake five years ago. This was a pure symptom of the current small-plates epidemic. The old two-course menu has broken down so badly that some restaurants feel no obligation to send dishes out in any particular sequence, even if diners clearly order appetizers and mains, as we did.  Until we work out some protocols for small-plate dining, the way cultures like Spain’s have done, we’re going to be eating on a lawless, fast-changing frontier. Sometimes innovative restaurants like Recette or Pearl & Ash come swirling out of the chaos. At other times it coughs up half-formed and unconvincing places like Telepan Local.  It’s easy to imagine what Bill Telepan was thinking. Since 2005 he has done all his sensible, seasonal, ingredients-first cooking in one restaurant, Telepan, on West 69th Street. In a perfect city, Telepan’s success would have lured more places of its caliber to the Upper West Side. Instead, the center of gravity of Manhattan’s dining scene has migrated steadily downtown, while a looser style has swept in to make even relatively youthful places like Telepan look a bit antediluvian.  A small-plates menu in TriBeCa must have seemed like a way for Mr. Telepan to reach diners who couldn’t find Columbus Avenue without the aid of an Uber driver. In practice, Telepan Local, which Mr. Telepan opened on Greenwich Street in early January with Joel Javier as chef de cuisine, offers most of the drawbacks of small-plates eating and almost none of the advantages.  As at so many of these restaurants, the dishes at Telepan come out whenever, they land wherever, and you have no idea if you’re going to get too much food or too little. The meal unfolds, or unravels, on tables built in Nicaragua from dark and white slats of wood approximately cobbled together. They are the size of the ones in cocktail lounges where, in another era, people had manhattans and mixed nuts while waiting to be moved to the dining room. Now, this is dinner: glasses for water, wine and cocktails; blue carafes for carbonated water and clear ones for filtered tap; bottles of wine; plates for eating and plates for serving; and a votive candle, all vying for two or three square feet of real estate. Something’s got to give, and it is the silverware, which falls to the floor with surprising frequency. Or maybe it jumps, through some instinct for self-preservation. “We’re a farm-to-table American tapas restaurant,” my server said one night. “All the food is small plates that you can share.” In fact, many plates struck me as too small, even for one. The carrots, tiny and multicolored and al dente, tossed with oregano and bits of feta, come in a dish slightly bigger than a coffee lid. They cost $8, which in many restaurants would get you a side dish two or three times larger.  A special of bay scallops with black-trumpet-mushroom purée was delicious, but there were six of them, and three of us. The price was $16. A $12 plate of eggs scrambled with smoked trout and fried bread worked out to about two forkfuls for each of us.  These dishes were all sensitively made from great ingredients, but they were all a bit well-mannered for this style of dining. The best small plates cause a clamor. Sharing them provokes tension: Who’s getting the last bite? That question came up with the wonderful little grilled cheese panini topped with a Spanish tomato-garlic-olive oil spread. And I could imagine arguing over the sea scallops and diced fried potatoes bathed in warm olive oil and spicy Aleppo pepper.  But far more often, after a bite of, say, soft cauliflower in Cheddar sauce, or a mini-pizza with fried calamari over tomato sauce, or corned tongue with charred cabbage (really good) and Russian dressing (not quite as good), I would nod happily, and move on to the next thing. A single taste of some plates was too much. With its shrimp poppers — peculiarly bland fried shrimp stuffed with peculiarly bland crab and fish mousse — Telepan Local seemed to be trying to imitate Red Lobster and not quite succeeding. Fried watercress with cashews and chile sauce was an obvious homage to a Thai dish, yet it lacked the rippling energy of lime juice and fish sauce that any number of restaurants in Queens would have given it. Telepan Local’s pigs in blankets, however, perfectly mimicked everybody else’s pigs in blankets. Some of the best small-plates restaurants are glorified bars; picture tapas joints in Barcelona or izakayas in Tokyo or wine bars in Paris. Telepan Local looks at first as if it might fit the bill, with its long line of white barstools in an aggressively mirrored corridor up front. And the wine list is intriguing and affordable. But I had a hard time finding anybody who knew the bottles; one night my server couldn’t tell me about any of the three Greek whites except the one poured by the glass.  The cocktail list comes on strong, too. Most of the spirits are distilled locally; bitters are made on site. And I was surprised by the low-key sophistication of the Mai O Mai, a pineapple juice and rum concoction. The rest were too sweet, except for a gin and tonic that was too flat and a martini variant, the Jabberwocky, that was too warm. I had one of the worst desserts of the year at Telepan Local, a galette of underripe, undercooked pears on a gummy, doughy crust. I also had one of the best. Larissa Raphael, who pulls double duty as pastry chef here and at Telepan, has come up with a champion recipe for coconut cake that is rich like poundcake but lighter — poundcake that could fly. Maybe it can fly right out of this small-plates version of Telepan Local and into one that makes sense, not an American tapas restaurant but simply an American neighborhood restaurant. Some of the understated cooking that gets lost when it’s shared by the whole table might, in more generous portions, make lovely appetizers or main courses for one.

196,Jean-Georges,★★★,2014-04-08,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/09/dining/restaurant-review-jean-georges-on-the-upper-west-side.html,Upper West Side,"Jean-Georges is still a four-star restaurant. That is all. Thank you for your time. On second thought, there may be a little more to say. Because great restaurants can fade fast, especially these days, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s serene flagship serves a city vastly different from the one it set out to dazzle and seduce 17 years ago last month. Back then, Jean-Georges was a radical reimagining of the grand style of French dining, “an entirely new kind of four-star restaurant,” as Ruth Reichl put it in her review for The New York Times. Jean-Georges didn’t just blow the dust off the candelabra; it tossed them out. In a room that was all right angles and Manhattan energy, men and women servers (a rarity in formal restaurants then) circulated with unfussy, level, American poise. Most of all there was the brilliant cooking, which was lighter, brighter and more embracing of other cultures than French food had any right to be. What we want from restaurants is changing, though, along with our notions of luxury. The kind of comfort Jean-Georges excels at providing makes some diners distinctly uncomfortable. Chefs who couldn’t peel a banana when Jean-Georges Vongerichten got his first four-star review (for Lafayette, in 1988) now run adventurous, unluxurious dining rooms where people come for the journey and where the thrill of the ride is more important than the condition of the shock absorbers. Jean-Georges glides like a Mercedes sedan, but Mr. Vongerichten takes the curves like a Formula One driver. Consider the squab dish that just popped up on the menu. It comes on like jerk chicken, coated in a blackened rub, and while the seasonings are Middle Eastern, the searing heat is almost Jamaican. And here comes the creative leap that separates Mr. Vongerichten from other spice-peddlers: a hot sauce has been splashed around this charred squab, and it is made from flowers. A bright-orange blend of lime, fresh red chiles and peppery nasturtium petals, it makes the already fiery squab into what may be the spiciest dish ever served in a French restaurant. Over and over, Mr. Vongerichten takes risks that are almost shocking. A little canal dredged into a pool of sweet parsnip purée is filled with a fruity riesling raisin vinegar, straight up. Taste it alone and you pucker, but swirl it into the parsnips with a forkful of meltingly soft Arctic char under an airy black-truffle crust, and it’s spectacular. In the same vein, the buttermilk sauce under red sea bream sashimi or the unsweetened lemon mousse with raw sea trout and roe are almost acidic enough on their own to clean copper pots. Taste a little of everything, though, and the sourness takes its place and galvanizes the rest. There’s not much sleight-of-hand in Mr. Vongerichten’s cooking. Nearly everything is visible, and the effects can still take you by surprise. Won tons stuffed with grilled foie gras are squirted, somewhat randomly, with a spiced red-wine reduction, but what makes the dish take off are the tart, crunchy passion-fruit seeds and the raw papaya chunks livened up with a dab of lime gel. This skill for getting the greatest impact from just a few components is Mr. Vongerichten’s foremost talent. Most of the time, you couldn’t take something away from one of his dishes without hurting the whole. This is why so many of his classics still jump with energy; they’re not dragged down by pointless ornamentation. Was the sweet sea urchin with slivers of green chile and drops of yuzu on a tongue of black bread invented last week, or last century? What about that intensely aromatic lobster sauce seasoned with fenugreek and lemon grass that surrounds lobster on toast? Or the chicken with the Parmesan crust that stays crunchy for an improbably long time, even after crumbs have fallen into the lemon-butter sauce that has more lemon and more balance than ought to be possible? If you are having your first $118 four-course dinner at Jean-Georges, you won’t always know. Regulars will, though. And they may start to wonder, along with me, how many of Mr. Vongerichten’s new dishes are as indelible as his greatest hits? I couldn’t imagine improving on any of the six savory dishes I enjoyed on a $198 tasting menu of classics. They had all snapped into place for good. The only dish on a spring tasting (same night, same length, same price) that I could pay the same compliment to were the stout asparagus stalks under morels in hollandaise, and I recall people rhapsodizing about them in 1997. This could become a danger to Jean-Georges’s pre-eminence. Mr. Vongerichten and his business partner, Phil Suarez, run a company that is responsible for 22 restaurants around the world. Diners tend to worry about this empire-building in terms of quality control: Does the food suffer when the head of state is traveling? It can, even at Jean-Georges. At a recent lunch while Mr. Vongerichten was in Japan, a salmon tartare spring roll, one of the three little bites that opened the meal, wasn’t crisp enough to stand up to its lettuce wrap, and the fish was barely seasoned. Gulf shrimp in an appetizer were overpowered by the heavily toasted flavors of fried artichokes and mushrooms, and a lemon-fennel aioli lacked the verve to pull it all together. These were blips, though, well within the standard deviation for one of New York’s most daring and high-performing kitchens. In the long run, the greater question is whether Mr. Vongerichten is channeling more of his creativity into building new restaurants than into building dishes that might run 10 years from now on the classics menu at Jean-Georges. Because each dessert is made of several mini-desserts that riff on a single theme, it’s hard to tell whether any of them has the staying power of the molten chocolate cake. (It has a permanent spot on the chocolate-themed dessert, and remains better than its imitators.) But as constructed by the pastry chef, Joseph Murphy, almost all of them are deeply, instantly lovable. For anyone feeling left behind by the current fashion for scattershot, disputatious desserts, Mr. Murphy’s citrus tasting — with its tiny, crisp strudel filled with candied kumquats and pistachios, and its plush, delicately floral citron snow and citrus sections over amber riesling jelly — is an answered prayer. The wine list is book-length. But it is unusually nimble, built for versatility. The chief sommelier, Laura Williamson, has a bottle up her sleeve for any trick the kitchen might pull. Listening to her or one of her colleagues suggest a wine can be a quick, thoughtful education in the principles of pairing. The rest of the dining room staff has the original poise and unfawning attentiveness, but servers can seem remote. Smiles bloom beside some tables, but not all. Lately some top-tier restaurants have invented a new style of service that is seamless, intuitive, guided by a species of emotional intelligence. Jean-Georges hasn’t quite evolved. Examples are so minor that they may sound petty, but here’s one. A guest of mine approached the reception desk, a sci-fi podium populated by a row of three or four humans with unnervingly perfect teeth, at the same time as two other diners. A host tried to pair them off: “Are you two together?” Um, no. Another attempt was made: “Are you two together?” Unless Mr. Vongerichten is trying to run a matchmaking service, there are smoother ways to begin. The game can always be played at a higher level. That is the challenge for any restaurant that wants to shine among the striving competition. And Jean-Georges does shine. The restaurant was redesigned in graceful, gentle curves by the architect Thomas Juul-Hansen in 2008 (two years after Frank Bruni’s four-star review, its last evaluation in The Times) and is the most elegant modern dining room in the city. The enormous windows let in the setting sun, and sometimes they catch the moon rising over the treetops in Central Park. You are in the city and hovering slightly outside it all at once. Then the food arrives, the flavors fall into their startling alignments, and there is only one place you could be: Jean-Georges.",Jean-Georges on the Upper West Side,"['jeangeorges', 'still',

197,The Shakespeare,★,2014-04-01,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/02/dining/restaurant-review-the-peacock-and-the-shakespeare-in-midtown.html,,"My dinner date had eaten in this room before. A Williams College graduate, she remembered its earlier incarnation as the school’s alumni club. “I practically lived here at one point,” she said, looking over her shoulder at the stuffed peacock stashed in one corner. “I took almost all my meals here.” How was the food? “Ghastly.” By the end of the night, she announced it is much better now. For that, she can thank her fellow alumni for selling the building on East 39th Street to a developer who turned it into a boutique hotel. Called the William, it opened before Christmas with two upholstered cocktail lounges and two distinct places to eat reformed English cooking. We were upstairs in the Peacock, a civilized, grown-up restaurant where Ray Charles shimmies from the speakers and the wine list is refreshingly nondenominational. One floor below, in the English basement (what other kind would an English restaurant use?) is the Shakespeare, a rustic pub with a rock soundtrack, soccer on both televisions and taps for British lagers and cask ales. The two spots share a kitchen, a chef named Robert Aikens and just enough dishes to justify corralling them into a single review. The food I ate during two dinners at the Peacock and one at the Shakespeare was always appealing; the settings were somewhat less so. This was particularly true in the Shakespeare, where in the early evening packs of beer drinkers can crowd out those of us who are there to find out if the shepherd’s pie made by Mr. Aikens is better than the mound of ruined groceries that went by the same name in our mothers’ kitchens. It is, by leaps and bounds. The potato crust, golden with sharp Cheddar cheese, blanketed a lamb stew, thickly spiced with thyme and rosemary. All winter, I had hoped something would push back at my interior polar vortex. This cast-iron pot of ground meat buried under mashed potatoes finally did. Other pub standards at the Shakespeare were true to form, like the highly credible bangers and mash and the fish and chips, with a light sheath of custardy batter around a hunk of very fresh cod. The Scotch eggs, molten at the yolk and wrapped in juicy, salty sausage before being plunged into the fryer, were good enough to eat by the dozen, although I would be round as an egg if I had tried. I was annoyed, though, when the $16 “pint of prawns” turned out to be a pint glass of ice cubes holding up five nearly flavorless boiled shrimp. The Shakespeare needs to do better than that if it wants customers to put the emphasis on the first word of “gastro pub.” Right now, it lands firmly on the second. The Shakespeare’s two rooms have low timbered ceilings, and the one with the bar, where I sat, has two TVs bigger than some movie screens. I couldn’t make out much beyond that because the place was crammed with after-work warriors there for the drinks, not the food. I couldn’t hear much, either. But I did feel something: the creeping damp chill of a full pint of beer that someone, in the crush of bodies, had knocked over on me. A champion drink spiller myself, I wasn’t upset. My soaked jeans did undercut the warming effect of the shepherd’s pie, though. If I had wanted to get out of those wet clothes and into a dry martini, one of the two cocktail dens at the top of the stairs would have been the place to do it. The armchairs are plush, the paneling is polished, the fireplaces are burning (with gas, but still) and the bartenders don’t smirk as they mix cocktails as well structured as a Savile Row suit. The William has given Midtown the hotel bar that I’ve always wanted out of the Algonquin. The fireplaces came with the building. The plush and polish were supplied by Reid & Taylor Studios, which also designed the Peacock’s two contrasting dining rooms. One has the flickering allure of the cocktail dens up front, along with emerald wallpaper in a peacock pattern. I wanted to eat below those peacocks. Apparently so did everyone else, because there were never any free tables. Instead, I was seated in what’s called the Garden Room. Bright and oddly underdecorated, it is probably a better place for lunch than for the nocturnal consumption of meat pies. Mr. Aikens, a veteran of Le Gavroche in London, has done the gastro-pub thing before, as chef of the Dandelion in Philadelphia. He is far from a flashy cook. He just believes in doing things the right way, which often means the hard way. As our server put it, “The simpler the dish, the more complicated he makes it.” For gammon steak, which in most parts of England would mean a slice of ham on a plate, canned pineapple optional, he starts from scratch. The ham is pork loin, brined in the kitchen, then grilled, as is the slab of fresh pineapple. Potato purée below, a sunny-side egg on top. I can’t imagine finding a better gammon steak in England. Details elevate dishes like an honest chicken soup, or grilled Spanish mackerel on toast: the velvety, chardlike softness of the wilted spinach; the sweet-tart tension of the sherry vinaigrette; the crisp snap of the bacon. Roasted chicken came with a terrific plank of fresh pork-and-sage sausage and a run of gravy that neatly managed to taste rich but not oily. I appreciated the robust and musky spices and the fluffy grains of biriyani rice with a lamb curry straight from the kitchens of the Raj. The desserts are staunchly English and tended by Mr. Aikens himself. In another restaurant, this might relegate them to stepchild status, but not here. Mr. Aikens lavishes care on them, not to mention historical research and generous amounts of cream, eggs and butter. The result is a roster of sweets as deeply gratifying as any I’ve spooned my way through in the past year. One night, Mrs. Beeton’s Snow Egg appeared on the Shakespeare’s blackboard. The dish, a version of the French oeufs à la neige, comes from Isabella Beeton’s 1861 manual on household management. In Mr. Aikens’s hands, the meringue egg, rising from a sea of warm custard like steam from a hot bathtub, was studded with cracked pralines and decorated with kumquats in syrup. English cooks can work a hundred variations on the same idea, so another night brought a bowl of custard mixed with brioche crumbs below dime-size domes of meringue, melting and soft like marshmallows on a stick. Sandwiched in the middle was warm, fresh raspberry jam. It goes by the name the Queen of puddings, and asking for it is almost as good as eating it.",The Peacock and the Shakespeare in Midtown,"['date', 'eaten', 'williams', 'college', 'graduate',

198,Rôtisserie Georgette,★★,2014-03-18,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/19/dining/restaurant-review-rotisserie-georgette-on-the-upper-east-side.html,Upper East Side,"Earlier this year Rôtisserie Georgette put a new chef in charge of its spit-roasted chickens and fish, its fries flecked with tarragon and its baby potatoes heavy with meat drippings, and I couldn’t tell the difference. This is meant as praise, and not the damning-with-faint kind. The cult of the new in restaurants has brought us many wonders, but it has also left us with the curse of compulsory creativity. It’s no longer enough for chefs to cook hot food that makes us happy; they are supposed to dumbfound us with flavors the human tongue has never tasted.  This is why writers like me devote energy to, for example, puzzling postmodern taquerias while taking for granted the simple excellence of traditional ones. The change in restaurant culture is something like the shift that overtook popular music after the Beatles. Singing old Cole Porter tunes was out; suddenly every kid with a guitar and an amplifier was supposed to have the songwriting chops of Lennon and McCartney combined. Rôtisserie Georgette isn’t writing any new music. The kitchen, now under Chad Brauze, plays standards from the French songbook and plays them well, with what a colleague who has eaten high and low around the city calls “a refreshing lack of creativity.” If this restaurant had a clock, its hands would be stopped at five minutes before nouvelle cuisine, when meat was carved to cover the plate and sauce came on the side and nobody turned down potatoes, when people eating a roast with a good but not-too-expensive Bordeaux could hardly imagine a better night out.  You can feel this way at Rôtisserie Georgette, although the joys of time travel end with the Bordeaux. Jean-Luc Le Dû’s list has an affordable 2002 Haut-Médoc from Château Lanessan for $62, but the other red Bordeaux have  been adjusted for inflation and then some. Rôtisserie Georgette has a real rotisserie and a real Georgette, both easy to spot.  There are two rotisseries, in fact, standing back to back in the open kitchen. The one facing the dining room is a tall steel model with brass trim, loaded up with pudgy chickens, small flocks of stuffed quail, dorade locked in a cage with lemon wheels and thyme branches.  There is one Georgette. Her last name is Farkas. A coiled spring of proprietary energy, Ms. Farkas started cooking in restaurants at 15, attended hotel school in Switzerland and interned with Alain Ducasse in Monte Carlo. She was on her way to running a restaurant of her own when Daniel Boulud offered her a job. After she said yes, she learned that she would be handling marketing and public relations.  That little gig lasted 17 years, which may be one reason that Rôtisserie Georgette seemed to have traveled from another decade when it landed on East 60th Street last November. The loft-height walls are hung with a cluster of antique mirrors, an Aubusson tapestry and bronze Louis XV-style sconces. Carpeting helps muffle the noise, which tends to wane around 9 p.m. This is an early-to-bed crowd, and with an 8:15 reservation one night I was the last to leave. At one end of the room is a porter’s chair, its egg-shaped back upholstered in leather. Now I know where to seat the dowager countess when she comes to visit. In some ways Rôtisserie Georgette is a delayed-gratification version of the restaurants opened in the ’70s and ’80s by young Americans who fell for European ways of dining. What set Ms. Farkas’s heartstrings humming were the rotisseries of France.  Rôtisserie Georgette will sell you half a chicken for $24 or a whole one, which feeds two people for $36 each. The economy model, raised on an Amish farm in Indiana, is rubbed with herbes de Provence and cracked coriander seeds. Roasted chickens don’t always pick up the flavor of the herbs they’re stuffed with. These birds do. The legs are tender without disintegrating into strands, as rotisserie dark meat can do. The white meat is close to ideal, with just a whisker of dryness at the narrow tips. The pricier chicken is called the poule de luxe, French slang for a woman with high upkeep costs. It is brought up in Pennsylvania under Mennonite supervision, hides a terrific mushroom stuffing under its skin, and features a slab of seared foie gras that is both unsatisfying and beside the point. Too bad you can’t get the stuffing without paying for the liver, but I’m sure if I were French I’d understand that this is always the way with a poule de luxe. There is nothing fancy about the quail, just juicy meat wrapped around a pale-pink poultry forcemeat seasoned with paprika and piquillo peppers. The dorade, roasted whole and then filleted, breaks into beautiful white lemon-scented chunks.  A special one night was rotisserie duck à l’orange, carved and arranged on a silver platter. Mr. Brauze had defied the modern rule of duck cookery, taking the breast all the way to medium. He knew what he was doing, because medium-rare meat wouldn’t have taken as well to the bittersweet orange-peel sauce. Only once was I served meat that didn’t come off the spit at the ideal moment: a crumbly, dried-out lamb shoulder with a merguez stuffing that tasted as if it had been left out in the rain. With any main course, the fat-basted rotisserie potatoes are almost required, although the frites, fried to a mahogany crisp, will also do. But a strict meat-and-potatoes diet can be supplemented by creamed spinach with garam masala, tiny and fiery-hot brussels sprouts and purple cabbage stewed with cider and bacon. I’d be surprised if the vegetables at Ms. Farkas’s long-ago French rotisseries were worth noticing, but these are.  Ms. Farkas put her first initial on the better of two salads, the salade G, with a time-tested mix of endive, pears, blue cheese, bacon and candied walnuts. There is also a salade Francine. If I were Francine, I’d be on the phone with my agent trying to get my name taken off it. Nicole Kaplan, the pastry chef who made her name at Eleven Madison Park and Del Posto, handles the desserts, mostly stock characters from the bistro repertory. The tarte Tatin has been circling the target: the caramel was too scorched one time, not scorched enough the next. But the chocolate soufflé hit the bull’s-eye, and so did the dark chocolate pot de crème in a coffee mug. Neither was the least bit surprising. That’s a compliment, too.

199,Contra,★★,2014-03-11,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/12/dining/restaurant-review-contra-on-the-lower-east-side.html,Lower East Side,"The outside makes no grand statements. A glass wall stares out at a not-yet-trendy block of Orchard Street. It’s blank except for the small menu posted by the door, offering five courses for the relatively modest sum of $55. Hanging on one inside wall, more art than ad, and almost invisible unless you are walking southbound very close to the window, is the restaurant’s name in red neon script: Contra. At work in a compact kitchen at the far end of the earnest and narrow dining room are two chefs whose ambitions for Contra are anything but small. They want to create a style of cooking that New York can call its own. “This is an incredible food city, but sometimes you can see a lack of identity in the restaurants here, where people want to channel another place, another time,” Jeremiah Stone, a former sous-chef of Rino in Paris who helped open Isa in New York, told Eater shortly before the restaurant opened in October. “They want to do modern Thai, Roman, creative French.” His partner in the kitchen, Fabian von Hauske, who worked in the pastry kitchen of Jean Georges and, briefly, at Faviken in Sweden, pursued the idea. “I don’t think there’s that much of a style here,” he said. “You go to San Francisco and there is definitely a style there when you go to places like Coi or Commis. I think there should be more of an identity here, something that’s contemporary that you can’t find anywhere else.” In most other cities, hatchets would be out for a pair of 20-something chefs who rode into town promising to show everybody how it’s done. But not New York. Here we just say, All right, kids, let’s see what you’ve got. What Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske have is a personal, understated, modern approach to deeply seasonal cooking. Mr. von Hauske makes the desserts and the bread, which costs an extra $3 and is worth it for the supremely creamy butter alone. Mr. Stone does the rest, but their styles are compatible. I’m not enthusiastic about what strikes me as a Northern European phobia of spices, but I came to admire their restraint with salt and added fat. You can see this approach catching on among other young chefs, some of whose food gets lumped in with the New Nordic movement. A more accurate name for their quiet, naturalistic, drama-averse approach may be mumblecore cuisine. Contra, at the moment, pulls it off with an originality that is sometimes dazzling and always worth following. The monkfish that appeared one recent night was cooked with faultless timing, roasted slowly, with the kind of tender pink center you’d find inside a seared scallop. It shared its chunky earthenware plate with leaves of charred kale, a marmalade of caramelized onions and a fish-sauce foam, but if you are thinking Vietnamese-molecular fusion, forget it. The fish sauce was a complex and milky froth made of monkfish bones and smoked trout, and it was very, very good.  This was truly expressive cooking, exploring shades of flavor more watercolor than acrylic. The dish is either changed or gone by now, no doubt, but the impression lasted. And I won’t forget Contra’s pairing of chicken breast with pickled daikon, toasted sesame seeds and blood sausage. The sausage had been transformed into a swipe of soft, tangy, beet-red paste, dotted with marjoram leaves and tart nubs of dried raspberries. It all came together in a way so unexpected and right that I had to shake my head.  New dishes roll onto the tasting menu every few days, and old ones are subject to restless tinkering. (Old, at Contra, means anything that was invented before today.) The first time I ate monkfish there, a mash of raw walnuts and garlic in miso was trying out for the role that was later played, with more depth, by the onion jam. And I liked watching the evolution of a raw scallop dish outfitted with noodle-like ribbons of raw kohlrabi. As wide as seatbelts the first time, they had slimmed down and looked more like fettuccine the next. On the other hand, the dried raspberries had gone from the blood-sausage swoosh the second time I saw the monkfish. I missed them a little.  You get the luck of the draw at restaurants that offer only tasting menus, but the format suits Contra’s food unusually well. The flavors are subtle, and on first encounter it’s a bit like walking out of the daylight and into a candlelit room: you need to adjust. Five courses is enough time to open your eyes (you may get more time than you need on nights when the pace drags). Another advantage of the tasting menu becomes clear when you are served dessert, followed by a second dessert. As you may have guessed, Mr. von Hauske is judicious with sugar and quite comfortable with vegetables. I liked a beets-and-yogurt number more than I did a creamed gianduja studded with tough sunchoke chips that put up more of a fight than I could face at the end of the night. But at least I knew everybody else would be crunching along with me, and I’d already smiled my way through a less-antagonistic dessert, a kind of rebuilt apple crisp, with an oat crumble and whipped oat-infused custard around a cider-like apple granita. This dessert was pure fun and charm, like Mr. von Hauske’s partnering of tangerine granita with a smooth popcorn-infused mousse and smashed bits of caramel popcorn.  Linda Milagros Violago, who stocked the cellars at Mugaritz in Spain and Geranium in Denmark, has put together a list of bottles from the kind of small winemakers who think of themselves as farmers and avoid modern tricks. The results aren’t always what you’d predict; a French cider, she said, had a note of blue cheese, and it did. The list almost forces you to try something unfamiliar, which feels just right for this restaurant.  I hope Mr. Stone and Mr. von Hauske achieve all their goals except the one about creating a shared New York style. The crazy riot of voices chattering in hundreds of accents is the whole point of this crazy, riotous city they have adopted. We don’t need other chefs imitating Contra’s style.

200,Gotham West Market,★★,2014-02-11,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/12/dining/restaurant-review-gotham-west-market-in-hells-kitchen.html,Clinton,"WHEN I ASKED a friend to meet me for dinner at a food court near the Javits Convention Center, he acted as if I had suggested we fill a fanny pack with Hot Pockets and eat them on the back of a bus. After that, I sharpened my sales pitch. I told people that we would be inhaling ramen that is famous in Tokyo, and for good reason. I said that we would be drinking beers that were more unusual and delicious than what they were used to, and that for ballast we’d put down a layer of lamb sausage. I noted that we might sit at a tapas bar that in flavor and spirit comes as close to the Spanish ideal as any place in New York.  That worked. Once I had convinced them, my guests tended to like everything about this food court, called Gotham West Market, except getting there. It occupies a block of 11th Avenue in the West 40s that lately feels less like Hell’s Kitchen than Hell’s Freezer. But the inconvenient address is the reason this new eating adventure exists. It was built to lure renters to Gotham West, the 1,238-unit apartment complex above and behind it. As any New York real estate agent can tell you, even buyers who think of themselves as pioneers don’t want to mill corn and slaughter hogs like Pa Ingalls. Gotham West’s developer tried to answer that objection by bringing forth a troop of places to eat in a spot that had almost none.  It is not the only effort to upgrade the food court, long the province of soft pizzas, sludgy stir-fries and swollen cinnamon rolls. A few blocks south, the sprawling Hudson Yards development will have a food hall (the preferred term these days), as will Brookfield Place in Battery Park City. This spring, Crown Heights in Brooklyn will get Berg’n, a beer hall with food from stalwarts of the Brooklyn Flea and Smorgasburg. Anthony Bourdain, meanwhile, has driven his fans into a near frenzy with his plan to bring street food from around the world to Manhattan.  With an unusual degree of imagination, Gotham West smartly stakes out a middle ground between the star power that packs Eataly and the hope of discovery that drives small-business proving grounds like Smorgasburg and the Golden Shopping Mall in Flushing, Queens.  Somewhere between famous and brand new, at least to New Yorkers, is Ivan Orkin, the American chef who taught himself to make ramen in Tokyo. Manhattan is becoming enmeshed in ramen, but his noodles at Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop stand out from the tangle.  Of the traditional ramens, my favorites are the shio, a supercharged chicken soup of phenomenal depth and clarity, and the vegetarian shoyu, darker and heartier, tasting of soy sauce and roasted mushrooms. Both broths were scalding hot, with a fatty richness that made my lips slippery. After the first few mouthfuls of rye noodles, I put down my chopsticks and stared into the white ceramic bowl, trying to see where all that flavor was coming from. If I ever showed up at Slurp Shop in a linen suit, I might forgo slurping and order roasted-garlic mazemen, a more recent style that dresses the noodles in a thick sauce, something like Italian pasta. Or I might eat a rice bowl. The one with smoked whitefish tastes like a Japanese translation of a morning at Russ & Daughters. But I was even more taken by the one topped with tender, soy-rich pork and a smear of salty, sour plum paste.  The chef Seamus Mullen is here, too. His tapas bar, El Colmado, expands on the Spanish menu he developed at Tertulia but is set up so it’s easier to drop in and graze and drink wines from Catalonia or Bierzo and pretend that 11th Avenue is in Spain. El Colmado feeds the illusion. The cooks are dressed in sky-blue grocers’ jackets and dark gray caps, and the counter is propped with jars of squid and cans of pimentón next to oysters on ice. They are excellent, as is the Serrano ham, which falls from a vintage Berkel slicer in shaggy pink leaves that are meltingly pliable.  With the exception of fried artichokes smothered below overdressed arugula, the cooking has a light hand that befits the elemental flavors of Spanish cuisine. Frying is a strength, in croquettes filled with smoked eel, or fried whitebait, their pinpoint black eyes staring up from a swirl of lemon-yellow aioli. Lamb meatballs are a model of the form. So are the gambas al ajillo, red shrimp in a quarter-inch of garlic- and shrimp-infused olive oil that I would drink from a shot glass. The market showed some discernment in electing Caroline Fidanza’s Little Chef as a delegate from Brooklyn. Ms. Fidanza helped create the borough’s current restaurant aesthetic as the first chef of Diner in Williamsburg, before she downshifted to a smaller shop, Saltie. Little Chef’s menu expands a bit on Saltie’s, adding soups and spirited juice blends. (I’m a fan of the carrot and fresh turmeric cocktail.) The core mission is the same, though: lavishing care on breakfast and lunch with a modest roster of eggs and sandwiches. Simplicity is luxury in the Ship’s Biscuit, a raft of creamy scrambled eggs and ricotta on very fresh focaccia studded with crunchy sea salt.  Across the hall, staring down the largely vegetarian pleasures of Little Chef with a meaty gleam in its eye, is the Cannibal. An outpost of the cultish East 29th Street original steered by the chef Francis Derby, this baby Cannibal makes do without a full-fledged kitchen. Sometimes it shows; the brussels sprouts I had tasted like Thanksgiving leftovers. There is a baked Japanese sweet potato that was a wonderful thing to find at the end of a cold walk, but in general charcuterie is the strong suit here, like spicy lamb sausages in natural casings or a surprisingly gentle sausage of juicy rock shrimp with fennel pollen. Even better is the beer fridge, shelved with obscurities that the servers expertly match with your tastes.  Some spots are geared for the day-to-day needs of locals. Genuine Roadside is an all-day diner annex designed and run by AvroKO, the design firm that did the rest of the market. I got more of a kick out of the hipster-truck-stop décor, with its shelf of vintage beer cans that includes deep verticals of Schlitz, than I did from an uninspiring pulled pork sandwich or the hard-shell ceviche taco spackled together with guacamole. But if I lived upstairs, I would make an occasional lunch of the fried chicken sandwich. And I would be devoted to the high-end heroes built by the Court Street Grocers Sandwich Shop. Dessert is a weak spot, especially at night. Little Chef, which bakes homey sweets during the day, closes at 6 p.m. Another early closer is the Blue Bottle Coffee kiosk. The baked goods devised by one of its owners, Caitlin Freeman, like crisp almond biscotti with more than a hint of saffron and the excellent, sweet-and-savory shortbreads, taste best between sips of state-of-the-art coffee and espresso. After dark, the best choices are the old-school flan from El Colmado or the s’mores icebox cake from the Cannibal, worth ordering just so you can see the toasted marshmallow slab.  Nearly every vendor has counter seating, but servers will run food out to the communal tables and benches in the center of the hall, which is handy if you want ramen and your friends want tapas. The offer is always made with a smile; while the businesses are separately run, they share a common spirit of friendliness. It’s as if everybody knows you didn’t really want to come to 11th Avenue.

201,M. Wells Steakhouse,★,2014-01-28,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/29/dining/restaurant-review-m-wells-steakhouse-in-long-island-city-queens.html,Long Island City,"The steakhouse is in trouble. Not financial trouble, because new ones keep opening, but spiritual trouble. Its soul is unwell. Because many other restaurants now offer better beef, the steakhouse serves little purpose except as a stage set for the dwindling number of occasions that require men to bond by spending money and consuming red meat together. Sensing that it has lost its swagger, chefs have tried to revive the genre by applying their culinary-school training. Their knifework is geometric, their potato recipes are French, their menus prettified with appetizers like diced raw bluefin under droplets of Ligurian olive oil. Each dish may be a delight on its own terms, but the whole approach is wrong. Trying to save the steakhouse by adding sashimi is like trying to improve a martial arts movie by casting Gwyneth Paltrow. We all know that there’s a problem, but only Hugue Dufour and Sarah Obraitis seem to have any idea how to fix it. Husband and wife, chef and manager, the two came to New York a few years ago and began waging a merciless attack on all that is fastidious and fussy in modern dining. First was the 18-month run of their gonzo diner, and then their “dinette” inside MoMA PS 1. Their most recent assault on propriety is M. Wells Steakhouse, which opened in November in a converted auto-body shop in Long Island City, Queens.  M. Wells Steakhouse needs some fixing itself. Discipline is not its strong suit, for better and for worse. It can lurch from magnificence to sloppiness, from inspired fever dreams to inarticulate notions that aren’t ready to leave the kitchen. One thing that needs improvement is the steak. This isn’t as fatal as you’d think, because when M. Wells Steakhouse succeeds, it does so in a deeply satisfying fashion, by feeding the lust in your gut for a meal that is not just a dinner but a feast.  Mr. Dufour and Ms. Obraitis get this. They know that we go to steakhouses to feel more alive. They respond appropriately, even if that sometimes means feeding us enough to kill us.  Let other chefs precisely engineer 130-degree steaks with immersion circulators and digital thermometers. Mr. Dufour has gone back to the cave, grilling meats over a crackling wood fire. This makes the steaks smoky, of course, and a little uneven, slightly overdone in spots, the meat seasoned with the scorch of burning fat. It’s an imperfect steak, and those imperfections are just the kind of the premodern thrill that makes a traditional steakhouse great. When we go to a steakhouse, we want to wrestle with our own appetites, to learn their exact dimensions. Luckily, confrontational portions are the way Mr. Dufour signs his name. I have eaten whole tasting menus that were less filling than the appetizers at M. Wells Steakhouse. French onion soup is more solid than liquid, stuffed with poached pork belly and a marrow bone (tiny spoon provided) that takes the natural beefiness of onion broth to its logical conclusion. Solomon Gundy, a dish that takes pickled smelts as its starting point, adds half a potato waffle, a huge outcropping of crème fraîche and a landslide of intensely crunchy trout eggs. If winter is getting you down, I’d prescribe one Solomon Gundy, to be taken at the bar with a glass of Champagne. (Étienne Guérin, imported from Montreal to be the wine director, has built a winningly nondogmatic list that is mostly French but doesn’t turn up its nose at a well-made retsina.) Less photogenic but just as wonderful are the sweetbreads blanquette in an unnervingly delicious expanse of white sauce. The blanquette is also offered as a side dish, but only the appetizer version is served on a plateful of mashed potatoes. There are two very good salads as well. Do not be naïve enough, however, to think that you will be eating lightly by ordering the romaine Caesar under a heap of grated Parmesan, as fluffy and white as the frosting on a coconut cake, or the improbably crisp grilled iceberg wedge in a blue cheese dressing speckled with bacon and candied pecans.  Ready for your pork chop tower? Here come a half-dozen thin-cut grilled chops piled up, with a salty pat of anchovy butter between each one, as if it were a stack of pancakes. It’s deranged and wonderful. With other main courses, though, we have to face the unpleasant reality that dinner at M. Wells Steakhouse can at times resemble “Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?”, that all this heroic swaggering comes with a certain amount of swaying and weaving and stumbling over the furniture, gastronomically speaking.  A Moroccan tagine with soft hunks of full-flavored lamb was as sweet as Jell-O salad. A torpedolike lobster roll tasted of its bun, and not much else. In the caviar sandwich, the pop and brine of what must have been a fat helping of sturgeon roe from Florida were muffled between two fried planks of Texas-toast-size bread. I kept thinking of what I could have done with that much caviar, or the $50 I’d just spent.  I wasn’t much happier paying $17 for the bone-in burger, a dense bundle of ground beef on the very low end of the juiciness and tenderness scales. The dish, with a swoosh of bone jutting out from within the bun, is a hit on Instagram. Too bad I couldn’t feed it to my camera. The skin of the trout au bleu, netted from a tank in the kitchen, conked on the skull with firewood, gutted and slipped into a tangy court bouillon, is meant to turn blue, eponymously. Does it, though? Hard to tell, because it was always covered up by fingerling potatoes, cabbage and tartar sauce. The flavor and feel of the trout seemed terrific, but with so many things competing for attention, that was hard to tell, too.  And while the fire does great things to the steaks, the meat didn’t always live up to it. The grass-fed Kansas City strip was all elastic muscle and very little flavor. The somewhat retiring chateaubriand needed the help of a sauce, but sauces are sold separately, and nobody offered us one. The best steak I ate at M. Wells Steakhouse came from a neighbor’s tomahawk chop, grilled on a whole rib almost the size of a goalie’s stick. It could have served six, so we bartered for a taste. The meat gushed with juices and shiny, delicious fat.  M. Wells Steakhouse was in the works for about two years. Still, I sometimes got the sense that Ms. Obraitis and Mr. Dufour are making it up as they go along. They wanted a dessert cart but decided to keep it stationary, requiring customers to walk over to it to select one of Bethany Costello’s sweets. (I can save you the trip: Get the tall pile of cheesecake or the Paris-Brest, which crackles with scraps of hazelnut brittle.) It’s a crazy way to run a restaurant. And if Mr. Dufour can fix the trout dish and find a steak that has the tomahawk chop’s intensity for less than $200, I hope it stays that way. A great steakhouse should make you feel a little insane.","M.

202,Han Dynasty,0 star,2014-01-21,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/22/dining/restaurant-review-han-dynasty-in-the-east-village-and-hirohisa-in-soho.html,East Village,"Independent thinkers find this hard to admit, but when you see crowds of New Yorkers standing outside a bakery or putting their names on the list at the door of a restaurant, more often than not the food they’re hanging around for is worth eating.  Whether it’s worth the wait is a separate question. In general, though, the crowds know something. Dominique Ansel Bakery is a wonderland, and Maison Premiere’s happy hour is such an amazing bargain that I am afraid that simply mentioning it may spook the owners into charging more than a dollar for each pristine oyster. There are exceptions to this rule. It does not apply to lines formed by tourists who trade their vacation days for a handful of cake crumbs under a waxy helmet of frosting on Bleecker Street. Nor does it apply to lines for brunch. Be wary of the opinions of people who will endure hunger and hangovers for a free mimosa. And so far, the rule does not apply to the lines at Han Dynasty in the East Village, a Sichuan restaurant that has been quoting waiting times at dinner of 45 minutes or more since it opened around Labor Day. This is nothing new for its owner, Han Chiang. Lines have been a feature of the six Han Dynasties he operates in and around Philadelphia. Despite his habit of informing customers, in loud and profane terms, that certain items on the menu should not be ordered by anyone but children, Han Dynasty has been so popular that he plans to open 100 locations around the country.  I can think of quite a few towns where this would be great news, but I’m mystified by the popularity of Han Dynasty in Manhattan, where there are far better Sichuan restaurants. Han Dynasty’s translation of the cuisine has a thick American accent. Many main courses are heavy on sugar, bell peppers and especially MSG, which is often used in great, slashing doses. They come across as close relatives of the kung pao chicken made by the best Chinese takeout in your neighborhood. In fact, your local joint might do this Sichuan crossover hit better than Han Dynasty, whose version was one of the sweetest and least appealing things on the menu.  In the restaurant’s anemic interpretation of cumin lamb, floppy bands of meat, drenched in a syrupy sauce, were too wet to give off any of the amazing fragrance of toasted spices that announce the dish’s arrival before it reaches the table at Szechuan Gourmet in Midtown, Little Pepper in College Point, Queens, or a dozen other restaurants around town. Under the menu heading “Shifu Special” (shifu means, roughly, chef) is the classic Taiwanese dish Three Cup Chicken. By tradition, the sauce is made with a cup each of rice wine, soy and sesame oil. Han Dynasty seemed to add a cup of sugar, too, and applied so much sauce that the chicken, meant to be served sizzling, arrived in a caramel soup. Apart from the dan dan noodles, which needed more snap from black vinegar, the appetizers were a less cloying crew, their seasoning closer to the Sichuan spirit. Cold rabbit with peanuts in chile oil, with the thrilling, classic combination of red chiles and Sichuan peppercorns, made my lips vibrate like a tuning fork. Dry pepper chicken wings had all the crunch, complexity and aromatic power I’d missed in the cumin lamb.  I had hoped that somebody would curse at me when I ordered. It never happened. Actually, the service was unusually friendly and forthcoming with the kinds of detail about the dishes that can be hard to obtain in some Sichuan restaurants. And the egg-yolk-colored paint and modern, Chinese-themed art on the walls give the place some energy. Still, if I want Han Dynasty’s wings again, I’ll get delivery. A 45-minute wait for the doorbell to ring would be well within reason. There are no lines at Hirohisa, which opened last summer on a quiet SoHo block. Instead there are reservations, which lately have not been hard to come by. In some ways, it’s easy to see why the crowds have passed it by. The cooking is very Japanese, in the let-the-ingredients-speak mode that can leave some Americans cold. “It’s ... subtle,” one person at my table said. “Very subtle,” another said. At times, I agreed. Some of the grilled meat courses, for instance, didn’t leave an impression on my memory as large as the one they left on the bill.  But for the most part, I love the way Hirohisa Hayashi, the chef, brings out the whispering harmonies that result when one small wave of flavor laps against another.  He finds those harmonies in the way lightly charred blocks of sesame tofu come together with buttery lobes of sea urchin and shreds of fresh wasabi. And again in the bowl of raw salmon layered over white rice, which becomes a steaming soup as you add roasted green tea from a pot. And again in the gently sweet and seductive stew of lobster in white miso and dashi. But nuanced flavors can also be potent, as an omakase meal last fall made clear. Mr. Hayashi intensified grilled lamb by marinating it in red miso. Served on top of a hunk of grilled tilefish was a slab of broiled foie gras; the heat chased the fat from the liver, and this became the sauce for the fish. It was a dish to make you shake your head twice, once for how luxurious it felt, and again for how simple it was.  Hirohisa is a kappo-style restaurant, a form of Japanese dining in which the chef makes both hot and cold dishes behind a counter. There are two kitchen islands floating at the edge of the serene white dining room, one for cold dishes like sashimi and another where the cooking takes place. You watch the action and relax, drink in hand, as if a friend had invited you over for dinner. In this case, you’re drinking sake from a list of junmai (“subtle rice and water”), junmai ginjo (“unrestrained challenge”) and junmai dai ginjo (“a specific target”).  With a carafe on the table, the soft light flowing from alcoves in the ceiling, the chefs bending over their knives, all the lines around the city seem very far away.",Han Dynasty in the East Village

203,The Bistro at Villard Michel Richard,0 star,2014-01-14,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/15/dining/restaurant-review-the-bistro-at-villard-michel-richard-in-midtown.html,Midtown East,"The first time I ate at Villard Michel Richard, the latest restaurant to dance among the frescoes and marble pilasters of the Villard mansion in Midtown, I strongly suspected that I was in an awful hotel restaurant.  This seemed like a connect-the-dots conclusion. It’s a restaurant. It’s in a hotel, the New York Palace. And it was awful.  That didn’t make any sense, though. Born in Brittany but a star in the United States, trained in pastry but adept in every corner of the kitchen, Michel Richard has been one of the most respected chefs in this country since the 1980s. Settling in Washington, he gave the city a restaurant, Citronelle, that earned national fame. Michel Richard was serious. He would not have come to New York last fall to open an awful hotel restaurant. Other possibilities had to be considered. Hoping that I was wrong about the awfulness, I went back two more times, concentrating on the à la carte menu served in the bistro on the Madison Avenue side of the restaurant rather than the tastings presented in a room named the Gallery, where dinner starts at $140 for four courses.  The Stanford White interiors look better than they have in years, thanks to the attention the design firm Jeffrey Beers International paid to the way light strikes the paintings and fireplaces. White’s giddily opulent Gilded Age rooms can awe out-of-town visitors. Two weeks before Christmas, the restaurant was full of little girls in fancy dresses, most of whom stared, hypnotized, into phones and tablets, although one young rebel held a doll in her lap. A glass cube in the center of the dining room shows off the wine stockpile amassed by Gilt, the last restaurant in this space. It’s not too hard to get a wonderful and affordable bottle, but you may have to manage on your own. One night, when my table of three wanted a little Beaujolais, the sommelier tried to sell us a magnum. Another time, when I asked for help choosing among more than 80 German whites, a manager said apologetically that he didn’t know much about them, and that the people who did weren’t around. Still, I always ended up drinking well. And if everything had been on the level of the roasted chicken, the rustic bean soup and the salmon fillet on a bed of lentils energized with balsamic vinegar, Villard Michel Richard would easily qualify as an average hotel restaurant. But many other dishes vaulted across the gap that separates average from awful. Think of everything that’s great about fried chicken. Now take it all away. In its place, right between dried-out strands of gray meat and a shell of fried bread crumbs, imagine a gummy white paste about a quarter-inch deep. This unidentifiable paste coats your mouth until you can’t perceive textures or flavors. It is like edible Novocain. What Villard Michel Richard’s $28 fried chicken does to Southern cooking, its $40 veal cheek blanquette does to French. A classic blanquette is a gentle, reassuring white stew of sublimely tender veal. In this version, the veal cheeks had the dense, rubbery consistency of overcooked liver. Slithering around the meat was a terrifying sauce the color of jarred turkey gravy mixed with cigar ashes. If soldiers had killed Escoffier’s family in front of him and then forced him to make dinner, this is what he would have cooked. Yes, Villard Michel Richard is, in fact, an awful hotel restaurant. But it still didn’t make any sense. Was Mr. Richard not the chef I had thought? Were the ecstatic reviews, the five awards from the James Beard Foundation, the induction into the Maîtres Cuisiniers de France, all a mass delusion? I doubted that, but to make sure I had dinner at Central Michel Richard, a bright, loud French-American bistro that opened in Washington in 2007. (Citronelle has been closed since 2012.) If a dish was served in both cities, I ordered it. In every case, the Washington version looked and tasted better, for the same price or less. Mr. Richard makes a chicken-liver mousse he calls faux gras, and at Central it was so silky and rich that the pun was not much of a stretch. The one in New York wouldn’t be mistaken for anything but mediocre chicken liver.  Lobster bisque in Washington had a robust shellfish intensity. The Villard version was floury, pale and almost completely bland; you could get nearly as much flavor by putting a lobster bib into a juicer.  A frisée salad at Central was garnished with crunchy little croutons, freshly crisped bacon matchsticks and a warm poached egg. At Villard, the croutons were stale, the bacon limp and the egg cold.  The strangest thing about my dinner at Central was the fried chicken. It looked like the one at Villard, but it was terrific. The difference between them was like the difference between winning a medal for figure skating and falling through the ice.  Mr. Richard was so clearly a smart, accomplished chef that for one crazy moment, I wondered if Villard Michel Richard was bad on purpose. Maybe he was paying tribute to the awful hotel food of years past, the way Grant Achatz and Dave Beran of the restaurant Next are paying homage to Chicago’s steakhouse tradition. The seafood pasta, after all, is almost a direct quote from the 1980s, when doughy, gluey, overcooked fresh pasta and washed-out bits of unidentifiable seafood drooped in flavorless pink sauces. Of the same vintage, and just as bizarre, were the mushrooms under a tower of puff pastry ringed with cold, mud-colored sauce that tasted of uncooked wine. (If Villard Michel Richard doesn’t make it as a restaurant, it could reopen as the Museum of Unappetizing Brown Sauces.) The flaw with this hypothesis was the desserts. They broke character. Mr. Richard’s elegant, reverse-engineered Kit Kat bar; his rectangle of classic crème brûlée with mango sauce; his profiteroles in the style of a croquembouche, with a steeple of puff pastry spheres enclosing the ice cream and a pitcher of warm chocolate sauce to be poured over the top: They were all too good to be a joke. The girls in dresses even put down their phones for the celebration cake, a chocolate drum that shoots out sparks and, when you break it open, reveals a jumble of fruit and spongecake. There was another possibility: Perhaps the restaurant was awful because Mr. Richard wasn’t actually involved. It’s true that he is not the owner, but neither does he have the kind of licensing and consulting deal that has often made the names of Gordon Ramsay or Todd English little more than celebrity endorsements. He is a partner, a publicist said, sharing in profits and overseeing “day-to-day operations.” A union contract limits his ability to hire and fire cooks, but that didn’t keep Paul Liebrandt and Justin Bogle from pulling off formidable technical feats when they ruled this kitchen. There is one more theory. Villard Michel Richard may be a symptom of the deal-making culture that afflicts the restaurant business. Too many chefs are being tempted with too many offers from too many developers and investors. Hotels especially know that a famous name lures travelers, who won’t realize until it’s too late that the food being served has nothing in common with the cooking that made the name famous.  Opening a restaurant used to be a brutal process, and for many chefs it still is. If you’ve spent your own money and borrowed from your friends and family, you’re too scared to slack off. But the best-known chefs don’t have to worry about this anymore. It’s become much easier for them to open restaurants. Maybe it’s too easy, because running one is still as hard as ever.",The Bistro at Villard Michel Richard in Midtown,"['villard', 'michel', 'richard', 'latest', 'dance', 'among', 'fresco', 'marble',

204,Toro,★★,2013-12-31,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/01/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-toro.html,Chelsea,"I can’t remember what we were eating at Toro, the new tapas restaurant in far western Chelsea, when one of the people at my table looked up in wonder. It could have been when we were swaying like drunken sailors over the suquet de mariscos, a chowder by way of Catalonia with cool sea urchin and warm lobster bobbing in parsnip-infused milk. Or when we had finished the last shrimp in the gambas al ajillo and were scraping up the last bits of a sauce for which a tank full of lobsters must have given their shells. Or when we were crunching through croquetas of ham mixed with unmistakably earthy meat from a pig’s head. Or when we were cutting into another croqueta, this one filled with unusually fluffy and moist salt cod sitting under two golden hoops of fried lemon peel. Or when we had emptied a sardine tin of its raw mackerel marinated in a Thai-derived green curry, rich with coconut milk and sharpened with lime juice. But I remember his smile and his question: “How can a place this big have food this good?” Toro, opened in September by the chefs Ken Oringer and Jamie Bissonnette and based on their enduringly popular Boston original, has factory-height ceilings, an industrial-chic design and 120 seats at long communal tables and smaller, unshared ones. It isn’t all that large compared with Morimoto across 10th Avenue, or Buddakan on the east side of the same building, or the teeming mess halls of the meatpacking district a few blocks south. By local standards, it is a bungalow in a neighborhood of McMansions. But by the cozy standards of the Barcelona tapas joints that inspired Mr. Oringer and Mr. Bissonnette, Toro might as well be a Home Depot. It sells almost as many items. The beverage list alone is a major treatise on Spanish drinking. There are spins on Spain’s beloved gin and tonic, dressed up with lemon grass syrup or yellow Chartreuse, although my Vauvert Elixir was a bit flat and cloying, as if the tonic came from a bartender’s hose. More inviting at the start of a meal are the feisty and autumn-crisp hard ciders or the cavas, a few of which settle any doubts that Spain is making world-class sparkling wine. Moving beyond bubbles, Toro stocks the garnachas and tempranillos you’d expect, but it has discoveries in store, too, from underappreciated grapes like xarel-lo and mencia. You may need a drink before ordering dinner, because the menu gives you something like 60 choices. Some are fully traditional Spanish classics like toast spread with raw tomatoes that shimmer with olive oil; others are non-Iberian interpretations like yellowfin tuna in white soy sauce with tissue-thin vinegared cucumbers. This presents a corollary to my dinner companion’s question: How can a menu this big have so many excellent dishes, and so few disappointments? I’ve certainly tasted things at Toro I wouldn’t be in a hurry to order again. One November night, I stayed cool to several dishes that could have used more warmth themselves. Chilly deviled eggs were somewhat generic despite being topped with a slip of preserved tuna belly. A $36 plate of streaky jamón Ibérico should have been warmer, too, to help soften the flavorful fat. This was an oversight I didn’t expect from a restaurant that goes to the trouble of hand-slicing the tagged Spanish hams that it proudly hangs from the ceiling. And while I loved the way mint yogurt brightened the wintry sweetness of rutabagas, sunchokes and carrots in a vegetable paella, I had no luck finding the socarrat, the crunchy bottom layer of browned rice that our server had promised would be the best part. The pan had been hustled off the flame before the crust had set. But there were fewer misfires each time I went, suggesting that the kitchen is settling down to business. I was happy to sink into the profoundly Spanish flavors of a vegetable stew called escalivada, with smoked eggplant in olive oil that carried the sweetness of simmered red peppers and onions. I immediately wanted more of the hot blowfish tails seared in a crust of North African spices. And I wondered how the simple combination of potatoes, octopus, harissa and charred onions could result in a contender for the best octopus dish in a city that’s gone cephalopod-mad. The octopus and blowfish gave me a hunch that later meals confirmed: The seafood at Toro can be spectacular. Can be, but not always: A whole sole griddled on a plancha could have used a kick of acid or salt, while delicate threads of sea cucumber were kicked around by acrid bits of over-fried garlic. But griddled red shrimp from Galicia were wildly delicious, from the tips of their tails to their heads packed with buttery orange fat. A blood-red run of fresh-pressed cranberry juice made an exciting vinaigrette for oysters, briny and raw. The clams, mussels and shrimp in paella Valenciana had plenty of character, and this time that irresistible layer of golden rice had fused to the pan. There were delicious oddities, too, like softly springy cod stomach flavored with some intensely funky stuff from inside the head of an octopus; it occupied its own wonderful niche between mild and extremely weird. A third question: Would this food taste even better if the place weren’t so big? Tapas in Spain are intimate, convivial bites. They’re snacks, sometimes running into meals, that you eat during hours when you fall into a bar for an hour or two of purposeless hanging out. New Yorkers aren’t so good at that. We eat tapas in restaurants where the casual, offhand moment of unplanned deliciousness gives way to the wait list, the crowds, the reservation before 6 or after 10, the upsell, the table smilingly offered with the condition that “we’ll need it back in an hour,” as a host at Toro told me one night. To their credit, Mr. Oringer and Mr. Bissonnette do not cook as if they are in a huge restaurant. Toro’s food isn’t stagy or gimmicky; it’s honest and thoughtful, and it can feel a bit lost in this space. There are times when eating tapas here is like watching card tricks at Yankee Stadium. And if I ever want to try some of these dishes in a smaller room, I can just go to Boston. The original Toro is less than half the size, and for the eight years it’s been in business, people haven’t stopped complaining about how hard it is to get a table.",Toro,"['can’t', 'remember',

205,Sushi Nakazawa,★★★,2013-12-10,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/11/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-sushi-nakazawa-in-the-west-village.html,West Village,"THE CHEF was late.  All 10 of the black-leather-and-chrome swivel seats, the same kind you’d perch on to play the slots at the Venetian in Las Vegas, were taken. Most of us had reserved a month before. Now we found ourselves sitting in the small, bright, glossy, black-and-white front room of the restaurant, which opened in August in the West Village. It looked about as Japanese as Peter Luger. Servers in black suits were offering hot towels, water and drinks, and more water, and then small talk, until it became clear that they were stalling. Were they going to let us eat?  Finally, Daisuke Nakazawa walked in the front door. “I’m sorry,” the chef said cheerfully as he slid behind the counter and prepared for work. He had just come back from Pier 76, he said. The police had towed his car. Then he picked up a palmful of rice and began to serve one of the four most enjoyable and eye-opening sushi meals I have ever eaten. I had the other three at Sushi Nakazawa over the next few weeks. The moment-to-moment joys of eating one mouthful of sushi after another can merge into a blur of fish bliss. But almost everything Mr. Nakazawa cups in his hands and places in front of you is an event on its own. A piece of his sushi grabs control of your senses, and when it’s gone, you wish you could have it again. These little events carve themselves into your memory. So does the meal, 21 pieces or so over about two hours. I remember precisely the dull luster of Mr. Nakazawa’s mackerel and the way its initial firmness gave way to a minor-key note of pickled fish and a major-key richness that kept building the longer I chewed. I can feel the warmth of just-poached blue shrimp from the South Pacific islands of New Caledonia, which had a flavor that was deep, clean and delicate at the same time. I can tell you about the burning-leaf smell of skipjack smoked over smoldering hay until it becomes a softer, aquatic version of aged Italian speck.  We don’t normally think of one sushi piece as wildly different from the next, apart from the inherent qualities of the main ingredient. But one of the points made by the 2011 documentary “Jiro Dreams of Sushi” was that a driven, obsessed chef will treat each sea creature as a unique challenge. He’ll ask, how can I make the best piece of horse mackerel anyone has ever tasted? When Jiro Ono dreamed of sushi, what he saw were new dishes waiting to be invented. In the movie, Mr. Nakazawa was the young apprentice who cried when Mr. Ono conceded that he had finally made an acceptable egg custard. With his shaved scalp, bowed head, downturned eyes and meek acceptance of Mr. Ono’s criticisms, he gave the impression of a novice Zen monk who was accustomed to abuse in the name of enlightenment. (He also gave you the idea that Jiro could be kind of a pill.) Mr. Nakazawa must have learned something, because his fish often tastes as if it has been coaxed along until it’s as delicious as it’s ever going to get. Each slice has a slightly different temperature, affecting flavor and texture, whether it spreads on your tongue or stays firm and chewy. All good sushi chefs do this, but Mr. Nakazawa seems to be able to hit any point on the thermometer with an assassin’s aim, locating a temperature for yellowtail belly that makes its buttery richness into a time-release pleasure bomb. He gets other effects by skipping the standard wasabi smear. He dabs Japanese mustard under medium-fatty tuna and the hay-smoked skipjack, bringing out its bloody-lip tang. Yuzukosho, a paste of bright yuzu peel and burning chiles, bites playfully into the cool sweetness of a sea scallop lopped from its shell just a minute before it’s served, its edges still fluttering. That scallop dish is distinctively his, and once you’ve had it you’d know it anywhere. Not everything I ate was in that category, and not everything is the best in town. The eel and octopus at 15 East are still undefeated, and possibly the rice, too, although Mr. Nakazawa’s has a wonderfully rich, rounded flavor. The $450 menu at Masa may glide to a higher pitch of pleasure, but the most striking dishes arrive before the sushi starts. No restaurant in town does as much with sushi, and sushi alone, as Nakazawa.  Behind the counter of Sushi Nakazawa, the chef is nothing like the movie’s humble stepchild. He laughs, he jokes, he handles live animals. One evening he held out a tray of sea urchins, their spikes groping the air, and asked each of us to choose one. The tiger shrimp he set down on white plates another night had more energy. With a flick of its tail one jumped up in front of a woman at the counter’s end. She jumped even higher. Another customer, more game, picked up the shrimp just above its wriggling legs, pointed toward his mouth in pantomime (Mr. Nakazawa is learning English), and asked the chef, “What is the best way?” The best way is to wait until Mr. Nakazawa yanks off its head, strips its shell and drapes the raw shrimp over a cushion of rice. Everything is gently pressed over rice, in the two-century-old Edo style of sushi that Mr. Nakazawa respects and refines. Sashimi is not served, and there are no hot dishes from the kitchen.  Sushi Nakazawa operates more like a tasting-menu restaurant than most Japanese sushi places. Mr. Nakazawa does not take requests until the very end, when he offers to sell you a second taste of anything. He does work around dietary restrictions, though. (He also notices who’s left-handed, and sets their sushi down with the ends pointing at 8 o’clock and 2 o’clock so it’s easier to pick up with the fingers.) There are three seatings a night at the counter. Reservations there can be made only for parties of two, which is needlessly unaccommodating; sushi counter dining is one of Japan’s great gifts to solo diners, and I can’t imagine Sushi Nakazawa would have trouble filling the slots. Reservations for the 25 seats in the back are more flexible, with staggered times and a discounted price, $120 instead of $150 at the counter. You can’t see the show from the cheap seats, and the room, while perfectly comfortable, will not be appearing in any interior-design magazines. But the sushi is rushed to the tables while the rice is still warm, which is crucial, and the dining room is the place to sit if you want to have a conversation without interruptions from jumping shrimp. Interruptions from Rick Zouad, the sommelier, are welcome, though. I am skeptical of pairings with tasting menus, but Mr. Zouad’s choices flattered each style of sake, and the price, $40 for six or seven glasses, is almost a gift. There are some very tempting half-bottles of Champagne from Chartogne-Taillet and other small producers or, for $12, about 15 percent of the price of the Champagnes, a 17-ounce Japanese lager brewed by Echigo from sushi rice that hits the reset button as effectively as pickled ginger. Sushi Nakazawa is owned by Alessandro Borgognone, whose other restaurant is Patricia’s, his family’s place in the Bronx. At home one night, Mr. Borgognone watched “Jiro Dreams of Sushi” and announced that he was going to bring one of the chefs to New York. His wife, reasonably, said no, you’re not. Luckily, he ignored her, and eventually found Mr. Nakazawa working in Seattle for another former apprentice of Mr. Ono’s. The trip from the Bronx to the West Village is probably easier to make than the trip from “spaghetti Frank Sinatra” to raw triggerfish under a squiggle of its own liver. Every once in a while, the distance tells. Mr. Borgognone has been bringing in sorbets made by his father at Patricia’s. The gesture is lovely, but superfluous. The egg custard Mr. Nakazawa cried over, made with mountain yam and shrimp, is the final, transporting piece of sushi. It hovers over the border between pudding and cake, and it tastes like an ending. Welcome to New York, Mr. Nakazawa. It’s a nice town for a great sushi chef. Please read those parking signs carefully, though.",Sushi Nakazawa in the West Village,"['late', 'blackleatherandchrome', 'swivel', 'seat', 'kind', 'you’d', 'perch', 'play', 'slot', 'venetian', 'la',

206,Charlie Bird,★,2013-12-03,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-charlie-bird-in-soho.html,SoHo,"THE HARDEST-WORKING WOMAN in the food business one recent night was the host of Charlie Bird, in SoHo. Armed with nothing but good cheer and a smile that could stop a war, she had the unenviable job of preventing an uprising in a waiting area by the door that might comfortably hold three people if they were very skinny and could survive for minutes at a time without breathing. There were around 10 of us.  Tables weren’t emptying out as fast as new reservations were arriving, and hungry customers were piling up like rush-hour riders on the platform at Times Square when, “due to an earlier incident,” the uptown No. 1 is nowhere in sight.  The earlier incident causing the short delay at Charlie Bird was one that has occurred regularly since the restaurant opened in June: It gets packed early on and stays that way for hours.  There was no room at the bar, but Robert Bohr, the wine director and an owner, had wedged himself into the tiny foyer to take drink orders, enthusiastically recommending a “tanky” and “gulpable” Piedmontese Barbera from Scarpetta. The host squeezed past him to look at the dining room. As she passed, there was a light pressure on my shoe.  “Oh, I’m so sorry,” she said. “I did not mean to step on your foot!”  I had barely noticed, and once she unholstered that smile, I hardly cared. She was one of those servers who can make you feel better after a misstep, even one that lands on your toes, than you would have if nothing had gone wrong in the first place. The tone she set carried through all my meals at Charlie Bird, and it went a long way toward smoothing over any wrinkles. Quick, experienced and friendly, the servers add to the hip-hop-fueled energy of the dining room, which has the slightly too crowded and slightly too loud spirit that keeps people living in New York, even while they gripe about it. This was fortunate, because the cooking at Charlie Bird is surprisingly erratic: tremendously likable one moment, strangely off-key the next. Ryan Hardy, the chef and Mr. Bohr’s partner, is working in an eager-to-please Italian mode that leans heavily on cheese, salt and crunch. The kitchen announces its intentions right away with focaccia that is so crisp and shiny with oil that it seems to have been deep-fried. Bits of bread roasted in chicken fat multiply the crunch of a half chicken that Mr. Hardy sears, pressing down on it until the skin crackles.  Apart from a near-perfect risotto with tiny clams, the soulful mush of Italian cuisine is mostly banished; when a wonderful classic tripe stew turns up, simmered to vanishing softness in tomatoes, Mr. Hardy spoons it over crunchy slices of toast.   There is a heroic veal chop at Charlie Bird, pounded and floured and browned at scorching heat, but not scorched, served with tender porcini slices and wedges of lemon. There are chopped razor clams that ride in the long canoes of their shells alongside a fiery mash of pickled peppers. A special of bay scallops with chopped pistachios was given little capes of lardo, which may not have been the most flattering look but made the scallops seductively good to eat. Jarringly, ingratiating dishes like these were mixed in with careless ones. Some main courses weren’t hot enough, including, on one night, that star chicken. A few of the handmade pastas were standouts; others were washouts. Squid-ink chitarra with too few strands of crab was drowned in oil, and pappardelle with tender veal belly was lost in a weak, watery broth; even $50 worth of white truffles couldn’t coax it to life. One evening, the cooks seemed to be applying salt with a snow blower. Salty croutons undid crisp leaves of escarole dressed with anchovies and lemon. Chanterelle pickles and a caper-raisin purée both brought extra salt to a wing of skate that already had more than its share. Dessert could have offered safe haven. But a warm chocolate cake with a molten, sunken center like the crater of a volcano and the olive oil ice cream next to it were topped, sadistically, with much more than a pinch of Maldon salt. A few weeks ago, the sodium had been purged from that chocolate volcano and it was the best dessert on the table. If the rest of the menu can shape up, Charlie Bird will be a very good restaurant. The other pieces are already in place. The narrow space, essentially a split-level bowling alley that runs along Avenue of the Americas, has been made over as a modern bistro, with squash-colored banquettes and Lyle Owerko’s blown-up photographs of vintage boomboxes shot like Avedon portraits. The music is carefully aged hip-hop. Over the summer the decibel level could have been classed as an enhanced interrogation technique, although if it elicited any confessions nobody would have heard them. Acoustic retrofitting and a lower volume setting have helped.  Mr. Bohr, who built the epic wine list at Cru, keeps a much shorter one at Charlie Bird. Working with one of his sommeliers, Grant Reynolds, he has assembled it with such care  that I fell hard for everything I tasted. Ordinarily I’d be put off by seeing more bottles over $100 than under in such a casual place, but the markups are kind and, if your curiosity outstrips your budget, you can buy a half bottle of anything except sparkling wines for half the price. Even the cheapest wines were exciting, like the grignolino from the Piedmontese producer Cavallotto.  At $45, it cost less than the retail price of the handblown glass it was served in, which had a crystal stem as thin as a chive.  Like Pearl & Ash, another downtown restaurant that opened this year, Charlie Bird is on a mission to make the thoughtful wine service that you used to find only in hushed, special-occasion restaurants into an everyday event. That philosophy shapes the whole meal. Servers watch the tiny details, the way they do at far more formal restaurants, but they’re loose and relaxed. It’s a style ideally suited for the way we go to restaurants now, and it would lure me back, once the kitchen becomes more consistent, even if I have to wear steel-toed shoes.",Charlie Bird in

207,Somtum Der,★,2013-11-26,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-somtum-der-in-the-east-village.html,East Village,"Many restaurants station an employee near the door who can make or break your evening. At Somtum Der in the East Village, that person is not a host who may banish you to a table in the frozen wastes of Siberia but a cook who can set your mouth on fire with the flavors of northeastern Thailand.  Wearing a T-shirt and a straw hat, he stands behind the bar, surrounded by glass candy-shop jars filled with shallots; heads of garlic; peanuts and cashews; granules of white sugar and little cakes of palm sugar; blistered sticks of fried pork skin; and, crucially, dried bird’s-eye chiles. When an order comes in, he grabs a wooden bat that would come in handy if he were caught in a riot and pounds it against the bottom of a deep wooden mortar. He looks as if he is churning butter. What he is doing is making tart, salty, crisp and exhilaratingly spicy papaya salad.  Called som tum in Thailand, papaya salad gave its name to this nearly three-month-old restaurant and is its star attraction, made to order in eight variations. One has brined, boiled eggs, which are fluffy and creamy and soothe the burn of the chiles. Another is seasoned with slivers of grilled pork neck, sweet and pink. The one called som tum poo-plara is darker than the rest in color and in flavor because it’s mixed with intensely funky fermented fish sauce and rock-hard miniature crabs scooped up in Thai rice paddies. It was the most complexly rewarding on the roster; the least was the one with rice noodles and sweet chile sauce, which seems to lull the noodles into a shallow, sugary daze. Nearly everybody in Thailand loves papaya salad, but the rest of the country got it from Isan, the vast northeastern plateau. Isan probably got it from Laos, next door, but that’s another story. In stalls all around Bangkok, street hawkers from Isan pound green papaya, and in 2012 a pair of restaurateurs brought the mortars indoors to a bright and offhandedly stylish place called Somtum Der. Like the Bangkok original, the East Village branch has knotty-pine walls and ceiling fixtures made from bamboo rice steamers and fish traps that could pass for the work of a modern design studio. To recap, this is a New York replica of a Bangkok restaurant that interprets that city’s street-food renditions of traditional Isan cooking. Amazingly, the food survives this journey, and if it has lost some herbs and other ingredients, it is still vibrant, fresh and delicious.  It has picked up a few things, too. Although Isan cuisine is on the march in New York, Thanaruek Laoraowirodge and Supanee Kitmahawong, who own Somtum Der, were worried that the city would wilt under the force of an all-Isan menu. With their consulting chef, Kornthanut Thongnum, they have padded it out with dishes from central Thailand.  A salad of sardines with mint and improbable quantities of crunchy, fragrant chopped lemon grass is worth a detour from Isan. Somtum Der’s drunken noodles or pad Thai with crab are more than credible, too, if you cannot imagine a Thai meal without those standbys. But they are not why you are here. You are here to build an Isan meal around sticky rice, a bowl of soup, a bit of fried or grilled meat and rustic, fiery salads. Very few dishes cost more than $12, and this is one restaurant where the refrain of “small plates meant for sharing” is not just accurate but culturally appropriate, so order as many as the table can hold. (Or maybe not quite that many. The food launches out of the kitchen quickly and relentlessly, and I felt lost in an avalanche until I learned to order about half of what I meant to eat, and then, when it was gone, put in a second order.) You want a larb or two, one of the chopped salads lavished with chiles and mint and a dusting of toasted ground rice that crackles between your teeth. The larbs with chopped duck and pork are very good. The one with crunchy flakes of grilled catfish that soak up the lime and fish sauce is even more satisfying. Another takes the opposite strategy, with minced mushrooms that don’t absorb the dressing at all but quietly allow the fresh herbs and chiles to sing out. Animal proteins do not demand the center of the plate in Isan cuisine, and while pork turns up frequently, it’s possible to put together an excellent vegetarian dinner at Somtum Der. Carnivores, though, will want at least one fried or grilled meat. Skewers of beef or pork marinated in coconut milk didn’t hold much interest, but the grilled “house special” pork did, especially when it was dipped in savory, salty jaew sauce.  Of the deep-fried dishes splashed across two pages on the full-color picture menu, sun-dried beef and pork with fried leaves of Kaffir lime made an easy-to-crave snack on their own, while the Isan sausages and pork roll worked better as pauses between spicy bites of larb and papaya salad. The restaurant is proud of its chicken thigh under a shower of fried garlic; it might have been wonderful straight out of the oil, but it was distinctly warmed over when I had it. Above all, you want papaya salad, absolutely, and you want it as spicy as you can stand. Somtum Der measures heat on a chile-pepper scale, with four chiles denoting a psychotropic level of spice. The cooks don’t always interpret this the same way, even on the same night, but most of the time a four-chile papaya salad will mean five minutes during which you are incapable of doing anything but sweating, squirming, trying to blot your tongue with rice and gulping mouthfuls of Beer Lao.  A lager from Laos, Beer Lao is a definite notch in quality above Singha, and several notches above Somtum Der’s stabs at Asianesque cocktails. It will, however, be all but useless if you are in the grips of a papaya salad armed with four-chile firepower by the man near the door. In that case, there is nothing you can do but wait.

208,Piora ,★★,2013-11-19,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-piora-in-the-west-village.html,West Village,"You can put up with mediocre food in a restaurant that has other things going for it. When an exciting chef works in a terrible dining room, though, you feel the way you do when a friend hooks up with somebody you can’t stand. You may visit the two of them once or twice to savor the full extent of the new partner’s awfulness, but then you run for cover while you await the end.  That’s the reaction most diners had to Tenpenny when Chris Cipollone was the chef. Nearly everyone agreed that his food was terrific but that eating it in the charmless lobby of a Midtown hotel was like being buried alive with your last meal.  When news of the breakup finally came, Mr. Cipollone’s admirers began to hope they could start hanging out with him again. This summer, they got what they wanted, and Mr. Cipollone got the restaurant he deserved.  Piora, next door to a West Village pet boutique where you can buy metallic-gold PVC dog collars, isn’t large. The tables are leather-topped, as if you were about to sit down for a hand of whist, and they are hemmed in so snugly that when servers converged to set down three plates at once, they looked as if they were playing Twister. Right hand, trout! Left hand, suckling pig! But the place has been put together with intelligence and taste. You walk past a long bar attended by men in spotless white jackets, as if they had been flown in from Harry’s Bar in Venice.  Then you arrive in a square dining room with walls inscribed by long, sinuous horizontal lines. They look a bit like tentacles emanating from a sideways jellyfish, but they’re strangely soothing, and they make the space look bigger. In another optical trick, the room seems to extend past the windows in the back to a tiered and illuminated garden that makes those of us with plants at home wonder why ours don’t look this green in November. Mr. Cipollone has definitely traded up, and he’s cooking as if he knows it. Imagine, if you can, four people fighting over carrots. It happened, and one of his appetizers was the cause. Some of the carrots were roasted in ham fat until they collapsed into their own sweetness; some had a humming spiciness locked inside them; under them was tangy white yogurt and on top, a pink drift of powder. “Ham snow,” our server said. If there are Bac-Os in heaven, I had better get some religion, because this is what they’ll taste like. Piora is owned by Mr. Cipollone and Simon Kim, a Korean-American who has management experience under Thomas Keller and Jean-Georges Vongerichten, and Korean flavors dart in and out of the menu. Mr. Cipollone makes fearless use of gochujang, the fermented hot-chile paste, blending it with shrimp stock and slathering it over crunchy and charred legs of grilled octopus. The gochujang, hot and deeply funky, is almost too much, but fresh basil leaves and candied pine nuts rein it in.  But before you file Piora away under Asian fusion, be aware that the one thing you must eat is the pasta. Mr. Cipollone, an Italian-American, loves to play with pasta, but he is not chained to the traditions of Italy. He simmers black garlic bucatini in crab stock and tosses it with crab meat, adding maitake mushrooms for earthy depth. He underlines the candy-like flavor of roasted red kuri squash inside tortellini with a butternut squash juice that’s a little less sweet, a two-note melody in the key of squash. Purple rigatoni — there’s red wine in the dough — looked odd but tasted great, with peppery, fennel-seed-flecked duck sausage and lengths of the bitter green called spigarello. “I like the tortellini,” the best cook at my table said, “but I want the recipe for the rigatoni.” Personally, I want to know how to make the side dish of toasted hazelnuts with crisp bits of caramelized sunchoke. It’s as crunchy as granola and nearly as sweet, and I’d eat it for breakfast. Life can’t be all sunchoke granola and ham snow, though. Dullness creeps in. A purée of prunes stewed in tea wasn’t dynamic enough to help the washed-out flavor of a duck confit appetizer fried in a puck. Even more spectral was the taste of a suckling pig main course, although a wonderful slaw of fried burdock root and radishes nearly made up for it.  But dry-aged duck breast had a potent steakhouse intensity, and if its sauce of puréed jujubes, the Korean date, had a somewhat flat sweetness, duck jus enriched with black garlic gave it a savory kick. In a gentler mode, halibut was topped with sweet-sour ribbons of pickled butternut squash and given a last-minute swirl of toasty brown-butter fumet. Piora is about to hire its first pastry chef. With luck, it will land one who has better ideas than squirting lychee foam next to a gooey chocolate tart, or doubling down on the perfumey taste of Earl Grey cake with a scoop of Earl Grey sorbet. Until a new regime enters, I’ll content myself with a glass of 12-year-old Guyana rum filtered one drop at a time through sliced bananas. It sounds like what you would put in the bottle of a baby with a drinking problem, but it is an excellent and serious nightcap. The men in the white jackets know their booze, and Piora’s cocktails are tautly balanced and ungimmicky. This restaurant and chef are so pleased to have found each other that at times they fall into the slightly stiff good manners of somebody trying to impress future in-laws. The servers, in slate-colored striped aprons, are attentive, numerous and rather serious about this whole business of dinner. Ours can’t be blamed for our fight over the carrots, having solemnly informed us when we sat down that Mr. Cipollone’s food isn’t meant to be eaten family-style but should be consumed in separate courses, one dish to each diner. You don’t say. Now could someone please tell me what I’m supposed to do with these shiny pieces of metal next to my plate? This style might play better in a grand restaurant like Per Se or Jean Georges than it does in this cozy back room on Hudson Street. Once Piora moves beyond its self-imposed formality, it and Mr. Cipollone can start to settle in and get comfortable. This time, it looks like things may last.

209,Sushi Dojo,★★,2013-11-12,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-sushi-dojo-in-the-east-village-and-kurumazushi-in-midtown.html,East Village,"Disco music with raw fish in the East Village may not strike you as a winning formula unless you remember when Avenue A had what was probably the only sushi bar in the city with a mirror ball and a D.J. booth. Everybody called it Disco Sushi, and I loved it for reasons that had nothing to do with the food. I had eaten enough good sushi to know I couldn’t afford it. But cold rice, fake wasabi and sinewy fish mattered much less when vinyl records and the mirror ball were spinning, the tables were filling up with musicians waiting for a 1 a.m. gig at Brownies, and we were all on our third round of sake bombs. I didn’t realize how much I missed Disco Sushi until I found Sushi Dojo, which opened this summer on First Avenue near East Sixth Street. There were no turntables in sight, but the room was filled with retro disco. Usually, bone-thumping dance music is the way restaurants say “we hate you” to their customers. But at Sushi Dojo the tracks by Chromeo, Sare Havlicek and the like were played at a humane volume and compiled with an evident love for high-sheen, poppy neo-disco. And while I didn’t spot any sake bombs, plenty of people were getting bombed on sake. Ask the sommelier, Max Lidukhover, for a recommendation and he’ll give you two samples that would pass for full pours in other places, and if you’re not wild about either, he’s likely to uncork a third. Along the way he’ll teach you the basics. “Ginjo sake is very harsh,” he’ll say. “I don’t recommend it unless you’re looking to get wasted.” This is not necessarily discouraged at Sushi Dojo, where you can see customers in lip locks, customers waving their arms in full I-love-you-guys mode and customers buying rounds for the chefs, a Japanese custom that the staff avidly embraces. All this would earn Sushi Dojo a heartfelt welcome to the neighborhood even if the food didn’t stand out. But it does. The soul of this party is sushi worth getting crazy for, made by three chefs with a strong traditional bent: Hiromi Suzuki, Makoto Yoshizawa and David Bouhadana. Mr. Bouhadana is the ringleader, and the most exuberant customers seem to gravitate to his end of the counter. One night I asked Ms. Suzuki for $75 worth of sashimi and sushi, dealer’s choice. Sashimi came first: entwined bands of unshy, oily horse mackerel under a stubble of chives; firm white squares of local striped bass; shiny sunset-pink Arctic char jolted with lemon; bonito seared by a pass of the blowtorch; a slippery-soft tongue of raw spotted prawn next to its armored head. The streaks of fresh wasabi I drew with a chopstick tip underscored what Ms. Suzuki had already done with her knives, her torch and her seasonings to enhance the texture and taste of each kind of sashimi. Next, she placed one matchbox-size piece of sushi at a time on a banana leaf: glistening golden-eye snapper; a purplish strip of needlefish with skin that flashed like steel; yellowtail belly that melted like whipped lard; wild Alaskan salmon warmed by Ms. Suzuki’s blowtorch just long enough to melt some of the oils; and a delicate slip of sea eel, one of the finest I’ve found anywhere. This was more than raw seafood; it was the work of a thinking chef, and it was a treat. It was also a lot of high-quality fish for the price. If $75 is beyond your means, an entry-level 10-piece omakase sushi meal costs just $45, although it probably won’t include many seasonal specialties like needlefish or rarities like live, still-wriggling octopus. Not every piece I had at Sushi Dojo was exceptional; baby cuttlefish refused to surrender its flavor, and I wasn’t sure if a scallop, overpowered by wasabi, had much to hold on to. The rice can wad together stubbornly rather than falling into separate grains, too. But its gently vinegared seasoning blooms in the mouth, lifting up the taste of fish. There is a surprisingly long menu of cooked food, and while it doesn’t quite keep pace with the sushi, it’s more than respectable. If this kitchen fried it, you want it: shrimp in their crackling shells; a beehive of mizuna and seafood tempura with green-tea salt; a horse mackerel’s skeleton, dispatched to hot oil after you’ve eaten its body as sashimi. Kurumazushi is where I would have gone in my Disco Sushi days if I’d been able to afford it. Ruth Reichl gave it three stars in its last review in The New York Times, in 1995. At the time, many sushi hounds regarded it as the best in the city. Some still do, but I am not one of them. My meals in this restaurant, hidden on the second floor of a small Midtown office building that, like one of the artist Ben Katchor’s streetscapes, has sidestepped the modern age, offered some extraordinary tastes: king crab from Canada; very sweet squid made tender by a fine lattice of crosshatched cuts; gleaming amberjack and horse mackerel; and a hand roll of fatty tuna and scallions that made me forget how to speak for a minute or two. But an omakase meal that starts at $300 should make you fall silent more than once or twice. Some of the sushi might have come from a far less exalted restaurant: the eel drenched in sugary sauce, the forgettable salmon roe, and an array of seafood that would have had no character at all if not for the dab of fresh wasabi. The fish was too cold, a particular issue with fattier cuts like toro. The main culprit, though, was rice, a mass of starch so in need of seasoning that it erased the flavors of the fish like blotting paper. And while the wasabi on sushi was the real thing, the green stuff on a sashimi plate, one course in a $140 prix fixe meal I ate in the front dining room, was not. That room is a cheerless place, and lacks Kurumazushi’s greatest asset: Toshihiro Uezu, the chef. An antic, grinning presence, Mr. Uezu has as much fun as anyone in the restaurant. Standing between the sushi counter and a wall that looks like a raked sand garden in Japan, he slams metal trays of fish on top of one another, catches his breath, and turns to a customer: “O.K.! Sushi or sashimi? You choose or I choose?” And then he is off. “Horse mackerel,” he says, reaching across the counter with a length of pinkish fish draped over rice. “Horse?” a customer asks, unsure he’d heard it right. Mr. Uezu loves this. “Yes! Horse!” he says. “Secretariat!” He laughs. Everybody laughs. Just like that, it’s a sushi party.",Sushi Dojo in the East Village and Kurumazushi in Midtown,"['disco', 'music', 'raw', 'fish', 'east', 'village', 'strike', 'winning', 'formula', 'unless',

210,Quality Italian,★,2013-11-05,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-quality-italian-in-midtown.html,Midtown,"The steak will be here in a minute. First, the show. Our server parks a trolley next to a window above Midtown in Quality Italian’s sprawling main dining room. “I’m going to make your steak sauce,” he announces as he drops oregano and parsley leaves into a mortar, cranks the pepper grinder and muscles down on it all with a pestle. “Tomato-garlic sauce,” he says, adding three spoonfuls. “Now raisin molasses.” He stirs with a clatter, making as much of a production of it as any mutton-chopped bartender ever made of a julep.  “The owner likes us to do things tableside,” he says. “It’s a little kitschy, but it’s fun.”  This would make a reasonably accurate motto for Quality Italian itself. The owners are Michael Stillman; his father, Alan; and Craig Koketsu, whose company, Fourth Wall Restaurants, is bravely battling the creeping solemnity and earnestness of parts of the New York restaurant scene.  Fourth Wall has one restaurant where not just the menu but the décor and the name change with the seasons (Park Avenue Winter, Park Avenue Spring, etc.) and another that salutes the tiki gods with drinks in watermelons and coconuts (the Hurricane Club). To the Stillmans, “gimmicky” is a compliment and “too gimmicky” is a phrase with no meaning.  Quality Italian, which opened this summer, is in some ways a clone of Fourth Wall’s steakhouse a block away, Quality Meats, but the executive chef, Scott Tacinelli, has grafted some Italian-American food onto the menu for good measure. The result is, as my server promised, both kitschy and fun, although the food is so uneven you may as well order by spinning a roulette wheel, a gimmick the Stillmans don’t seem to have tried yet. This is the restaurant that finally answers the question, “What if we set lobster fra diavolo on fire?” Enter a server pushing another trolley. He pours vodka infused with hot Calabrian chiles over a pan of sweet red-pepper sauce. Now the match. The flame climbs the stream of vodka and engulfs the bottle’s neck. It threatens to engulf the server, too, but he’s quick, and there is no damage: neither to his hand, nor to the lobster, which was not stunningly flavorful the night I had it, nor to the sauce, which was. At Quality Italian, you don’t get zeppole after dinner. You get a Zeppole Workshop. The pastry chef, Cory Colton, fills a galvanized pail with fried balls of dough and sends them out with a sifter of powdered sugar, a jar of honey with a honey wand, a tiny pitcher of chocolate sauce and a scoop of ricotta ice cream, creamy and not too sweet. You do the rest.  That’s the kind of work I excel at, especially if it means that I get to skip the Zeppole Workshop’s less exciting cousin, the Cannoli Cart. This is yet another trolley upon which a server stuffs limp wafer shells with a blend of mascarpone and ricotta that is as blandly sugary as canned frosting. After tasting these cannoli, I wanted to flag down another cart to take them away. Better yet would be a swap cart, where you could trade the cannoli for the lovely lemon meringue tart in its rectangle of crisp sugar-crust pastry. Even the vegetables perform tricks. Servers stir an egg yolk into bacon-studded kale carbonara, and they crack the glassy surface of caramelized sugar above corn baked in a sweet custard: corn brûlée. Both are preposterously rich, but good. It’s hard to believe the same kitchen that makes these would send out sunchokes roasted to a flavorless, baby-food mush inside deflated skins, little pantyhose-colored bags of regret. Distinguishing between entertaining ideas and silly ones is not Quality Italian’s strength. Serving gelati in a paper cup has a Dairy Queen charm, but stamping those cups with the red Safe Handling Instructions label found on meat packages is just bizarre, unless the Stillmans want to educate the public about the risks of E. coli in ice cream. And dressing the female servers in modified French maid outfits may not be the most forward-thinking policy for a restaurant catering to Midtown professionals of both sexes. (Maybe the Stillmans nabbed the idea from Le Relais de Venise, the steakhouse chain, which seems to get away with it by being French.) I wanted to believe there was more than kitsch to the chicken parmigiana that looked and acted like a 13-inch pizza. But its shroud of browned cheese was more like Tombstone than Totonno’s; its fried breading was limp, and after our server had sliced the pizza into wedges with a wheel, the chicken turned out to be spongy ground breast and thigh meat almost completely free of seasoning. Other diners report tasting herbs and salt in the patty, but even that, and a serving that easily feeds two with leftovers (in a pizza box, of course), wouldn’t persuade me to pay $58. Luckily, a fair number of dishes don’t do anything but sit there and taste good. Oysters baked under sea urchin butter and bread crumbs are a briny thrill. Nearly as good are the baked clams, with their doubly crunchy topping of bread crumbs and crisp angel-hair pasta.  Both a filet mignon, tall and proudly alone on an empty white plate, and a sirloin, served on the bone, hit all the classic steakhouse marks, from the glossy, fleshy interior to the matter-of-fact sear. A medium-rare rib chop, though, was inexplicably lean, chewy and dry; almost all the flavor was in the crunchy trimmings left on the bone. Help was not going to come from the steak sauce, drowning in sweetness and clogged with oregano. It could have used some of the energy that a sensational sour-cherry mostarda with fried sage brought to a Berkshire pork chop.  Pasta dishes have nothing like the finesse they get at Michael White’s steakhouse, Costata, but the porterhouse agnolotti in brown butter and vincotto had the transfixing depth of dry-aged beef, and the sickle-shaped creste with shrimp in spicy tomato sauce were bright and appealing.  Finesse may be beside the point at a place where servers proudly tell you that the Quality Burger on the lunch menu is “served with Quality cheese.” The kitchen needs to work on the first half of the restaurant’s name. But judging by the crowds and the number of times I heard “Happy Birthday to You,” the Stillmans seem to have figured out that some people would still rather eat in a theater than a church.

211,Hearth,★★,2013-10-29,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-hearth-in-the-east-village.html,East Village,"Reading the opening lines of Hearth’s last review in The Times, published in 2004, is like strolling among the headstones in New York’s vast restaurant graveyard. The critic at the time, Amanda Hesser, observed that one-word names had become fashionable, and gave recent examples: Ilo. Tappo. Beppe. Gonzo. Pazo. Pico. Salt. Fresh. Supper. Canteen. Commune. District. Town. These establishments, more than half of Ms. Hesser’s roll call, didn’t last.  Hearth did. It thrived not because it cruised along in the tail winds of a nomenclature fad, but because it diligently looked the other way as fads came and went. The same potato gnocchi wallowing in a wading pool of melted butter that Ms. Hesser praised will be on every second table tonight. Everybody else will get the same rich but not filthy-rich polenta, although the ground corn is now typically grown in upstate New York, not South Carolina. Returning again this fall are the same improbably long bands of handmade pappardelle that drink the braising juices of a fine duck ragù. If you woke up shivering because you went to sleep with a window open and the temperature dropped 30 degrees overnight, this is the bowl of noodles you want.  From the start, Marco Canora, Hearth’s chef and, with Paul Grieco, its owner, set out to adapt the transparency of Tuscan cooking to his own region and time of year. He gets few points for the originality of his vision. But for his fidelity to it, Mr. Canora’s score is off the charts. By all accounts he is in the kitchen on East 12th Street almost every night, even as he and Mr. Grieco have replicated their wine bar next door, Terroir, in four other neighborhoods.  As Hearth approaches its 10th anniversary next month, you can tell the kitchen is paying attention most of the time. Not always: one night the gnocchi would have had no flavor if not for the melted butter and grated cheese on top. Dry, stringy salt cod mantecato needed more richness, and it was stuffed in a bitter roasted yellow Hungarian pepper that needed more sweetness. Siobhan DeCarlo’s desserts were variable, too. I had a nearly perfect cardamom panna cotta with a coffee-caramel sauce one night, and a dry, drab pear spice cake with almost no hint of spices on another. I noticed the lapses because they were so out of character, like John Boehner vaping on an e-cigarette. In the dining room, though, inattention was closer to normal. The servers seem friendly enough, smiling in their plaid shirts and bluejeans with napkins peeking out of the back pocket. But all my meals could easily have been finished 45 minutes sooner, without rushing. While I waited for somebody to take an order, or bring the main course, or clear dirty dishes, there were pauses long enough for several species of Amazonian frogs to go extinct.  Ordering wine wasn’t always simple, either. Once when I asked a server about a wine, she admitted she didn’t know much about it but promised to find out. Instead she came back 10 minutes later with the bottle; we were halfway through our main courses by then, so we didn’t stop her from opening it. Any restaurant can get into the weeds, but the weeds at Hearth seem especially fast-growing and luxuriant. If I had been alone, I would have passed the time reading Mr. Grieco’s wine list. This passionate, garrulous, name-checking manifesto exhorts us to drink mead (“a true symbiosis between insect, nature and man”), urges us to drink riesling (“To say that Riesling is great is as obvious as saying Vladimir Putin is the Michael Corleone of Russia”), pleads with us to drink sherry (“the most underrated beverage on the planet earth”) and revises the lyrics to a Justin Timberlake song (“It’s my wine in a box, my wine in a box babe”), twice. The tension between Mr. Grieco’s confrontational wine list and Mr. Canora’s soothing menu is one of the springs that keeps Hearth in motion.  Another is Mr. Canora’s understanding of the seasons. Once a vanguard notion in the United States, cooking with seasonal ingredients is so mainstream that chefs of all stripes practice it, from the modernist gear heads to the New Nordic foragers who can tell you exactly when to pick toothwort roots.  But chefs who plug this week’s ingredients into a style of cooking that stays the same all year long, who incorporate pumpkin and pheasant into their gels and streusels and cantilevered fronds asymmetrically disposed on just one side of the plate, seem to forget that it isn’t just the farmers’ market that changes with the seasons. Our appetites change, too.  One night in June, when restaurants in the East Village had their doors thrown open and the neighborhood took on a relaxed, unhurried mood, I ate a salad that put me in the same kind of mood: sweet, firm, bright-green favas and bits of soft young pecorino, dressed with vinaigrette and chopped parsley. In early fall, I ate just-cooked canestri, like bent rigatoni, tossed with braised cauliflower and wilted Tuscan kale; on top were toasted bread crumbs that stayed crisp until the pasta was gone, which bread crumbs never do when I make them. What made the crunch of the crumbs, the chew of the noodles, the long, mellow flavors of the vegetables so satisfying was the way they filled a hunger I wouldn’t have felt a month earlier.  Even though Mr. Canora rarely has more than two pastas on the menu, that’s what comes to mind when I think of Hearth. I also picture the platters for two. The spatchcocked chicken with flavor in every scrap of its flesh and golden skin, the whole roasted fish stuffed with lemon and rosemary, and the côte de boeuf are all treated like the classics they are. Unlike other restaurants, where trendy platters for two are an old-fashioned opportunity for price gouging, Hearth sells the chicken and fish for about as much as two regular main courses. For the beef, which could probably feed three, $125 isn’t out of line. Hearth received two stars from Ms. Hesser, who praised it for what she called “good, familiar food given a little luster.” After 10 years it’s easier to see that familiarity as Hearth’s path to timelessness.",Hearth in the East Village,"['reading', 'opening', 'line', 'hearth’s', 'last', 'review', 'time', 'published', 'like', 'strolling', 'among', 'headstone', 'york’s', 'vast', 'graveyard',

The snouts and I were in Whiskey Soda Lounge Ny, which the chef Andy Ricker opened in August. It serves as a way station where people can nosh and drink and watch Muay Thai highlight reels while waiting for a table at Mr. Ricker’s Pok Pok Ny down the street. Whiskey Soda Lounge is more than that, though.  It’s also a gallery of Thailand’s bar snacks, which you almost never see in the United States except at Mr. Ricker’s other Whiskey Soda Lounge, in Portland, Ore. Along with Khe-Yo, a new Laotian-inspired restaurant in TriBeCa, Whiskey Soda Lounge joins a busy crowd of kitchens turning New Yorkers on to Asian dishes that we might have treated with extreme caution not long ago. New Yorkers will pinch raw tripe in miso between chopsticks at Takashi in the West Village, rip crisp folds of grilled chicken skin from skewers at Hanjan in Chelsea, and line up for the softer morsels of a lamb’s head at the scattered outposts of Xi’an Famous Foods.  Our pain threshold for spice is rapidly climbing, too. Blistering Isan cuisine has been taking over the Thai scene, and incendiary Sichuan food is turning up all over, riding a great orange tide of chile oil.  Whiskey Soda Lounge, in the Columbia Street Waterfront District in Brooklyn, feeds the city’s appetites for both spice and novelty. To tell the truth, that pig snout was so leathery that chewing on it was like getting nourishment from an old football. But I dug into the crunchy pig tails and invitingly tender pork tongue beside it on the plate, a constant special, dipping them into a dark and intense sauce called jaew, made from soy, dried chilies and toasted ground rice. Jaew turned up again with deep-fried strips of marinated pork called muu sawan, a sweet, crunchy and irresistible species of jerky.  Offal anchors the tom saep muu, a clay-pot soup in which a vivid hot-and-sour pork broth elevates the blunt flavors of chopped heart, liver and tripe. One spoonful reminds you that the first cook who combined chilies, lemon grass, Kaffir lime, galangal and lime juice deserved a Nobel Prize for aromatic sciences. The soup and some other spicy dishes are not murderously hot, but they are not meek, either. The dressings on two excellent salads — yam plaa meuk, or squid with tomatoes and celery, and yam het huu nuu khao, tomatoes and scallions with ruffled white mouse-ear mushrooms — had the kind of warmth you feel in your joints, not the kind that makes you want a tongue transplant.   There are gentler dishes, too. A deep-fried Thai analogue to Scotch eggs, khai luuk khoei, comes with a relatively nonincendiary tamarind dipping sauce, although you can crank up the heat with bits of toasted dried chilies. One of Mr. Ricker’s most lovable hits, the Vietnamese-style chicken wings marinated in fish sauce and garlic, can be ordered spicy or less spicy, and neither version is as fierce as the kind you’d find in a sports bar. Drink a cocktail if spiciness becomes an issue. Drink a cocktail in any case, because the ones at Whiskey Soda Lounge, like Pok Pok Ny, are fun and refreshing, and because the food almost demands it. Few items, except for maybe the wings, are substantial enough to be main courses. Still, you can easily put together a satisfying meal out of a few snacks, a salad and divots of sticky rice. It isn’t a going-out-to-dinner kind of night, but it makes a great field trip with one or two other bar-stool travelers. Khe-Yo, opened in July by the chef Marc Forgione and Soulayphet Schwader, one of his longtime cooks, works the other way around. It’s easy to navigate the menu, with appetizers and main courses heavy on animal protein serving as recognizable landmarks. But while much of the food is very appealing, not all of it makes you feel as if you’ve left home.  The most intriguing flavors hide out in Khe-Yo’s sauces. Grilled black bass that comes to the table with its blackened head staring up like a totem is ordinary until you wrap it in lettuce with a funky, salty jam of tamarind and peanuts. This makes it great. A similar transformation happens when you dip the sesame beef jerky in a thick paste of assorted dried smoked chilies pounded with galangal. The condiment is as dark and glossy as shoe polish, and the peppers contribute both fruitiness and spice that make it wonderfully complex.  Meals at Khe-Yo always begin with sticky rice in a bamboo basket, along with two sauces. One is an eggplant mash, with the funky, salty taste of fish sauce. The other is called bang-bang sauce, fresh red chilies and cilantro pounded in a mortar with lime juice and fish sauce. Its genuine heat can improve some of the underspiced dishes you might run into later on, like the excessively mild-mannered laap salads (the one with sliced duck breast and braised and fried tongues is the most compelling) and the lackluster grilled chicken. It doesn’t help the meek papaya salad, though, which needs more chilies before it leaves the kitchen. Servers invariably described the sticky rice and sauce combo as “our bread and butter service.” This hand-holding feels superfluous for New York in 2013, as does the repeated instruction to wrap food and herbs in lettuce to “create your own perfect bite.” The cooking of Laos is rare in the city, to be sure, but certain dishes and ingredients overlap with those of northern Thailand next door, and at this late date the lettuce wrap probably needs no introduction. A highly skilled cook with a sharp eye for ingredients, Mr. Schwader was born in Laos and moved to Kansas with his family when he was 3 years old. Right now his menu is a little more timidly westernized than it needs to be, but his kitchen may become bolder as he gets a sense of how far New Yorkers are willing to go.  Meanwhile, diners hungry to try a few Lao dishes in unreconstructed form can go a few blocks south to Mangez Avec Moi at 71-73 West Broadway, (212) 385-0008. Its name isn’t promising, nor is its “authentic pan-Asian cuisine” tagline. But after 4 p.m., the chef, Jeannie Ongkeo, sends out a short Lao menu.  Her papaya salad hummed with fresh chilies and fermented seafood, and her nam kao, a crispy rice salad with shredded coconut, had a taut balance of hot, sour, salty and sweet. My favorite was “or stew,” a murky bowl of slippery mushrooms and eggplant cooked with Kaffir lime, lemon grass and branches of fresh dill. It was the first time I’ve tasted flavors quite like it, but I hope not the last.",Khe-Yo in TriBeCa and Whiskey Soda Lounge Ny in Brooklyn,"['crunching', 'grilled', 'pig', 'snout', 'thai',

213,Lake Pavilion,★★,2013-09-24,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/25/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-lake-pavilion-in-flushing-queens.html,Flushing,"“Uh-oh,” I said under my breath. “Is there a wedding here tonight?” I tried not to sound nervous. I’d talked seven people from three boroughs into traveling to this Cantonese restaurant in Flushing, Queens, about a mile south of the Flushing stops on the 7 train and the Long Island Rail Road. But I hadn’t made a reservation. The dining room seats slightly fewer people than Citi Field. The only way we might have trouble getting a table would be if the entire place had been rented out by a couple about to walk hand in hand into marital bliss. And that’s exactly how it looked.  A classical white arbor stood at the entrance, threaded with silk rosebuds. Lavender swags had been draped from the rafters, and lavender napkins were propped up in the water goblets. Shiny gold curtains hung in the windows, and enormous bows in pink or burgundy flopped from the back of every chair. Servers were buzzing around, immaculately dressed in black suits with red bow ties or striped neckties. But no, there was no wedding. Lake Pavilion looks like that every night. It is almost certainly New York’s snazziest banquet-style Cantonese restaurant located in a former diner. Since its opening last year, it has shimmered above the Main Street exit on the Long Island Expressway in a squiggle of blue neon. Off the main dining room, in a string of private rooms marked by varieties of tea spelled out in red LEDs, Chinese families salute birthdays and other milestones with lobsters the size of single-engine planes.  For the rest of us, finding a Cantonese seafood restaurant as good as Lake Pavilion is a reason to get a group together. By day, dim sum trolleys cruise the dining room like a fleet of dumpling-laden Zambonis. The real interest, though, is in the menu, which goes on for about a dozen pages and does not waste any of them on Chinese-American silliness. This kitchen is as serious as any in the city about Cantonese classics, along with a few more recent notions from Hong Kong. If Dungeness crabs are in season and you do not have a life-threatening allergy, please order them. Get them stir-fried with ginger and scallions, their cracked legs and deep-dish bodies sticky with a sauce that will end up everywhere while you pull the meat from the shells: on your lips and nose and thumbs and probably your earlobes.  At least as delicious and certainly less gooey is the house special, a casserole of Dungeness crab stacked up on sticky rice that’s been lightly browned while being turned and tossed with roasted peanuts, garlic chives, ham, onion and liberal strafings of fried garlic.  When the crabs scuttle offstage between seasons, you could bide your time with clams in “hot spicy XO sauce.” It looks like soup, the clams submerged in sauce that is not just hot and spicy but also sour, salty and really deeply funky. The sauce gets aromatic depth from onions and bell peppers and a lovely lift from lemon peel, and it’s so intense that the clams taste as if they’ve been stewing in it for hours, yet they’re barely cooked. Stringy, yellowing water spinach and “crispy fried chicken” with garlic, which was neither crisp nor garlicky, were the only cases in which I wasn’t rewarded for testing my luck with the menu.  Sometimes I pointed at a photo of something I wouldn’t have ordered otherwise. This is how I came to try the bizarrely compelling sea scallops in a black pepper sauce that seemed to belong on a TV dinner steak. When nobody was looking, I kept stealing another scallop from inside the circular green hedge of broccoli, convinced that what I was doing was somehow wrong, and not caring. Menu pictures also helped me give mayonnaise prawns another chance. In other restaurants I’d been left cold, not to mention bewildered, by the combination of fried shrimp, candied walnuts and lemony, MSG-laced mayonnaise. Lake Pavilion adds deep-fried pillows of thickened condensed milk. I am not sure why I loved this particular version. I’m not even sure why the dish exists, but I am glad it does.  Should you want to drive deeper into unusual terrain, I can recommend the goose webs in a casserole with bok choi and Chinese black mushrooms. The thick, floppy webs, which you suck from the goose’s bony toes, had a fascinatingly earthy flavor that reminded me a little of fresh pork belly.  If that doesn’t fully scratch your itch for adventure, do try the screw clams. Stir-fried with snow peas and yellow chives, they look a bit like squid, crunch slightly between your teeth and have a faint, delicate flavor. Screw clams are not clams. They are often called osmanthus mussels, although they are not mussels, either. They’re organs extracted from sea cucumbers, which are not, of course, vegetables.  But there is no shame in having something as simple as the excellent stir-fried lamb chops, whose only sauce is a little oil deeply flavored with browned garlic and shallots, or something as old-school as Peking duck. Lake Pavilion does the dish beautifully, shearing off rectangles of skin with a cleaver and tucking them inside yeasty steamed buns dabbed with a little hoisin. The soft buns make a much more satisfying foil for the crisp skin than the pancakes you usually see in New York, and by the time the rest of the duck had been carved, our table was still passing around the platter of little sandwiches, going back for just one more. A group of six or eight is about right for the duck, and for Lake Pavilion. But look out for the gentle upsell. Order one lobster or Dungeness crab, and your server may ask if your gang wouldn’t be better off with two. If you want a fish netted in a splash from the tanks by the door, you may at first be shown the species that cost $35 a pound, $75, or more. Ask for cheaper options, like a speckled grouper from Mexico that emerged dense and moist from the steamer, and cost less than $20 a pound.  Your server may not push a $110 bowl of shark fin soup, still legal until next summer, but may suggest an off-menu soup served in a hollowed-out winter melon for around $50. Politely decline in favor of the more humble winter melon soup that’s on the menu, its homespun chicken broth full of sweet seafood and ginger slivers. A pot that serves the whole table is $12.95. I can happily report that when I ordered a drink, nobody tried to upgrade me to the 2009 Opus One for $350. I got a Tsingtao, no questions asked.","Lake Pavilion in Flushing, Queens","['“uhoh”', 'breath', '“is', 'wedding', 'tonight”', 'tried', 'nervous', 'i’d', 'talked', 'seven', 'people', 'borough',

214,Estela,★★,2013-09-17,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/18/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-estela-in-nolita.html,Nolita,"If you wanted to take the measure of Ignacio Mattos’s cooking at Estela, which opened on East Houston Street in June, you might look at the burrata on the menu and think: no, too easy. Anyone can slap burrata on a plate and wait for the moaning to start. But order it anyway, so you can see what happens when Mr. Mattos puts this louche, voluptuous cheese on a juice cleanse.  The burrata sits like whipped cream on charred bread. Soaking into the bread and pooling around it is a brooding green liquid pressed from lovage, sorrel, celery and other foliage. It looks like something you would force yourself to drink after doing very bad things to your body. Ingesting it with burrata must be some kind of preventive medicine, the after-midnight ibuprofen with a bourbon chaser.  That’s not what it feels like, though. When this fatty sprawl of dairy is brought to heel with fresh and grassy vegetable juice, it becomes something you taste, not something that washes over you in a big creamy wave. It’s strange but it’s right. Strange food is often born from a need to kill boredom, ours or the cook’s. It can keep kitchen and dining room awake through what would otherwise be another night of spaghetti and salad.  Mr. Mattos’s cooking at Estela has a mild case of weirdness. It is just unfamiliar enough that I had eaten about a meal and a half there before it dawned on me that nearly everything is Mediterranean, more or less. I should have seen that one coming, given that Mr. Mattos, who grew up in Uruguay, cooked at Chez Panisse for a year and Il Buco for five.  The cooking is almost familiar, but not quite, and it’s the little differences that get under your skin. The flatbread served with an excellent potato-thickened mash of salt cod is a rye matzo. And a whole squid and a spring onion, both griddled on a plancha and served with a reasonably traditional Romesco of red peppers and hazelnuts, look like a leathery, podlike alien creature alongside a blackened stem that snakes down the plate. The mild strangeness drew my attention to how deep and elemental the flavors of both dishes were.  Mild strangeness hasn’t always been Mr. Mattos’s preferred line of attack. When he was the chef at Isa, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, he reveled in deep, surrealist weirdness. His best-known dish there was fried sardine skeleton, which looked as if it belonged behind glass at a museum of natural oddities. I remember rattling my jaw on nearly raw grains and getting my first taste of sweet potato leaves, which until then I had thought were poisonous.  Estela, which Mr. Mattos opened with two partners, Mark Connell and a wine-guy-slash-general-manager named Thomas Carter, is far less confrontational in ways that go beyond the kitchen. Within two seconds of climbing the steps to this spare and intimate little dining room, you know that there will be a speech on how the menu works, that most of the dishes will be small, that sharing will be encouraged, that the noise level will climb steeply, that the meal will cost more than the menu prices lead you to believe. (This is a particular danger if you aren’t careful with wines, because Mr. Carter leads us into three-digit temptation much more often than you’d expect from a list that’s relatively compact.)  The dishes aren’t composed of pixel-size bits of food that have to be divided by laser surgery; they generally share well. This is a good start, but then Estela, like many small-plates restaurants, neglects the so-called share plates that you actually eat from if you treat each new creation from the kitchen as a serving platter. The share plates at Estela are no bigger than tea saucers, and are rarely swapped out. One night assorted juices and sauces from eight recipes swirled together before a fresh plate came along. It was like seeing eight movies projected on the same screen at once. New or bigger plates would help you to focus on the energetic crackle Mr. Mattos gives beef tartare by folding fried sunchoke chips into the raw meat, or the low growl of spice he lends to a fried egg and gigante beans by pairing them with bread cubes dunked in harissa. Ingredients that don’t appear to have been tampered with often have a depth of flavor that takes you by surprise. There’s the invisible pop of yuzu and grapefruit hiding inside wheels of uncooked summer squash arranged like scales over intensely sweet raw scallops and puréed avocado. There’s the lemon that perks up white rounds of kohlrabi dressed, simply and wonderfully, with shards of fossa cheese, mint and crushed, toasted hazelnuts. There are usually only four large plates (what we once quaintly called main courses), but Mr. Mattos makes them count. Cod is briefly salt-cured and slowly pan-seared until it surrenders into soft, meaty flakes. Pork shoulder is as juicy and red as steak, and the steak is something else again. As he does in other dishes, Mr. Mattos uses flecks of char almost as a spice. With the pulse-quickening slices of beef, the blackened edges from charred eggplant get together with the oily intensity of anchovies for an irresistible roughness and force.  Desserts look simple. O.K., they are simple (there is a panna cotta and three low-key sundaes based on grapefruit, chocolate or blueberry sorbet). But Estela’s consulting pastry wizard, Alex Grunert, gives each one a little snap, crackle and pop, and they end up being more satisfying than some high-end sugar landscapes. Early on, it’s true, there was a sardine dish that was like a public repudiation of the one at Isa, replacing weirdness with dullness. And the night I found that the matzo was being served with drably spiced egg salad instead of that great whipped cod, I felt as if I had traded a classic six for a studio.  It doesn’t matter. Mr. Mattos is not trying to shock us, but he is not trying to pacify us with the tried and true, either. It’s a thin line he’s walking, and if he didn’t wobble occasionally, that would be truly strange.",Estela in NoLIta,"['wanted', 'take', 'measure', 'ignacio', 'mattos’s', 'estela', 'opened', 'east',

215,Armani Ristorante Fifth Avenue,★★,2013-09-10,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/11/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-armani-ristorante-fifth-avenue-in-midtown.html,Midtown East,"A few opulent restaurants opened right after the economy fell apart in 2008, like guests who pound on the door long after the lights have been turned out and the hosts have gone to bed. The rest of the city looked up from a collective hangover at their flashy outfits and expectant smiles and said, “Um, the party’s kind of over, dude.” Armani Ristorante, inside the Armani store on Fifth Avenue in Midtown, was one of those late arrivals. The mood in the city was humbled, downsized, frightened, and here was an expensive restaurant reached by a private elevator from the street or, better, a sinuous white ramp that twisted past two floors of gowns and luxury leather goods like a floating catwalk. After a lunch there in early 2009, Frank Bruni, then the New York Times restaurant critic, wrote a blog post noting that “the whole thing just feels sort of tone-deaf and odd.” He never reviewed the restaurant, which seemed likely to end up in the same landfill where they’d deposited the carcass of Lehman Brothers.  Some people’s money is more durable than others’, though. Giorgio Armani apparently kept pumping his into the restaurant, his first in New York.  Here it is today, as another New York Fashion Week sashays to a close. The restaurant’s kitchen is now under Sandro Romano, who arrived last spring after seven years as chef de cuisine at the Modern. The catwalk is intact, and tiny blue and purple lights still twinkle in the windows over Fifth Avenue. The white circular booths with black leather tops are still there, too, looking like the Mad Tea Party ride at Disney World, transported to Armani World.  Dolled up like that, Armani Ristorante will always be somewhat odd. But since the stock indexes hit record highs in August, it hasn’t seemed quite as tone deaf. With main courses averaging around $35, it is cheaper than (don’t laugh) Carbone, and in the same range as some Upper East Side Italian stalwarts where the cooking and service aren’t as refined. If the prices are out of touch, then so are large patches of Manhattan. Yes, if you ask for sparkling water, you will get Acqua Armani. Does the bottle, skinny as a fashion editor and stamped with a big block A, justify $11? I’d say no, but I’d say yes to the wine list, which has a surprisingly generous number of wines under $50. One night while I was scanning the Southern Italian whites, a sommelier materialized at my elbow and pointed right away to a crisp and sunny Sicilian grillo for $39. You’d have trouble matching that price at some downtown joints that pass as inexpensive. The sommelier did this without making me feel like a cheapskate. Another server showed similar discretion one night when a woman at my table immediately peeled back the glittering silver skin from a branzino fillet. “Ah, but that’s where all the flavor is,” he protested briefly, then flashed a wide smile that beamed understanding.  He was right about the skin. It was the best part of a lovely dish, its slight fattiness offset by cracked pink peppercorns and sage. Mr. Romano sets the fish on a green circle of Italian salsa verde made from arugula and fresh herbs blended with olive oil. The bright taste of the raw greens is just what this mild but meaty fish needs. Mr. Romano has a sensitive hand with seafood. It was on display on a long plate that held five raw tastes of the ocean, like branzino dyed purple by a bath in beet juice, and a sweet, firm langoustine with tart little bits of green apple. He mimics the look of seared sea scallops with short stacks of meltingly rich potato gratin. Shaved black truffles looked dramatic but didn’t follow through with the expected flavor; all the pleasure was in the gentle interplay of the potatoes and scallops. The only seafood letdown was baby octopus, which had even less flavor than the truffles. Remarkably good polenta was wasted on those bland little legs. Pasta was a trickier proposition. Lasagnetta, a tower of roasted eggplant slices layered with tomato sauce, smoked scamorza and fresh pasta rolled very thin, was a little like eggplant Parmesan and a little like lasagna, but more delicate than either, getting restrained richness from basil oil and a Parmigiano-Reggiano sauce.  Spaghetti and shaved dried tuna roe, on the other hand, got no help from slabs of tuna belly that were as mushy as a black banana. And green tagliolini was overdressed with a muddle of mushrooms and truffles and two whole langoustines dropped in the center of the bowl. Removing one accessory, Coco Chanel-style, would have focused the flavors and helped lower the ridiculous $38 price tag. I chalked both misfires up to an off night. They and other dishes didn’t have the same sparkle I’d seen on my other two visits, making me wonder if Mr. Romano is still consolidating control over the kitchen.  His menu is at its best when it takes its cues from the understated style of Milan, Mr. Armani’s base of power. The rice in black risotto with speck-wrapped cuttlefish had precisely the firm but creamy texture it should. And when the bone-in veal chop Milanese showed up, I just sat there smiling for a minute because I could tell from the gorgeous, tanned crust how much fun I was going to have eating it. Apart from gravity-bound bomboloni, the desserts were worth giving up any dreams I might have of fitting into something sold by Armani other than a sofa. There is a fine molten chocolate cake, called a fondente, with an espresso gelato that has the licorice kick of Sambuca. A puff of raspberry mousse and tongues of meringue topped a barely set panna cotta. My favorite was the least traditional: an after-dinner salad of strawberries, and inky balsamic vinegar with micro-wedges of tomato and a refreshing basil gelato. While the prices aren’t quite so out of step with the times, nobody would describe Armani Ristorante as of the moment. The tiny colored lights and view above the sidewalks always reminded me of two places from an earlier era:  Windows on the World and the revolving lounge at the top of the Marriott Marquis in Times Square. I miss the first one and still like the second one, so maybe I’m the one who’s late to Mr. Armani’s party.

216,The Pines,★,2013-08-20,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-the-pines-in-brooklyn.html,Gowanus,"Someone who used to prowl around CBGB and other clubs when punk and new wave were breaking their first guitar strings told me he had seen one particularly untutored band at least 30 times. “Really?” I asked. “Yeah,” he said. “The first 15 times, they were just awful.”  I didn’t need to ask why he had stuck it out because the band was Television, and they went on to harness their early chaos into two obliquely beautiful records.  Some restaurants are like that. Even if they don’t have the mechanics down yet, their glimmers of originality can keep drawing you back. None of my five meals at the Pines since its opening late last summer in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn has been in the “just awful” category, but two were so frustrating I swore I’d never return. The opening line of my notes on one dinner reads, “I am done with giving this place a chance.” Three months later, I was back. That night, the Pines and its chef, Angelo Romano, were in control of their chords and the tempo from start to finish. Dinner began with a short glass of chilled soup, or maybe it was a virgin cocktail: tofu whipped with mint into a frothy green drink. Lolling at the bottom were juicy little Champagne grapes, a burst of sweetness lightening the intensity of the mint. Next was a salad. Wheels of yellow cucumber had been marinated with a yuzu green-chile paste to give them a citric tang and a low burn. They were set beside a pool of almond milk and stacked with thin medallions of more almond milk, this batch thickened to the texture of silken tofu.  It was very good, and the next course was simply great: razor clams and trout roe with pinched squares of fresh pasta that Mr. Romano calls borsa vuota, or empty purses. The pasta seemed undercooked and under-clammed until I gave it a stir, sending the purses down to soften in the spicy miso-butter sauce, and bringing up a dividend of extra shellfish and slices of tiny hot red chiles. There had been flashes of excellence before that night, but they had been obscured by hospitality issues, strange kitchen decisions and checks whose totals had a way of ambushing me.  The Pines, about a five-minute walk from the Gowanus Canal past windowless industrial buildings and stubby little houses, looks like an indie band sounds. Beat-up pressed tin ceilings have been nailed across some patches of wall, and others are covered in bare wood slats. Spooky dried flowers and herbs hang over the bar, evoking not a Tuscan farmhouse but an abandoned cabin being used for Wiccan rituals. Next to the kitchen is a signboard with cryptic handlettered slogans: Fugazi. Rainbows and Unicorns. Pray 4 Weezy. Beards: They Grow on You. Despite the untucked appearance of the Pines, it is surprisingly easy to spend what you would in a slick Manhattan restaurant. One night I’d rolled in like a drug dealer, hundreds of dollars stuffed in my pocket because I knew the Pines didn’t take credit cards. Service was vague and distant. We waited interminably for food, cocktails, even glasses of wine. To settle the check at the end of a long, slow night, I needed about $100 more than I had brought.  I knew from the Web site that there was an A.T.M. in the restaurant. It was broken. Lots of businesses are opening on Third Avenue around President Street, but the area is not yet one of the world’s banking capitals. After a 10-minute search on foot, I got into my car and drove until I found a cash machine.  On other nights, the food was perplexing. Mr. Romano, who cooked at Roberta’s before striking out on his own at a short-lived Williamsburg restaurant called Masten Lake, has a discerning eye for prime ingredients, but isn’t always as discerning about his ideas.  Cappellacci that looked like bishop’s miters were filled with a giddily tender and rich oxtail ragù, but the pasta was as thick as shoe box cardboard and nearly as stiff. The cappellacci were undercooked at other meals, too; apparently it’s a feature. Coating sea urchin with crunchy BBs of toasted amaranth grains and serving it with tart, astringent sea buckthorn juice struck me as a mean thing to do to a nice, gentle ingredient. Most memorable was the squab — dry-aged and roasted with its feet on — that made the bird look as if it were running. It may have been running away from the oven, because one breast was still bloody. The raw-pigeon incident nearly ended my fascination with the Pines. Luckily, though, I remembered eating other things that were distinctive and skillfully prepared. On recent visits, such dishes have become the rule, not the exception. In the spring, Mr. Romano made the smart decision to treat ramp greens like spinach, sautéing them to softness and surrounding them with a concentrated tart-sweet late-harvest vinegar. A fried duck egg and Marcona almonds balanced their garlicky bitterness. This summer, he dressed tender young purslane with a vibrant emulsion of mint and garlic. A savory foam of warmed egg yolks had been shot between the purslane branches, a lovely way of adding creaminess to the crisp greens. Mr. Romano is fond of esoteric ingredients like sea blight and Japanese knotweed, but he can wring terrific results out of more-common ones. Lightly cooked corn juice under slices of roasted pork shoulder offered profound, summery pleasure, and cabbage cooked with fish sauce, sambal and smoked pork jowl layered Asian flavors in an unexpected and very welcome way. And his choice of melted aged beef fat with chunks of bone marrow as a sauce doubled down on the beefy intensity of a Wagyu culotte steak. As my meals have been getting better, the restaurant has been growing up. The no-reservations policy was dropped. The service has become more polished and knowledgeable, ready to tell you what that glass of Slovenian refosco or other wines on Mr. Romano’s willfully obscure list will taste like. And as of last week, the Pines accepts some credit cards. These civilities make it easier to take a chance on a night that costs a bit more than the cover charge and a beer at CBGB in 1975.

217,Costata,★★,2013-08-13,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-costata-in-soho.html,SoHo,"So this is where he decides to bring us: back to the same place on Spring Street where it all started. The year was 2002, the restaurant was called Fiamma, and he was just another hungry 29-year-old chef from the Midwest. We didn’t know yet that his name was Michael White. We just knew that when he cooked Italian food, he could make us forget about all the others for a while. Now he has bought the place and renamed it Costata. This time around it’s a steakhouse. He is credited as the chef and owner, with PJ Calapa as the executive chef and Robert Truitt in charge of the dessert menu. But he definitely wants us to remember the early days here, and maybe reassure us that even though he’s been spending a lot of time on the road lately, we still mean something to him.  All those Foreigner and Stone Temple Pilots songs aren’t helping to set the mood. And those huge white cotton chandeliers with accordion folds are distracting. They look like air filters for monster-truck engines. The votives are a nice romantic touch. Except those aren’t candles; they’re flame-shaped light bulbs programmed to flicker on and off. They fit right in with the jokey space-age décor at the Butterfly, his new bar in TriBeCa. But on Costata’s white tablecloths, they look cheap.  And these teapots are sleek and shiny, but he’s sending them out two at a time, one with a tea bag and hot water, the other with just hot water, because a single pot won’t fill a teacup. He wouldn’t buy us teapots just because they were on sale, would he? Or is this ... a regift? But tonight let’s stay focused on the good times. To remind us, he’s making the garganelli he used to do at Fiamma, those ridged quills with peas, pancetta and, oh, that truffle cream. Wow. As indecently rich as we remembered it. This spaghetti with clams almost eats like carbonara, with its sticky yellow-tinged sauce that clings to the noodles. The casarecci, bent scrolls blackened with squid ink, have a powerful oceanic undertow that pulls the sweet shrimp and sepia along in the current.  For a minute, we’re wondering if he’s laying it on a bit thick, showering shredded fontina over the oxtail ragù with cavatelli. Then we take another bite and decide that when somebody makes pasta as wonderful as this, there are some questions you just don’t ask. Though we do want to know how many people take the menu’s advice and order pasta as a side dish with steak. Costata’s pasta shouldn’t have to compete with anything.  We should know. We’re never sure we’re getting his full attention anymore. He’s a blur, opening three restaurants since May. He didn’t seem to be trying very hard to make us happy with his last one in New York, Nicoletta. Now he’s got something going on in Hong Kong, and in London. And who knows what he does at those two places in New Jersey.  If he wants to persuade us he’s not spread too thin, some of the cooking at Costata isn’t helping his case. Raw branzino is obliterated under a black mash of salty taggiasca olives, although what little of the fish’s flavor comes through suggests that obliteration may be the right call. Potatoes puréed with barrels of melted butter and Parmigiano-Reggiano taste great, but they are gluey and oafish.  The brilliant-red coral butter painted on a split and roasted lobster the size of a dachshund looks stunning, but it’s irretrievably salty. And the generic red-meat flavor of lamb chops is a $49 shock. Some of these dishes have a coarseness that wasn’t there when we first met, or even later on, when he took us to Convivio and Alto and Marea. And the relationship feels a little one-sided now. If we had given him $59 for a bone-in rib-eye back when he was so eager to impress, would he have turned around and asked for another $3 for compound butter and $4 for sauce? Or maybe our memories have gone all misty and watercolored. Oh, now he’s going to try to sweep us off our feet again with crudo, the way he did at Marea. We’ve seen this move before.  And you know what? Apart from that sad branzino, the old moves still work. Those beautiful red prawns with lemon, olive oil and a prawn-head stock are extraordinarily fine. So is the fluke, sparkling beside the green divots of Castelvetrano olives and slow-roasted grape tomatoes. And these thin disks of sea scallop, so sweet and pure on a blanket of puréed celeriac, with diced celeriac pickle and fresh, herbal celery leaves — they’d destroy our resistance even without the head-filling taste of black truffles in the vinaigrette.  All right, the guy’s a magician with seafood, too. Roasted langoustines had better be exceptional at $19 apiece. They are. We’d come back for a second taste of the chilled lumps of tender lobster with strips of honey-coated guanciale cooked like bacon and a thick cocktail sauce that delivers a Bloody Mary’s loving slap to the head. The truth is that we always loved his gut instinct for richness and fresh, bright flavors. We don’t really need him to cook us a steak. But by now we’re ready to be won over.  The filet mignon delivers all the tenderness we want and more flavor than we expect. Pink within and a rich caramel brown on top, the veal chop is everything we ask from that cut. The pancetta-black pepper sauce takes to it the way a cat takes to an empty lap. The bone-in strip is a very good piece of beef, though it doesn’t have the intensity of the best dry-aged meat. Neither does the 40-ounce porterhouse, though big enough for at least two people, for $116. Called the Fiorentina, it’s a handsome carnation-pink all the way through, but it has no crust to speak of and is lukewarm on arrival. It’s all steak and no sizzle. For sizzle, we’ll spend $2 more to get the Costata, a 44-ounce rib-eye on the end of a theatrical curve of roasted bone. Bathed in mouth-coating melted fat, the meat is so tender beneath its dark crust that slicing it makes you feel like a bully. This steak alone is a reason for the restaurant that it’s named after to exist. When the meal ends, Mr. Truitt is a master of extending the good feelings and then building on them, with desserts that are quietly sophisticated without flaunting their cleverness.  Things aren’t the way they used to be. They’re not quite the way we pictured them in the beginning. But give us the cavatelli and a rib-eye, or a few langoustines, and for tonight, we’ll be happy.",Costata in SoHo,"['decides', 'bring', 'u', 'place', 'spring', 'started', 'called', 'fiamma',

218,ABC Cocina,★★,2013-07-30,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-abc-cocina-in-manhattan.html,Flatiron,"Apparently there are people who believe that the Internet has made restaurant critics irrelevant. I’d like to direct their attention to this text from the ABC Cocina Web site: “abc cocina & michelin star chef jean-georges vongerichten welcome you to our modern global exchange celebrating local craft and international culture, a fusion of tradition and innovation uniting yesterday and tomorrow.” Got that? There’s more: “experience the vision of abc home curation, a romantic and mystical atmosphere and succumb to a dynamic love affair with an eclectic and enchanting cuisine.” If that gives you a vivid picture of what is in store for you at this three-month-old establishment, stop reading and use the free time that now stretches out before you to do something nice for a stranger. If, on the other hand, you found a few passages somewhat hazy, I’ll be happy to do my job.   This “modern global exchange” is what we critics like to call a “restaurant.”  By and large it is a very good one, with a few odd touches. It is overseen by Mr. Vongerichten, who collaborates on the food with Dan Kluger, the executive chef here and next door at ABC Kitchen. “International culture” must refer to the menu, which rummages through the cupboards of Spanish-speaking countries in Europe (that would be Spain), Mexico, Central America and South America (although you don’t need to go to Argentina these days to find chimichurri). This attempt to reassemble the Spanish Empire does not shed new light on any of these cuisines. Intellectually and culturally, it borders on incoherence. But in the kitchen it has inspired a large number of smart, exciting dishes along with a small handful of slightly peculiar ones. You can get along just fine without intellectual coherence when the flavors are as clear and harmonious as they are in a ceviche of white shrimp bathed in a vivid citrus sauce. Just as the throb of habaneros begins to build up, a bite of soft banana or a crisp Marcona almond breaks the tension. And sure, maybe the first person to put cucumber, dill and yogurt together with cured salmon wasn’t all that fluent in Spanish. Fine. ABC Cocina’s version is still great, with dried chiles powdering the edges of the sweet and smoky fish, and an unexpectedly bright acidity in the cucumber, which is zippy where you expect it to be soothing. There’s an alchemy at work at ABC Cocina, the kind that can turn the last thing you’d want to order into the first thing you’ll ask for next time around. For me, it was the vegetables with brown rice, which I expected would taste like a tea made by steeping the yellowed pages of the “Moosewood Cookbook” in warm kombucha and straining it through Pigpen’s bandanna. It was, in fact, one of the freshest, cleanest vegetable dishes I’ve tasted all summer. The rice was fluffy, not gluey, and each vegetable — baby fennel, tender carrots, skinny asparagus — spoke out clearly. The rice was dressed with a salsa verde that came across as more of an herb vinaigrette with a citrus rasp and a little spice. The vegetables were so tender and seasonal, you could call this a farm-to-table dish, but it’s almost too light on its feet for that. The “michelin star chef” (Mr. Vongerichten has done all right by this newspaper, too) and his protégé are both minimalists, but in different ways. Mr. Kluger has a gift for making his ingredients, especially the vegetables, taste a little purer than almost anyone else’s. With the best of Mr. Vongerichten’s dishes, on the other hand, it’s not the main ingredient you remember as much what he has done to it: a three-ingredient sauce or marinade whose ingredients are suspended in a tense standoff. Once in a great while, the two approaches — one interventionist, the other more conservative — are at war. I loved the deep, meaty flavors of roasted maitake mushroom chunks pieced together around a core of warm goat cheese, but couldn’t understand what either ingredient was supposed to get out of a sharply acidic Fresno pepper vinaigrette. And I’d skip the sweet barbecue sauce with black sea bass; the interplay of thyme and tamarind in the marinade was enough to carry the fish. More often, the team of Vongerichten and Kluger puts you in the excellent dilemma of not knowing which you like better, the food or its sauce. Should more restaurants have fried squid this sweet and fresh, or should more of them look beyond lemon wedges and marinara to find something with the rounded sweet-and-sour depth of ABC Cocina’s ancho glaze? I hope this kind of dish is what “fusion of tradition and innovation uniting yesterday and tomorrow” means, and not the drippy, messy burger going around in taco drag. The warm, slightly shiny tortillas have a depth of masa flavor that is shown off better by roasted mushrooms with a peanut-based mole. Or by the one big piece of tempura-fried fish with spicy mayonnaise and citrus-dressed cabbage. Or by the BLT taco, which translates each element of a classic  Mexican pork-based taco into idiomatic American English, with roasted pork belly and a red-and-yellow jumble of tiny, juicy heirloom tomatoes. I know what you’re thinking: enough with the eclectic, enchanting cuisine already — let’s hear about the romantic, mystical atmosphere! I am sorry to disappoint you, but ABC Cocina didn’t seem very romantic to me, or especially mystical, either. It looked to me like a fairly simple cafe, with metal chairs and bare tables, located inside a lighting showroom. That is essentially what it is. The restaurant, like ABC Kitchen, is inside ABC Carpet & Home, and nearly every object is for sale: lighting fixtures, chairs, plates, pyrite rocks, fragments of wasps’ nests and water bottles that come with a stick of charcoal (“the vision of abc home curation”). A surprising number of those lighting fixtures have tiny bulbs embedded in long tentacles that dangle over the dining room like jellyfish. I could see how it might be romantic and mystical if you are sexually attracted to gelatinous sea creatures. As for “dynamic love affair,” you are going to have to ask Google.

219,Daniel,★★★,2013-07-23,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-daniel-on-the-upper-east-side.html,Upper East Side,"Your job may be worrying you, or your father’s health, or your own. You may have been up at 2 that morning drafting a better ending for a long-ago memory. But certain restaurants, if you can afford them, can knock down the barriers between you and happiness for a few hours. Every taste seems to transport you to another world, while every gesture of the staff convinces you that you live in the privileged center of this one.  Daniel, which turned 20 this year, can make you feel that way. Does chilled pea soup sound like the stuff of privilege? It is when it comes from this kitchen, where Jean François Bruel has been the executive chef since 2003, and which Daniel Boulud, the proprietor, watches over from a windowed perch above the saucepans and sieves.  Those sieves got a workout on this soup, straining it to a gliding smoothness. It had the clear, refreshing sweetness of the smallest peas eaten straight from the pod. Salty diamonds of smoked sable and a white ring of rosemary-infused cream helped the soup’s purity shine more clearly. This kind of exquisitely sensitive, profoundly seasonal, fundamentally French cooking helped lift Daniel to several four-star reviews in The New York Times, the most recent one by Frank Bruni in 2009.  Again and again, I have been startled by the excellence of Mr. Bruel’s ingredients and his talent for unlocking all they had to offer. I have never tasted more calmly flavorful veal tenderloin, or fresher and more gently handled swordfish, or a more skillfully roasted breast of guinea hen. But some of these star ingredients were embedded in elaborate, multipart compositions that didn’t fully reward the attention they demanded. At times, the restaurant gave the impression that it was trying to garnish its way to greatness.  And while the service can be among the best in the city, with a supreme attentiveness softened by a surprising warmth and even chattiness, it is not always that way for everyone. When people who are known at the restaurant tell me about their meals, they look blissful. Others look disappointed or resentful as they tell me about cramped tables in the neoclassical arcades around the grand sunken dining room and hasty, perfunctory service.  One night I had a reservation 15 minutes apart from a colleague who wasn’t likely to be recognized, as I repeatedly was. We both ordered the six-course $195 tasting menu. (A three-course prix fixe dinner is $116.) Our meals were virtually identical. Our experiences were not. The kitchen sent two amuse courses to my table. His got one. A few remaining sips of my wine, ordered by the glass, were topped off. His glass sat empty at times while he waited to be offered another.  We both ate extraordinary fried lollipops of filleted frogs’ legs on a long stick of bone, but only I was then brought a napkin-covered bowl of rosemary- and lemon-scented water for rinsing my fingers. My servers were solicitous: Was this course, or that one, or that one, prepared to your liking? Was the pacing of the meal satisfactory? Could we interest you in a cheese course? Would you like your espresso with dessert, or after? Finally, as I neared the revolving door on East 65th Street: Can we help you find a cab tonight? My colleague wasn’t asked any of those questions. Still, the next morning, he reported feeling very well taken care of. And a restaurant can’t be blamed for trying to impress a critic.  It can be faulted, though, for turning its best face away from the unknowns, the first-timers, the birthday splurgers, the tourists. They are precisely the people who would remember a little coddling at a place like Daniel for years. And while a missing finger bowl won’t seriously mar anyone’s evening, missing Daniel’s cheese cart might. It is one of the finest four-wheeled vehicles in New York. Whenever I wondered if I really wanted cheese, a server would lay his knife on a soft wheel, pressing gently. The mounded top would fall for a moment then rise up again, gracefully and almost willingly. After that, the question was not if I should have some, but how many kinds could fit on one plate. It was just as pointless to try to wave away the basket of Mark Fiorentino’s gorgeous breads, like a garlic focaccia, round and dimpled in the center. Rajeev Vaidya, the head sommelier, shepherded me past the many bottles that could land a weak wine lover in debt to more affordable ones. He has a 2007 halbtrocken from the German riesling maker Georg Breuer. Some buyers scoffed at the vintage, pushing prices down, but not Mr. Vaidya. A bottle can be yours for the princely sum of $25. Recently, the title of executive pastry chef passed from Sandro Micheli to Ghaya Oliveira, and the dessert course, already exciting, has a little more energy. Ms. Oliveira’s approach is more modern and wide-ranging, embracing unusual spices and exuberant swipes of color. Her mint-scented strawberries are a giddy, flagrant essay in pink, with triangles of watermelon, columns of half-frozen strawberry mousse and ladyfingers tinted with powdered strawberry skin. It was a soft, lilting summer tune I won’t get out of my head before Labor Day. The courses before dessert could be just as wonderfully haunting. I’d give a lot to recapture the happiness I got from slow-baked abalone, rich with creamed avocado and slightly tart with heart-shaped wood sorrel. I’m still transfixed by a peekytoe crab salad’s bravura variations on apple and celery, carried through to the juices in a walnut-oil vinaigrette. And nothing quite prepared me for the untamed whoosh of intense green herbs in a bowl of olive-oil-poached cod teased into big, glistening flakes, then seasoned with za’atar and a bright cilantro sauce. But the kitchen’s compulsion toward complexity could also result in a proliferation of dollhouse garnishes. Grilled sweet shrimp were outfitted with a heart of palm purée, microcubes of mango and cucumber, bok choy, tiny tapioca crackers, curls of shaved hearts of palm, among other things. The parts never quite gathered into a rush of flavor. A variation on Mr. Boulud’s classic roasted sea bass with syrah sauce came with radicchio so bitter I wanted to slap it. A drum of sweet potato purée with a candylike crust of marrow on top only made the next bite of radicchio harder to take. The kitchen loves to put two or three treatments of an ingredient side by side, when it might do better to focus on the one that works best. In a triptych of striped jack, a poached piece on a salad of mustard seeds with cubes of riesling gelée tasted as if the components were destined to be together. But there wasn’t the same inevitability about the lettuce-wrapped dumpling of striped jack tartare topped with caviar, or the smoky rillettes surrounded by crunchy carrot and asparagus. Daniel built its fame on Mr. Boulud’s exquisite refinements on French peasant food. Over the years, the refinements have multiplied while the peasant food has been sent away to his many spinoff bistros.  Traces of it are still around, as in the short rib braised in red wine, half of a beef duo. The last time I tasted it, I was sure it was the finest French beef stew in existence. I knew my servers were trying to make my night one I’d recall with a smile. And I wished everyone could be so lucky.",Daniel on the Upper East Side,"['job', 'worrying', 'father’s', 'health', 'morning', 'drafting', 'better', 'ending', 'longago', 'memory', 'certain', 'afford',

220,Uncle Boons,★★,2013-07-02,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-uncle-boons-in-nolita.html,Nolita,"The smallest blackout I’ve ever lived through was limited to the interior of a Thai restaurant on Spring Street, just off the Bowery, named Uncle Boons, where early one night the electricity kept cutting out, then flicking back on a few minutes later. Almost every foot of wall space is covered with pictures that might have been picked up at a Bangkok flea market: portraits of Thailand’s kings, thrift-store paintings, prints of jungle beasts, a monster-movie poster in Thai and semi-English (“Once again dinosaur shake the erath!”). But staging a Southeast Asian power failure seemed to be taking the conceit a bit far.  We didn’t stop eating, though. I would bring my own generator if that’s what it took to finish the mee krob with fried sweetbreads. In many Thai restaurants in the United States, the fried noodles in mee krob are dispatched into dissolved brown sugar with trace amounts of fish sauce and lime juice. The result is as interesting as spaghetti in pancake syrup. The sauce at Uncle Boons, which starts with tamarind pulp and palm sugar, was rounded and rich and deeply engaging. And a little thing like iffy wiring wouldn’t keep me away from the yum kai hua pli, a salad of warm roasted chicken torn and tossed with crunchy threads of sliced banana blossoms. The chicken would have been great by itself, but it was the dressing that helped it shine through the power failure: warm coconut milk soured with lime juice and spiced with dried chiles to an intensity that I think of as handkerchief-hot. Uncle Boons must have fixed its electrical troubles, because they did not recur. What did return was my excitement at tasting Thai flavors so fresh and dynamic. The restaurant has less in common with Queens Thai dynamos like Ayada, Sripraphai, tiny Chao Thai or its roomier spinoff Chao Thai Too than it does with Pok Pok Ny, Andy Ricker’s place on the Brooklyn waterfront. A few of its tricks might have been lifted from Mr. Ricker’s backpack. There is the charcoal grill, visible behind a glass wall at the end of the bar. There is the tight menu that doesn’t give you the choice of chicken, beef, pork, shrimp or squid with almost every curry, a concession that holds back some of the best Thai restaurants.  Both places look like dark, woody Thai pubs, right down to their motorized ice buckets that shake bottles of Singha until they turn into alcoholic slush that you drink through a straw. (It won’t be the best beer you’ve ever had, but it may be the coldest.) Pok Pok Ny follows through with many other wacky and excellent Thai beverages, while the drinks are Uncle Boons’s prime blind spot. Neither of the two cocktails is a complete triumph, and even the iced tea with sweetened condensed milk tastes watery. But Uncle Boons has many charms all its own. The owners and chefs, Ann Redding and her husband, Matt Danzer, met while working as cooks at Per Se, and the marks of Thomas Keller’s ballet academy are far more visible than you’d expect at a place that plays warbly Thai covers of “Another Brick in the Wall” and “Hang On, Sloopy.” The tables are set with folded cotton napkins and traditional brass forks and spoons from Thailand. Three months after the restaurant opened, the dining room staff is already quite polished, poised and welcoming. The third time the lights went out, a server brought every table an unnecessary but delicious little apology, a plate of mieng kum, little one-bite snacks. Mounded on a soft, fresh betel leaf are fresh ginger, coconut, dried shrimp, peanuts and very hot chiles. You dab on some shrimp-paste sauce, fold the leaf over and pop it into your mouth, and right away your taste buds spring to attention. It’s a preview of the flavors that will become major themes of the meal. Coconut milk is the foundation of the remarkably aromatic curry of chicken livers and fresh pineapple called dup kai kaeng supalot, and of an amazing massaman curry with shredded potato and braised beef cheeks that break up the minute you dip a spoon into the bowl. In place of the gloppy peanut-butter sweetness found in many American massamans, Uncle Boons makes a drier sauce with the exotic muskiness of a walk through a spice shop, punctuated by the crisp pungency of green peppercorns.  Over four meals, Uncle Boons appeared to be working its way toward consistent excellence. Still, there was one night when the green mango salad tilted too far into sourness, and another when damp, clumpy fried rice with crab suggested that the wok had been a few degrees shy of the smoking fury that leads to great fried rice. Spice levels could waver, too. But with only one or two exceptions, Uncle Boons came through with searing heat when it was called for, especially in that chicken salad or with a laab of minced lamb wok-fried to a deep mahogany and served warm; fresh mint and cilantro temper the spice but in no way tame it.  Subtle flavors have a place in Thai cooking, too. There’s a hint of a 1970s suburban party dip to the lon pu kem, which offers raw snap peas, radishes, crisp green mango and Thai eggplant to be dunked into a bowl of creamy, coconut-rich crab dip. And there is just enough fresh green chile in a thin nam prik sauce to bring out the sweetness in charcoal-grilled blowfish tails or baby octopus that would fit in your palm if you were silly enough to place them there and not between your teeth, where they belong. A coconut-milk-based curry yellow with fresh turmeric is one key to the greatness of Uncle Boons’s khao soi. But really, everything in the bowl plays a part: the chicken leg stewed to irresistible tenderness, the pickled mustard greens, the big frizz of fried cilantro-flecked egg noodles on top and the same noodles boiled in the curry. I wouldn’t scream if Ms. Redding and Mr. Danzer threw a few more dried chiles into the pot, but this is still the best khao soi I’ve eaten in New York.  Ms. Redding was born in northeastern Thailand, but before opening Uncle Boons she and Mr. Danzer roamed the country, and their cooking does, too. The couple may be in the market for a better electrician. But where it counts, in the kitchen, they have all the power any lover of Thai food could ask for.",Uncle Boons in NoLIta,"['smallest', 'blackout', 'i’ve', 'ever', 'lived', 'limited', 'interior',

221,Lafayette,★,2013-06-25,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-lafayette-in-noho.html,NoHo,"In some corners of the food media, the opening of Andrew Carmellini’s new restaurant, Lafayette, was written about the way successful nuclear tests are covered on North Korean television. Some of this was because of Mr. Carmellini’s record as a chef and restaurateur. His first two places, Locanda Verde and the Dutch, are so well loved that he would probably draw a crowd if he sold nothing but Lorna Doones and ginger ale.  But Lafayette serves French food, now getting a second wind in New York after years of running on steak-frites-scented fumes. Apart, perhaps, from Daniel Boulud, no chef in town is better equipped to make that cuisine relevant and exciting again than Mr. Carmellini. A walking Larousse Gastronomique, he spent six years at Café Boulud working within the traditions of France as gracefully as he danced around them. Given a NoHo corner lot with miles of windows, the restaurant Mr. Carmellini came up with is like a junior Eataly for Francophiles. There is a pastry shop and bakery, a cocktail bar and an all-French wine list. Damon Wise, an ace technician from Craft and the Monkey Bar hired by Mr. Carmellini as chef de cuisine, wears a toque as he oversees an open kitchen where chickens on spits slowly give up their melting fat. All of this is packed inside the brass-and-mirrors skin of a brasserie that stays open from morning to midnight or thereabouts.  As for the food, there are salads and charcuterie and oysters and shoestring fries. Almost all of it is worthy, but very little seduces you. Lafayette wants you to fall in love with it, but it tries too hard in some ways and not hard enough in others. It’s a restaurant that is a little too easy to place in the friend zone. The nonromance starts at the door. One night when a private party had taken over the basement, Lafayette let large, unfunny security men with earpieces stop diners on the sidewalk for questioning. One prospective guest with a reservation said he was on his way inside to meet somebody. “For what?” came the reply.  When Lafayette’s staff members were handling first impressions themselves, the greeting was not always warmer. One night I was briskly packed off to the bar and ordered to come back and tell the hosts when the rest of my party had arrived, even though my other guests were sure to check in before searching for me. Nobody seems to have helped the servers pronounce simple French words on the menu. Specials weren’t mentioned until I asked, and a menu change (trout in place of dorade) wasn’t disclosed until I ordered it. A basket of country bread was placed directly in front of the only woman at the table, as if she were supposed to eat the whole thing herself.  This wouldn’t be such a bad fate; baked by James Belisle, the bread is outstanding, with a dense, mildly tangy rye and whole wheat crumb beneath a thick band of crust that shatters with a noise like a motorcycle boot stepping on a bag of potato chips. But the service at a restaurant as busy as Lafayette needs a brisk professionalism leavened with charm, or else you start to feel as if you are eating in the largest and most elegant Pain Quotidien in the five boroughs. The details matter.  Luckily Mr. Wise and Jennifer Yee, the pastry chef, are as detail-oriented as they come. Ms. Yee is a master of classic tarts (both a cherry-almond frangipane tart and figs baked on a wheel of puff pastry were high points not just of the meal but of the month); modern French desserts (her charred mango with toasted coconut and lime parfait is a sunny and sophisticated tropical holiday); and, for good measure, all-American classics (she makes a great whole-wheat carrot muffin, which should be an oxymoron. The muffins are sold at the bakery counter alongside my favorite almond croissant in the city and other viennoiseries baked by Mr. Belisle). My meals leading up to dessert were often very good, even if they didn’t always reach the same highs. The red-wine sauce in tripe bourguignon is a terrific achievement: fruity but not sharp or winy, it has a bittersweet richness like good dark chocolate. The pastas, too, were reliably impressive, like the little postage stamps of ravioli filled with goat cheese and squirted with a pesto that had a just-picked freshness, or the fleur de soleil, tender and silky little flowers tossed with snap peas, pancetta and mint. The eggs Lafayette, hard cooked with smoked sable heaped into the yolk hollows and trout roe gleaming on top, tasted like three or four great brunch dishes in one small, luxurious package.  Duck breast au poivre under pinwheels of candied kumquat had a more concentrated and meatier flavor than some steaks, although the watery disks of braised radish remained on my plate.  Sometimes a modern tidiness goes too far, though. The seasoning on a neat patty of beef tartare was too polite and the frisée salad was too prim, with dainty bits of house-made bacon and an egg cooked too long to melt into the vinaigrette.  A bouillabaisse that could have been the best in town was undercut by its serving dish, photogenic but impractical. The lobster tail, langoustine, mussels and monkfish were all handsomely cooked, and the shellfish broth was wonderfully aromatic with saffron and pastis. But spreading it all out in a shallow copper braising pan meant that both seafood and sauce were tepid within minutes.  It’s now off the menu. I hope it’s simply gone to Williams-Sonoma to buy itself a deep porcelain bowl, because a spectacular bouillabaisse could help Lafayette get out of the friend zone. The by-the-book pork pâté won’t do it. Neither will the rotisserie chicken. Tender and flavorful as it is, it still puts you in mind of Fairway, not Chez l’Ami Louis. Profoundly sweet and fresh scallops won’t do it, either, not if they are languishing in a nondescript pea purée surrounded by a meek spoonful of morel jus. Another chef-engineered burger won’t do it, even if this one, served at lunch, gets its terrific flavor from ground brisket, and neither will a soft-shell crab on a toasted brioche. The crab is faultless, but the sandwich belongs in another restaurant. The name of that restaurant is the Dutch.  Dishes that would be equally at home there, or at Locanda Verde, are everywhere. This may make fans of those restaurants feel welcome. It may also help Mr. Carmellini move cooks from one kitchen to another. But it doesn’t give Lafayette the strong point of view that would make it feel like something more than a good choice in the neighborhood of the Public Theater. Of all the adjectives that might describe a French restaurant built by Andrew Carmellini, Lafayette brings to mind the last one I would have expected: optional.

222,Kajitsu,★★,2013-06-18,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-kajitsu-in-murray-hill.html,Murray Hill,"When I eat at Kajitsu, a restaurant that practices an animal-free cooking tradition called shojin ryori, I am never shocked to find that I don’t miss meat or fish. When the Japanese have been working on an idea for hundreds of years, they tend to figure out a few things. To express wonder that Kajitsu’s chef, Ryota Ueshima, can fashion a delicious multicourse meal out of nothing but plants and mushrooms is like being astonished when a French baker makes dessert from flour, butter, sugar and eggs.  But each time I go to Kajitsu, which recently moved from the East Village to a tranquil and luminous new home in Murray Hill, I am still surprised by the variety of flavors that Mr. Ueshima coaxes out of meals that Westerners would call vegan.  Before reaching across the chef’s counter with porcini and morels cooked in steaming mushroom broth just until they have lost their raw crunch, he adds a ladleful of green sansho buds and blossoms to the bowl. They look like tiny grape clusters, taste a little lemony and make your mouth tingle in a way that intensifies as you eat. The sansho also seems to deepen and change the flavor of the mushrooms until they start to remind you of cured meat. On a blanket of Japanese maple leaves, next to a tall cup of spindly enoki mushrooms and a single boiled pearl onion with a red beak of miso, he places a little fried sandwich: two pieces of lotus root filled with house-made fermented tofu. Kajitsu is known for its fermented tofu, and if this strikes you as a sketchy claim to fame, then I urge you to eat some as soon as you can. It has something like the pungent, funky, very deep and long-lasting flavor of blue cheese, with a smoothness of its own.  Even Mr. Ueshima’s simpler dishes have unexpected depth. A chilled pea soup with a welcome sweetness was underlined by the slight savoriness of white miso. Chopped pine nuts, grated daikon and tender stems of wild parsley scattered over a soupy bowl of rice gave it a fresh, gentle flavor that was like the coming of spring. Shojin ryori was developed in Zen Buddhist monasteries after the religion arrived in Japan. The monks did not believe in taking life. They did believe in drinking tea. The frugal meal that preceded their tea ceremony grew into shojin ryori, which grew into the formal multicourse kaiseki tradition. That shojin ryori was vegetarian made it a devotional practice. That it was seasonal went without saying.  At its original address, Kajitsu may have taken the monastic aesthetic to a fault. The plain walls and chilly stone floors of the dining room were so austere, they felt slightly punitive. The new place (above a shop selling expensive tea and even more expensive teapots) shimmers, although it has not quite gone Vegas.  In the back is the chef’s counter, carved from a single block of keyaki wood and sitting beneath a gently sloped cedar arch. The front dining room has a bay window and a ceiling that seems to hang in midair. Between the two, casually resting on one side just off the floor, is an 1,800-year-old ceramic pot.  The service ware at Kajitsu is worth studying. Most pieces are handmade, like the carved wood trays and the hammered metal chopstick rests and sake pitchers. Vintage ceramics with small chips show signs of repair, and their age underlines transience of the seasons that is a major theme of shojin ryori. You could design a calendar simply by eating at Kajitsu every four weeks and taking pictures. Mr. Ueshima changes his menus on the first of the month, adding some plants that are at their peak and some that are on the rise. His dishes — four of them in a $55 tasting, eight in an $85 or $100 menu that ends with a bowl of matcha, green tea as thick and frothy as espresso — are drawn from the season, but they are also drawings of the season.  In June, he used a glossy dark magnolia leaf as the lid for a soup of slippery wakame seaweed and sesame tofu fried to a satisfying crunch. Last month, he lay pointy lily blades across a bowl that held a kind of vegan Jell-O salad, a clear gelatin dome studded with slices of raw baby okra, cooked bell peppers and mountain yam. To garnish that pea soup, the first dish on his April menu, he had made tiny replicas of pink-streaked cherry blossoms out of thin sheets of wheat gluten and rice flour, then decorated the bowl with a cherry branch whose flowers were so exquisitely small and delicate that they made other cherry blossoms look like the centerpiece at the wedding of a mobster’s daughter. Anticipating the season and showing off local ingredients are both old kaiseki traditions, but I found that the things I enjoyed least at Kajitsu were Western vegetables that had not come into their own yet. Neither grape tomatoes with a vinegar jelly in April nor corn kernels in a golden fritter in June were as lush as they will be in July. And while Mr. Ueshima seems to reach for stronger, meatier flavors than Kajitsu’s first chef, Masato Nishihara, he doesn’t always have his predecessor’s delicacy. The chef’s artistry, though, can make up for some of the flavor his ingredients might be missing on their own. His simmered tomato would still be very good in August; it is exceptional in June, a chilled poached plum tomato with slivers of juicy and spicy spring ginger set on shimmering tomato jelly that took its layers of depth from kelp and shiitakes. Although the buckwheat flavor of the soba noodles made fresh each day could be a little more full-throated, they are as tender as they could be and still hold together. Rice, the last course before dessert, is a treat that can appear in many forms. Warm and fragrant, sharpened with vinegar, it made a bed for two rows of tender, cooked king oyster mushroom stems carved to look like slices of raw fish. Dab the mushrooms with nori paste and freshly grated wasabi, pinch some rice between chopsticks, and you have a deeply rewarding take on sushi. Whether or not it is on your menu, you should drink matcha at the chef’s counter at least once. Mr. Ueshima will froth it with a bamboo whisk before giving the bowl three small turns. Then he sets it in front of you and gives a deep bow that brings you back to the roots of a meal that is more than a meal.",Kajitsu in Murray Hill,"['eat', 'kajitsu', 'practice', 'animalfree',

223,Carbone,★★★,2013-06-04,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-carbone-in-manhattan.html,Greenwich Village,"At Carbone, they don’t ask if you’ve dined with them before. Even if you haven’t, the answer would still be yes. This is supposed to be the Italian restaurant where you celebrated your birthday before anyone told you that chicken scarpariello isn’t Italian.  This being 2013, and the two chefs, Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone, being former lieutenants of Mario Batali and Daniel Boulud, Carbone is infinitely more self-conscious than those old restaurants. It is a fancy red-sauce joint in Greenwich Village as directed by Quentin Tarantino, bringing back the punch-in-the-guts thrills of a genre that everybody else sees as uncultured and a little embarrassing, while exposing the sophistication that was always lurking there. Carbone has a technical prowess that can make you giddy; a lust for excess that can, at times, make you a little queasy; and an instinct for sheer entertainment that makes a lot of other restaurants seem like earnest, unimaginative drones. There are, in the Tarantino style, fanboy film allusions: the tile floor from “The Godfather,” the narrow passageway into the back dining room that makes you feel like Ray Liotta handshake-tipping his way into the Copacabana. There are the songs that make you think, “Oh, no,” followed by “I forgot how great this is,” as people with open bottles of Gaja on the table drum their fingers to “We Open in Venice.”  Like Tarantino’s love letters to pulpy exploitation films, Carbone affectionately picks up the clichés of its genre, twirls them, then hurls them at your head. Our captain wears a B-movie smile and a tuxedo in a shade of maroon last seen at Liberace’s estate sale. Bearing a hollowed-out wheel of Parmesan, he stabs a nugget of cheese and slides it on to my plate. It tastes young, milky and uninteresting, but next come papery slices of smoky and complex aged country ham, Kentucky serving as a stunt double for Parma, and a stack of “grandma bread,” a no-cheese Sicilian pizza with oregano and a shadowy, sweet pulp of tomato sauce. Both make me smile.  More unbidden genre tropes are on the way: tart giardiniera in oil, amazing garlic bread, fried ribbons of dough under powdered sugar, suave fig grappa, and delicate house-made limoncello in a bottle furry with frost. I don’t love every one of these extras, but I love the way they make me abandon any hope of quiet moderation. Nearly the entire menu at Carbone is a quotation, starting with the $50 veal parm, which is larger than some fancy brick-oven pizzas and looks like one, too, with ovals of browned buffalo mozzarella and a bright red, summer-fresh, barely cooked tomato sauce. Served with a fried shaft of bone, it’s a shock-and-awe dish, and the most shocking thing about it is that there is no real revisionism here; it is a veal parm, the way you always hoped it would be.  More often, the old tropes get an injection of technique that acts like a syringe of epinephrine plunged into the heart. The two-and-a-half pound lobster fra diavolo is both brash and polished, the huge portion galvanized by Calabrian chiles and soothed by Cognac. No shrimp scampi has been handled as gently or luxuriously as Carbone’s chorus line of langoustines, claws extended, bodies split and slick with butter that implies garlic without coming right out and saying it. Concentrated shellfish stock is the foundation a zuppa di pesce so deeply fragrant, you know it’s coming before it’s on the table. I wish the clam broth that infuses linguine vongole had the same intensity. But other plates of what Carbone calls “macaroni” are remarkable. Knuckles of tortellini stuffed with whipped sheep’s milk ricotta are a show of zero-gravity delicacy while elbows of rigatoni are forceful and substantial, their tomato sauce unabashedly spicy and slyly buttery. There are also, in this movie, some lapses in taste and judgment. Fried broccoli rabe is locked inside some of the heaviest, greasiest batter I’ve ever tasted. Carbone’s tiramisù, a wedge of layer cake with mascarpone between Marsala-soaked spongecake, is too wet and too boozy, a case where the middlebrow original is better than the highbrow makeover.  Strangest of all is something called Chinese chicken, which tastes as if Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Carbone were trying to recreate something from Chinatown Night at their college cafeterias. But old Italian-American restaurants generally have at least one dish on the menu that nobody orders. Maybe this soy-and-sesame-seed nonentity is supposed to be another in-joke, although it would be funnier if, when you ordered it, your captain said, “We just sold out.” They could get a laugh out of it, too. Carbone’s captains are character actors who have mastered the jokey, swaggering, slightly bossy style that was a New York specialty before waiters began to have the blandly pleasant manners of the young people who carry Bibles and ring doorbells on Saturday mornings. There is a flash of three-card monte below the surface, as these men sell you on meatballs with your pasta or promise that the lemon cheesecake is “the best you’ll ever have in your life.” They aren’t lying about the cheesecake, though. And the most talented among them can improvise dialogue while grating creamy ricotta salata over a Caesar salad that is just as sharp with anchovies as you could wish. One night a star of romantic comedies was sharing one appetizer and one main course with her male date. When the date left the table, the captain leaned in. Captain: Nice catch. Star: Excuse me? Captain: I said that’s a good-looking young man you’re with. Star: (Raucous laughter.) This kind of thing is funny only if you agree to play along. And I’m not ready to play along with all of Carbone’s casting decisions: currently all the captains, typically the most highly tipped employees, are men. But I admire nearly all the other choices that Mr. Torrisi, Mr. Carbone and their business partner, Jeff Zalaznick, have made. Many American restaurants are trying to reinvent fine dining by looking abroad. Carbone is mining the best elements of homegrown American style of service and cuisine that flourished when men in ties and women in heels, woozy from a final shot of sambuca, wobbled to the sidewalk clutching doggy bags. We didn’t know how good we had it. Carbone is here to remind us.",Carbone in Manhattan,"['carbone', 'don’t', 'ask', 'you’ve', 'dined', 'even', 'haven’t', 'answer', 'still', 'yes', 'supposed', 'italian', 'celebrated', 'birthday',

224,Taqueria Tlaxcalli,★,2013-05-28,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-salvation-taco-in-murray-hill-and-taqueria-tlaxcalli-in-the-bronx.html,Parkchester,"Expectations are everything. It was hard to know what to expect when April Bloomfield, the British-born chef who has been New York’s chief importer of the gastro-pub ethos since she opened the Spotted Pig, announced that her latest project would be called Salvation Taco. Although she consulted with the chef of two local Mexican restaurants, Roberto Santibañez, it seemed likely that Mexican tradition would not be treated as law. But when a restaurant has two words in its name and one of them is taco, you might think the star attraction will be a fat bundle of something hot and tasty folded inside a warm tortilla with a sauce that adds intrigue and excitement. That describes almost none of the tacos I ate at this jammed and noisy five-month-old restaurant inside the Pod 39 hotel in Murray Hill. The tortillas were a little bigger than an English muffin. A small taco can be a great taco, but these were topped so minimally and sauced so timidly that masa was virtually all I could taste. A swipe of curried crema was not enough to bring four tiny and stubbornly bland cauliflower florets to life. A relish of charred onions and pomegranate molasses might have lifted two little fried sweetbreads out of dullness if there had been more than a small blotch of it. Those tiny portions cooled quickly. Often the fillings were cold, the tortillas going stiff, a shame because they are freshly pressed and griddled. Even the miniature naan that stood in for a tortilla in one taco was so firm one day that it was unbendable, although on another it folded obediently around chunks of spiced lamb. Stacked in a covered basket, though, Salvation’s masa tortillas are tender, warm and seductively fragrant. This is how they are served if you order one of the “family-style feasts,” impressive platters of protein that you tear apart and pile into tacos yourself. Two of these were spectacular: the ham hock, with a fruity and tart chile-tamarind glaze; and the cumin and pepper-rubbed lamb shoulder, so intensely flavorful it was as if three lambs had been distilled down to a single super-lamb. Rolling your own will get you a terrific taco, but some of the tables are so narrow it’s a bit like performing surgery on an airplane seatback tray. Ken Friedman, Ms. Bloomfield’s business partner in Salvation Taco (as well as the Spotted Pig, the John Dory Oyster Bar and the Breslin), has gone for a psychedelic, polytheistic thrift-store look, filling two rooms with Japanese lanterns, glass Buddhas, Hindu gods, Christian saints and a painting of a cowboy angel by the Rev. Howard Finster. At least it supplied some visual distractions on a Friday night when a promised 90-minute wait for a table stretched to two hours. Dishes that seemed out of place in a taqueria often had a good reason for being there, including the fried pig ears sprinkled with ground chiles; a soup of kimchi, pork and hominy with the hot-and-sour potency of some Sichuan stews; and the dark, terrifically complex beef chili, long on the fruity flavor of dried chile peppers if somewhat short on meat. But the things you’d hope any taqueria would nail could be dispiriting. Guacamole was sensationally well seasoned with lime and serranos, but always arrived cold. Margaritas were strangely flat, a mariachi band without trumpets. An al pastor quesadilla needed more heat, more cheese and, crucially, any amount of pineapple, which was missing entirely. At least two-thirds of the white cubes in a ceviche turned out to be not fish but apples. There is also a lamb tongue sandwich that the menu calls a torta. It had the bread you’d expect, a bulkie roll dabbed with refried beans, but none of the trimmings: no lettuce, tomatoes, onions or mayonnaise. The tongue, poached and grilled, was wonderfully done, and so was the chimichurri of raw herbs, lime and olive oil. The only thing the sandwich needed was the crusty Italian roll that Ms. Bloomfield might have chosen if Salvation Taco was not supposed to be a Mexican restaurant. To redraw my taco baseline, I went to the Bronx. At Taqueria Tlaxcalli in the Parkchester neighborhood, I found golden gorditas, flying saucers of fried masa filled with a crunchy mash of chicharrones. These little pork puffs make impressively complex snacks with the addition of a cooked tomato salsa that had almost as much smoke as heat. I found hand-pinched sopes filled with refried beans and crumbled chorizo browned to a heavy-duty crackle that was softened by cilantro, onions, fresh cheese and crema. I found a crisp, citrusy and spicy cactus salad that was a model of unpretentious salad craftsmanship, and a torta constructed to maximize the collisions of warm and cool, crunchy and soft that are the source of the sandwich’s charms. I found juicy fajitas and even juicier alambres, a stir-fry of meat, green peppers and onions under a poof of melted queso Oaxaca and four folded tortillas. And I found tacos that filled out their warm corn tortillas the way a fat man fills out a hammock. The meats were canonical: al pastor bright red with chiles and topped with pineapple; tender barbacoa to make a convert out of goat skeptics; and deeply savory carnitas that were somehow both creamy and crunchy. The exterior of Taqueria Tlaxcalli (pronounced TLOSH-collie), with a neon Corona sign under an awning in a shade of pink that looks like lipstick at the end of a long night, tells you to move on. The interior, with mango-colored walls, lime-green ceramic pitchers and marbled blue pendant lights, tells you to stay. You may be here for a while if you come during the dinner rush, when the cooks working at slapstick speed become mired in delivery orders. And some larger plates, like knife-resistant pounded steak in a thin guajillo sauce or the chicken enchiladas in a soupy and droningly bitter mole poblano, were not worth the delay. But the guacamole, freshly mashed in a molcajete, the traditional rough stone mortar, always appeared within minutes. Taqueria Tlaxcalli also makes a stew of cactus, onions and strips of chicken or steak in an angry red sauce or, my favorite, a tangy cooked tomatillo sauce. All versions are served, seething, inside a hot molcajete — the name of the stew. Mauricio Gómez founded Taqueria Tlaxcalli seven years ago because he was homesick for the food he had grown up with in Mexico City. For new immigrants, a little homesickness is to be expected, but a restaurant as solidly good as Mr. Gómez’s is always a happy surprise.",Salvation Taco in Murray Hill and Taqueria Tlaxcalli in the

225,Caravaggio,★,2013-05-14,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-caravaggio-on-the-italian-upper-east-side.html,Upper East Side,"IN HIS LANDMARK STUDY FROM 1971, “The Food of Italy,” Waverley Root divided that nation into 19 distinct culinary regions. The book is a classic, its insights and prose recipes still tantalizing four decades later, but it contains a major oversight. Mr. Root says nothing at all about the Italian Upper East Side. In this chunk of the earth that broke off from the boot and drifted 4,300 miles across the ocean before colliding with Manhattan, the restaurant menus resemble one another more than they do the menus of Emilia-Romagna, Campania or Umbria. Ligurian pesto, Tuscan steak, Roman pasta all’amatriciana and Sicilian cannoli live together in harmony. Salad is an antipasto, truffles never go out of season, and beets with goat cheese is a combination as time-honored as tomatoes and olive oil. Caravaggio, which opened in 2009 around the corner from the Whitney Museum of American Art, makes a strong bid to win respect in its wayward region. Owned by Giuseppe, Antonio, Cosimo and Geraldo Bruno, the four brothers who also run Sistina and San Pietro not far away, it is one of the most civilized Italian restaurants to turn up anywhere in the city in the last few years.  Plumes of fresh flowers (cherry blossoms in early April, calla lilies later in the month) line one side of the hallway to the dining room; on the other is a framed print by — oh, hello, signed Matisse lithograph. Inside are more flowers, and much more art: a pair of Ellsworth Kelly prints, a pair of Frank Stella paintings, all four bought from the widow of William Rubin, the former curator of painting and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art.  On a commission from the Brunos, the painter Donald Baechler has covered the entire back wall with a crowd of the eeriest children in the world. With their terrified eyes and gaping red mouths, they look as if they might be friends of Dick and Jane’s who have just watched Spot eat Puff. The mural is unsettling, but it has the hovering, electric presence of real art.  Caravaggio is defiantly elegant in an age that sees white tablecloths as a medieval relic whose sadistic power to stand in the way of a good time is second only to that of the chastity belt. The tables are draped with linens, ceiling baffles keep the noise to a low burble, and streamlined chocolate-leather chairs offer a quaint amenity known as lumbar support.  Another anachronism: a dress code. Jeans, shorts and sneakers are not permitted, the Web site says, although in practice only the ban on shorts is enforced. Jackets and ties are not required, but nearly all the men wear them, along with haircuts that seem to have been tidied up at Paul Molé a day or two ago. The women seem to have had their hair done even more recently. Caravaggio’s loyalists are so well groomed, it is humbling. “We are among our betters,” a companion said one night. The plates are just as carefully put together, assembled with a sharp eye for color and shape. Caravaggio has a roasted swordfish that is an Italian flag in seafood form, the white fillet sitting between a red pond of puréed tomato sauce and a frothy green sea of oregano sauce. And it served me one of the prettiest veal chops I’ve ever seen, trimmed into a thick, nearly perfect circle and evenly, handsomely browned.  Osso buco with saffron risotto, which may be the official dish of the Italian Upper East Side, looked better than ever and was almost ideally cooked, the meat tender and rose-tinted, the rice firm and creamy.  But Caravaggio, for all its civility, is haunted by inconsistency more than three years into its run. Some of my meals there were very good; in others, I couldn’t find a single dish to get excited about, and there were a few that were just not right at all. The same kitchen that dressed perfectly al dente spaghetti with a wonderfully balanced pesto of dried nuts and tomatoes put too many tomatoes in a Sicilian sardine and fennel sauce and tossed the result with bucatini that were crunchy and hard at one end. Dover sole was cooked to show off the firm delicacy that makes it such a treat, but the swordfish wrapped in the Italian flag should have come out of the oven at least two minutes sooner. Scallops, shrimp and tiny squid rings were sweet and tender, and while serving them warm over braised leeks with a lobster reduction may have stretched the definition of a seafood salad, it was so good nobody would ever complain. But in another appetizer, octopus tentacles had no flavor at all; they were nothingness with suction cups. Caravaggio’s bomboloni, sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and served hot in a figure-8 dish with vanilla sauce and caramel, were light enough to achieve liftoff. But the floury, dry torta di ricotta remained depressingly earthbound. First-time travelers should be warned: no matter what the euro is trading at, the exchange rate on the Italian Upper East Side is always awful. It is especially unfavorable at Caravaggio, where salads begin at $18, and most of the pastas hover around $25. This ought to be enough to buy bucatini that is cooked on both ends. Service, slightly formal but relaxed enough to crack a smile, often lived up to Caravaggio’s aspirations. But there could be unscheduled leaves of absence after main courses were cleared, and one night one server after another tried to take our order before anyone had told us about the specials. When someone finally did, the recitation went on for almost five minutes, covering at least a dozen dishes.  It felt like a memory quiz, one I always flunked until I started writing the correct answer on my palm: just get the chicken meatballs. They are made from white meat mixed with capers, sun-dried tomatoes, thyme and enough milk-soaked bread to give them some loft, and they are braised in tomato sauce, but none of this quite accounts for their appeal. The appeal of fickle and expensive Caravaggio is easier to explain. For great Italian cooking, much of the action is in thunderous and flashy downtown dining rooms. The civilized style of a place like Caravaggio feels as rare and impressive as a blue whale. That would draw me back, along with the chicken meatballs, the bomboloni, those spooky kids and the chance that one day the restaurant will put the Italian Upper East Side on the map.",Caravaggio on

226,Randazzo's Clam Bar,★,2013-04-23,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-randazzos-clam-bar-in-sheepshead-bay.html,Sheepshead Bay,"The regulars at Randazzo’s Clam Bar know what to order. I was still learning the ropes, though, so I invited suggestions. My server’s advice was quick and definitive. “Get the calama’,” she said. “That’s why you’re here.” Strictly speaking, the fried calamari was not the reason I had driven down Ocean Avenue in Brooklyn until it dead-ended at the white row of fishing ships and booze-cruise leviathans on Sheepshead Bay, then parked in front of the neon lobster with the name Randazzo’s pinched between its upheld claws. No, it was the Sauce. Randazzo’s makes any number of tomato sauces, but only one Sauce. It has two speeds, spicy and medium, but the dark, intense, concentrated, oregano-accented essence is the same. The tomatoes cook down for an eternity and then some, until they are as deeply caramelized as a pan of fried sausage and onions. The Sauce can be ladled on hot or chilled lobster, on fried shrimp, on steamed mussels or on chopped scungilli, where it works a particularly satisfying alchemy. And of course, it is poured over floured and fried calamari. A pure distillation of Italian-American cuisine, the Sauce tastes as if a chemical analysis would reveal the blueprint for every great dish in every red-sauce joint in the country. I found many other things to like at Randazzo’s, but yes, the Sauce was the reason I was there. It is the reason many people were devastated when the restaurant was destroyed by Hurricane Sandy last October, and the reason they cheered when it reopened just before Christmas. And, in a sense, the Sauce is the reason Randazzo’s is there in the first place. Decades ago, when the boats leaving Sheepshead Bay each morning carried men who fished for their living, the Randazzo family owned a seafood shop and a bar on Emmons Avenue. As a cheap bar snack, they handed out fried squid, which back then was more likely to be found on the end of a hook than the end of a fork, along with Helen Randazzo’s long-simmered Sauce. “They would cut the bar down a little every year and put in tables, because more people would be sitting down,” said Helen’s oldest grandson, Paul Randazzo. In 1964, the bar graduated to a clam bar with a menu of six items, not counting the Sauce. As the mounds of cherrystone shells grew, so did the family business, adding on a formal Italian restaurant that served pasta, broiled seafood and other Helen Randazzo recipes. When it closed in 1994, it bequeathed those dishes to the clam bar. They are still on the menu today for customers who look beyond the Sauce. Marcella Hazan may rap me on the knuckles with her cheese grater for this, but I am crazy about Randazzo’s shrimp parmigiana. The restaurant buys wild shrimp netted in the Gulf of Mexico, and their substantial flavor comes through even after they have been breaded, fried, doused with marinara and blanketed with browned fresh mozzarella. That flavor comes through just as clearly in the shrimp fra diavolo, with a heap of pasta under spicy tomato sauce and, just so you don’t forget where you are, a few clams. As a parade of marine life, though, the dish has nothing on the lobster fra diavolo, which supplements clams and shrimp with mussels and an entire Canadian lobster, ideally tender and sweet the night I had it. A different lobster dish on another night was problematic. The stuffing was an unexciting blend of baby shrimp, bread crumbs and, supposedly, crab meat. The claws were overdone to a rubbery dryness, but the tail, cooked more gently, had its quality intact. Randazzo’s pasta with clams is a lesson in the meaning of generous portions: about a quarter-acre of linguine or spaghetti weighed down who knows how many chopped clams, very sweet and very fresh, and untold cloves of sliced garlic. The pasta is exactly the kind that Italian restaurants in this country served 40 years ago, before the phrase “al dente” got its green card. It is boiled in water with little if any salt, which is less of a drawback when the sauce piled on top is a hearty one like fra diavolo rather than a thin one like the marechiara. Very simple seafood dishes found at shacks up and down the East Coast can be quite good at Randazzo’s: the raw Long Island oysters, littlenecks and cherrystones shucked at the counter; the steamers, free of grit once they are rinsed in their broth and dunked in drawn butter; the fat crab cakes wrapped in a spicy bread-crumb coating but otherwise light on the filler; the Manhattan chowder and, even though it is slightly thickened with cornstarch, the New England, both weighty with potatoes and clams. Less enticing are the lobster bisque and the corn-and-crab chowder, neither of which tastes much like its namesake shellfish. And given how pure most of the seafood is, I wish the fried clams were the squishy whole-belly variety, not chewy frozen strips in a sarcophagus of breading. This is one food that is beyond the help of the Sauce. Another is the slice of bread, slightly less hard than granite, that waits on each platter of calamari to traumatize the loose molars of neophytes. Simultaneously soggy and dry, hot and cold, it is too bizarre and unfathomable to be called awful; it is simply one of the world’s mysteries, to be discussed while eating all the squid around it. Helen Randazzo was, according to her grandson, a virtual pescetarian. Still, her recipe for cut-up chicken marinated in lemon, olive oil, garlic and oregano, then roasted and charred under the broiler, is very good. Perhaps out of her distaste for land animals, she gave the dish the unalluring name “burnt chicken.” Paul Randazzo, who owns the place now, eats fish nearly every day, but he gave it up for the two months that his restaurant was closed after the hurricane. It was a form of protest, I imagine. The night of the storm, he was inside Randazzo’s, standing on chairs and then on the counter when the bay refused to stay outside the doors. When he wanted company, he said, he got on a raft and paddled down what, just that afternoon, had been Emmons Avenue to visit a friend who was holed up on the second floor of Loehmann’s. Did anything in the restaurant survive the flood? “Me.” Today the pink-granite floor tiles, the mirrored wall painted with a scene of the marina, the tables, the chairs and the restrooms are new. The faces are not. Mr. Randazzo, his wife and his four children still tend to customers, who come in all shapes, sizes, colors and ages. Randazzo’s prices are not intimidating, especially for fresh seafood, and the welcome at the door is heartfelt. Had I grown up eating at Randazzo’s, the emotion I felt tasting the Sauce might be love. But as a relative newcomer, I’ll have to settle for gratitude.",Randazzo’s Clam Bar in Sheepshead Bay,"['regular', 'randazzo’s', 'clam', 'bar', 'know', 'order', 'still', 'learning', 'rope', 'though',

227,Hanjan,★★,2013-04-02,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-hanjan-in-manhattan.html,Midtown South,"The pajeon at Hanjan did not look like any Korean pancake I’d ever seen. It appeared to be a casual pile of squid tempura interlaced with a few splinters of fried green stuff, but I took a knife to it and quartered it anyway. Amazingly, the gold loops and strands held together as they traveled from the dish of spicy dipping sauce to my mouth.  As I ate, I understood that Hanjan’s chef, Hooni Kim, had accomplished the most delicious kind of engineering feat, minimizing the layer of rice starch that makes up the bulk of a traditional pajeon and maximizing not just the crisp fried bits but also the flavor of scallions and wonderfully fresh squid. At the same time, his pajeon held on to the essential taste of Korean cuisine. This taller, airier pajeon was nowhere near as filling as the original, but I didn’t mind. Planning ahead, I had ordered two. Hanjan opened in December on West 26th Street, its recessed entrance easy to miss alongside rowdy neighbors like Hill Country and the Hog Pit. Like Mr. Kim’s slightly older restaurant, Danji, Hanjan has a menu divided between traditional Korean dishes (the pajeon) and new ideas (slices of raw wild salmon that you wrap around salad greens in a spicy sesame dressing). And once again, the cover versions and the original compositions are so much in touch with the spirit of Korean cooking that it can be hard to tell which is which.  Hanjan does not cast out any obvious chum for food bloggers the way Danji did with its bulgogi sliders and bacon paella. Mr. Kim may be more confident in his cooking this time around, or more certain that New Yorkers will get it. On a menu of mostly small dishes, one of the two substantial enough to anchor a meal is a large bowl of cod roe in a cloudy seafood broth that contains so much chile paste, it’s pink. Both the esoteric main ingredient and the fearless seasoning in this remarkable stew suggest that Mr. Kim trusts his audience, and vice versa. Certainly, the relationship has progressed to the point where he can name one of Hanjan’s dishes fresh killed chicken wings. Just how fresh, you may wonder, tilting an ear toward the kitchen to listen for muffled squawks. Not quite as fresh as that; the birds are slaughtered off site earlier in the day that they are served. The object is to obtain poultry with a clean and full flavor, which Mr. Kim simply underlines by marinating the wings in sake and soy and grilling them.  Other parts of those recently graduated birds end up skewered and grilled, yakitori style, with minimal seasoning. You need to love the flavor of extremely fresh chicken to love most of these skewers, especially the very chewy gizzards. The crunchy accordion folds of grilled skin are probably universally appealing, though. Two of my guests, at least, declared them the best thing on the table. A minute later, they claimed to have found something better. All my meals at Hanjan were like that, with new dishes eclipsing the memory of what had come before. “That’s my favorite of the night,” somebody would say, chopsticks pinched around a fried sandwich of shrimp and pork paste between shiso leaves. A few minutes later, somebody else would crown the grilled mackerel fillet, its skin gleaming like candy under a glassy soy glaze, accompanied by a lemon and grated daikon. Next the torch was passed to meaty slices of pig trotter braised in soy and smeared with a far-from-tame paste of fermented shrimp and soy beans. In the rush to declare winners, a few also-rans were soon forgotten. To be a contender in a town full of good Korean fried chicken, Hanjan’s needs to be crisper than it was the night I had it. A tiny portion of noodles with spicy squid vanished without impact. Thin slices of fish cakes bobbed around in a nearly clear seafood broth that was very, very good, but the dish wasn’t substantial enough for a restaurant that is, essentially, a Korean pub. Mr. Kim’s small-plates approach leads to one significant miscalculation. Hanjan charges $5 for kimchi and $4 for cold appetizers called namul. Order both and you have a small but high-quality banchan spread, which most Korean restaurants bring without charge or request. By putting a price on banchan, Mr. Kim makes it optional, just another tapas plate. Without it, the whole spirit of the meal changes. Lines of two-tops and four-tops run along opposite walls; in the center is a long communal table that might feel like trend-chasing in another restaurant but here feels like an invitation to put your elbows down and have another bottle of sake. After 8 p.m. you will need it, because the din from hungry-eyed people waiting at the bar and the customers at their tables shouting to one another that everybody needs to try the pork fat rice cakes (they’re right) will be bouncing off the concrete walls and the steel ceilings.  After a while, you may get curious about the cloudy, oatmeal-colored drink served in frosty mugs. It is makgeolli, a yeasty rice brew with the soft sweetness of cantaloupe. By 10 or so, the crowds may thin a bit and there might be a seat at the bar. This is good because that is when the ramen broth is finally ready, after bubbling in a pot for half a day with the bones of fish and pork and chicken. Ramen is listed on the menu as ramyun, one of the large plates, which implies sharing. I recommend eating it alone at the bar, where you can have all four slices of sweet pork to yourself and make as much noise as you want slurping the bouncy, squiggly noodles out of the steaming and chile-hot soup.  The ramen shows up on the modern side of the menu, even though nothing about its long-simmered, bone-rich flavor tastes 21st century. But Mr. Kim is now the city’s leading interpreter of Korean cuisine, and if he says the dish is modern, the rest of us will have to believe him.",Hanjan in Manhattan,"['pajeon', 'hanjan', 'look',

228,The Dining Room at the Modern,★★★,2013-03-26,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-the-dining-room-at-the-modern.html,Midtown East,"WHEN MY GUEST in the Dining Room at the Modern realized he could order three courses of foie gras, he looked like somebody who had just found a $50 bill on the street. He would have extended his streak to four courses, I think, had the menu offered a foie gras dessert.  As it turned out, his appetizer would have worked almost as well as a finale. The Modern’s chef, Gabriel Kreuther, scooped out little balls of duck liver terrine and rolled them in crumbs of fried celery root so they looked like nut-crusted bonbons. These counterfeit candies were set on a rectangle of mango and passion fruit sauce within scribbles of syrupy balsamic vinegar, bringing out an unsuspected kinship between the terrine and ganache. In the second course, foie gras was a star protein, poached in red wine. This time its garnishes — bittersweet chocolate tuile, pickled red currants and a peppery caramel — worked as foils to show up its seriousness and depth. Then in the third course, it took a step back, serving as a sauce that enriched slices of squab breast baked in savoy cabbage inside a shatteringly thin brik crust.  The three dishes could have been a monotonous episode in self-indulgence. Instead they were a memorable demonstration of the skill, inventiveness and discipline that permit Mr. Kreuther to make his ingredients do what he wants them to do while still tasting like themselves. Those traits made my recent meals in the Dining Room at the Modern a pleasure and something of a discovery, if one can discover an eight-year-old restaurant run by Danny Meyer inside the Museum of Modern Art. When the Dining Room was last reviewed in The New York Times, in 2005, Frank Bruni praised its “significant joys,” including much of the food, but warned of “uneven terrain” on the menu. At the time, the far more casual and livelier Bar Room up front met its promises more fully, as Mr. Bruni suggested when he awarded that space three stars in a later review, one more than he had given the Dining Room.  The Bar Room still has more energy, but the cooking in the Dining Room has more focus and intensity than I remember from the early days. Mr. Kreuther’s dishes in this space are more complicated than the more rustic ones in the Bar Room, but the complications pay off in rewarding layers of harmony and contrast. Two cured fillets of sardine (one smooth and silver, the other crackling and golden with a thin sheet of brioche seared to its skin) were outfitted with crisp artichoke chips and dots of artichoke purée, but the warm heart of the dish was a bright sauce of tomato confit, black garlic, green olives, roasted red peppers and blood oranges. Eat it and you almost felt the summer sun beating down on your head. Other recent dishes invited you to burrow into winter’s consolations. Sweet apple-wood smoke made its way into every bite of a sturgeon and sauerkraut tart topped with a glittering vein of caviar. It was elegant and powerful, like the pairing of a luxuriously soft poached egg with squid-ink spaetzle, sea urchin, roasted salsify and fragments of black truffles. The white walls and tablecloths, and the grid of steel and glass facing the museum’s sculpture garden, suggest a contemporary gallery. This graceful, understated room stands back so the artistry can happen on the plate. Mr. Kreuther follows through. He is bold with color, painting salmon crimson with a marinade of beet juice, or drawing a dark green stripe of powdered Kaffir lime down the center of a monkfish fillet resting in a gorgeous sauce of blood orange and mustard. He is intrepid with flavor as well. Roasted lobster tail seemed complete with a smoky pimento broth that I would have happily drunk from a teacup, but then a server brought something extra, a tiny portion of tender claw meat under a wheel of burned sugar that went beyond caramel by several degrees of bitterness. It was daring and wonderful. One or two dares didn’t pay off, like juxtaposition of pear purée and bay scallops. There were technical glitches, too, like the bottom crust on the sturgeon tart that was crisp one night but damp on another, or the piece of cobia cooked to the point of dryness on one side.  Yet the next act of each four-course, $98 fixed-price dinner would invariably set things right again. This was especially true for Marc Aumont’s desserts, fresh looks at European classics like a black currant vacherin or a Black Forest cake rendered as an array of cubes, cones and spheres. Calling something modern puts it at risk of looking dated, as one or two things at the Modern do. A flurry of amuse-bouches always included a test tube full of hot liquid. Are we still pretending this is a fun way to drink soup? And the charcoal gray suits with collarless shirts the servers wear look like costumes from a sci-fi film about a dystopian, genderless future. The vented jackets in particular don’t do the women any favors. As you notice this, though, you also notice just how many women there are in the front of the house, along with others who don’t look like men of European descent. It is a pleasure to see this kind of diversity at the higher altitudes of New York dining, where it is still not the rule. The staff was always attentive and mindful, helping diners navigate food allergies, for instance. At moments, though, the service felt disengaged and aloof in ways than can make this formal room feel chillier than it needs to be. (When I heard happy, intoxicated shouts from the Bar Room, I felt as if I’d joined the wrong club.)  One night, the server driving the mignardise trolley acted as if listing the whole catalog of sweets would make the meal longer than it needed to be, and suggested that she make the choice for us instead. Another night, it was wheeled around by someone who seemed to have been waiting all night for the chance to tell us about the Calvados lollipops, the saffron truffles, the macadamia pralines and the make-your-own sandwich cookies of butter wafers and chocolate ganache in a tube.  By drawing out the moment, our server made it one to remember. Like the trolley, the restaurant itself is full of unexpected delights. Unpacking them one by one is the pleasant work of a meal.

229,Chez Sardine,★,2013-03-19,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-chez-sardine-in-the-west-village.html,West Village,"ONE MAJOR THEME of modern restaurants is what we might call Asian stoner food. This is the cuisines of Japan, Korea and other places as seen through bloodshot eyes, the cravings of a hipster whose late-night munchies send him out in search of tacos stuffed with bulgogi, pigs’ tails cooked in root beer and the like. Another competing theme is fat-on-fat cuisine. It challenges our notions of appropriate caloric intake, treats foie gras as a sacrament and has rarely seen an ingredient that couldn’t be improved by cooking it with some part of the pig. If these styles were two friends of yours, you would think they were both narcissistic, a little dangerous and more fun to be around than almost anybody else you knew. And you would pray that they never, ever hooked up.  But hook up they have, at a friendly and demented Greenwich Village tavern called Chez Sardine that Gabriel Stulman opened just after Thanksgiving. Mr. Stulman, an increasingly busy restaurateur, described Chez Sardine as “a very inauthentic take on a Japanese izakaya.” This is the kind of izakaya where a bite-size piece of hamachi sushi is crunchy with fried pork rinds, and where sashimi is slipped into a stack of flapjacks.  For connoisseurs of Asian stoner cuisine, this will sound like high-grade chronic. But the chef, and one of Mr. Stulman’s partners in Chez Sardine, is Mehdi Brunet-Benkritly, who spent four years at Au Pied de Cochon in Montreal, the Stanford of fat-on-fat cooking. So this is also the kind of izakaya where you can order a grilled cheese sandwich stuffed with foie gras, garnished with cucumbers pickled in rice-wine vinegar.  The first face you see when you walk into Chez Sardine is Pat Morita’s in a framed close-up from “The Karate Kid.” Mr. Morita, who spent part of his childhood during World War II in an internment camp in Arizona, holds his chopsticks midair, midlesson, although the lesson here is a nuanced one about the strange things that happen when Japanese culture comes to America.  Mr. Stulman, who also owns Fedora and Joseph Leonard, must have a kind of second sight for Greenwich Village real estate that lets him see future diners eating and drinking comfortably inside rooms not much bigger than a double bed. In this case, horizontal lines and walls of windows that meet by the corner of West Fourth and West 10th Streets give Chez Sardine an openness and energy out of proportion to its size. The only time the room feels small is when you are attempting to book one of the 28 seats, but even that is a fairly painless process thanks to a widget on Chez Sardine’s Web site that lists open time slots rather than making you guess. (I hope the technology catches on.)  Whether you sit at a table by those windows or at one of two short counters, the meal will probably start with sushi. Already it’s a departure from Japan, where izakayas are more likely to serve sashimi, but that’s just the beginning.  Hamachi with chicharrones reads like a declaration of war, but no. The pork skins add crunch and a savoriness that deepens as you chew and that is kept in check by pickled ginger. And Arctic char, cured with sugar and lime zest and smoked, makes for sushi you could happily eat for breakfast. Mr. Brunet-Benkritly finds a cool contrast of textures by topping cubes of raw beef with spoonfuls of sea urchin, then surrounding the pair with a ring of nori that rustles between your teeth just before it softens. He also combines like with like, wrapping eel and braised pork belly in a hand roll and then piling on layers of richness with avocado and spicy mayonnaise. In dishes like this, it can seem as if Asian stoner food and fat-on-fat cuisine were always meant to be together. But doubts are never far off. If you prize the cold-water fattiness of mackerel, you’ll wish it hadn’t been squelched by crushed potato chips, fried leek threads and cold, underseasoned rice. And oyster fans will wish that the apple mousse mounded on top of sparkling raw Wellfleets was a little more tart and a lot less sweet. As the cooked dishes start to arrive, the pattern continues: sometimes excess succeeds, and sometimes it is just too much. Breakfast pancakes with raw fish, salmon roe and lime yogurt are as fun as they sound, both silly and luxurious. But a similar dish of raw seafood with fried rice balls can’t repeat the trick. Unlike the pancakes, the rice has little flavor of its own, and it needs some to cope with an unruly mess of spicy mayonnaise, tobiko, seared scallops, raw mackerel and avocado paste. Hot and exceptionally creamy cod fritters would make an ideal bar snack, while the fried chicken nuggets — with strands of pickled cabbage and a garlic aioli that comes across as creamy Italian salad dressing — are like something you would wolf down when all the bars are closed.  At times, technique and seasonings conspire, as they do with chopstick-tender braised beef in a peppery Japanese brown curry. At other times, they seem at odds. Mr. Brunet-Benkritly gets unusually fine results out of pork belly, slowly roasting it until it is tender, meaty, fatty, chewy and crunchy all at once. But it’s hard to appreciate that neat bit of work with sweet barbecue sauce, raw and pickled cabbage, mayonnaise, pickled shallot, sriracha, shoestring potatoes and spreadable egg yolk fighting it out on the plate. Along the way there are terrific satisfactions, like the roasted salmon head, marinated in miso and maple syrup, which you poke at and poke at with chopsticks until you’re sure you’ve separated the bones from every bit of salty pink flesh and sweet skin. And there are lovely little grace notes, like the brussels sprouts in brown butter with apple purée, good enough to make you wish Mr. Brunet-Benkritly would take an interest in vegetables more often.  There are, in fact, very few ways to put together a balanced meal at Chez Sardine. This may be the common curse shared by fat-on-fat cuisine, Asian stoner food and small-plates dining: When diners expect to be wowed by every bite, why would chefs waste their time on dishes that are meant to be supporting players?  But we need those things, too, if we are supposed to get out of bed tomorrow and do this all again. After a certain point, even stoners and foie gras eaters crave a little restraint.",Chez Sardine in the West Village,"['major', 'theme', 'modern', 'call', 'asian', 'stoner', 'cuisine', 'japan',

230,Jeepney,★★,2013-03-12,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/13/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-jeepney-in-the-east-village-pig-and-khao-on-the-lower-east-side.html,East Village,"The cry goes up around the restaurant. “Ba-luuuut!” The word volleys from Jeepney’s kitchen to its dining room as a server carries the hard-boiled duck egg to a man at the bar. “Ba-luuuuuuuuuuut!” Grabbing the customer’s hand, she whacks the flesh between his thumb and forefinger with a tablespoon to demonstrate the force needed to crack the balut’s shell. Then she prepares him for what he’ll find inside. Right on top, she says, is “a really smoky chicken broth.” Under that is the white, hard-boiled, and the yolk. “And down at the bottom, there’s E.T.” The extraterrestrial is a two- or three-week-old duckling that will never hatch, a ball of spindly legs and tucked wings and fine threads of feathers. The unabashed embrace of a delicacy with major freakout potential is typical of the deep-end approach of Jeepney, a self-described “Filipino gastro pub” in the East Village. Another approach is on display about a mile south at Pig and Khao, which has a strong Filipino imprint, too. The two places have many things in common. Open since last fall, they are small, casual, fun and often loud — Jeepney with American and Filipino party rock, Pig and Khao with slow-rolling Southern hip-hop. Neither stocks hard liquor, but each still manages to shake up very entertaining cocktails. Recently, I’m glad to report, both dropped their no-reservations policies. In their styles of presenting Asian cuisine, though, they go their own ways. Before opening Pig and Khao, Leah Cohen, the chef, spent a year eating and cooking in countries like Vietnam, Thailand and the Philippines, where her mother was raised. Eating at her restaurant, I felt as if I were poring over an album of carefully edited postcards from her travels. Dinner at Jeepney, on the other hand, felt more like parachuting into Manila myself. I didn’t know all the vocabulary and didn’t always know what I was putting in my mouth, but I knew I had left home. I’ve grown fond of both places, but I would take different sets of friends to each. For Pig and Khao, I’d round up the ones who love Asian flavors, don’t have significant hearing loss yet, think it’s fun to get endless refills of beer from a keg in the back garden and won’t be heartbroken to learn that fertilized duck embryos are not an option. They’d be pork lovers who would go for the sugary chunks of Chinese sausage in a bowl of mussels first before dipping the so-so shellfish in a redeemingly aromatic, basil-scented broth of dashi, butter and yuzu. They would be delighted by a salad of watermelon cubes with strips of grilled pork jowl and golden puffs of fried pork rind. Like nearly every dish on the menu, it has enough crunch, salt and acidity to satisfy the most curmudgeonly judge on “Top Chef,” where Ms. Cohen came to national attention while she was cooking at Centro Vinoteca before taking over the kitchen there. Then they’d see nothing wrong with moving on to another part of the pig’s face with sizzling sisig, a modern Filipino classic. They’d devour the chopped bits of pork — some crisp, some gelatinous, some meaty — seasoned with soy and slicked with the yolk of an egg cracked over the platter at the last minute. They wouldn’t be fanatics about the authenticity of a menu that leans repeatedly on “crispy” over less familiar words. When “crispy red curry rice salad” turned out to be a less-spicy Thai pork larb tricked out with fragments of curried rice cooked into a crust, they’d nod their heads over Ms. Cohen’s talent for bright, clear flavors instead of quibbling. And when the adobo in “crispy quail adobo” was not a stewing liquid, as it might be in the Philippines, but a rich soy and garlic sauce tossed with deep-fried quail, they wouldn’t care. I didn’t care, either. The friends I’d take to Jeepney would be the explorers, the ones who see every meal as a chance to learn something. They wouldn’t fume if it took three tries to bolt the restroom door. They wouldn’t clutch their pearls at the sight of nipples on the back room’s photomurals, one set belonging to the first Filipina to appear in Playboy, the other to the first in German Playboy. (When children show up, the staff applies discreet bands of tape.) The menu nonchalantly tosses out ingredients like sawsawan and bagoong as if they were peas and carrots, and these friends would listen as the high-spirited servers explained it all. They’d pay $7 more for an extra marrow bone to supplement the impressive one that rides on top of a short-rib and vegetable soup called bulalo. They would mash the marrow with a fork into a lump of jasmine rice, then drink the deeply restorative broth from their bowls and ladle some into mine. If they came on a Thursday, when Jeepney puts away the utensils and plates and serves dinner on banana leaves, they’d wash their hands and get right down to business. They’d mold jasmine rice around bits of longanisa sausage; strips of tocino, pork that the chef, Miguel Trinidad, cures in 7Up; and cubes of pork stewed in a fascinating chocolate-colored sauce of beef blood, bay leaves and vinegar. Facing fried crabs sautéed with garlic, they would crack open the shells and excavate the meat with their fingers. Would they eat balut? Maybe. Would I? I did. The liquid on top tasted, yes, like chicken broth; the yolk was chalky; parts of the white were confusingly hard. As for the little embryo, it gave way to the spoon as easily as custard and tasted something like duck liver mixed with duck breast. If you didn’t grow up eating balut, it probably helps to stop thinking about the feathers. Jeepney’s batting average could be higher. A dish called the Defeated Chicken, with nondescript roasted chicken in adobo sauce, defeated me, too, and the slow-roasted pork shoulder in one called Bicol Express had been cut across the grain into short, dry strands. But the people I’d take there know that discoveries require both trial and error. If they prefer the reliable rewards of skillful cooking edited for New Yorkers, I’ve got a restaurant for that, too.","Jeepney in the East Village, Pig and Khao on the Lower East Side","['cry', 'go',

231,Mighty Quinn's Barbeque,★★,2013-03-05,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-mighty-quinns-barbeque-in-the-east-village.html,East Village,"Chase the scent of great barbecue in New York City, and you are rooting for a team that will, sooner or later, let you down. You are a Red Sox fan in any season from 1919 to 2003. There will be enough victories to keep the dream flickering, and there will be nights when you watch the ball hop between the first baseman’s legs. But every loss feeds a new hope in your heart. This winter, hope came in threes. Barbecue hounds ran to Gowanus to get burnt ends and char siu pork steak at Fletcher’s Brooklyn Barbecue, and to Williamsburg to find out whether BrisketTown deserved to be crowned the Brisket King of New York in a recent cook-off. They descended on the East Village to take apart Flintstonian beef ribs at Mighty Quinn’s Barbeque and watch men in heavy black gloves grab pork shoulder by the fistful and shake it into dripping hunks — yes, real pulled pork on Second Avenue. All three places slow-cook their barbecue with hardwood only, no gas allowed. All three places serve meat that is largely raised on pastures or outdoors, including pork from old breeds with flavorful rosy flesh and a thick girdle of white fat that bastes the meat as it melts. All are worth noticing, and one of them, Mighty Quinn’s, comes as close to delivering on all fronts as any barbecue place the city has seen so far. Mighty Quinn’s got its start as a stall at Smorgasburg, the open-air souk for start-up deliciousness on the Brooklyn waterfront. Hugh Mangum, a drummer and cook who worked under Jean-Georges Vongerichten, drove there on weekends hauling brisket he had smoked in Hunterdon County, N.J. The meat was deliberately, slowly sliced, and the lines were notoriously long. A 30-minute wait could make a stale bagel taste good, so the greater efficiency of Mighty Quinn’s operation makes it easier to evaluate Mr. Mangum’s work. The restaurant, which opened in December, runs on the cafeteria model, with meat at the start of the assembly line, drinks at the end and shiny metal trays that you ferry to a table made of century-old spruce salvaged from the Puck Building. The counter workers are quick and usually friendly, although once when I asked for three-quarters of a pound of brisket I got an unsmiling, have-it-our-way reply: “You can get a pound or a half-pound.” With digital scales in use, why? Half a pound at a time, it became clear that Mr. Mangum’s scope has widened well beyond brisket. The only disappointment is the chicken, no better or worse than what a skilled weekend cook can produce with a kettle grill. And while there is nothing wrong with a smoked hot sausage, the one here isn’t quite strong enough to build a meal around. With its cuts of pork and beef, though, Mighty Quinn’s gets serious, smoking more cuts of meat more skillfully than its rivals, except, perhaps, Daisy May’s, which unfortunately obscures its handiwork in sticky sauces. The pulled pork is the only one in town that doesn’t make you embarrassed for New York. It is staggeringly good. The inside meat is slick with the flavor of old-school pork butt; the black, chewy outer rind looks as if it fell into the fire. Don’t be fooled, though; the flavor of smoke and sweet fat is most concentrated there. The carvers splash the pulled pork with the house barbecue sauce, which balances sugar with vinegar and mustard; Mr. Mangum calls it Texalina because it blends the styles of Texas and North Carolina. It comes close to being an all-purpose condiment, but the rich butt would still benefit from a more bracingly acidic treatment. Spare ribs are exceptional, too, meaty and juicy, with a smoky outer ring the color of cherry soda. They are brushed with a little paprika to enhance the oak, cherry and apple smoke they picked up over many hours in a pit made in Mesquite, Tex. The beef rib is an instant conversation stopper, a long block of impressively tender meat clinging to a Jurassic curve of bone. It surely upstages the brisket in theatricality, and possibly in flavor as well, though it’s a close call. The brisket is cooked patiently to render much of the fat from the top cap, moistening even the leaner lower muscle until it gleams. A simple rub of salt and pepper is subdued but effective. The meat is not as thoroughly suffused with smoke as the best products of Texas, but it has as much finesse as anything I have ever eaten from a cardboard box. The carvers sprinkle the barbecue at Mighty Quinn’s with Maldon salt. This is nice, but it would be even nicer if the restaurant put salt and pepper, or better still a salt-pepper blend, on the table, alongside the brown-glass bottles of that sauce. In some barbecue joints in the South, the awfulness of the side dishes is a point of pride. New York, still struggling to be taken seriously, tries harder. Mighty Quinn’s baked beans, darkened with molasses, roughed up with mustard and choked with bacon, may be the best I’ve tasted. If your timing is lucky, you will place your order just as a carver is sweeping a handful of fresh brisket trimmings from the butcher block into the pan. There is a salad of peas and edamame coated with goat cheese that people seem to like, although it’s a little out of place here. Perfectly at home, though, is the sweet potato casserole, which is like a pie without a crust. Actually, with its topping of pecans in brown sugar, it is more like two pies, and is as close as Mighty Quinn’s comes to serving dessert. The natural enemy of well-smoked barbecue in New York is, of course, New Yorkers. The ones who work for the city can shut down a pit at a moment’s notice if they decide the smoke has not been thoroughly scrubbed and filtered, citing concerns about air quality. Some of us believe that the aromas of brisket and ribs improve air quality, but rules are rules. The cost of a flue that satisfies the government, Mr. Mangum said, can run from $10,000 to $15,000 for each floor. Mighty Quinn’s is in a six-story building. Hill Country’s flue is 11 stories high and Blue Smoke’s is 15 stories. Doing the math, many pitmasters are now planting their smokestacks on the low rooftops across the East River. Fletcher’s opened in November on an unphotogenic strip of Third Avenue in Gowanus that, against all odds, has become something of a restaurant row. The sides made the strongest case for Fletcher’s, like the beans that lap up wood smoke as they bake in the pit next to the meats; the crisp house-made refrigerator pickles, put up in a jar; and the macaroni and cheese when it is topped with the great burnt-end chili. Although the meats are all well seasoned and admirably smoky, nearly everything I tried in two visits tended toward dryness in one degree or another. This was more pronounced in the brisket and burnt ends than in the ribs, which were still juicy and pink. Sauces helped lubricate the thinly sliced pork steaks, like the char siu steak, with its Chinatown seasonings. As the cooks learn the idiosyncrasies of their J & R smoker, Fletcher’s meats may come closer to an ideal balance. Pitmasters are nothing if not obsessed, losing sleep to tend their fires, adjusting to each day’s temperature and humidity. The most obsessed pitmaster in New York may well be Daniel Delaney, who hitched a cast-iron offset smoker to the back of a U-Haul truck in Texas and drove it to Brooklyn. Before he opened BrisketTown in November, he sold brisket by subscription. He did his research, and sells slabs of cheese, like a lightly crunchy and caramelized Comté, in homage to the days when barbecue purveyors doubled as grocers (although he is surely the first pitmaster in history to utter the words, “We’ve started working with Bedford Cheese to curate our cheese program”). The most atmospheric of the three restaurants, BrisketTown gets the props right: the neon steer over the butcher block; the paper towel rolls used as an element of décor. You could almost believe you were in Texas if the customers weren’t all as skinny as drainpipes. Mr. Delaney pushes cooking time and seasoning to extremes. He rubs the brisket generously with salt and cracked peppercorns and smokes it for many, many hours, until it is very, very tender. The style has its fans, who line up before the doors open at 6:30 and keep coming until the brisket sells out, as it almost always does. But I was a skeptic. Long cooking had made the meat too soft; the fatty brisket one night had so little structure I could have eaten it with a spoon. And the edges were so peppery, that’s all I tasted; when I got to the milder interior, my mouth was almost numb. The spare ribs, rubbed less lavishly, were more satisfying. Recently I started a fantasy barbecue league. Now I’m building my dream New York City barbecue restaurant with elements from all over town. I’ve got the soundtrack and the corn pudding from Hill Country; the pickles and chili mac from Fletcher’s; the pork belly and beers from Fette Sau; the beans, pulled pork, brisket and both kinds of ribs from Mighty Quinn’s; the enthusiasm, atmosphere and cheese from BrisketTown.

232,The Marrow,★,2013-02-26,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-the-marrow-in-the-west-village.html,West Village,"We have our swamis of salumi in New York restaurants, our chieftains of charcuterie, our sultans of sausage. But where are the wizards of wurst? Who will carry the flag for the multitude of cured and smoked meats that flourish in the German-speaking lands? Harold Dieterle, please step forward. At his new restaurant, the Marrow, Mr. Dieterle leads off the menu with compound words from the lexicon of German butchery. A meal there might start with excellent jägerwursts, salty, pink little sausages split and dotted with drops of violet mustard that run down the center like buttons on a cuff. There is liverwurst, too, not the sinister tube that lurks in sad deli cases but a rich paste of duck liver ground with nutmeg and allspice.  Mr. Dieterle, who won the first season of “Top Chef,” then gambled his prize money and his recipe for spicy duck meatballs to open a restaurant called Perilla, thinks globally. At Perilla, where Garett McMahan now oversees a kitchen that is both adventurous and finely tuned, chermoula and labneh might share the table with aji amarillo chiles. With his second place, Kin Shop, Mr. Dieterle made an unexpected and welcome digression into Thai cuisine seen through a Western fine-dining lens. The Marrow looks abroad again, but this time his destination is home. Half his menu is inspired by his father’s German roots. The other half draws from the Italian cuisine of his mother and her relatives. The two trunks of the family tree are stamped on the menu: Famiglia Chiarelli on the left, with the polenta and the fettuccine; on the right, with sauerkraut and schnitzel, Familie Dieterle. But another, invisible line divides the menu, too. It is the split between dishes that are completely sure of their purpose and the ones so overembellished it’s unclear what the idea was meant to be. One minute, the Marrow would send out something as concise and well considered as an appetizer of shredded duck leg pressed into a brick under a crackling sheet of skin, with a top layer of huckleberries providing all the counterpoint that the duck needed. The next, out would come skillfully cooked salmon covered by a sprawling haystack of cabbage and carrot slaw. The vegetables, underseasoned and underdressed, seemed to need something. Could it be ... nuggets of pastrami?  No, but that’s what they got. Like a flustered person who isn’t sure what to say, the dish rambled on without coming to the point. Order unwisely and the table can be overcome by this kind of nervous chatter. Luckily, many aspects of the Marrow need no editing at all. Ginger Fisher’s dessert lineup goes from one pleasure to another. I’m not sure I will ever find another turnover as appealing as the Marrow’s apple hand pie, a triangle of tender, buttery crust folded around sliced fruit, but if I do, I’ll want to swab it, too, in a dark pool of caramel, then go back for a forkful of quark ice cream.  And the next time I go for a doughnut run, I hope I collide with Ms. Fisher’s Berliners, soft and white, filled with cinnamon-schnapps cream and served over a rewardingly complex chocolate ganache.  At this point, readers who have stayed for dessert at the Marrow are jumping up and down in their seats, shouting, “What about the ginger stout cake?” I was just getting to that. A wedge of sticky, crunchy gingerbread served with roasted, spiced pears, it has an intense bittersweetness derived from the combination of molasses and stout. It really is worth jumping up and down about. So is the wine list assembled by Jill Roberts, particularly if you prize the incandescent energy and clarity of Austrian and German whites. One night, looking out at the West Village streets through the glass windows that frame this bent elbow of a dining room, I decided it would be smart to keep drinking wine at the Marrow until I’d memorized the position of every umlaut on that list. I might never learn to pronounce Smaragd, but I’d be a happy man. I’d stay happy, too, if I ordered well. I’d come back again to carve into the great golden expanse of the duck schnitzel, miraculously crisp and almost juicy. I’d sit at the bar and dip the fat lamb ribs into their caraway yogurt, chewing on the caramelized edges like jerky.  Mr. Dieterle has an odd but very good interpretation of vitello tonnato, with the part of the veal roast played by deep-fried sweetbreads. (The part of tuna sauce is played by tuna sauce; a wreckfish fillet takes on a previously unknown role that is well suited to the ensemble.) His roasted bone marrow seemed odd at first, too, with scoops of sea urchin sitting along the trench of shinbone like ice cream scoops on a nose-to-tail banana split. But Mr. Dieterle knew what he was up to, juxtaposing two ingredients that felt almost the same in your mouth, but not quite. It was a pun on textures, a delicious joke that you got with your tongue. Some dishes, though, made me wonder whether I’d missed the punch line. I wasn’t sure why anyone would go to the trouble of making salt cod into smooth and subtle dumplings, only to drown them out with chunks of spicy pickled peppers, golden raisins and a too-sweet broth. I squinted and stared at a precarious tower formed by stacking one half of a chicken on top of the other half and balancing both on a bizarre hash of brussels sprouts, batons of salami and cubes of bread. The menu called this a panzanella, after the Italian salad built around tomato-drenched bread, but these cubes were hard and dry, unmoved by their contact with the other ingredients.  One night there was a special of garganelli puttanesca with bottarga and tuna marrow, a clear jelly found inside the fish’s spine. “We recommend stirring the marrow into the pasta,” our server said. We complied, and still thought the sauce too meek and the bottarga too pushy. We couldn’t taste the marrow that had been incorporated into the pasta and didn’t want to deal with the mucilaginous blobs that had not.  Not every dish is so unfocused, but enough are that the Marrow, which should be Mr. Dieterle’s most personal restaurant, feels like his most abstract. Saws can split bones. Opening the marrow of a family’s history takes something stronger than metal.",The Marrow in the West Village - Restaurant Review,"['swami', 'salumi', 'chieftain', 'charcuterie', 'sultan', 'sausage',

233,Lakruwana,★,2013-01-29,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-lakruwana-on-staten-island.html,Stapleton,"WE HAD BEEN DRIVING less than 10 minutes from the toll plaza on the Staten Island side of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge when we spotted the elephants.  Draped with bright red and yellow carpets, their trunks raised importantly, the animals marched with a retinue of turbaned drummers and attendants across a nearly life-size mural that covered the first floor of a building.  “I think we’ve found it,” I said.  Our destination was Lakruwana, one of about a half-dozen Sri Lankan restaurants on Staten Island. Some of these are a short walk from the ferry terminal in St. George, on a hilltop along Victory Boulevard where they are huddled with groceries selling banana blossoms, coconut vinegar, wood apple juice and ribbon cake.  A mile or so south, about 10 minutes from the ferry by bus or Staten Island Railway, is Lakruwana. It stands alone, in more than one way. While the atmosphere of the island’s other Sri Lankan restaurants ranges from serviceable to pleasant, Lakruwana’s verges on spectacular.  The elephants gave us a hint of what we were in for, but things didn’t really get going until we stepped inside. The walls were covered with small, rough pink stones set in stucco framed by bamboo rods. There was a brightly painted wood door in one wall, flanked by matching wood shutters, and above them began the eaves of a tin roof. It was as if we had walked into a small house in the Sri Lankan countryside that had been turned inside out. All around the room were painted masks, sharp pairs of spears, statues of Buddha, and who knows what else. The backs of the chairs were metal rods that stretched about five feet into the air before tapering off into curlicues that looked like butterfly antennas drawn by Dr. Seuss.  We’d come on a Sunday, when a buffet is served all day. If we had expected a dour stainless-steel steam table, we had come to the wrong restaurant. All the curries, rice and other dishes were waiting for us inside 20 or so covered clay pots set over flames. Lifting the lids, I found deviled chicken in a chile sauce with a balance of sweetness and spice that grew more captivating the more I ate; sticks of pineapple in a lightly hot curry paste soured with tamarind; chopped kale mixed with coconut and stir fried just until the greens begin to relax, a wonderful thing to do to kale; fat yellow lentils stewed in coconut milk with the warming flavors of mustard seeds, curry leaves and cinnamon sticks. A mysterious shiny black tangle turned out to be eggplant that had been cooked and cooked, and cooked some more, until it was nearly marmalade. I kept returning for another taste. One or two dishes were easier to resist, like pork in a murky green-black sauce or hard-cooked eggs in an extremely mild coconut-milk curry. But there was always something else to discover, especially the condiments: a flaky pink coconut sambal; another sambal of marinated onions; and lunu miris, a chile-onion relish that I used to give a screaming heat to other things on the plate when I wasn’t eating it straight up. It was Lakruwana’s lunu miris that made me take up silverware again after trying to follow the advice painted on the mirror above a small sink by the kitchen door: “Sri Lankan Foods Would Be More Tastier If You Use Your Fingers Than The Forks.” Though the curries did seem more flavorful when I ate them with my hands, I had trouble keeping a grip on the lentils. This is the cooking that Lakruwana’s chef, Jayantha Wijesinghe, learned in her mother’s kitchen in Sri Lanka. After moving to the United States, she married another Sri Lankan expatriate, Lakruwana Wijesinghe, and together they opened what was almost certainly New York’s first Sri Lankan restaurant. It was unlicensed, and consisted of a picnic table under an umbrella behind a grocery shop in a sixth-floor walk-up above a pornographic movie theater in Times Square. In 1995, it moved to the street level and went legit.  After a fire, Lakruwana relocated to Staten Island, where an estimated 5,000 Sri Lankans have settled over the past few decades. Before it moved into its current spot in Stapleton about two years ago, Mr. Wijesinghe went to Sri Lanka, designed the dining room, bought all the materials and decorations and sent them to New York City in a 40-foot shipping container. Lifting each of the bamboo-and-stone wall panels, he said, required six men.  I know of no other place in town that goes quite so far to summon up the world where its owners were born. Lakruwana may be New York’s most elaborate realization of the immigrant restaurateur’s dream: a shrine to another culture that can soothe homesickness in some patrons and kindle a thrilling sense of discovery in others.  For both kinds of customers, Ms. Wijesinghe’s menu, executed by A. Wimalaratha, is a showcase of distinctively Sri Lankan dishes. Her excellent version of mulligatawny soup, green with cilantro and sour with lemon juice, tilts more toward Southeast Asia than India. Her kitchen also makes lampreis, a steamed packet of aromatic long-grained rice, curry, eggplant, onions, bananas, soft cashews and a fried egg wrapped in a banana leaf that is pinned shut with a paper umbrella. A batter of coconut and rice flour is fried into a wafer and shaped while still warm into crisp, edible bowls called hoppers. You eat them with one of the curries, like the nuanced, gingery Ceylon chicken, or the Wadiya squid seasoned with toasted coriander and cumin. (Both were better choices than the kingfish curry or tuna ambul thiyal, which suffered from lackluster seafood.) Threads of rice flour called string hoppers are sizzled with vegetables and curry and the result, a string hopper kottu, is something like a Southeast Asian stir-fried noodle. The kottu roti is a near cousin in which thin strands of sliced roti stand in for the rice-flour threads. Both are wonderful, particularly if you convince Mr. Wijesinghe, who waits tables in a sarong, that you can handle some spice. (This is crucial with the deviled dishes, which are otherwise dull.) After the savory courses, desserts offer a welcome simplicity. There is yogurt under a dark sea of honey, and there is a mango pudding that I look forward to tasting again. Strange as it sounds, I look forward to the water, too. It is served in clay cups with glazed lips, which somehow makes it taste cooler and smoother. I’m sure the restaurant goes through a lot of these. But having imported enough Sri Lankan rocks to cover the walls, the Wijesinghes must view the cost of replacing a few broken cups as a trivial expense.",Lakruwana on Staten Island,"['driving', 'le',

234,Krescendo,★★,2013-01-22,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-krescendo-in-boerum-hill-brooklyn.html,Boerum Hill,"PIZZA IS NOT A HUMBLE food, and great pizza is not usually made by humble people. Some of the proudest and most willful cooks you will ever meet are pie slingers. So when Elizabeth Falkner, a chef who until recently owned two major restaurants in San Francisco and who is a familiar face on television, goes to work at an unassuming neighborhood pizzeria in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, it’s worth a second look. And then a third, because things at Krescendo are not as modest as they initially appear.  The simple chairs and tables, the light bulbs hanging inside wire cages and the standard-issue bar do not scream ambition. Nothing does until you see, at the far end of the restaurant, a pizza oven clad in little metallic tiles that glint like sequins. In an otherwise unremarkable restaurant, spotting this outcropping of glam is like boarding the morning commuter train from Mount Kisco and discovering that you are sitting next to RuPaul. The menu seems to revert to the ordinary. There are pizza knots, rice balls and meatballs, a few salads and a handful of simple pastas including spaghetti with tomato sauce. Then there are the pies, including three under the heading Pizza Napoletana. This might have stood out a decade ago. Today, it puts Krescendo among a herd of brick-oven strivers. But here, under Pizza Italiana Classica, is a flash of lamé: Finocchio Flower Power.  What is on top of the crust is mainly fennel, but to call it a topping would imply that it is interchangeable with some other item. It is not. This pizza is an essay on the theme of fennel. Ms. Falkner stews the bulb to draw out its mellow sweetness, spreads out some raw fronds for their fresh, herbal flavor and calls on the seeds in fennel sausage for their licorice snap. The vegetable’s candylike tendencies are kept in check by sharp aged provolone and powdered red chiles from Calabria.  The Finocchio Flower Power is the pizza version of the sparkly oven, a lavishly constructed detail that lets you know that Krescendo is much better than the neighborhood Italian joint it is trying to pass for. I do not know why Ms. Falkner and Nancy Puglisi, the restaurant’s owner, camouflaged the place so thoroughly, but the result is that not enough people are talking about Krescendo.  Ms. Falkner is skillful enough to make something exceptional out of the utterly simple: Krescendo’s marinara pizza, with four or five golden cloves of roasted garlic on a plush red circle of oregano-scented tomato sauce. At the other end of the scale, she can assemble a complex fleet of ingredients that seem to be headed for a nasty collision and send them whizzing around the racetrack. One pizza, the Californication, is topped with prosciutto, shishito peppers, arugula, honey, two kinds of cheese and an arugula-walnut pesto. It sounds preposterous, but it’s very good, if you can bring yourself to ask for it by name.  One pizza didn’t work at all, the Clam Pie, which had few of the shellfish and little of their flavor. But the one called the Cure, with sopressata and fresh Fresno chiles, tasted potent enough to fix colds, hangovers and the January shivers, both the physical and metaphysical varieties.  INTENDED AS A KIND of edible plate for Ms. Falkner’s cooking, Krescendo’s pizza crust is not bland, though it is scant on salt and lacks deep flavor. But it is exceptionally light and tender, with what pizza researchers call good “crumb structure.” The rim is evenly browned, with no black blisters and only a few dark speckles. The char is minimal, but you can often taste the smoke that pours across the roof of the oven from the wood fire banked on one side.  On four different nights, the crust looked and tasted virtually the same, a consistency that eludes some of New York’s most acclaimed pizzerias. Very few of those places attempt a gluten-free crust, something that Krescendo has already mastered. Made with rice flour, potato starch and cornstarch, it is the Bizarro World double of the wheat-flour crust: crackling rather than soft, flat rather than puffy, with a fuller, more savory taste. It is not my first choice, but it is a good choice.  The quality of a restaurant’s pizza often correlates negatively with that of its pastas and salads. Ms. Falkner brings the same quiet focus to all her cooking at Krescendo. Her pasta con le sarde, with toasted pebbles of Sardinian fregola, is exceptional. And while the spaghetti al pomodoro does not surpass the great version at Scarpetta, it comes close enough to survive the comparison unscathed, and it contains way less butter. Krescendo’s pizza knots are more like zeppole, deep-fried dough with a tendency to be a bit undercooked at the core. But get them anyway and avoid the doughy parts, dipping the rest in the remarkably deep sauce of black garlic, calamata olives, balsamic vinegar and molasses. The finest use of the kitchen’s fryer is the terrific cod fritter, served with just-tender cannellini. When Ms. Falkner deviates from Italy, she shows  a Californian’s intuition for produce, as in a lovely fritto misto of sliced pears, acorn squash and onions. A beet salad one night was just routine, but finely honed instincts were at work in a salad of raw and fried kale in a lemony dressing, with pancetta candy hidden under the leaves like a prize.  As a young art-school graduate in San Francisco, Ms. Falkner first saw the sculptural possibilities of sugar and batter. Soon she was off, making desserts that teetered and towered like the designs of a chocolate-mad architect.  You will have guessed by now that Krescendo offers almost no hint of her pathbreaking work at Citizen Cake and Orson in San Francisco. But order the cassata. In Palermo, Sicily, cassata is a spongecake adorned with marzipan, ricotta and candied fruit. Ms. Falkner essentially blows it up, sending the pieces all over the plate and taking advantage of the chaos to make each fragment a little more exciting. The cake is pistachio; the cherries are soaked in Campari; out of nowhere there is a scoop of excellent tangerine sorbet.  The dessert is another of Ms. Falkner’s tiled ovens. I suspect it will not be her last.","Krescendo in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn","['pizza', 'humble', 'great', 'pizza', 'usually', 'humble', 'people', 'proudest', 'willful', 'cook', 'ever', 'meet', 'pie',

235,El Toro Blanco,★,2013-01-08,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-el-toro-blanco-in-the-west-village.html,West Village,"ONCE you plow your way through the crowds struggling in vain to catch a bartender’s eye at El Toro Blanco, you emerge into a dining room that might be in Santa Barbara during the last days of the Nixon administration. Ridged orange backs on half-moon banquettes stand up like a wall of Cheetos. Glazed brick walls in red and black flank curvy 1960s plywood chairs, dangling tangerine-colored pendant lights, and matadors painted on black velvet.  El Toro Blanco’s evocation of the last days of midcentury modernism is so spirited that you expect to see women in Halston pantsuits talking about EST while flicking More cigarettes over glass ashtrays the size of dog bowls.  Restaurant designers can’t fight the smoking ban, but what they can do is get across an idea. Even if you don’t consciously register the intention of Meyer Davis Studio, the architecture firm that collaborated with El Toro Blanco’s partners, John McDonald and Josh Capon, you can still feel it. The look of El Toro Blanco is the latest sign that in New York City, Mexican cuisine is cool, of the moment and ready to be presented without quotation marks — quaint ethnic folk crafts on the earnest side or, on the sloshy side, shot-glass bandoleers and blueberry margaritas. Admittedly, El Toro Blanco’s interior makes the point more forcefully than its menu, assembled by Mr. Capon in consultation with Scott Linquist, a chef who has wrangled tamales at Dos Caminos in New York and Border Grill in Los Angeles. The main courses are on the mild side, and the sauces rarely achieve the profound interplay of heat, bitterness, smoke, fruits, nuts and spices that can make Mexican cuisine so rewarding. Balancing that, though, is the kitchen’s emphasis on fresh flavors and its appealing lineup of street snacks and other appetizers.  Tamales were probably never meant to be fluffy, but that didn’t stop me from enjoying the airy forkfuls of steamed masa in the tamale oaxaqueña, covered with sweet plantains and shredded roast chicken in red mole, or in the lighter version with corn kernels and green strips of roasted poblanos. Empanada dough is rarely as thin and crisp as it is on the half-moons at El Toro Blanco, filled with tender short rib or with shrimp that seem to have twice their usual flavor. I refuse to choose a favorite among the three ceviches. I’d rather just appreciate the lean, classic profile of red snapper in lime juice with jalapeño and cilantro, the depth that soy sauce brought to cubes of tuna with cucumber and avocado, and the way habaneros seemed to raise the temperature of a chilled coconut-milk broth for lobster. Lightness has its limits: the Sonoran cheese crisp, a thin flour tortilla beneath melted cheese, roasted tomatoes and threads of roasted poblanos, had a way of staying behind on its pizza stand while other things on the table disappeared. Like, for instance, the scalding pan of chorizo fundido, in which Mexico looks Switzerland calmly in the eye and says, “I’ll see your cheese fondue and raise you some green chiles and a heap of crumbled spicy sausage.” (Switzerland folds and leaves the room.) Tacos didn’t always deserve the extensive acreage on the menu they occupied. The tacos al pastor needed more heat to balance the sweet pineapple and unexciting pork, and whatever the chicken breast taco needed wasn’t quite supplied by a sweet tomato-chipotle sauce. And a thick wad of stewed goat, while as tender and goaty as you might hope, called out for a bright or hot counterpoint, not just cheese and beans. But a squeeze of lime handily completed the tacos of lightly fried cod with slivers of radish, or better yet the ones with charred but still tender octopus tentacles that curled out of their folded tortillas like question marks that are really invitations. None of this is likely to alter your perceptions of Mexico, but put a few of these snacks together with a margarita on the rocks — the best, El Toro, is sweetened with orange juice and agave syrup, not liqueur — and the night will cruise along like a 707 to Acapulco. The energy can flag if you strike out for the bigger plates, though not if you order the lobster Puerto Nuevo, served split on its back with orange legs pointing in all directions. In the town of Puerto Nuevo, the lobster would be pan-fried in lard. El Toro Blanco grills it instead, and while I won’t endorse this compromise, I have to admit that the melted butter seasoned with ground chiles de árbol made me miss the pork fat a little less. Still, at times the restaurant seems to play to timid palates. The mole coloradito, which typically draws intrigue from cloves and cinnamon, is something of a fruit bomb, its sweetness landing with a thud on roast chicken breast that can tend toward dryness. A tomatillo salsa, one of three served with the bright guacamole, also gets more sugar than it can handle.  Veracruz-style fish, usually cooked in a Mexican-Mediterranean blend of tomatoes, capers and olives, was pan-seared instead; the tomatoes, now more condiment than sauce, came across as strictly Italian. Grilled swordfish repeated the pattern: simply cooked seafood in the center of the plate, tomatoes on the side, Mexico disappearing around the bend. Most of the desserts won’t bring it back, not the simple-minded apple empanada or the tapioca pudding or the chocolate tart. But a tres leches cake had a properly heart-stopping level of dairy overkill, and churros, crunchy with cinnamon sugar and scorchingly hot, were satisfying with or without a dip into dulce de leche sauce.  Mr. Capon and Mr. McDonald are the creative minds behind Lure Fishbar and B&B Winepub, both of which manage to conjure quintessentially downtown scenes without benefit of a notably progressive menu. That these two men saw a future for themselves in Mexican food may not do much to move the cuisine forward. But style can have a substance of its own, and this may be the case when two restaurateurs convince New Yorkers that the centerpiece of a fun and stylish night on the town can be a plate of

236,Royal Seafood Restaurant,★,2012-12-11,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/12/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-royal-seafood-restaurant-in-chinatown.html,Chinatown,"EVERYBODY was having lobster. Before placing an order, Chinatown veterans look around the dining room to see what others are eating. At the Royal Seafood Restaurant on Mott Street one recent night, the vote was unanimous. Grandmothers were having lobster and small girls in crisp dresses were having lobster and eight police officers in stiff blue uniforms were having lobster. Nearly all the enormous round tables draped with carnation-pink cloths were occupied, and sitting on the center of each was a platter of red shells split open to expose the shiny white meat inside. Lobster wasn’t anywhere on the menu, but my table followed suit and asked for one anyway. It was hacked into sections and wok-fried with a sticky, time-honored Cantonese sauce of scallions and slivers of ginger. With chopsticks and fingertips, we dug the slippery flesh out of the legs, the tail and the claws, asking ourselves how lobster could be this soft and generously sweet. We had followed the wisdom of the crowd and won. James Surowiecki would have been proud. So would the budget hawks back at the office, because the whole lobster cost $15. This was a week after the hurricane and a few days after the lights had come back on in downtown Manhattan. Chinatown was on my mind. I worried about the mournful fish in their dark tanks, but I also worried about the money the restaurants had lost and might keep losing if tourists stayed away. Chinatown has lived through so much that it can seem indestructible, but restaurants are fragile. We eat in Chinatown restaurants because no part of Manhattan so readily offers better food for less money; because the portions are truly meant for sharing; because even those places that don’t change their fluorescent bulbs as often as they might still buy fresh snow pea shoots each day. Royal Seafood has glinting chandeliers, not fluorescent bulbs, but it suits all the other criteria beautifully. It has the added benefit of serving food that is often very close to Cantonese cuisine, the original flavor of Chinatown, with enough modern Hong Kong flourishes to let you know that it’s 2012. The kitchen is under the command of Kendy Cheng, who arrived in New York from Hong Kong several years ago and founded Royal Seafood as the chef and a co-owner. His crispy fried chicken is old-school, and one night gave me almost everything you could ask from that dish, with deeply flavorful meat pressed flat beneath a crackling sheet of skin. The bird’s head stared up from the platter. I don’t know why some of the chicken’s original savor was missing on another night. But I know I am glad I overruled the person at my table who tried to vote down the Peking-style pork chops. He got jumpy when the server called the sauce “sweet and sour.” Of course, it was the furthest thing imaginable from the phosphorescent orange jelly of dubious takeout counters. It had the color of dark rum, the resonant tang of aged vinegar and the bittersweetness of burned sugar. The sauce brought a tingle of energy to the pork’s crunchy fried coating. Smoking-hot oil is often the elixir of happiness at Royal Seafood. It cooks a whole flounder impeccably and makes the fins, tails and bones brittle and hard to resist. It turns salt-and-pepper seafood into fritters with a slightly sweet, saffron-colored batter that reminded me, pleasantly, of the Coney Island Boardwalk. The same batter makes a nifty little snack of cubed pork ribs; you chew and suck them before spitting out the bony bits. And the deep fryer’s transformation of tofu into an object of desire is so impressive I might almost have considered it fraud, if I hadn’t been busy helping myself to more. Fried crispy bean curd was lovely; even more appealing were cubes of tofu dressed with a rich minced-pork sauce, and olives that were vaguely sweet and more fruity than briny. There were unengaging exceptions to the rule of deep-fried excellence, like the T-bone steak and the “house walnut shrimp.” If fried shrimp and melon cubes glazed with warm mayonnaise sounds appealing to you, though, by all means take mine. Just leave me the candied walnuts. Royal Seafood, rarely empty, draws rush-hour crowds for its dim sum. A manager stands in the front, looking around for empty chairs beneath one of the room’s four golden dragons with colored light bulbs for eyes. The moment somebody gets up to leave, the manager barks a number into a cordless microphone hooked up to a loudspeaker, and new customers rush across the room to claim their seats. It’s like a high-speed game show in which the prizes are dumplings. The best strategy: sit on an aisle unless you speak some Cantonese. Tables are jammed together, and sitting too far from the trolleys puts you at risk of missing a favorite dumpling. I wouldn’t have wanted to skip the shumai, filled with rosy pink chopped pork or with shrimp and chives. And it would have been a shame not to try the hollow, pistachio-green spheres of sticky rice filled with salty peanuts and sweet black sesame paste. If I had sat in a back row, the chewy, lightly spicy cubes of starchy turnip cake tossed with dried shrimp, Chinese sausage and scallions may have passed me by. Few of the dim sum items were exceptional, but all were good enough and all were priced to move, and move the meal does. You can order from the menu all day, but the best time to explore it is by night, when the dining room and presumably the kitchen are less frantic. Dinner brings the opportunity to share a soul-warming casserole of curried oxtail or a platter of irregular, springy e-fu noodles with fat mushrooms. And it’s the right moment to try the house special baby lamb chops in a black-pepper sauce that has a caramel bitterness and an unexpected depth, an umami undercurrent that must come from leaves of seaweed that are frilly and green like an iguana’s beard. In the evening, with enough people around the table, you can start the meal with a hot and deeply restorative soup. Maybe the bean curd with bits of chopped shrimp, or the West Lake beef soup with bright green cilantro leaves. A server will rush the steaming white tureen to the table, his arms straining at the weight. He will ladle it out. There will be just enough to fill every bowl. You will wish all your dinners began this well. It’s Chinatown. Don’t forget it, Jake.",Royal Seafood Restaurant in Chinatown,"['everybody', 'lobster', 'placing', 'order', 'chinatown', 'veteran', 'look', 'around', 'see', 'others', 'eating', 'royal', 'seafood',

237,Moti Mahal Delux,★★,2012-12-04,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/05/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-moti-mahal-delux-in-manhattan.html,Upper East Side,"FOODS that give us a deep feeling of indulgence aren’t always the ones you’d expect. There are spoonfuls of caviar that taste of little more than salt, and slices of wagyu so meek that their return on investment is roughly in the territory of a savings bond. Meanwhile, at a quiet Indian restaurant in the East 60s called Moti Mahal Delux, a bowl of lentils can make you go wobbly with happiness. The dish is called dal makhani, and it is an inky stew of spiced black lentils that have been coaxed into absorbing what feels like twice their own weight in salted butter imported from India. They are deeply, truly luxurious, a word I’m rarely tempted to use in the context of lentils. It had been a while since I had considered just how indulgent vast quantities of butter can make a humble plate of lentils, but the great practitioners of North India’s Mughlai cuisine never forgot. Mughlai food can be seductively rich and, with its wealth of spices and fresh ginger, spellbindingly aromatic. Heavily influenced by the Persian cuisine that was brought to the subcontinent by the Mogul emperors, the cooking of North India still has an imperial lavishness when cooked with care and consideration for ingredients, as it is at Moti Mahal Delux. The restaurant, which opened in July, is itself an outpost of an empire, a chain centered in New Delhi that has built a formidable reputation among Indians for its tandoori chicken, butter chicken and that black-lentil dal. In fact, there seem to be two competing companies, each claiming a lineage with the original Moti Mahal founded in 1947 and each vying for rights to the name in New York City. Lawyers may have to sort it out. Meanwhile, the rest of us can get down to the more serious business of rooting around the lengthy menu, paying particular attention to anything that passes through the tandoor oven. Its dry heat roasts papadum to a greaseless crisp and chases excess water from mushroom caps stuffed with herbs and cheese, leaving them tender and meaty. The tandoor also imparts a winning smokiness to an unpromising-sounding snack of grilled pineapple, sweet potato, apple and bell pepper in a sweet-tart malt vinegar marinade that has a slowly mounting black-pepper buzz. Skewers of lamb called burrah kebab emerge from the tandoor coated with a thick and tangy marinade of yogurt, sour cream and lemon juice spiced with garam masala. These chops make you want to gnaw at the bone once the meat is gone. The most eye-opening item to come out of the oven is tandoori chicken, a preparation said to have been introduced to restaurant dining by the original Moti Mahal. Justifiably, the dish and the restaurant became famous. Juicy despite its black streaks of char, the tandoori chicken at Moti Mahal Delux has a subtle heat and spice but does not have the quarter-inch of candy-red flesh that indicates the presence of food coloring. After tasting it, I thought of the restaurants where I had been served poor facsimiles of the dish and wanted to demand refunds from all of them. “My whole point of taking this franchise was to get the recipe for their tandoori chicken,” said Gaurav Anand, the executive chef and an owner of Moti Mahal Delux, in a phone interview. “Because as a chef I’ve been thinking for so long: How do they make it? It’s unbelievable.” Mr. Anand, who was raised in New Delhi, obtained the recipe he coveted from the mother ship, along with several others on the menu that are denoted as Moti Mahal Delux signatures. They are all worth having, from the golden pakora fritters spiked with ground Kashmiri chiles to the fearsomely rich butter chicken to the crab masala in a dry and complex sauce made of tomatoes, onions and a garam masala blend supplied by the restaurant’s New Delhi overlords. (A similar masala dish is made with goat brains.) These dishes set high expectations that are not met by every item on the menu, which mixes Moti Mahal classics and Mr. Anand’s own contributions. I was a bit mystified by the golgappa shots, four fried poori cups perched on different kinds of broth in shot glasses. You are meant to pour the broths into the poori, but they dribble out the bottom and don’t add much in any case. Roomali khasta was another shot-glass appetizer, fried pastry cigars stuffed with mushrooms and standing in a sun-dried tomato dip that didn’t leave much impression. And apart from the rice pudding, I was immune to the charms of the desserts. Next time I’ll have sweets elsewhere and concentrate on the things Moti Mahal Delux does best, starting with the vegetarian dishes. The kitchen brings out okra’s most appealing qualities by slicing the pods lengthwise and dredging them in roasted cumin seeds and other spices before giving them a fast blast in very hot oil. The okra hangs on to its crunchy texture even after it’s been tossed in its gravy of tomatoes and onions. Less aggressive treatment is in store for tiny eggplants with their stems still on and for broccoli, which is steamed and then simmered in a quiet saffron sauce. Mr. Anand, who also owns Bhatti Indian Grill on the south end of Lexington Avenue, said that he had discovered many of these dishes in India as a young cook. “If somebody made good kebabs, I’d get their recipe,” he said. The main dining room of Moti Mahal Delux, most recently a different Indian restaurant, has been done over in clean, modern style, with chocolate-leather chairs and straight-backed red banquettes along a blond wood wall. The room looks so fresh and new that you wish the designers had kept going a few yards more, into the corridor leading to the restrooms and the glassed-in terrace that wraps around the corner of First Avenue and 63rd Street. For a new restaurant, it has a few spots too many that could use a fresh coat of paint. For now, the restaurant has no liquor license, which keeps the check from climbing very high. A weekday lunch special with two appetizers, three entrees, a biryani, naan and dessert comes to less than $12. These are Curry Hill prices on the Upper East Side, and a bargain in any neighborhood for food that provides a surprising flavor of luxury.",Moti Mahal Delux in Manhattan,"['food', 'give', 'u',

238,Dirt Candy,★★,2012-11-27,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/28/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-dirt-candy-in-the-east-village.html,East Village,"DID you hear the one about the rutabaga? No, probably not. Vegetables don’t tend to inspire great jokes. On the contrary, they conjure their very own brand of humorlessness, the tight-lipped officiousness of grim nutritionists that is captured in the phrase “Eat your vegetables.” Since opening Dirt Candy in the East Village almost four years ago, the chef Amanda Cohen has been waging war on the “eat your vegetables” mind-set, using humor as one of her weapons. Here she is on her restaurant’s Web site on the subject of cabbage: “It’s the wino of the vegetable world: smelly, unloved and looking at it makes you feel sad. A cabbage salad sounds even worse. Cabbage that’s ... raw? It sounds like a plated suicide note.” Humor is so integral to Ms. Cohen’s work that she may be the only chef in America who could publish her first cookbook in comic-book form and make the decision seem not just sensible but inevitable. Drawn by Ryan Dunlavey with facial expressions that range from mild exasperation to howling rage, Ms. Cohen’s cartoon character delivers bitingly funny monologues about appearing on “Iron Chef” and rolling out pasta dough. Along the way, she and her staff beat the daylights out of a wizard and a fairy who are idiotic enough to suggest that pickles are made by magic. But Ms. Cohen’s chief weapon in the battle against vegetable scolds is the food she serves at Dirt Candy, a vegetarian restaurant that is thrillingly free of high-minded ideals. Ms. Cohen isn’t necessarily out to save a small planet or prevent heart disease. Her goals are possibly more subversive, and she achieves them with vegetable cookery that is original, clever, visually arresting and, above all, a lot of fun to eat. Take the dish called Cauliflower! The punctuation is the restaurant’s, but I’ll go along with the emotion. Ms. Cohen gives cauliflower florets a long bath in maple smoke, dips them in cornflakes, fries them to a golden crisp and serves them on waffles. She’s making a visual pun on the chicken-leg shape of the florets and stems. But these smoky and crunchy nuggets also invite you to see vegetables as an indulgence, a pleasure that is not quite guilty but not entirely innocent, either. Eating at Dirt Candy can be like going to a child’s birthday party in a country where all the children love vegetables. Eggplant tiramisù, with layers of rosemary lady fingers sandwiching a sweet mascarpone whipped with grilled eggplant, sounds like a dare: daring you to try it, daring you to like it. While you consider your options, a server brings the final element of the dish, a white frizz of cotton candy with a startlingly pure and piney taste of rosemary. It lifts up the eggplant, the dessert and the party. One way of cooking vegetables is to go deep, to concentrate flavors until you have the world’s most carroty carrot, and leave it at that. Ms. Cohen builds layers of flavor from the outside in. During the fall, she constructs a savory tart using tomatoes in every way imaginable, to intensify the effect. There are dried tomatoes in a pink, biscuit-like crust; there are peeled and marinated cherry tomatoes on top of that crust, with a creamy layer of smoked feta; there is a ribbon of sweet and chewy tomato leather around the tart; finally, off to the side, there is a salad of fresh and dehydrated cherry tomatoes. The whole was more than the sum of its parts, but all the parts were good to begin with. The same isn’t true yet of a new dish (Onions!) built around small Chinese-derived cakes of smoked scallions and chives. One night they were overwhelmingly smoky; on another night the smoke was more reticent but the cakes themselves tasted flat. Both nights, a salad of grilled scallions, red onions and herbs could have used a livelier, more decisive dressing. But it’s very difficult to criticize a dish that includes the world’s tiniest onion rings, each just big enough to fit on the tip of a chopstick. These elaborate plates, each of which holds about a half-dozen components and can be made in vegan form upon request, emerge from a visibly cramped kitchen. This may seem like a marvel, but it pales next to the logistical feat Ms. Cohen and her staff pulled off early this month. Like hundreds of restaurants downtown, Dirt Candy lost power for four days after Hurricane Sandy. Every perishable, including stocks, jams and pickles, had to be tossed onto the sidewalk in trash bags. Almost all of it was replenished in just two days, which meant scheduling times and temperatures for the single oven down to the minute. It must have been like re-enacting the invasion of Normandy in a kiddie pool. It also involved the same kind of spatial planning that allows Dirt Candy to fit 18 seats into a spare, modernist dining room where even one more might be too much. Wineglasses are stored on a sea-green glass ledge above the tables, and customers waiting for a table are stored outside on Ninth Street. Vegetarian cooks in the United States have not always found much nourishment in American cuisine. Some looked to health food and ideology, while others have looked abroad. Ms. Cohen dabbles in overseas influences. Cabbage!, a lonesome hobo no more, is reimagined as the star of a marvelous Asian noodle salad, with kohlrabi threads standing in for noodles, fried walnuts carrying a spicy blast of Sichuan peppercorn, and purple fried won tons getting their color and flavor from juiced cabbage. A new item on the menu, Beans!, surrounds haricots verts and crisp tofu with a deeply intriguing sauce in which saffron, ginger, cilantro, coriander seed, cumin and Urfa biber pepper offer echoes of Morocco. But there is no mistaking a Dirt Candy dish for one that you would find in another country. Ms. Cohen is not adapting the vegetarian cuisine of some other culture. She is inventing her own.",Dirt Candy in the East Village,"['hear', 'rutabaga', 'probably', 'vegetable', 'don’t', 'tend', 'inspire', 'great', 'joke', 'contrary', 'conjure', 'brand', 'humorlessness',

239,M. Wells Dinette,★★,2012-11-20,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/21/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-m-wells-dinette-at-moma-ps1.html,Long Island City,"WHEN M. Wells, a tin-can diner on a windswept corner of Long Island City, Queens, closed in the summer of 2011, its operators blamed its demise on a rent increase. I never believed it. The more likely explanation, it seemed to me, is that the restaurant had to die so New York could live. As a light beginning to your meal, you could start with a half-dozen fat snails stuffed into the melting marrow of a long shaft of shinbone. After that delicate snack, you could get a little more serious by ordering an entire meatloaf with stroganoff gravy, spaetzle and foie gras. This tower of meat was meant to be shared by four people, but you could round out the meal with slices of buttered brioche weighted down with even more foie gras. That was a side dish. M. Wells posed a danger to more than the heart and arteries, though. Its chef, Hugue Dufour, advocated an approach to dining that was a threat to the work ethic that has made the city prosperous since it was called New Amsterdam. The gleefully unrestrained portions and liberal doses of fat and meat were an invitation to eat too much at lunch, get drunk in the afternoon, sleep it off for a while, resume consciousness again at dinner and call in sick the next day. If enough people had fallen into the M. Wells lifestyle, the city would have ground to a halt and our economy would look like Greece’s. But New York must have an immune system that keeps it safe from destabilizing outside influences, because M. Wells lasted just more than a year before the steak knives and the foie gras vanished from the scene. Two months ago, Mr. Dufour and his wife and business partner, Sarah Obraitis, returned to haunt our 60-hour workweeks and our plans to live to retirement age with M. Wells Dinette, a new cafeteria inside MoMA PS1 in Long Island City. In homage to the building’s past as a red brick schoolhouse, the dining area is set up like a classroom. There are long shared desks with composition notebooks tucked beneath the surface and even a few of those chairs with a built-in writing surface; others have a cage for books under the seat. More forgiving than the restaurant it attempts to reprise, M. Wells Dinette is closed for dinner and seems to have scaled back its portions ever so slightly for daytime eating. But Mr. Dufour did not return to the kitchen to make cucumber sandwiches. One weekend, a goat had been drawn on the menu chalkboard, its heart and other organs instructively labeled. (Another blackboard lists the wines, many of them French and all of them very helpful in putting away Mr. Dufour’s cuisine.) The kitchen had bought a goat, butchered it, and was selling off the pieces. By the time I got to the dinette on Sunday morning, just one leg and the liver were left. I chose the liver. With a rustic French sauce of vermouth and lardons, a mess of caramelized onions and a cushion of mashed potatoes holding everything in place, it was staggeringly hearty, the kind of thing you’d want to eat before setting off on a three-day bowhunting trip in Alaska. If my hemoglobin count had still been low after that liver, and I was still hungry, I might have followed it with the blood pudding. This big slab, the color of a just-dug beet, was crunchy on the outside, with an iron-rich tang that was softened and sweetened by a buttery apple mustard. The menus, which change daily, can be read as methodical studies in the uses of animal fat. Cured pork belly binds an expertly made terrine of rabbit shot through with pink ovals of foie gras. The rich oils of smoked herring bring depth to a surprisingly light Caesar salad with broccoli. One of my companions described the thin slices of fried bread served with a classic brandade as “crisp butter.” There is also smooth, spreadable butter, on an open-face sandwich of bottarga served with a shot glass of the anise-flavored spirit arak, and flaky layered butter in the crust on a slice of Mr. Dufour’s justifiably renowned Québécois meat pie, which overflows with the flesh of four or five species of animal. A native of Quebec, Mr. Dufour learned his blithe disregard for moderation while cooking at Au Pied de Cochon in Montreal, where he was also the pastry chef and an owner. Most of the time, his celebration of the unbridled joy of eating like a lumberjack is so convincing that I’d be prepared to split cordwood all day just to earn the right to pull up a chair. I may have to do that, in fact, if I keep going back to M. Wells for the charlotte that appears in various guises. One day the pastry chef, Bethany Costello, had filled it with pears, mascarpone and a lake of salted caramel; another time she made it impersonate a black forest cake, with chocolate mousse below brandied cherries and a dark chocolate shell. In any incarnation, it is said to serve two. It could easily make six people happy, or four people ecstatic. But at M. Wells Dinette, as at its forerunner, there are times when excess does not lead to success. There was nothing appealing about a veal cheek stroganoff — not the crunchy, underdone mushrooms, not the dense and pasty torpedoes of spaetzle, not the largely flavorless meat and especially not the pools of grease that lay on top of the sauce. Grease was also a major and unwelcome player in a bowl of onion soup topped with bland melted cheese. Get a dish like this, and you can start to wish that the kitchen put as much care into the fine details as it does into the broad strokes. Then again, you might just accept the occasional greasy sauce as the price you pay for all the food at M. Wells Dinette that you’ll never find anywhere else, least of all in a museum cafe. PS1 should be congratulated for landing a restaurant that suits the neighborhood, the museum’s audience and, trickiest of all, the questing spirit of the work in its galleries. It’s easy enough to imagine a contemporary artist butchering and roasting a goat as a performance piece. It’s less easy to imagine the resulting feast tasting as good as it did at M. Wells Dinette.",M.

240,Guy's American Kitchen & Bar,0 star,2012-11-13,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-guys-american-kitchen-bar-in-times-square.html,Times Square Theatre District,"GUY FIERI, have you eaten at your new restaurant in Times Square? Have you pulled up one of the 500 seats at Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar and ordered a meal? Did you eat the food? Did it live up to your expectations? Did panic grip your soul as you stared into the whirling hypno wheel of the menu, where adjectives and nouns spin in a crazy vortex? When you saw the burger described as “Guy’s Pat LaFrieda custom blend, all-natural Creekstone Farm Black Angus beef patty, LTOP (lettuce, tomato, onion + pickle), SMC (super-melty-cheese) and a slathering of Donkey Sauce on garlic-buttered brioche,” did your mind touch the void for a minute? Did you notice that the menu was an unreliable predictor of what actually came to the table? Were the “bourbon butter crunch chips” missing from your Almond Joy cocktail, too? Was your deep-fried “boulder” of ice cream the size of a standard scoop? What exactly about a small salad with four or five miniature croutons makes Guy’s Famous Big Bite Caesar (a) big (b) famous or (c) Guy’s, in any meaningful sense? Were you struck by how very far from awesome the Awesome Pretzel Chicken Tenders are? If you hadn’t come up with the recipe yourself, would you ever guess that the shiny tissue of breading that exudes grease onto the plate contains either pretzels or smoked almonds? Did you discern any buttermilk or brine in the white meat, or did you think it tasted like chewy air? Why is one of the few things on your menu that can be eaten without fear or regret — a lunch-only sandwich of chopped soy-glazed pork with coleslaw and cucumbers — called a Roasted Pork Bahn Mi, when it resembles that item about as much as you resemble Emily Dickinson? When you have a second, Mr. Fieri, would you see what happened to the black bean and roasted squash soup we ordered? Hey, did you try that blue drink, the one that glows like nuclear waste? The watermelon margarita? Any idea why it tastes like some combination of radiator fluid and formaldehyde? At your five Johnny Garlic’s restaurants in California, if servers arrive with main courses and find that the appetizers haven’t been cleared yet, do they try to find space for the new plates next to the dirty ones? Or does that just happen in Times Square, where people are used to crowding? If a customer shows up with a reservation at one of your two Tex Wasabi’s outlets, and the rest of the party has already been seated, does the host say, “Why don’t you have a look around and see if you can find them?” and point in the general direction of about 200 seats? What is going on at this new restaurant of yours, really? Has anyone ever told you that your high-wattage passion for no-collar American food makes you television’s answer to Calvin Trillin, if Mr. Trillin bleached his hair, drove a Camaro and drank Boozy Creamsicles? When you cruise around the country for your show “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,” rasping out slangy odes to the unfancy places where Americans like to get down and greasy, do you really mean it? Or is it all an act? Is that why the kind of cooking you celebrate on television is treated with so little respect at Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar? How, for example, did Rhode Island’s supremely unhealthy and awesomely good fried calamari — dressed with garlic butter and pickled hot peppers — end up in your restaurant as a plate of pale, unsalted squid rings next to a dish of sweet mayonnaise with a distant rumor of spice? How did Louisiana’s blackened, Cajun-spiced treatment turn into the ghostly nubs of unblackened, unspiced white meat in your Cajun Chicken Alfredo? How did nachos, one of the hardest dishes in the American canon to mess up, turn out so deeply unlovable? Why augment tortilla chips with fried lasagna noodles that taste like nothing except oil? Why not bury those chips under a properly hot and filling layer of melted cheese and jalapeños instead of dribbling them with thin needles of pepperoni and cold gray clots of ground turkey? By the way, would you let our server know that when we asked for chai, he brought us a cup of hot water? When you hung that sign by the entrance that says, WELCOME TO FLAVOR TOWN!, were you just messing with our heads? Does this make it sound as if everything at Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar is inedible? I didn’t say that, did I? Tell me, though, why does your kitchen sabotage even its more appealing main courses with ruinous sides and sauces? Why stifle a pretty good bison meatloaf in a sugary brown glaze with no undertow of acid or spice? Why send a serviceable herb-stuffed rotisserie chicken to the table in the company of your insipid Rice-a-Roni variant? Why undermine a big fist of slow-roasted pork shank, which might fly in many downtown restaurants if the General Tso’s-style sauce were a notch less sweet, with randomly shaped scraps of carrot that combine a tough, nearly raw crunch with the deadened, overcooked taste of school cafeteria vegetables? Is this how you roll in Flavor Town? Somewhere within the yawning, three-level interior of Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar, is there a long refrigerated tunnel that servers have to pass through to make sure that the French fries, already limp and oil-sogged, are also served cold? What accounts for the vast difference between the Donkey Sauce recipe you’ve published and the Donkey Sauce in your restaurant? Why has the hearty, rustic appeal of roasted-garlic mayonnaise been replaced by something that tastes like Miracle Whip with minced raw garlic? And when we hear the words Donkey Sauce, which part of the donkey are we supposed to think about? Is the entire restaurant a very expensive piece of conceptual art? Is the shapeless, structureless baked alaska that droops and slumps and collapses while you eat it, or don’t eat it, supposed to be a representation in sugar and eggs of the experience of going insane? Why did the toasted marshmallow taste like fish? Did you finish that blue drink? Oh, and we never got our Vegas fries; would you mind telling the kitchen that we don’t need them?

241,'21' Club,0 star,2012-10-23,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/24/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-21-club-in-manhattan.html,Midtown,"READERS who look forward to the dark thrill of a public execution on days when there are no stars attached to this column should turn elsewhere to satisfy their blood lust. This is going to be a kind of love letter to a restaurant where the food is largely forgettable and the prices are almost always unwarranted. Years had gone by since I had last sat beneath the toy trucks and boxing gloves, the model airplanes and beer steins in the barroom at “21.” Too many years, I realized in March, when another reformed speakeasy in Midtown, Bill’s Gay Nineties, went out of business. I stopped by on its last night, annoyed with myself for how long it had been since my last drink there. Then, like a man who has just returned from a funeral, I checked in on some old acquaintances. The “21” Club is in no apparent danger, although its status as a corporate trophy is nervous-making. (Last week a luxury hotel group based in India made a takeover bid for its owner, a luxury hotel group based in London.) All the same, I put on a blazer, left the jeans and sneakers at home so I wouldn’t be turned away at the door, and went for dinner. Sadly, the future of “21” might be grim if it had to survive as a restaurant alone. To get the violence over quickly: a game platter, with venison, a boar chop, house-made bacon and rabbit sausage, was as cold as if it had been carried all the way from the hunting lodge. Caesar salad, exactly what you want to eat at “21,” was hopeless, the sliced romaine unevenly dressed and dumped on a plate with stale, dry croutons that might have come from a box. Creamed spinach was a rough paste of chopped greenery in a floury white sauce. That was the worst of it. Most of the food prepared under the chef, John Greeley, a 17-year veteran of “21,” was classic, unsuspenseful and solidly prepared, like the chilled shrimp with cocktail sauce, the grilled lamb chops, the salmon fillet and the steak tartare that wasn’t as neatly hacked up as it might have been but did hold a properly honed edge of mustard and pepper. I ate only four things at “21” that I’d go back for with any anticipation: the famous chicken hash, as creamy and agreeable as Jo Stafford’s voice; the “21” burger, blended with onions and thyme for a homey taste, like meatloaf without the bread; the coconut cake, topped with a beehive of white meringue and toasted coconut; and the olives in the martinis that are as cold as a walk along Park Avenue in January. But to judge “21” as a restaurant is to miss the point of the place. Like Galatoire’s in New Orleans, “21” is at its best when you treat the food as a solid foundation for the liquid entertainment. Take note of the first question you are asked at the table. It is not an offer of still or sparkling, as if you had gone out to dinner because you were tired of the bottled-water selection at home. No, servers at “21” lead off the way they should at all restaurants: “Can I get you something to drink?” On a good night, everybody who works at “21” behaves like a bartender, and the meal sails along on a river of alcohol and high spirits. The wine director, Phil Pratt, has a practiced theatricality and patter more often heard above the splash of gin than the gentle swirl of old Bordeaux. To feel out a customer’s budget, he might ask “How ... painful do you want it to be?” He is not above exploiting the dramatic possibilities of the silver tastevin swinging from his neck, filling it with a splash of Burgundy, lifting it to his lips, rocking back on his heels, popping his eyes and pursing his lips. Many sommeliers tell stories these days. Often they are the tales of ardent fans, and when the story gets to the part about meeting the winemaker, as such stories always seem to do, the sommelier will blush like a sixth grader who has Justin Bieber’s autograph on her backpack. None of that for Mr. Pratt. One night he brought one of Michel Chapoutier’s Rhône reds to a table and asked the diners there to feel the bottle. Mr. Chapoutier, he explained, had embossed his labels with Braille ever since he had poured his wines for a blind man. “And that man,” he said, pausing before the punch line, “was Ray Charles.” It probably didn’t happen that way, but you don’t interrupt an actor mid-monologue any more than you would forget to tip the attendant in the men’s room whom everybody calls the Rev. “Hello, young man,” he said to me one night, then embroidered on his lie. “It’s a good thing you brought your driver’s license, or you’d be drinking Coca-Cola.” By some logic I didn’t follow, this led to a warning that if I didn’t behave, they were going to ask Halle Berry to spank me, and of course she’d expect to be spanked in return. (Personal and confidential to Ms. Berry: I didn’t believe a word of this.) The Rev holds court among vintage pastel murals that depict men and women relieving themselves in complicated ways, scenes that were naughty once and will be bizarre forever. The sense of time travel in that room was intense and not always comfortable, and after a few minutes I felt the urgent need to get back to my table before a portal slammed shut and I was trapped in 1952. It’s not an experience I’d want every night, any more than I could regularly afford to pay $32 for a burger or $37 for chicken hash. But I’ll be back, because I have enough regrets already. I regret all the songs I could have belted out around the piano at Bill’s Gay Nineties. I regret the nights I didn’t tune in to hear the huge mahogany doors on Danny Stiles’s Art Deco penthouse swing shut as Mr. Stiles bid all his radio listeners “Good night, dear hearts.” I regret the rides I didn’t take on Checker cabs while they still prowled the avenues. I don’t want to add “21” to the list.",‘21’ Club in Manhattan,"['reader', 'look', 'forward', 'dark', 'thrill', 'public', 'execution', 'day', 'star', 'attached', 'column', 'turn', 'elsewhere',

242,Nougatine at Jean Georges,★★,2012-09-04,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/05/dining/reviews/nougatine-at-jean-georges-in-manhattan.html,Upper West Side,"YES, Nougatine. You didn’t forget about it, did you? I hope not. So does Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who established it 15 years ago as the easygoing bistro next door to the demure elegance of Jean Georges, Audrey Tautou to the flagship’s Catherine Deneuve. Since then, New Yorkers have come to rely on Nougatine at Jean Georges, to give the name that nobody ever uses, for working lunches that could be expensed without waking up the auditors, yet they also tended to take it for granted. It has never been reviewed before in The New York Times, and it rarely comes up in conversations about favorite Vongerichten restaurants, although it is one of the most dependable. Part of the trouble is that it can be hard to say just what kind of place Nougatine is. There’s that slightly embarrassing name, which suggests a shop that sells chocolates or lingerie or maybe both. There’s the menu, roaming from burgers and fries to foie gras with a hotel-lobby inclusiveness. But the biggest reason Nougatine never quite emerged from the long shadow of its sister may have been its design, meant originally as a hotel lounge. Particularly after Jean Georges was brought up to date by the architect Thomas Juul-Hansen several years ago, Nougatine resembled an afterthought. It was as if Nougatine were meant to make the diners who passed through on their way to Jean Georges feel better about what they were about to spend, the way a glimpse past the curtains into the shantytown in the back of a plane reassures first-class passengers. Then in April, Mr. Vongerichten brought Mr. Juul-Hansen in to redo everything but the floors. Suddenly, Nougatine feels like a destination. It’s a livelier, more kinetic space than Jean Georges; there’s a long, mail-slot window into the kitchen where you can see the cooks, and often Mr. Vongerichten. A mirror right above the mail slot, and another window behind the cooks that looks out on Broadway, roughly doubles the energy at that end of the room. Gone now are the blocky woven-back chairs and the lounge tables that looked as if they’d been left behind by a percussionist on his way to a drum circle in Central Park. The furniture is more graceful now, with echoes of Charles and Ray Eames in the creamy leather chairs and walnut tabletops. There’s a bit of Rat Pack-era verve; the skinny pendant lights above the bar even look like smoldering cigarettes. (Nougatine’s newfound glamour is weakest at the low and awkward tables along the wall between the bar and the kitchen; after the hosts recognized me, they went to some lengths to avoid seating me there.) Despite Nougatine’s night-on-the-town gloss, though, the soul of the menu is not far from what you might cook at home — or, to be more realistic, what Mr. Vongerichten might cook if you came to his apartment on Perry Street. If the weather was hot, he might cut open a watermelon, whittle it down to cubes, arrange them in a circle like a pink Stonehenge, and scatter white fluffs of goat cheese all around. This almost preposterously simple appetizer soars above salad-bar level thanks to good green olive oil and a sly kick of cracked white pepper. After that, if you were effusive in your praise of Mr. Vongerichten’s collection of toasters, he might grill you a pork chop, then surround it with fruity habanero sauce made with cherries in early summer, or plums as fall nears. Comfortable as this down-home bone-in chop and this emphatically spicy condiment would feel in a home kitchen, they are almost unimaginable next door at Jean Georges. Nor would any restaurant of Jean Georges’s aspirations send out Nougatine’s massive, handsomely trimmed whole globe artichoke, as imposing as Vitali Klitschko’s fist, and ask you to pull it apart with your hands to dip leaves and bites of heart in a lemony, mustardy chervil mayonnaise. Too bad, because it’s a treat. A few dishes look so casual they seem to have been whipped up by Mr. Vongerichten and his chef de cuisine, Mark Lapico, after a morning run to the farmers’ market, like the crisp chicken breast with summer squash and very gently roasted tomatoes. Does it sound ordinary? Try making it yourself, then go to Nougatine and get back to me. On a menu as wide ranging as Nougatine’s, which must cater to guests in the Trump International Hotel upstairs, there must be a few slackers. I liked the idea of Cantonese-style salt-and-pepper lobster, and the warm cabbage slaw that came with it, more than I liked the chewy lobster meat itself. Still, that was a better use for the shellfish than the “lobster burger,” interred, bizarrely, under green chile mayonnaise and a blanket of melted Gruyère. And if a French-born chef serves fries, you expect more than the pale and not terribly crunchy ones at Nougatine. (For a refresher in how to cook a potato, look no further than the spectacularly crisped wedges that come with a good but unthrilling strip loin.) Since Johnny Iuzzini stepped down as pastry chef at Nougatine and Jean Georges last year, a successor, Joseph Murphy, has been settling in. His straightforward, American touch was most assured in an impressively fluffy sour cream cheesecake and in a group of ice cream sandwiches. But scraps of dough on a peach cobbler were pasty and floury, and I could never get a perfect spoonful out of a bowl of bland butterscotch pudding with heavily salted crème fraîche and bittersweet caramel. (Recent desserts at Jean Georges suggested that the changeover isn’t seamless there, either.) The redesign did nothing to change Nougatine’s weak spot, the wide runway to Jean Georges that cuts the dining room in half. Some intimacy and liveliness are lost, but something is gained, too: a front-row seat to the lavishly dressed parade of pilgrims. There are the gastrotourists, set to document the entire meal in photos; there are out-of-towners whose one big splurge this will be; there are women whose dresses and heels make you wonder exactly how long ago they met their dates. And then the parade is over, and the little dining room returns to normal. Like all successful restaurants in the grand old style, Jean Georges belongs to the world. But Nougatine belongs to New York.",Nougatine at Jean Georges in Manhattan,"['yes', 'nougatine', 'didn’t', 'forget', 'hope', 'jeangeorges', 'vongerichten', 'established', 'year', 'ago', 'easygoing',

243,Rosemary's ,★,2012-08-28,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/dining/reviews/rosemarys-in-greenwich-village.html,West Village,"IN restaurants, as in high school, popularity can be a burden. Just ask the host at Rosemary’s who was cheerfully trying to marshal the wildly oversubscribed waiting list the other night. (The list has been oversubscribed pretty much continuously since the restaurant opened in June.) In the kindest possible way, she tried to dissuade one member of my party from adding his name. Under strict orders from me, my emissary insisted, and finally succeeded. He was asked to come back in an hour. My group of three passed the next 60 minutes very agreeably in a bar down the street, and we returned at the appointed time. Our host apologized and said there was a group lingering over drinks at the table she’d meant for us, so we would need to wait just a little longer. And we did, standing out front, watching Villagers strut past the corner of West 10th Street and Greenwich Avenue. That was agreeable, too, for a while. But its delights were wearing thin 25 minutes later, when the host came out to say that the lingerers were still lingering. There was one table ready now, though. It was usually a two-top, she said with a wince, but since we’d been standing so long perhaps we’d like to take it? She was doing her best, but the whole situation could have been avoided, thanks to a miraculous advance in technology. Although it may sound like science fiction, a remarkable new device has the potential to change the way we communicate. It is small enough to fit in the palm of your hand yet powerful enough to enable you to place and receive calls wherever you happen to be — even inside a bar. Yes, the “cellular telephone,” or “cellphone” for short, is real, and it is available now. One day, the owners of Rosemary’s may discover that this futuristic gadget can be a handy method of notifying customers when a table is ready. At the moment, they seem to have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. There are reasons to put up with the list at the door, if not the restaurant’s technophobic method of handling it. First among them is the spirited cooking of Wade Moises, who learned to move gracefully around a scalding pot of spaghetti at Mario Batali’s finishing school. You can spot some of the headmaster’s knack for energetic flavors in Rosemary’s linguine, tossed with preserved lemon and threads of hot pickled chiles. I’ve never met a dish of pasta more deeply infused with the sunny brightness of citrus. Nearly as satisfying, but in a richer, porkier mode, was the chitarra alla carbonara with meaty strips of guanciale. But with just four pastas on the menu, there should be no room for disappointments like the gummy house-made cavatelli with starchy, crunchy peas. Mr. Moises is adept at working vegetables and seafood into antipasti that bring your appetite to attention. With a spicy dressing of grated pecorino and pickled onions, he can make a treat out of slices of raw zucchini, typically as thrilling as an ice chip. The house-cured tuna is more voluptuous than cooked tuna has any right to be, and cold shrimp tossed with mint, jalapeño and ginger shows Mr. Moises knows when to color outside the lines. At nearly every table, some wise person has ordered the porchettina, sawed-off columns of brined and roasted pork loin standing upright like the ruins of a Roman temple. The main-course-size minestra di stagione didn’t seem to tempt as many diners, but it should. On the night I tasted it, elbow macaroni shared the bowl with sugar snap peas, young turnips, asparagus as thin as a knitting needle, purple carrots and cherry tomatoes, each vegetable cooked to its ideal point, all of them in a vegetable broth that was gentle but persuasive. The menu bills it as “the ultimate minestrone,” and the hyperbole is not far from the mark. The cherry tomatoes in the soup, along with the ones in a very pretty tomato salad, were ripened in the Greenwich Village sun that beats down on a kitchen garden on the roof. The restaurant’s owner, Carlos Suarez, who also runs BoBo nearby, seems rather proud of this. The words “Rooftop Farm” are printed on the menu, right below the name, and servers always mention the provenance of those tomatoes. Most of the produce could have been procured at any farmers’ market, but the urban agrarian notion does seem to have provided a theme for the décor. The interiors firm Dekar Design flirts with rustic-Italian clichés without falling too hard for them. Parquet tables sit on parquet floors below exposed rafters; glass doors are thrown wide open in warm weather; potted plants are everywhere. The place has the feel of a trellised patio in some corner of Italy that’s heavily populated by Upper East Siders, the women wearing expensive rings, the men wearing even more expensive watches. I skulked through this slender crowd feeling like a beagle among greyhounds. Many of those greyhounds look as if they could afford to pay far more than Rosemary’s asks: each vegetable antipasto is $5; the pastas are $14 or less. Given the quality, these are impressively low prices, and they provide another possible justification for the lines. There are exceptions, though. One is the bistecca gran mela for two, a dry-aged strip steak served on the bone, for $80. It isn’t nearly as flavorful as the skirt steak, which provides a much more pronounced beefiness and, at $22, costs about half as much for a serving. Rosemary’s wine list has a gimmick that seems to promise good deals: there are 40 wines, all for $40. That price feels comfortable until you find out how many of those wines can be picked up in stores for $12 or less. (If you want a reasonable return on your $40, try the 2010 Lia Vi Barbera d’Asti from Carussin; the 2009 Marzemino from Costaripa; or the 2007 Capitel Foscarino from Anselmi.) If I felt some chagrin at paying $40 for the kinds of bottles that might be opened at an office party, most of it melted away under the influence of the summer breezes and the servers’ ready smiles. Just think how charming Rosemary’s could be if it took reservations or, failing that, if cellphones ever catch on.",Rosemary’s in Greenwich Village,"['high', 'school', 'popularity', 'burden', 'ask',

244,La Vara,★★,2012-08-21,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/dining/reviews/la-vara-in-cobble-hill-brooklyn-restaurant-review.html,Cobble Hill,"APPEARANCES count in food, but great cooking is sometimes hard to spot at first glance. When they arrive at the table, there is nothing prepossessing about the fried artichokes served at La Vara, a four-month-old Spanish restaurant in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn. I took one look and thought, O.K., fried artichokes. I know what these are all about. So what was it that made me want to betray my friends by creating a diversion (Hey, out there on Clinton Street! Is that Martin Amis?) so I could polish them off all by myself? It clearly has something to do with the way all the luxuriously soft qualities of confited artichokes are wrapped inside those crunchy fried leaves and hearts, and just as much to do with that sauce, a creamy aioli with force-multiplying jabs of anchovy. Nor did I swoon at the arrival of La Vara’s fideuà, thin noodles cooked paella fashion in a seafood broth. Brown, broken and floppy, the noodles look like a halfhearted attempt to disguise last night’s pasta. All leftovers should fare so well. Surrounded by tiny squid, clams and shrimp, cooked until done and not an instant longer, the fideuà tastes a little like toasted durum wheat and a lot like the dripping-wet haul from a Valencian fishing net. La Vara is the newest vessel in the small and nimble Spanish armada commanded by Alex Raij and her husband and co-chef, Eder Montero. Txikito and El Quinto Pino in Manhattan, which make up the rest of their fleet, have done much to broaden the range of Spanish flavors in the city. With La Vara, Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero are exploring new territory, the vast legacy of the Jews and Muslims who shared the Iberian Peninsula with Christians for centuries. This three-way marriage, known as la convivencia, had its tensions, and the breakup was ugly, but it did wonderful things for the country’s kitchens. Its imprint on Spain’s cuisine isn’t always evident. La Vara urges, and rewards, a closer inspection. During their long rule of Spain, as Claudia Roden writes in “The Food of Spain,” the Muslims introduced ingredients that remain staples, like rice, artichokes, eggplants, bitter oranges, cumin and saffron. They brought skewers, noodles (fideuà comes from an Arabic word for pasta, al-fidawsh), the shatteringly crisp savory pastries known as bricks and chickpea-spinach stews. All are on offer at La Vara. I’m not convinced that sweet-and-savory chopped greens with pine nuts and currants are the ideal stuffing for a brick. But grilled chicken hearts made plenty of sense on a skewer, and while they could have been more tender, their pepper, caraway and coriander seed seasoning was inviting, as was the herb salad alongside, vibrant with lime. Another gift from the Moors was deep-fried fish, a term that doesn’t suggest just how delicious the long ribbons of fried, marinated, pimentón-dusted skate called raya en adobo turn out to be. But is La Vara good for the Jews? The history of Jewish cooking in Spain is fraught, to put it mildly, especially after 1492, when Ferdinand and Isabella compelled the Jews to convert or leave the kingdom. Converts were often watched for suspiciously pork-free kitchens and smoke-free chimneys on the Sabbath. Forced into hiding, Spanish-Jewish cuisine virtually disappeared. Traces remain, though, and Ms. Raij and Mr. Montero have excavated some of them. Those fried artichokes, for instance, may remind you of the carciofi alla giudea placed in the Roman repertory by Sephardic Jews. One of La Vara’s two best desserts is an almond cake called Torta de Santiago. Thought to be Jewish in origin, it survived in, of all places, Catholic convents. Understandably, La Vara skips the cake’s traditional ornament, a cross outlined in sugar. (The other standout is the Egipcio, an improved Pop-Tart with date-and-walnut paste inside an exquisitely tender semolina shortbread.) The restaurant doesn’t force-feed you any of this history, not in menu footnotes or in carefully memorized tableside lectures. What most people will notice is simply how inviting the place is behind its glass storefront, brick walls glowing under white light, and how it manages to feel intimate without feeling cramped. At any given table, the plates are scattered all over, because La Vara serves most things as small tapas-size dishes.  Sometimes this works and sometimes it doesn’t. If the bar isn’t crowded and time isn’t tight, you could certainly stop for a glass of fino sherry and crunch on a dish of excellent fried chickpeas, a marvelously crisp and creamy croqueta or a single oil-cured sardine under sliced radish pickles. But the pleasures of eating tapas-style can get lost at a table for four, where you may find that just as you realize how much you’re enjoying a dish, the person next to you has managed to stab the last forkful. (See the Amis stratagem, above.) When will New York restaurants stop peddling the myth of “small plates meant for sharing”? Small plates are meant for hoarding. This might be why the most satisfying meal I had here was at a table for two. (If you have eaten out in the last decade, you can guess that while the prices at La Vara may seem low, the check won’t.) In truth, I was content to let others finish a few items at La Vara, including the strange stewed bacon sandwiches, the thin and meek ajo blanco with strands of squid, and the braised beef tongue in a watery tomato-caper sauce. But such dishes were far outnumbered by the ones I competed avidly for. If the griddled red shrimp came 12 to an order instead of 2, I could have eaten them all, and sucked the bittersweet juice from the head of each one. And I need to return for a second run at the pasta called gurullos, if only to figure out how any pasta can be as fluffy as an Italian grandmother’s prizewinning gnocchi. La Vara, by the way, was the name of a Jewish newspaper published in New York until it ceased in 1948. It was written in Ladino, a Castilian-Hebrew hybrid that was to Spain what Yiddish was to Eastern Europe. The language has all but vanished from the city, but it remains on the headstones of Sephardic graveyards in Queens and the Bronx, out in plain sight for those who know where to look.","La Vara in

245,Biang!,★,2012-08-14,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/15/dining/reviews/biang-nyc-restaurant-review.html,Flushing,"IF you are one of those people who believes that ingredients should always be treated with respect, by all means stay away from Biang!, an excitable name for a frequently exciting new restaurant in Flushing, Queens. Before they arrive in the dining room, the biang biang noodles, a specialty of the house and its namesake, are punished in ways that might have unnerved the Spanish Inquisition. They are repeatedly swung up and down through the air, slapped on a table, ripped right down the center and then dropped in boiling water. After handling like that, the final application of searing chile oil must come as a relief. When you eat those noodles, you might suffer, too, but only for a minute. Even if you have little fear of spices, the chile oil can bead your forehead with perspiration and make you blink back tears. Then you emerge on the other side, wide awake and energized, and you understand that the abuse in the kitchen helped make those noodles that much more fun to eat. All that swinging and slapping stretches them until they are so long that when you lift one from the bowl to your mouth, it seems to go on forever, like a magician’s handkerchief. Even better, ripping the noodles gives them ragged edges that hang on to any nearby sauce. You will want to hang on to those sauces, too. The one called “spicy and tingly beef with wide hand-ripped noodles” brings the hypnotic pairing of chiles and Sichuan peppercorn to bits of deeply concentrated braised beef. “Spicy and sour diced pork meat,” meanwhile, is a sauce that revels in oppositions: the sharp edge of black vinegar versus the supple fattiness of pork, the soothing spice-cake flavor of star anise against the fury of roasted dried chiles. Then there is the biang biang dish that almost everyone gets, lamb noodles seasoned with longhorn peppers and with cumin so intensely fragrant that it seems to penetrate every taste bud you have. Like everything at Biang!, the lamb noodles are a specialty of Xian, the ancient city in central China. The recipes come from David Shi, a native of Xian, who recreated them from his memories of cooking with his grandfather before moving to the United States in 1998. Biang! is essentially a cleaner, brighter, more modern sit-down version of Mr. Shi’s food stall inside the Golden Shopping Mall, an extremely ramshackle food court on Main Street in Flushing. He named the stall Xi’an Famous Foods. This may have been wishful thinking at first, when as far as most New Yorkers were concerned, Xian was famous only as the home base of the emperor who ordered up an army of terra-cotta soldiers and horses to keep him company after his death, in 210 B.C. But famous is what the food of Xi’an became, and quickly, because Mr. Shi’s cooking was so vibrant and his recipes so novel to customers who did not grow up in China. His menu was drawn from all over Xian. Lamb soup came from the Muslim Quarter. The biang biang noodles are served in innumerable casual shops. Another noodle, called liang pi, is a street food as common in Xian as the hot dog in Manhattan, said Mr. Shi’s son, Jason Wang. Cool, smooth, chewy ribbons of steamed wheat starch, liang pi are tossed with wrinkled tablets of house-made seitan and a head-clearing dose of stoplight-red chile oil. As Xi’an Famous Foods accrued a following, Mr. Wang, then a business student in college, began to help his father. He set up a Web site and led an expansion into Manhattan, where there are now three branches. Biang! is their latest move forward, a place where people Mr. Wang’s age might be happy to hang out and eat dishes that their grandparents would remember. The menu at Xi’an Famous Foods is the template of the one at Biang!, with some additions. There is now a whole page of skewers, like grilled cumin lamb and tofu skin (surprisingly flavorful in a nutty sauce of fermented tofu and sesame paste). The standout skewer, though, holds one meaty grilled chicken wing with salty, peppery, crunchy skin and sweet, smoky flesh. The other skewers cost $3 for three; the wings are $2 each. Laudably, the prices as Biang! follow the heroically low ones at Xi’an Famous Foods, a nice surprise considering how much more attractive the space is. Mr. Wang designed it, liberally taking cues from downtown Manhattan places like the Momofuku restaurants. Light comes from hanging Edison bulbs, and you sit on polished wood benches at polished wood tables. There are tunes by Beyoncé and Kanye West, and enigmatic propaganda-style prints of pandas by the Singapore artist William Chua. The transition from stall to restaurant has not been seamless. The servers’ notions of what it means to clear a table may not coincide with your own, and the kitchen can appear to struggle with the pace. One night, spaghetti-like strands of cold buckwheat noodles with cilantro and scallions were doused with mercilessly pungent mustard oil that stampeded its way into nasal passages I didn’t know I had. On another visit, I could barely taste the mustard oil. My suggested strategy is to order an extra dish or two, just in case. Get the cold tofu in chile oil with pickled vegetables and get the crisp, zippily dressed lotus root salad. Get the improbably elegant canapés of rough-hewn pork sausage topped with fried quail eggs, and by all means get the juicy lamb dumplings in hot-and-sour broth. And even though they are served on a bun without much flavor of its own, get either the cumin lamb sandwiches or, even better, the chopped pork belly sandwiches. In my case, the order-too-much strategy ended when dessert began. A cold egg drop soup made with fermented rice was vaguely beery and very peculiar, like a home brewer’s first batch. The one sweet I truly enjoyed was steamed sticky rice with sesame seeds and jujubes, which are not the jaw-fatigue-inducing candy, but fruits that look like olives and taste a little like dates. (Watch the pits, though.) There are many ways to adapt the cuisine of immigrants to a new country. But the father-and-son team at Biang! have hit on a model worth imitating: keep the recipes and the prices the same, and buy nicer furniture.",Biang!,"['people', 'belief', 'ingredient', 'always',

246,Nicoletta,0 star,2012-08-07,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/08/dining/reviews/nicoletta-nyc-restaurant-review.html,East Village,"IN an earlier, more primitive era, chefs with an entrepreneurial urge believed that success began with a delicious product. If you cooked something that enough people wanted to eat, you could build an empire that might one day span the country. First, though, you needed 11 secret herbs and spices. You needed special sauce. You needed Hot Doughnuts Now. It all sounds rather quaint. Thanks to the rise of celebrity chefs, restaurant empires have as much need for a great product as they do for spittoons and a separate ladies’ entrance. To see this new model in action, you need only study Nicoletta, the pizzeria opened in the East Village in June by the chef Michael White and his business partner, Ahmass Fakahany. It was already clear in March that Nicoletta was to be the first of several places rolled out from the same batch of dough. “We are developing distinct brands where we can open multiple restaurants, lowering costs as we go,” Mr. Fakahany told a reporter at the time as he explained how practices from his former career as a high-flying executive at Merrill Lynch were helping him wring extra profit from his restaurants. Nicoletta had been in the works for some time. In December, the two had filed a liquor license application for a corporation known as “Letta # 1 LLC,” a name that had been registered with the State of New York six months earlier. Marble tables were designed and fabricated, each with a spring-loaded socket in its top. The sockets can anchor pedestals that hold the pizzas several inches off the table. As for the product on the pedestal, apparently that could wait. About a week before the opening, by some reports, Mr. White was changing his pizza dough recipe almost day by day. He was talking about 12- and 16-inch pies cut in squares, in the style of his home state, Wisconsin. By the time hosts in Nicoletta T-shirts were stationed out on the sidewalk with clipboards to manage the people willing to wait 90 minutes or more for a table, pies were being cut into the usual wedges, and the 16-inch pizza was history. As it turns out, even the smaller size may be too much. The servers will tell you that it feeds two people. That may be true if both people are running a marathon the next morning. I was never able to finish one, even with two or three hungry assistants at the table. Some of this is because of sheer mass. Nicoletta’s pizzas are not quite deep dish, but they are heading in that direction. The crust is as strong as epoxy, and Mr. White piles it up with an abundance of toppings that would buckle an ordinary pie. In thickness and heft, a Nicoletta pizza resembles the September issue of Vogue. There was another reason my table never finished an entire pizza: we lost interest. The style of pizza Mr. White is pursuing emphasizes gut-stretching abundance over flavor. The pies are overburdened conglomerations of cheese, flour and fistfuls of other stuff; in the end, the elements cancel one another out. In the Fior di Zucca, zucchini blossoms and watery shredded zucchini were completely engulfed by an ankle-deep carpet of melted mozzarella. It was a vegetable pizza for people who hate vegetables. Not that the addition of undercooked Nueske’s bacon brought much relief to the bleak expanse of starch created by the layer of smashed potatoes on top of the Patatona. Other combinations were more promising, like the Calabrese, with excellent fennel sausage and curly divots of spicy pepperoni, or the Carbonara, the pasta classic reimagined in pizza form. But that great shelf of crust deadens the taste of any ingredient that gets near it. Mr. White has said he engineered the dough to stand up to the rigors of delivery and reheating with no loss of quality. In that, at least, he has succeeded. Warmed up a day or two later, a Nicoletta crust is just as stiff and bland as when it was fresh from the oven. Pizza hunters with long memories will recall another pizzeria founded by an acclaimed chef whose pizza was met, at first, with skepticism. A decade ago, Mario Batali’s Otto opened with pizzas that were griddled, not baked. At first, they were not encouraging. The dough was tweaked and tweaked again, but in the meantime you could have a wonderful time at Otto without eating a single slice. The menu offered many other diversions, including full-flavored vegetables, robust pastas, a wine list built for Italy-hopping, and Meredith Kurtzman’s array of gelati, which won cult status and deserved it. Nicoletta has a far less elaborate gelato menu than Otto’s. There is only one flavor, a house-made vanilla soft serve called fior di latte, but it was consistently the high point of my meals. Creamy and easygoing, it never failed to make me smile, whether topped with amarena cherries, drizzled with blueberry limoncello or left undecorated. Nicoletta would be a pleasant place to stop for ice cream if only the staff didn’t seem to expect you to order some of the other food first. But they do, and it’s not an uplifting experience, even if you steady yourself with a glass of red wine poured too cold from a tap. The pizzas, at least, don’t resemble anything else in New York. The salad recipes might have been nabbed from that corner trattoria you stopped going to a few years ago. There is the Nicoletta, with lettuce, red endive and a sliver of focaccia smeared with goat cheese. Or the insalata mare with clams, mussels, squid and octopus, all as tender as an extension cord, all bathed in a dressing that had no effect on any of it. The snacks and appetizers can have an off-the-rack quality as well. Tender as the meatballs were, is the city really suffering from a shortage? Nice surprises did pop up now and again, like the suppli fortified with ragù and the cucumbers pickled in white balsamic vinegar that were good enough to sell by the jar. But on the whole, what is striking about Nicoletta is how little evidence it gives of Mr. White’s prodigious talent for cooking Italian food that can make you dizzy with pleasure. He has overseen five restaurants that were awarded three stars in The New York Times: Fiamma, Alto, Convivio, Marea and Ai Fiori. (The last two are still open.) After a run like that, it must have been tempting to think that great pizza would materialize on command.

247,Reynard,★,2012-07-31,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/01/dining/reviews/reynard-in-williamsburg-brooklyn-restaurant-review.html,Williamsburg,"AMONG summer vegetables, okra is not a heartthrob. If green zebra tomatoes and white nectarines are the romantic leads, the part of okra is a cameo played by Willem Dafoe. For those wise to its unconventional charms, though, even an okra cameo can be memorable. That was the case the other night at Reynard, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. I was eating an excellent piece of wahoo, which the kitchen treated as something like a cross between swordfish and albacore, grilling it to medium rare and slicing it into generous slabs. Beside it was the kind of salad you could eat all summer long: cool faro and bulgur, green herbs, agreeably sugary tomatoes and long green spears that I mistook at first for green beans. In fact, they were young okra pods halved lengthwise and quickly tossed on a searing grill. Okra holds its own under forceful heat, while a meek flame will melt it into a swamp of goo. This heat, and this okra, had something extra: a fleck of char and a lick of smoke from a wood fire. This treatment may not turn okra into a box-office draw, but it was still pretty cool, in a Dafoe kind of way. It also showed off what’s best about Reynard, where nearly everything that comes out of the kitchen is chosen by hand and cooked with firewood. Chosen by hand means that the chef, Sean Rembold, has a farmer who will pick baby okra pods when they’re the size of an AAA battery. He has a fishmonger who can deliver bluefish yanked from the sea so recently, it can be served ceviche-style with smoked crème fraîche. Mr. Rembold may have a forager, or he may just hang out in Williamsburg’s few remaining vacant lots, because one night he was serving milkweed leaves, as thick and soft as pappardelle. Reynard, which opened not long ago on the ground floor of the new Wythe Hotel in Williamsburg, can get a little “Portlandia” at times. Andrew Tarlow, who built the restaurant and is a partner in the hotel, carries a briefcase of leather tanned from the hide of a cow that once passed through his butcher shop, Marlow & Daughters. “We have relationships with everyone from our sheep farmers to our coffee roasters,” he told a reporter recently. One night, a server at Reynard said that the Mast Brothers had already been in. (“They sat at that table over there,” she said.) The Masts, two chocolate makers with Smith Brothers beards, may be more famous locally than the cast of “Girls.” I wondered whether any customers, on being informed that the elegantly composed layer cake is made with Mast Brothers chocolate, had ever asked, “Who?” “No.” You might be tempted to roll your eyes at how perfectly Reynard would fit into a novel about the Brooklyn dining scene until you remember that Mr. Tarlow helped write the book. In 1998, with a partner he had met waiting tables at the Odeon and a chef who had trained at Savoy, he took over a failed diner down the street from Peter Luger and renamed it Diner. Next came Marlow & Sons, where Mr. Rembold was the sous-chef and later, the chef. The restaurants helped a style of cooking that had started to seem not quite flashy enough for Manhattan — scruffy, devoutly local, indebted as much to Berkeley, Calif., as to France and Italy — establish itself as the common language of chefs from Greenpoint to Ditmas Park. Happily for him and for us, Mr. Rembold has something most of those chefs don’t. Reynard’s kitchen was built so that almost everything can be cooked with fire. Sit in the rear dining room, with its tiled floor and soaring raftered ceilings that make it look like the set of a play about Balthazar being staged in an abandoned factory, and you can see the rigs at work. If you keep a fishbowl-size grill on your fire escape, you may writhe in envy as you watch one cook working at tongs’ length from leaping flames on a grill as big as a coffee table and another stashing skillets at eye level inside a wood-burning oven. Reynard’s hoods must be powered by jet engines because you don’t smell smoke at your table until you get close to your food. Then you can’t miss it. You can savor the smoke in the round oven-roasted clams, oysters and mussels served, with their juices, over thin toast slices. You can appreciate the way it turns grilled leaves of romaine lettuce with bread crumbs into a Caesar salad that has a beguiling edge of char. It burrows all the way through a roasted duck breast, making every scrap of meat worth whittling away from the bones. Smoke even has its way with the dessert course. If you are one of those jaded creatures who has grown weary of tarte Tatin, then the grilled and caramelized peaches in the version here may revive you. One day the skill with which the kitchen handles fire may carry over to the rest of its work more reliably. I hope so, because several dishes missed their mark by mere inches. A melon salad came close to being a sweet ode to summer, but it turned sour thanks to sharp and briny pickled jalapeños. Croutons saturated by brown butter made an otherwise lovely main course of rock shrimp too rich to finish. And lobster with vanilla sauce lacked the confidence that was needed to resurrect this nouvelle cuisine landmark. Some of this can be attributed to the strain of changing the menu nearly every day. So can the servers’ occasional fogginess about just what, exactly, is on the plates. Their jobs might be easier if they didn’t have to memorize a catalog of unlisted specials, a pointless affectation from a place that prints the date at the top of the menu. (By day, when light filters through enormous windows, Reynard offers breakfast and lunch, with far fewer choices.) Diner and Marlow & Sons have their off nights, too, but somehow their small scale and obvious eccentricity conspire so that it hardly matters. Reynard feels more serious and self-conscious, as if trying to prove that Williamsburg has come of age. And yet Diner, circa 1998, could not have built a cellar of offbeat and affordable French wines as deep as the one Lee Campbell has built at Reynard, or found enough customers to drink them. Growing older does have compensations.",Reynard in Brooklyn: Restaurant Review,"['among', 'summer', 'vegetable', 'okra', 'heartthrob', 'green', 'zebra', 'tomato', 'white', 'nectarine', 'romantic',

248,Atera,★★★,2012-07-17,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/18/dining/reviews/atera-in-tribeca.html,TriBeCa,"MATTHEW LIGHTNER has funny ideas about snacks. That is his name for the flurry of little bites that kick off each of the tasting menus at Atera, the remarkable new countertop-dining restaurant in TriBeCa where Mr. Lightner is the chef. One of them looks like an engorged, rhinoceros-gray potato chip and tastes like something scraped off a rock. That’s what it turned out to be: lichen found in the woods near Bear Mountain, pulverized and reconstituted. Another night, there was a bitter and stringy clump of fried garlic roots, about as rewarding as eating a broom. A facsimile peanut made with foie gras and peanut butter wasn’t as good as an actual peanut, and a facsimile egg shaped from aioli wasn’t as good as an actual egg. After a few more such mouthfuls, I decided that, if I were ever invited to a Super Bowl party at Mr. Lightner’s house, I’d bring the guacamole. Yet, when snack time was over and the core of the menu began, something remarkable happened. A kitchen that had seemed willfully strange began to use strangeness as a key to unlock sensations and emotions. Irritation and bafflement yielded to a steady sense of wonder. Wonder is not on the menu at most restaurants in New York, nor is it much in demand in this relentlessly pragmatic city. Wylie Dufresne and Paul Liebrandt are among the small corps of chefs busy keeping Manhattan supplied with new inventions. But on the whole, novelty-seeking adventurers have looked to Spain, to Scandinavia, to Chicago and to northern California. Mr. Lightner opened Atera in March after winning a national reputation at Castagna in Portland, Ore., and cooking at Noma in Denmark and Mugaritz in the Basque Country, poking around in their cabinets of curiosities. He touched down in New York’s hermetic environment, trailing wild ideas from the West Coast and Europe like alien spores. With a counter perch at one of the 13 unexpectedly comfortable high chairs of soft leather (there are another five a few steps away, at a table beside a shaggy vertical garden), you watch the cooks bent over their work, silent and solemn. At this stage, there is not much cooking. Mostly they are arranging food on fresh hay, or moss, or slate, or polished wood, or smooth riverbed stones, or buffed lengths of bark. Nearly every arrangement ends with the tweezered application of oddball plants: glasswort, crunchy beach pea pods, violets, bright green tips of spruce branches, wisteria or black locust blossoms. Watching all of this unfold, some have portrayed Mr. Lightner as a woodsy forager come to town, Euell Gibbons on Worth Street. Others, remembering his liquid nitrogen and powdered gelling agents, have seen a geeky science-club member, giddy over his chemistry set. In truth, he is a little of each. One of his plates may hold a modernist bauble next to a specimen from the forest floor. At Atera, foraging and modernist techniques are two roads to the same destination. Whether he is fussing over a corsage of edible wildflowers or tinting a baguette with squid ink to fashion a copy of a razor clam, Mr. Lightner is opening our eyes again to how busy nature has been. He seems to be feeling his way toward an articulated, poetic response to the seasons that is something like a modern Western version of kaiseki. In Mr. Lightner’s hands, pear skin can be dried into a crinkly green leaf to drape over squab. Sunflower toffee can look like a peach pit, and chocolate truffle like a black walnut shell. In his eyes, there is beauty in homeliness. A charred lump of beet looked as if it had been left too long in a campfire by a distracted Boy Scout. Sliced open and displayed against a luxurious shellfish cream and trout roe, its flesh radiated a purple so deep it was almost black. And there can be contrast in sameness. With one dish he brought on a sudden whiteout: Atlantic halibut, poached in and sauced with whey, with camomile petals scattered on top and pickled garlic cloves here and there. You don’t see so many shades of white side by side unless you’re comparing paint chips. Mr. Lightner is his own pastry chef, and many of his desserts are spectacular. In late spring there were cookies mimicking oak leaves with spindly breadstick stems; July brought a white rose made of frozen rosewater. It glowed as if there were an LED encased inside it. “It’s beautiful,” I said involuntarily. In fact, Mr. Lightner may have more aptitude for desserts than savory courses; he is fascinated by sculpture and unafraid of prettiness. At the moment, too, he may be more adept at expressing his ideas through sight than taste. Careful to vary the look of each course, he does not always do the same with flavors and textures, sending out several dishes in a row with frozen or half-frozen elements, for instance. With many of the snacks, an urge to show off trumps a desire to please. That urge leads to a silly guessing game, in which one of the extremely polite and rather earnest servers challenges you to name the main ingredient in one dish. When I found out it was air-dried squid, I felt like a child who had just opened a gift-wrapped package of socks. Mr. Lightner may need time to sort out all of the ideas ricocheting around his head. (Amid the moss and fronds, the laboratory culture tubes used to dispense sauces stick out like a remnant from the early days of molecular gastronomy.) At times, his food can’t live up to its striking first impression. A lobe of sweetbreads was glazed in a savory hazelnut caramel that wasn’t really savory enough. Lumpfish roe in a sourdough slurry seemed to be aiming for a taramosalata effect, but it didn’t have the same briny pungency, and the fish eggs were distractingly grainy. The menu changes often enough, reservations are scarce enough, and the $150 price tag before tax, tip and drinks is daunting enough, that you’re unlikely to eat the same meal twice. But if you do, you’ll understand why magicians never repeat a trick. Atera could stand to serve a few more dishes whose flavors are thrilling enough to stand on their own once the novelty is gone. It is well on the way already with stunners like the beet ember, with its deeply pleasing interplay of earthy and oceanic flavors. Or, in a gentler but equally transfixing mode, the raw scallops cured in gin botanicals and then interwoven with shards of green-tomato ice. And a handful of wet, crisp green almonds with milk skin and fresh almond milk exhibited no trickery, just a sensitive and joyful celebration of an ingredient that is gone from the market almost before it arrives. Seasonal cooking has often meant a narrow devotion to simplicity. Mr. Lightner is chasing another path, a cuisine that uses this-week-only ingredients together with technical sleight of hand to summon up moments of genuine beauty. It doesn’t all come together yet, but it comes close enough that a night at Atera is now one of the most fascinating experiences you can have in a New York City restaurant.",Atera in

249,Almayass,★,2012-07-10,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/11/dining/reviews/almayass-in-manhattan-restaurant-review.html,Flatiron,"ANY time a server in Manhattan informs you that “all our food is served family style,” you can be certain that the dining room will be notably free of actual families. Platters that might feed two children and their parents are more likely to languish before a herd of bachelors and bachelorettes, who will reflexively hoist forks to their mouths while getting drunk on cocktails invented by publicists. I found myself wondering where all the family restaurants have gone while spending time at Almayass, which opened this spring on East 21st Street, a few steps from the gang-grazing mess halls of lower Park Avenue. Every time I ate there I saw enormous tables covered with lemony hummus, yogurt-coated eggplant dolmas and canapés of spiced meats under quail’s-egg bull’s-eyes, and at least one of those tables would be swarmed by a large clan, from grandparents to their children to their children’s tiny infants taking a turn on one shoulder after another. This was unusual enough in that part of town; still more striking was that whenever a baby vocalized some urgent complaint, there were no grimaces of infanticidal rage at the other tables. Or on the faces of the people working there, several of them members of the Alexandrian family. Rita and Shant Alexandrian, the children of Armenians who fled the 1915 purge and later settled in Lebanon, operate the original Almayass in Beirut and its spinoffs in Kuwait, Riyadh, Abu Dhabi and Qatar, all of them with Armenian-Lebanese menus shaped by their family history. In fact, family values set the tone for the whole experience of eating at Almayass. At times that is refreshing; occasionally, like one’s own family, it can drive you slightly bananas. One waiter, for instance, played the overbearing uncle. When we asked for suggestions, he wrote down what he thought we should eat. It took some haggling to replace any of his selections with one of our own. Another reminded us of the kind of shiftless cousin who never stays focused. He seemed to forget we were there for vast periods of time. When we had all finished the initial pours of a bottle of white Chateau Musar, one man at our table flagged him down to ask for a refill. The waiter emptied the bottle into his glass, filling it almost to the brim, as the rest of us stared. Although I never determined which servers were related and which were merely in the wrong line of work, there were moments at Almayass when I understood why there are laws against nepotism. Yet sooner or later the table would be spread with food, and sometimes that is enough, especially when the flavors are ones you don’t taste every day. That’s definitely the case at Almayass, where the Alexandrians punch up Lebanese dishes with Armenian accents like lemony grains of crushed red sumac berries and flecks of Aleppo pepper that offer more robust flavor than fiery heat. The restaurant even stages a Manhattan comeback for some Armenian classics. Another question: Where have Armenian restaurants gone? A fixture of the city’s dining scene 50 years ago, they had all but vanished by the end of the last century. Ever since, certain New Yorkers have nursed longings for subereg, a labor-intensive lasagna variant, and basterma, considered by some cured-meat connoisseurs the highest form to which pastrami can aspire. Both desires can be requited at Almayass. One woman at my table hadn’t tasted subereg since the death of an Armenian aunt who was educated in a French convent in Istanbul; she pronounced Almayass’s exquisitely tender and subtle version “right,” if not quite as good as the suberegs of her memories. The tangy and peppery basterma made a strong case for the Armenian charcuterie canon. So did an intense beef salami called soujuk, especially the version topped with sliced lemon and ground sumac, doused with arrack and set on fire at tableside. An Armenian bulgur salad named Itch (how it must hate its parents for that), with chopped herbs and tomatoes, had a red-pepper glow that kept luring me back, once the chill of the refrigerator had worn off. The bulk of the cooking, though, is Lebanese, ranging from terrific dips to less terrific kebabs. Meats and seafood at Almayass tended to be overcooked; grilled prawns one night were so tough that I sliced them with effort and swallowed them with regret. I found only one main course that I truly enjoyed, broiled lamb chops that you pick up by their ribs so you can swab them in a secret Almayass sauce that seems to go into nearly everything, but tasted especially welcome here. The hunting was happier among the small dishes. The salads, like green olives dressed with a spicy tomato sauce and lemon juice, tasted radiant, a Levantine beach-side afternoon beamed down to Flatiron. I would have happily eaten a fistful of the kebbe sajieh, fried pockets of beef and bulgur kneaded together and stuffed with walnuts and pistachios. And while the pita had no charm, that mattered less when it was dunked into dips like the lemony charred eggplant mash called moutabbal; its cousin, moutabbal Almayass, made with beets and tahini; and the mouhammara, a rust-colored paste of walnuts and red pepper that gets its sweet-sour shuffle from pomegranate molasses. Parties of eight or more, and not just multigenerational families, seem drawn to Almayass. In part this is because ordering for that many people lessens the impact of the occasional rogue kebab. (In small-plates restaurants as in insurance, the larger the participating group, the lower the risk to the individual.) But these big tables may also be responding to some kind of secret signal of hospitality sent out by the unmistakably family-run restaurant. One Alexandrian sister, Siran, designed the menus, with their covers of inlaid wood; another, Alidz, watches over the dining room with Varak, her brother; their mother, Rita, chose the sculpture of blue-glass flowers on wire stems and other works by Armenian artists around the interior. Almayass can be frustrating and deeply idiosyncratic at times, but it always feels personal. The Armenian restaurant scene, it turns out, went west, to greater Los Angeles. As for family restaurants, they thrive in the outer boroughs, exiled by the forces of real estate. When somebody dares to open one in Manhattan now, it’s worth marking the event. I’d recommend celebrating with a plate or two of flaming soujuk.",Almayass in Manhattan,"['manhattan', 'informs', '“all', 'family', 'style”', 'certain', 'notably', 'free', 'actual', 'family',

250,Hill Country Barbecue Market,★★,2012-07-03,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/dining/reviews/hill-country-barbecue-market-nyc-restaurant-review.html,Midtown South,"IN the line of duty, I’ve eaten food served on a curl of bark, food served on a slate shingle, food served on the end of a wire, food served in an antique silver caviar caddy and food served in a box of rocks. But for sheer power to send ripples of anticipation through the pit of my belly, none of those vehicles beat the greasy butcher paper at Hill Country Barbecue Market. Whenever I eat at this restaurant on West 26th Street, I head for the meat counter and ask for a pound of moist brisket. If a pound strikes you as too much, then you haven’t had Hill Country’s moist brisket. A counter worker with a long knife tears off a sheet of brown paper and proceeds to bury it under slabs of meat. Beef ribs, too, yes, and some jalapeño-cheese sausages. A couple of those, please. Let’s make it three. When I stop at last, the counter worker grabs the ends of the butcher paper and scrunches them to form a basket filled with smoked meat and serpentine wisps of steam. I carry that basket to my table and set it down in front of my friends, casual as can be. They look amazed, and if they don’t, I rethink the friendship. At the table, the paper is flattened into a communal plate, and I cover one patch of it with seasoned salt. Pink from cayenne and spotted with black pepper grains, the salt goes with brisket better than barbecue sauce. Paper, meat, salt: by now my stomach is in a riot and I am sure I should have ordered two pounds of brisket. Moist brisket on greasy paper is not the only reason to eat at Hill Country, but it’s a convincing one. The term “moist brisket” is the restaurant’s euphemism for the deckle and tip of the brisket, upholstered in fat that will slowly render and baste the meat during the 13 or 14 hours it spends in the smoker. Carved just before serving, the meat is juicy throughout, but the parts that really get me going are the blackened edges that give way to a mahogany-tinted quarter-inch or so of smoky borderland between crust and interior. The moist brisket, along with the beef and pork ribs that carry a similarly peppery, crunchy top layer, show Hill Country’s rotisserie barbecue pits at their finest. The restaurant is a state-of-the-art Manhattan homage to the preindustrial craft of Texas barbecue, particularly as it is practiced in the town of Lockhart. The flavors Hill Country achieves in its pits are not precisely the ones I remember from meals at Lockhart’s legendary rivals, Smitty’s Market and Kreuz Market. At both places, the smoke was deeply entrenched in the meat. Despite burning about 1,500 pounds a week of post oak shipped in from Texas, Hill Country doesn’t produce that kind of deeply smoky barbecue. It produces very slowly roasted meat with an echo of campfire around the edges. The low smoke quotient makes a spongy, beige pork chop a disappointment, and leaves the market chicken just another slightly dry rotisserie bird. But it does no harm to the prime rib and the beef shoulder. They may not be great Texas-style barbecue, but they are still terrific slabs of roast beef, cooked medium-rare through and through and ringed with that salt-and-pepper crust. And the jalapeño-cheese links, shipped to Manhattan by Kreuz Market, are always full flavored and insistently spicy, though their juiciness varies from day to day. When Hill Country opened, five years ago last month, it joined a wave of new restaurants that tried to coax more smoke into barbecue than had seemed possible on the tightly regulated shores of the East River. In a glowing $25 and Under column in 2007, the last time Hill Country was reviewed in The New York Times, Peter Meehan focused on the meat, especially the brisket. “No other barbecue place that has opened in New York in recent years has gotten it so right, right out of the gate,” he wrote. Since then, Hill Country’s other virtues have become easier to notice, or harder to ignore. Year after year I am drawn back to the dessert case for another plastic cup of banana pudding, built upon a custard so thick with eggs and cream it brings Paris to mind, and not the one in Texas. And as New York has become cluttered with strenuously playful cupcakes, few make me smile as easily as the one at Hill Country that is filled with grape jelly and frosted with a fluffy turban of peanut butter. According to hard-liners, the only permissible side dishes with barbecue are white bread and saltines. Anything else is as out of place as a yuzu macaron. Hill Country takes a more liberal point of view, thankfully. When I can afford to surrender the stomach space, I will have some peppery corn pudding, which has roughly the same relationship to an ear of corn that an ice cream sundae has to a cow. And I am always grateful for the relief provided by crunchy, sparingly dressed coleslaw and a vinegary salad of black-eyed peas. None of these dishes look like restaurant food; they seem like things packed for a church picnic by the best cook in town. The cook in this case, or at least the one whose recipes the kitchen follows, is the restaurant’s executive chef, Elizabeth Karmel. Named in her honor, EAK’s Bowl of Red is a ground-beef chili that could be a meal in itself, although it’s soupy enough that I wish Hill Country really did serve it in a bowl rather than in the same paper cartons used for all the sides. In Texas, much of the atmosphere of a barbecue joint is provided by the employees and the customers. Since shipping live Texans across state lines can be complicated, Hill Country’s owner, Marc Glosserman, bought inanimate objects like battered butcher blocks, salvaged floorboards and an old Blue Bell ice cream freezer. All this may be mistaken for the set dressing a big chain might use, but no chain would play Ray Wylie Hubbard and Reckless Kelly, or hire bartenders who mouth the lyrics as they tuck their bottle openers into the back pockets of their jeans. Hill Country may not be the real thing. But it plays the part better than anybody else in town.",Hill Country Barbecue Market,"['line', 'duty', 'i’ve', 'eaten', 'curl', 'bark', 'slate', 'shingle', 'end', 'wire', 'antique', 'silver',

251,The NoMad,★★★,2012-06-19,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/20/dining/reviews/the-nomad-in-new-york.html,NoMad,"CREATIVE people should never explain their process to anyone except their biographers, who care, and their spouses, who have to listen. The rest of us ought to be left guessing. It’s difficult, for instance, to give your full attention to a meal at the NoMad once you have read the interviews in which Daniel Humm and Will Guidara, its ambitious young operators, talk about modeling the restaurant on the Rolling Stones. They went through a branding exercise, writing down words that defined the band (loose, alive, genuine, deliberate) and molding the restaurant’s identity around them. Those words hang on a kitchen wall, not far from the enormous photo of Mick Jagger onstage, one leg goose-stepped up to microphone level. Once you know all this, you keep looking around the NoMad’s cluster of small, grandiose dining rooms thinking, “If this is supposed to be a night with Mick and Keith, why am I eating dinner at 5:30, and where are the police?” True, there’s an absinthe-fortified martini, the Turf Cocktail, that could easily become a habit, but it’s probably not the kind described in “Sister Morphine.” And while the thin women at the next table have a seen-it-all air, I doubt they have anything to teach Anita Pallenberg. If the “Sticky Fingers” flashbacks are distracting to me, though, they seem to have been liberating to Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara. They run Eleven Madison Park, a restaurant that rose from the middling ranks, and kept rising, and finally soared into world-class status. With a chance to do a second, larger, more populist restaurant inside the NoMad Hotel, they could have taken the well-traveled route with a bistro or trattoria. You know the model: steak frites or pasta with skillful knife work and tricky garnishes to prove the chef’s fine-dining bona fides. Instead, they have done something rather novel and wonderful. The NoMad takes recipes developed in Mr. Humm’s kitchen at Eleven Madison Park and translates them into a more open and generous style. Dishes fastidiously set in place by surgical tweezers to create the intimacy, delicacy and artfulness expected in a $125 four-course menu have been simplified, painted with broader strokes in a more relaxed hand that suits à la carte dining. At Eleven Madison Park, which earned four stars from The New York Times in a 2009 review by Frank Bruni, Mr. Humm concentrates and compresses suckling pig for about eight hours until it holds more flavor than any one piece of meat should be able to contain. It is the enriched plutonium of pork. In its best-known version, the suckling pig and its garnishes are arranged like two exclamation points running beneath a thin green line of baby leeks. Vast stretches of the white plate are left vacant. The NoMad serves suckling pig, too, but it is at the center of the plate, with pickled mustard seeds spooned over it and a crown of dandelion leaves resting around it. The dish is vastly easier to produce, no doubt, and does not scream, “Take my picture” quite as insistently. But it still looks grand and (let’s get to what really matters here) it offers a new way to consume enriched plutonium of pork. Lobster, which Mr. Humm prepares expertly and with never-ending variety at his flagship, was on the NoMad menu recently as lobster minestrone — with tomatoes, string beans, peas and quills of handmade garganelli in a light broth. Duck is here, too: not the whole roasted bird glazed with lavender honey and then carved tableside, but flat slices of the breast, with pickled juniper berries and scrolls of shaved pickled peaches. Color is splashed around with retina-filling gusto in Mr. Humm’s kitchen. A salad of strawberries, raspberries and roasted beets was supersaturated with ruby and garnet. Snap peas, cherry tomatoes, carrots in two shades and cauliflower in three are planted upright in a dish of shiny ice pebbles, the crudités tray treated as a botanical garden. And rarely have radish greens made the visual impact they have when left on the ends of red radishes enrobed in a thin shell of butter, like strawberries dipped in white chocolate. The colors, and much of the NoMad’s flavor, result from the creative deployment of vegetables practiced by Mr. Humm and his chef de cuisine, Abram Bissell. But if you have heard anything at all about the NoMad, you know that its signature dish is a roast chicken for two accessorized only by white asparagus and the smallest swipe of potato purée. Upstaged by the duck at Eleven Madison Park, here the chicken is the uncontested prima donna, and heads swivel when it goes by. Under a skin of lacquered brown the color of a loaf of challah lies a stuffing of brioche with foie gras and truffles. It is a dish from another era, when chicken breast was still seen as a worthy canvas for great chefs. Taste it and you know why. This is white meat for sybarites. On the side is a fricassee of the dark meat with morels, almost an afterthought. If served at a dark no-reservations tavern in the Village, it would be enough to put the place on the map. When things can go so right, you notice when they go even a little wrong, as they did with a slow-cooked halibut that was slightly squeaky and verging on dry in parts. Grated horseradish somehow didn’t lend raw hamachi the extra savor it needed, and while a finger-scorching loaf of bread topped with zucchini was irresistible on one occasion, on two others it was unpleasantly sticky on the inside. But these are minor demerits for a kitchen that takes on as much as the NoMad’s (besides tending to the restaurant’s 120 seats, it also cooks for room service). At times the operation’s scale seems to strain the dining room staff, too. Menus and empty glasses can linger on the table, and a plate of five excellent cheeses (made in Switzerland, like Mr. Humm) arrived at the table with no introduction; we had to ask which was which. Mr. Guidara, who oversees the dining room, has imported some talent from Eleven Madison, and you can still feel the difference between the veterans and the new hires. With time, that should change, and the servers might even start to have fun. The restaurant wants everybody to have a good time, yet curiously nobody seems quite sure how to go about it. The music has the forced energy whipped up by D.J.s trying to draw too-sober guests to the dance floor: Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin and, of course, the Rolling Stones, in up-tempo numbers, as if Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara wanted to host a class reunion for baby boomers. The restaurant’s designer, Jacques Garcia, has built a series of rooms that try to evoke a belle epoque house, with rich fabrics, floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, framed herb fronds and a glittering bar held up by carved mahogany elephants. It’s fancy without being elegant, and slightly decadent without being particularly interesting. It needs a little mystery and some more-attractive upholstery. But while the NoMad seeks its tone, there are so many reasons for patience. The selection of cocktails, an entire fleet, is surely one of the best in the city, down to a cooling and alcohol-free fennel-basil soda. There is the crazily smooth torchon of foie gras wrapped around a rough bull’s-eye of pig’s head pâté. And the pastry chef, Mark Welker, has a dessert called Milk and Honey that takes two simple flavors surprisingly far. If the only way to conjure these pleasures was to summon the Stones on a Ouija board, that’s all right. The muse doesn’t always come looking for us. Sometimes, we have to build a trap.",The NoMad in New York,"['creative', 'people', 'never', 'explain', 'process', 'anyone', 'except', 'biographer', 'care', 'spouse', 'listen', 'rest', 'u', 'ought',

252,Hakkasan New York,★,2012-06-12,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/13/dining/reviews/hakkasan-new-york-in-midtown.html,Clinton,"AT first, a hostile takeover did not appear to be the best solution to the problems of Hakkasan, the multimillion-dollar exercise in Orientalism one block off Times Square. Protesting in the streets seemed like a more promising approach. It wouldn’t be hard to muster a mob of New Yorkers outraged by a restaurant that asks $48 for grilled Chilean sea bass or wok-fried lamb chops. After a few days of pickets out front, Hakkasan would cave and drop its lunatic prices. At the very least, it might apologize for tacking an extra $3.50 for a small bowl of rice onto the check of customers who are already paying around $50 for a main course, plus a bruising markup on the wine. But while I was writing protest chants (“We like to eat/fried rice and such/but Hakkasan charges/much too much”), I began to see that the idea was flawed. People might conclude that the problem with Hakkasan is that its prices are too high, and that’s not right. The real problem is that its prices are too high for extremely restrained portions of food that is, in too many cases, about as interesting as a box of paper clips. It’s not all dull. What I remember most vividly about my meals are some truly outstanding dim sum items, including first-rate steamed dumplings; a soft-shell crab with curry leaves and a tangle of crunchy egg-yolk threads; a tender and nuanced bite of lobster with XO sauce; and the dizziness and shortness of breath I felt whenever I tried to understand where the money had gone. Some of it, no doubt, helps pay for the spectacular interior. The restaurant is part of a big expansion paid for by the Abu Dhabi-based investment company that now owns the Hakkasan brand, with seven locations around the world. At its first Manhattan restaurant, the 11,000-square-foot dining room has been diced into small chambers separated by silk-embroidered banquettes, walls of white Carrara marble and carved Chinese screens. Following the custom for intensively designed Asian restaurants, the lights grow dimmer and the music gets louder and untz-untz-untzier as the night goes on. One evening before darkness had descended, I sat with a view of the kitchen, and what I saw made me suspect that Hakkasan has the crew and the equipment to be the greatest Chinese restaurant in New York. There behind the screen was a squadron of woks blasted by flames that looked hot enough to refine steel. Each one was being tended by a white-jacketed cook, and each cook had the focus of a cobra. If you were in a cooking competition and this gang was the other team, you’d take one look and think, “It’s over.” You wouldn’t stand a chance against people who can make crystal dumplings as good as Hakkasan’s, the meaty brown morels pressed right up against the see-through wrappers. Some other dim sum items (under the awkward name “Small Eat”) were just as expertly done, like the lovely shrimp and Chinese chive dumplings, green-edged ovals dotted with a red goji berry. The texture of the rice noodle slipped around Wagyu beef was superb, as was the tender steamed bun stuffed with meaty red char siu. Tiny pumpkin-duck puffs, in the shape of pumpkins with leaves of borage cress, looked as if they were made for a dollhouse vegetable patch. I would have adopted them if they hadn’t been so delicious. The dim sum is, in fact, the best reason to eat at Hakkasan, particularly if you go for lunch or brunch, when the selection is greatest. (At any hour, though, it’s best to avoid the oily XO seafood puff and the ridiculous foie gras shrimp toast, a waste of perfectly good gavage.) Just don’t think of going if you balk at paying more than $3 a dumpling, or indeed if you demand any kind of rational correlation between price and product. In the rest of the menu, though, the kitchen pours its considerable skills into dishes that only occasionally rise above the ordinary. Little squares of pipa duck under a crackling shell of skin were good enough to make me wish that a $39 serving brought more than 10 pieces, each the size of a tea bag. But silky house-made tofu was misspent on a weird curry-and-black-pepper-flavored custard that traveled under the name “mabo tofu.” The crisp honey-toned skin on something called spicy roast ma la chicken was truly admirable, but the chicken meat itself was characterless, cast adrift without either the Sichuan peppercorn buzz (ma) or the chile-pepper burn (la) that the name promised. Disconnects like this are so common that you wonder if the person who wrote Hakkasan’s menu has ever met the chef. Anything described as spicy was sure to be as mild as cream cheese. Run-of-the-mill udon noodles with duck had no trace of the advertised XO sauce. Nothing I tasted at Hakkasan was unpleasant, but when the check easily surpassed $100 a person, it was hard not to feel cheated. It was like buying scalped tickets to see Anna Netrebko at the Met and then finding out that she would be performing the Katy Perry songbook. Sheer frustration finally put the idea of a takeover into my head. If a great restaurant was trapped somewhere inside Hakkasan, why not set it free? An elite crew of zealous Chinese-food fanatics should be able to pull it off. I can’t imagine that the smiling women in red Diane von Furstenberg dresses at the front podium would put up much of a fight, especially once they saw that we came as liberators. First, we would tell the cooks to make the food in their hearts instead of the lackluster recipes that somebody in the management company apparently believes non-Chinese people like. Unfortunately, we wouldn’t be able to drop the prices at first, at least not until we had reimbursed the owners for confiscating their restaurant. But once we had done that — I foresee a very amicable transaction, after which we would all share a plate or two of the braised abalone with truffles, having a good laugh over the $888 price tag — we could let gravity take over. If you’re with me, let’s meet outside the restaurant at 6 tonight. Oh, and somebody please bring some good music. The stuff they play at Hakkasan at night now — it’s enough to put crazy ideas in your head.","Hakkasan New York, in Midtown","['hostile', 'takeover', 'appear', 'best', 'solution', 'problem',

253,Neta,★★,2012-06-05,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-neta-in-greenwich-village.html,Greenwich Village,"EVEN by the spartan standards of sushi bars, the interior of Neta, on West Eighth Street, is defiantly plain. The walls are covered in a nubby material that makes them look like bulletin boards in a corporate cafeteria. They’re even dotted with pushpin-size holes, as if somebody had taken down the Man With a Van fliers just before unlocking the doors at 5 p.m. The best view in the house is from one of the 20 seats at the long maple counter, and even then you face a kitchen in floor-to-ceiling stainless steel where eight or so cooks in white caps silently go about their business. There are diners on Route 4 in New Jersey that give you more to look at. Soon it won’t matter. In the presence of unusually well-made sushi, a kind of tunnel vision sets in. Anything else in the room might as well be invisible as the world narrows down to a gleam of fish on a finger of rice in a tight circle of light. Since sushi good enough to bring on this malady can cost serious money, most of us do not suffer from it very often. It’s been my good fortune to have been afflicted several times recently at Neta. You won’t notice the walls when you have before you a piece of sea urchin roe on a cylinder of rice wrapped in nori. The tail end of the nori isn’t rolled tight but instead juts out like the short length of film that you used to feed into cameras. It unwraps itself inside your mouth. You have just enough time to notice how each grain of rice stands out from the rest, to enjoy how boldly the rice has been seasoned with vinegar and salt, before the mouth-filling taste of the sea urchin takes over. Now here in front of you is toro in a milky shade of pink. It will melt on your tongue; it is nearly melting already, sprawled across its bed of rice. Here is some marvelous sashimi of orange clam, expertly sliced for maximum tenderness. And now a piece of hamachi under a frizz of spiced and fried potato threads. Neta is a collaboration of two longtime disciples of the sushi master Masa Takayama. Nick Kim helped Mr. Takayama open Masa in 2004, and stayed on as head chef until 2010. His partner, Jimmy Lau, was head chef at Bar Masa in New York and the one in Las Vegas. In other words, these two know how to order prized Japanese species from Tsukiji market in Tokyo. Such exotic items are rarely seen at Neta. In part, this reflects the chefs’ interest in what Mr. Kim has called “Japanese food with local ingredients,” like stunning scallops from Massachusetts and mugwort foraged in Central Park. Yet their locavore sect allows salmon from Scotland and bluefin tuna from Spain. In an interview, Mr. Kim gave another reason the menu is fairly conservative: they weren’t sure yet how far their customers would go. At the moment, they keep off-the-menu esoterica like blowfish for regulars who want to go beyond the entry-level offerings. Neta will be an even more exciting and confident restaurant when the chefs have learned to trust their customers. In the meantime, it has compensatory pleasures. One of the biggest (and stop that laughing) is vegetable sushi. Had a friend with a fish allergy not told me that she’d eaten an extremely satisfying vegetarian dinner at Neta, I might have read that section of the menu with as much attention as I give to sponsored posts on Twitter. Curious, I tried grilled shiitake caps pressed around rice, a lotus root roll with minty shiso and another roll of asparagus tempura. They were some of the purest vegetable preparations I’ve tasted all spring. If your heart does not dance to the rhythms of mushroom sushi, then by all means proceed directly to the small hot and cold dishes. Grilled sea scallop is sent out on its shell with butter seasoned with garlic and soy as its sauce, dots of sea urchin as condiment and a lime wedge as garnish. The recipe would be wonderful with any good scallop. The chefs at Neta use one that has been severed from its shell an instant before grilling, a level of freshness that will keep this dish in my mind for a very long time. Fluke and shrimp rolled up inside a translucent sheet of daikon, another small dish, looked alluring, but was wrapped so tightly its flavors never emerged. This, though, was an anomaly in a kitchen with such a gentle touch that the food often seems to be held together by nothing more than the chef’s will. Chopped salmon with Sichuan peppercorn oil is set on a plank of rice so delicate it’s ready to take flight, and curls of shaved bonito on top flutter like wings trying to help it achieve liftoff. Duck skin, duck meat and foie gras brushed with hoisin sauce were stowed inside a half-pipe of cucumber carved so thin it resembled a single layer of leek. This is one of the ideas the chefs packed with their sushi knives when they left Masa, where a similar cucumber dugout is used for eel. Another Masa touch is the cocktail glass filled with toro tartare and caviar. You spread the tuna belly and the sturgeon roe on lightly grilled white bread, a bite at a time. It is alarmingly easy to eat, the only difficulty being the need to make sure you run out of bread early so you can eat the last bites of toro and caviar straight off the spoon. This transporting dish is typically included in Neta’s $135 omakase menu, but not on the $95 version. On its own, it is $48, the costliest item on the menu by far. Even if you forgo that particular frill, a meal at Neta can still tear a small hole in your pocket. Of course, you can tell yourself that you just saved hundreds of dollars by not eating at Masa. Neta is more American than Masa, and the chefs aren’t above hybrid concoctions like a spicy tuna roll. (It’s good, too.) I did miss the more Japanese communication style of traditional sushi bars, where an entire meal can be conducted with nods, smiles and lifted eyebrows. Service at Neta can lean a bit too far in the how-are-you-enjoying-the-mackerel-tataki direction. But I can’t complain about that, because the answer was always the same, whether the question concerned the mackerel or almost anything else: very much, thank you. I enjoyed it very much.",Neta - NYC - Restaurant Review,"['even', 'spartan', 'standard', 'sushi', 'bar', 'interior', 'neta', 'west', 'eighth', 'defiantly', 'plain', 'wall', 'covered', 'nubby',

254,Le Bernardin,★★★,2012-05-22,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/23/dining/reviews/le-bernardin-in-midtown-manhattan.html,Midtown,"ERIC RIPERT has been the executive chef of Le Bernardin for 18 years, and people sometimes ask him if he gets tired of cooking fish. Clearly these people have never eaten at Le Bernardin. No other restaurant in the city makes the simple cooking of fish (and the fish at Le Bernardin is cooked simply, when it is cooked at all) seem so ripe with opportunities for excitement. Some of the thrills are the hushed kind, like the way black garlic, pomegranate and lime support the crisp skin and white flesh of sautéed black bass. Others are scene-stealers, as when a white slab of steamed halibut is slowly surrounded by a crimson pool of beet sauce that, with crème fraîche stirred in, will turn the delirious pink of summer borscht. A few are flat-out luxurious, like a small boulder of caviar nested inside a heap of sea urchin on a carpet of little gnocchi. I blinked my eyes a few times at the $70 supplement on top of the $125 set price for four courses at dinner. Then I decided not to worry, because a chance like this might not come along again. A year from now the sea urchin and caviar, along with almost everything else on a menu of nearly 40 items, may well have made way for a new crop of thrills. For a restaurant so determined to stay on top, keeping such a deep repertory and refreshing it so often would seem to be a risk. It is also, of course, one source of its enduring success. Le Bernardin’s four-star rating in The New York Times has been confirmed every time the restaurant has been assessed, from 1986, when it opened, through 2005, when Frank Bruni wrote its most recent review. Why wait to say it: today I fall in line, happily, with my predecessors. Not that I am reviewing the same restaurant, exactly. Under the relentless guidance of Mr. Ripert and Maguy LeCoze, his partner in the business, Le Bernardin moves forward without a pause. To rest for a minute might mean growing old. Change, typically gradual, came in a rush last summer, when the interior was given a shake-up by the architecture firm Bentel & Bentel. The old dining room was always compared to a corporate boardroom, but for some reason its monumental scale and profusion of framed canvases in an antiquated style made me think of the atrium of a minor art museum. That’s all different now, starting with the art. Now, just one enormous painting of a brooding sea, “Deep Water No. 1” by Ran Ortner, looms over the space, imparting a sense of motion and immediacy. Wavy blades of twisted aluminum ripple like reeds along another wall. Opposite are shimmering, swaying curtains woven from vines and aluminum fibers. This room may never be sexy, exactly, but now it has a suggestive invitation in its eye. The downside of the redesign, however, is the removal of a good number of tables for two. Just as the restaurant has worked up a little romance, couples have a harder time getting reservations. The sleepy little bar was remodeled, too, and is now a sleek leather-and-steel lounge. Cocktails, when appropriate, come with a stainless-steel swizzle stick, not (please pound your fist on the bar along with me) a cheap plastic straw. The lounge is also something like Branson, Mo., for Le Bernardin’s greatest hits, bringing back from retirement classics like the irresistible smoked-salmon croque monsieur overflowing with caviar. The full menu is available, though I can’t imagine perching on a tuffet not much higher than a footstool to eat a $125 dinner. One French Connection cocktail and a brioche filled with warm truffled lobster, and I’d be ready to move along. Comfort, though, may not be the point. Simply having a lounge at all gives the entire restaurant a pulse that was missing before. The achievement of Bentel & Bentel’s design is that the interior now walks in step with Le Bernardin’s cuisine. Both are up-to-date, lively, intimate and playful. A corporate boardroom is no place for Laurie Jon Moran’s elegantly disassembled desserts, for instance. Mr. Moran’s plates are a bit busier than those of the last pastry chef, Michael Laiskonis, who left late last year, but the flavors quickly and agreeably reassemble themselves as you eat. And a museum is no place for the muscular sancocho sauce served with lacquered grouper, or more recently with striped bass. Inspired by the Puerto Rican stew, the sancocho is enveloping and warming, made from oxtails and chicken, with a low current of heat. The fish is treated like meat and likes it. Another attempt at the same treatment perplexed me: Dover sole in a red wine and cassis sauce the color of grape chewing gum. Out of more than two dozen I tasted, this was the only dish that didn’t come together for me. And at each meal just one minor detail struck me as not quite keeping up with the rest: the breads, which are outclassed at a number of places around town. Mr. Ripert has been stocking up on ingredients from Asia for years now, but somehow he makes the whole enterprise feel new. Sliced geoduck set down on a fluffy mousseline of smoked edamame and given a bath of wasabi and lime has obvious roots in Japan, yet doesn’t taste Japanese at all. The original impulse has been transformed. Like nearly all the savory dishes, this one depends upon the kitchen’s expert sauciers, especially Vincent Robinson, who has been on the job since 1985. Standing over his stockpots, Mr. Robinson has the control of Mariano Rivera on the mound. (Get well soon, Mr. Rivera.) When he makes a sauce of sweet pimentón for red snapper, the level of heat will be just perceptible; in a red wine and squid ink sauce for sepia, it will rise a bit higher and stop, right there. When he blends bergamot with grapefruit and other citrus for lobster, or jalapeño with lime for fluke sashimi, the nip of acidity will touch down precisely on this spot of your tongue, and nowhere else. Every time I went to Le Bernardin, somebody ordered a vintage Bordeaux, and the decanting apparatus would be trundled out. What on earth did those people order, I wondered, and did they ask Aldo Sohm for advice? Mr. Sohm, who holds the title chef sommelier, has studded his list with the required blockbusters, but he also has hidden oddities and discoveries to drink with raw salmon bathed in cardamom and ginger. He was joined on the floor at all times by at least two other sommeliers, silver tastevins swinging from their necks. They and other servers patrol the room like the Secret Service at a parade, on the lookout for the slight muscular shift indicating a guest is about to stand. One, two, three brisk steps, and someone is there to pull back the chair. There are slightly more women on the dining room staff these days, although men are still overrepresented as they are at other restaurants in this style. Ms. LeCoze and her maître d’hôtel, Ben Chekroun, are zealous about enforcing correct procedure, and woe to the novice who clatters dishes or forgets to look customers in the eye the minute they walk in the door. There is one other aspect of the service at Le Bernardin that sets the place apart from some of its peers. In spite of Mr. Ripert’s television appearances, in spite of the restaurant’s global acclaim, no one ever tried to let me know I was lucky to be there.

255,Cafe China,★★,2012-05-01,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/02/dining/reviews/cafe-china-in-midtown.html,Midtown South,"FOR a certain kind of food enthusiast, there is a deeply felt but little examined belief that immigrant-run restaurants, like presidential candidates, should not pay too much attention to their appearance. Just as a $400 haircut can spell days of bad press for a politician, a dining room outfitted with anything that might be termed design can raise suspicions of misplaced priorities. Some Sichuan-food fanatics I know, for instance, would roll their eyes at Café China. It looks far too pretty for a place serving a cuisine renowned for its chile-powered ability to make eaters teary-eyed and sweaty. Out front is the potted bamboo whose fronds sway in whatever breezes find their way to East 37th Street in Midtown. A vintage bird cage sways from the ceiling by the front door. Soft light is thrown by candles and chandeliers of hobnail milk glass, and the robin’s-egg-blue walls are hung with images of Shanghai starlets from the 1930s. A bartender pours cocktails into etched-glass coupes, and portable typewriters are here and there. (Customers use one as a guest book, tapping out compliments.) The skeptics would look at you with outright disbelief if you told them that this quaint, demure restaurant serves uncompromising Sichuan food that can stand with Manhattan’s best. But a cold appetizer of spicy diced rabbit will silence the doubters. It silences everybody, even the ones who aren’t totally sure they want to eat small cubes of bone-in rabbit with scallions and peanuts. The bones turn out to be essential to the overall experience, though. You need a minute to separate them from the meat, and during that minute some very intense things begin to happen to your tongue and lips. The sauce on that rabbit blends Sichuan peppercorns with scoops of small, fiery dried chiles. Sichuan cooks call the heat of chile peppers la. Ma is the word for the mouth-numbing zing of their region’s prized peppercorns. Stir them together and you have ma la. The chile heat and the Sichuan pepper tingle intensify each other until your mouth vibrates the way Wile E. Coyote does when he is hit on the head by an iron beam. You get the ma la buzz from the ma po tofu, too. In this hot entree, the nearly flavorless pockets of soft, delicate tofu offer safe harbor from the ma la assault (momentarily, at least). Then you take another forkful and it begins again. You have about four seconds to appreciate how exquisitely balanced the ma and la are before you reach for a drink, or cold cucumbers or bitter melon. The force of its ma la kick is certainly one test of a good Sichuan restaurant, but not the only one. As Fuchsia Dunlop noted in her cookbook “Land of Plenty,” ma la is one of 23 distinct flavor combinations in Sichuan cooking. One of the best reasons to go to Café China is that the chef, Lu Ziqiang, shows great control of flavors beyond the head-spinning realm of ma la. Even his spiciest recipes hold back from obliterating your palate, so you can taste the other dishes. As a chile-seeking friend put it, “Nothing is disgustingly hot.” That was a compliment. Pickle and fish stew has a burn that stops short of eye-watering, with round slices of preserved red chile bobbing in the broth like life preservers around a shipwreck. But it also has a sharp tang of pickled mustard greens that changes the formula to something new. Cumin leads the charge in other dishes, not just the well-known cumin lamb, which is superb and velvety here, but also in a dish called baby black lamb, which gains depth from fermented tofu and sweetness from red bell peppers. Cumin seeds and chiles strafe a whole tilapia that is steamed inside a tent of foil. Any objections I might have had to seeing fish given this rough, almost brutal treatment were forgotten the minute I started to eat. A far more gentle fate was dealt to the tea-smoked duck, with its whisper of smoke, its crisp handsomely rendered skin and its dipping sauce of sweet miso. Mr. Lu, a native of Chengdu, Sichuan’s capital, excels at foods that are marinated or cured, like the duck or the great cold appetizer of sliced beef with five-spice flavor, or the pork belly inside what the menu calls, confusingly, shredded pork sandwiches. (The pork is in fact sliced, and the sandwiches are the kind of steamed buns familiar to Momofuku followers.) Café China was opened in August by Xian Zhang and his wife, Yiming Wang. The two are Chinese-born bankers who make up for their lack of restaurant experience with the strength of their convictions. They insisted on a focused menu of about 75 items, with no egg rolls for the takeout crowd. They argued with Mr. Lu about monosodium glutamate, and won their case by force, charging into the kitchen to throw the MSG away. Without it, the smoked tofu with Chinese celery shoots doesn’t deliver the same kick in the head you’d get at Sichuanese competitors a few blocks away, but it does have a clean celery flavor. Even under a blizzard of spices, the main ingredients at Café China taste like themselves. Ms. Wang was in charge of the décor, meant to evoke Shanghai before World War II. Sometimes she seems to picture herself as a design element, gliding across the dining room in tight vintage dresses and bobbed hair. The restaurant works at a languorous, almost tropical tempo. This sometimes manifests itself in hazy service and puzzling waits for cold appetizers, but mostly it is a refreshing change from the usual staccato rhythms of Midtown Sichuan operations. For ma la maniacs, these are glorious days. Once you leave Chinatown, good Sichuan food may be easier to find in Manhattan than good Cantonese food. In Chelsea is the amazing Legend; Land of Plenty opened near Bloomingdale’s; there are Grand Szechuans all over. The 30s alone have  Szechuan Gourmet, Lan Sheng, Mapo Tofu and Café China. With so many expert chile-wrangling chefs, surely there’s space for a restaurant where a casually cool retro interior can be home to Sichuan’s enveloping heat.",Café China in Midtown,"['certain',

256,Alison Eighteen,★,2012-04-17,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/18/dining/reviews/alison-eighteen-in-manhattan.html,Flatiron,"DID somebody forget to tell Alison Price Becker that in the decade since she last operated a Manhattan restaurant, all of New York below 42nd Street has been taken over by kids, and that their idea of going out to eat resembles some kind of blood sport? They have no sense of mortality, these young people. It’s nothing to them if restaurants make them wait all night for a table. They’ll stand up knocking back $16 cocktails for hours as if there won’t be a price to pay in the morning. Their bodies are still limber and lean, curse them, so when these kids are finally shown to a seat, and it turns out to be bigger than a laptop but smaller than an actual human lap, they can wedge into it without hearing anything inside creak or snap. The seat (O.K., it’s more like a stool or a bench or a tree stump or maybe an anvil) will offer no lumbar support, but still they won’t wake up the next morning feeling as if they’d been lifting file cabinets all night. The damage to their eardrums hasn’t started to manifest yet, so they can bob their heads to an early ’80s hair-metal anthem while recounting the latest episode of “The Walking Dead.” And the way they eat! They’re like houseflies, always buzzing around one another’s plates, sharing a dozen dishes ordered off menus divided into indecipherable headings like “By the Foot” and “Neither Fish nor Fowl.” Apparently none of this news has reached Ms. Price Becker’s ears. Or perhaps she heard it and then chose to go her own way. Either way, what she opened in January a few blocks off Union Square is a perfectly normal restaurant. Alison Eighteen is not a replica of her first place, Alison on Dominick, which she ran from 1989 until 2002. But it works the way restaurants worked in those days. You show up for your reservation, are led to a recognizable chair at a table that’s all yours, eat an appetizer and a main course in that order, make conversation with your inside voice and then go on your merry way. And if there are a few bumps as the night proceeds, at least they will be familiar bumps. You can almost hear the sighs of relief as patrons make their way past the bar and through the eggplant-colored velvet curtain into the orderly, un-raucous, cleanly illuminated dining room. There is no dress code at Alison Eighteen, yet nearly all the men who eat there show up in blazers. It must be a sign of gratitude. Not to say that Ms. Price Becker wasn’t keeping tabs on the city’s mood while she was in exile in the Hamptons. Alison on Dominick summed up its era’s suave metropolitan ideal of a date-night restaurant. But these days, date night could mean walking up Second Avenue eating deep-fried hot dogs followed by crack pie and soft serve, so Ms. Price Becker has eased up on the romance. Instead of lining the walls with the black-and-white Parisian scenes shot by her brother, the photographer Jonathan Becker, she has installed Payton Cosell Turner’s whimsical wallpaper with line drawings of produce stands, park benches and awnings for a variety of establishments, all named Alison. This is not a room where young men will offer tiny Tiffany’s boxes to their pretending-to-be-surprised girlfriends, as they regularly did on Dominick Street. But it may be where couples who got engaged there will repair to decide whether it’s finally time to sell their country house. While they talk, of course, there will be food. Most of the time, it will be in an Americanized bistro mode, and most of the time, it will behave itself. There is no funny business at the rotisserie, for instance. It will spit-roast a chicken that looks and tastes the way a rotisserie chicken should, and will do wonderful things with a hunk of lamb shoulder seasoned with preserved lemons. There is a no-nonsense grill, too, applied to uncomplicated cuts like a juicy pink pork chop and a sirloin. If I couldn’t taste the evidence of all 35 days the steak had supposedly been aged, it didn’t matter much. The lip-smacking Bordelaise and the hot, crisp potato sticks supplied more than enough flavor. The lamb shank created by Tom Valenti when he opened the kitchen at Alison on Dominick became a totem that each of his successors paid homage to or kept in the repertory. Alison Eighteen’s chef, Robert Gurvich, offers his own tribute to the dish in the form of a fully satisfying veal shank with reduced braising juices. Before those main courses, you could begin with fat mussels in a wonderful creamy broth, or some well-dressed salads, or an appetizer-size portion of stewed rabbit on wide house-made pappardelle speckled with mustard seeds. Both noodles and meat were so good that I was tempted to write off an earlier collision I’d had with a pasta dish: razor clams slapped — grit, shells and all — on top of a knotted clump of flavorless fettuccine. Maybe it was a failed experiment, and I was glad to see that on a recent evening it was no longer being offered. I was less thrilled that an earlier night’s special had been promoted to the menu: seared bigeye tuna over lemon jam so sugary you could spread it on toast. Scrape off the jam, though, and you have an excellent piece of fish. I did something similar with a white cocotte of polenta with wild mushrooms, tilting it until a small pond of olive oil and melted butter collected on one side. The dining room staff makes a great show of brisk efficiency. They wear white coats and neckties, and somebody is always topping off your water while holding a splash-catching pad to the glass. But I craned my neck in vain looking for someone to suggest a bottle of wine before the main courses landed, or to take a dessert order, or to bring the check. Behind that velvet curtain, Alison Eighteen can feel a bit like seeing a revival of an old play in out-of-town tryouts. The sets look great, but the dialogue can feel a bit strained, and the players need time to learn their lines. The audience looks indulgent, though. After all, they don’t write them like this anymore.",Alison Eighteen in Manhattan,"['somebody', 'forget', 'tell', 'alison', 'price', 'becker', 'decade', 'since', 'last', 'operated', 'manhattan',

257,Kyo Ya,★★★,2012-04-10,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/11/dining/reviews/kyo-ya-nyc-restaurant-review.html,East Village,"SOME facts are beyond the reach of search engines. This is probably lucky for all of us, and it is especially lucky for those who go to eat at Kyo Ya. A Japanese hideaway in the middle of the East Village, Kyo Ya gives up its secrets slowly. Learning them is part of the adventure. The restaurant, which turned five years old last month, has no Web site. Reservations cannot be made through OpenTable. Any menu you manage to turn up online is likely to be seriously out of date. If Kyo Ya has opinions about bankers or fracking, they remain untweeted. Even in three dimensions, Kyo Ya can be elusive. Whenever I take friends there, I ask them to meet me on Seventh Street, just east of First Avenue. If I don’t, I will end up studying the menu at length until my phone trembles with a text message: “I’m outside. Where is this place?” It is below street level, at the bottom of an iron staircase marked by a carved sign that says, not too helpfully, Open. Once you make your way inside, welcomed by hosts who always seem delighted by your arrival, you look around, smile and start to unwind. The restaurant — floors, tables, counters, chairs, walls, doors, spoons, trays, even toilet seats — is made almost entirely of wood, with one long curving wall of stacked panels that fit together so well they make you want to take up carpentry. It is a room that restores all five of your senses if you have spent your day flicking away at pixels. And it puts you in the right frame of mind for the food of Kyo Ya’s chef, Chikara Sono. Like much Japanese cuisine, it is grounded in the shapes and rhythms of the natural world, and in respect for the seasons. It is easy in New York now to believe that eating ramps in April makes you an expert in seasonal cooking. As a meal at Kyo Ya will show, this is a little like believing that eating a tuna salad sandwich makes you a marine biologist. It’s a wide world out there. And it’s a wide world in here. Fans of Japanese food trust that Mr. Sono will find a way to serve rarely seen ingredients the minute their fleeting season begins. A couple of weeks ago, Kyo Ya offered a taste of spring’s first young bamboo shoots. The spiky leaves were peeled back like corn husks to expose the tender core, barely marked by the grill, seasoned with soy and flecks of kinome, the leaves of the sansho pepper plant. “You eat this part,” our server said, gesturing toward the stalk. We did, tentatively at first, then greedily. Mr. Sono’s most highly evolved display of right-now seasonality is the kaiseki menu, a procession of courses following a model that evolved over centuries. In February, I reserved one of the 10 spots for the kaiseki meal served nightly. Deep winter may not be the ideal time to appreciate a style of cooking that tries to showcase ingredients at their absolute peak. Still, I was transfixed by course after course, each a study in the forms and flavors of roots and leaves and marine life. A gratin of creamy sesame tofu with bits of deeply sweet blue shrimp was like a Japanese translation of shrimp and grits, and a great translation, too. Poached burdock mousse tasted the way the woods smell after it rains. Most astonishing of all was a plate of scallops in a sea-urchin butter so richly pleasurable that the only intelligent response was total submission. If you have heard of Kyo Ya, chances are you have been told that the kaiseki menu is the thing to get. It is a rare treat, no question, but so are many of the dishes that can be ordered à la carte with a smaller investment of time and money. If you eat this way, your meal will be less epic, but it can be just as enjoyable. Not every good tale is a novel. A compelling short story could be written about the chawanmushi, the traditional savory egg custard, served steaming hot with shrimp, ginkgo nuts and other little treasures hidden inside. It was so silky it made silk feel like pavement. Another could be told about the slowly simmered kurobuta kakuni, a pork belly that stands out even in a city that is full of them. And there is another story in the sweet potato that is steamed twice, then fried tempura style and eaten with a few drops of soy sauce. And another in the black cod in a miso glaze. No matter how many times you’ve had this dish, the version here can still make you shake your head in amazement. With every meal at Kyo Ya, I found another dish to add to my list of favorites, or a subtle new sake, or a deeply aromatic tea I’d never tasted before. With all of this, I was delicately guided by servers who were almost balletic in their gracefulness and nearly clairvoyant in their attentiveness. Toward the end of what had sounded when we’d placed our order like a very full meal, a server seemed to sense that we were still hungry even before we did. He mentioned a plate of sashimi. It was exactly enough. Much of the menu is likely to succeed with almost anyone, but some of Mr. Sono’s cooking can leave behind those who aren’t prepared to follow the Japanese palate down every winding path. One of my companions could not quite come to terms with the texture of cold sea urchin lobes and tofu skins bobbing in a milky broth. Another balked at lifting glassy baby eels with chopsticks. On a recent night, I faced a tiny but powerful cup of fermented squid in a sauce of its own liver. If fried calamari is a sunny day on the coast, this was a cold night near the ocean floor. I found it thrilling, but not everyone would. But even my most cautious friends went wild for the pressed sushi, which is rarely served in New York. The rice is fortified with shiso, two kinds of ginger, scallion, fried kelp and sesame seeds. The fish is placed on top, and the whole thing is squeezed into a tight rectangle. In the most arresting version I had, salmon trout was gift-wrapped in a papery sheet of oboro kombu seaweed that looked like green marble. There is more to learn, but that pleasure should be yours.

258,Acme,★★,2012-03-13,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/14/dining/reviews/acme-signals-the-arrival-of-new-nordic-cuisine.html,NoHo,"SOME chefs storm into the city like an invading navy, gunships of publicity thundering on the horizon. Mads Refslund slipped into town in January as quietly as a canoe. Word was that new owners had taken over the Acme Bar and Grill on Great Jones Street, which had dished up jambalaya under strings of chile-pepper lights for more than two decades. From the sidewalk, it looked as if nothing had changed. The red-and-blue awning still advertised “Authentic Southern and Cajun Cookin’. ” When the double doors opened in January, Eater, the usually all-seeing restaurant blog, reported that the menu “still has a Southern accent.” Soon, clued-in diners were filing ecstatic reports about Mr. Refslund’s food, which was non-Southern in the extreme. He was tucking a spooky tartare of bison and raw shrimp into endive and radicchio leaves. He was roasting sunchokes in a bed of hay, then setting the hay on fire. For dessert, there were chewy dried pears strewn around a green mulch of frozen wheatgrass juice. As some of those diners realized, the gentle and thoughtful cooking at Acme has nothing to do with Louisiana and quite a lot to do with Denmark. Along with René Redzepi, Mr. Refslund had been a founding chef of Noma, the Copenhagen restaurant that is the current center of the culinary universe. He was present at the creation of the new Nordic cuisine, an experiment in restricting the kitchen to ingredients that can be grown or caught or foraged locally, leading to a new appreciation for humble grains and edible weeds that nobody in Scandinavia had thought about eating for many years. Bits and scraps of this movement have drifted across the Atlantic, touching down on plates at Isa and Frej in Brooklyn, but the new Acme was the stealthy arrival of the genuine thing. Acme doesn’t look or act like a restaurant for gastronomic mandarins, which is one of its more appealing features. The owners have cultivated a constituency among the kind of gallery circulators and style trackers who turn up in Paper magazine. During Fashion Week, the arching mirror that runs nearly the length of the dining room reflected men in expensive-looking flannel and women in expensive-looking everything, nearly all of them angular and underfed. The servers are lean, too, in stiff, narrow-waisted jeans, their skinny ties tucked into the plackets of crisp white shirts. They do not intone psalms about Chef’s wisdom or explicate every last item on every last plate. Half the diners probably wouldn’t want to hear it, and the other half are having fun discovering it on their own. The food invites that. What looks like a bowl of sea foam subsides into a milky sauce of roast sunflower seeds bathing open clamshells embedded in sand-colored barley. It’s a small, intimate landscape that you eat. In fact, you might choose to eat it each time you come to Acme, noticing that it’s a little different each night, now with scallops, now with razor clams. Mr. Refslund cooks intuitively, by look and feel and perhaps by mood, but in three meals this dish was always cozy and comforting, with a sophisticated sense of balance. A painter’s hand is at work in a plate of carrots, too, though this time the genre is a botanical still life. The kitchen roasts them with pine needles and slices them in half the long way, serving them under a see-through sheet of lardo. The carrots, stretched out in a tart pool of blood-orange sauce, are knobbly and crooked, ugly but radiant. But to find real beauty in homeliness, order those blackened sunchokes. They might remind you of marshmallows that got too close to the campfire, or more appetizingly like fresh-dug truffles, but either way they are undeniably strange. And undeniably wonderful, enriched with butter, melted Gruyère and actual winter truffles. The nature-trail quality is turned down a notch in the main courses (“Sea/Land” in the menu’s language), although you never know where a craggy leaf or weedy flower is going to turn up next. The main courses are generally simpler and, almost without exception, excellent, particularly a chicken breast with a refined giblet sauce, and anything where fish is involved. There is black sea bass with pickled green tomatoes; there is arctic char with snow-white leeks; there was, at one point, turbot in a simple butter sauce with green fennel, and the kitchen seemed to nail them every time. None of these ingredients sound particularly Scandinavian, which is part of the point. “I think it would be very stupid to import things from Denmark,” Mr. Refslund said over the phone last week. “My whole philosophy is to tell the story of where you are right now.” This was his philosophy in Copenhagen as well. He and Mr. Redzepi were roommates and best friends who became co-chefs, heading off on a four-month tour of the Nordic region. Their hunt for puffin eggs and reindeer moss was the starting point for Noma’s cooking, although Mr. Refslund is the first to say that he had no hand in what the restaurant became. About five months after the opening, it became clear to both men that there was one chef too many, and Mr. Refslund left. “The whole cuisine today is René’s,” he said. Acme is not Noma in NoHo, nor is it MR, Mr. Refslund’s rarefied Copenhagen restaurant, now closed. The cooking is greatly simplified and meant to be shared. (This isn’t always successful; four people can’t split two fried eggs, and even perfectly cooked fish can cool on its trip from platter to plate to mouth.) The aim is to avoid startling the tables discussing Hedi Slimane’s move to YSL, while not boring the ones debating the chef César Ramirez’s move to Manhattan. The second group must be wondering if Mr. Refslund is going to be allowed to cook at his full capacity. And I’m wondering what will happen when he begins to make friends with local farmers and foragers. While the kitchen has been getting steadily more precise, I have the sense that the raw ingredients are holding it back somewhat. The salt-baked beet salad, for instance, can seem like a sketch not fully colored in yet. (Mr. Refslund also has a thing for al dente vegetables, as if he didn’t want to tame them with too much heat. Sometimes it works and sometimes, as when the sunchokes or carrots are crunchy and raw-tasting, it doesn’t.) One night as I left, two young European travelers were out front, peering at the awning. “Excuse me,” one said. “What is ... ca-joon food?” The restaurant is serving another kind of cuisine now, we explained. What kind, they asked. One of my companions hazarded, “Modern Danish?” But no. It’s modern New York, it’s fascinating and it’s going to be a blast to watch it grow. There were no trumpets playing when Mr. Refslund landed, but you can hear them now, and they’re going to get louder.",Acme Signals the Arrival of New Nordic Cuisine,"['chef', 'storm', 'city', 'like',

259,RedFarm,★★,2012-03-06,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/07/dining/reviews/redfarm-in-the-west-village-turns-up-the-flavors.html,West Village,"JUST for a moment, try to forget that the dumplings are staring at you. It won’t be easy. They have plaintive black sesame-seed eyes, the dumplings at RedFarm, giving them the appearance of strange, adorable characters in a Miyazaki film. These flat-bellied duck and crab dumplings look like a school of wide-mouthed catfish; the pale-green ones, filled with shrimp and snow-pea leaves, like moon-faced tadpoles. Over here are Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Clyde, spectral shrimp dumplings in blue, pink, yellow and white, chasing a Pac-Man made of sweet potato tempura with a blueberry for an eye. Ignore their plaintive stares, and stare at them instead. Look how rounded they are, how their fillings weigh against their glossy wrappers like the summer juice pressing against the skin of a plum. They look firm, ripe, ready. You can tell that they’re going to be good. But you don’t know how good they really are, and how good RedFarm can be, until you try one. And then, plaintive stares or no, you begin devouring these bundles of delight one by one. RedFarm, in the West Village, is a collaboration between one of New York’s greatest Chinese chefs, Joe Ng, and one of its greatest Chinese restaurateurs, Ed Schoenfeld. Only one, Mr. Ng, is Chinese by birth. Mr. Schoenfeld is Chinese by calling, a Brooklyn-born Jew who long ago heard an inner voice urging him to bring better kung pao chicken to the people of Manhattan. They have several clever ideas at RedFarm. First, the menu has been tailored for a Western palate, with none of the bland and slippery specialties that non-Chinese eaters find so enigmatic. It also seems designed for the age of Yelp, when the entire world can be split into either Nothing Special or OMG. RedFarm’s cooking runs hard toward OMG. Finally, there is the idea the management likes to broadcast: “Chinese cuisine with a Greenmarket sensibility,” which boils down to spending more on ingredients than many other Chinese restaurants do. A server one night rattled off the provenance of just about every scrap in the kitchen, from the rib steak (Creekstone Farms) to the truffles (a forager in France). “We don’t say all this on the menu, but everything is intelligently sourced,” he said. All that sourcing and intelligence result in some wonderful flavor. The rib steak, marinated for a night in shredded papaya, ginger and soy sauce, is the last thing I’d expected to find in a Chinese restaurant: a great steak. A few more pieces of beef like this around town, and soon baked potatoes and cheesecake will be the only reasons for steakhouses to continue to exist. The winter farmers’ market can’t be much help in assembling the okra and eggplant in a Thai-style yellow curry, but Mr. Ng must have other connections, because the vegetables can hold their own against the spicy and warming curry, fragrant with lemon grass and rich with coconut cream. The bowl satisfies you and makes you want more at the same time, a tension that feels so good that a meal at RedFarm could begin and end right there. Could, but shouldn’t. It would be insane to come to RedFarm without having a dumpling, and silly not to have four or five. They are the foundation of Mr. Ng’s fame as the Balanchine of dim sum, built at World Tong in Brooklyn and then at Chinatown Brasserie in NoHo, where he is still the chef. The shrimp and snow-pea leaf versions have a juicy sweetness far more intense than what you usually find in Chinatown. The mixed-vegetable, with sunny corn kernels peeking through the crimps in the dough, have a right-off-the-vine vibrancy. Still, neither one is going to overtake Mr. Ng’s soup dumplings in popularity. Here’s how to eat them: hold one in a spoon, raise it to your lips, nip off the puckered crown, suck out the hot thick broth, and try to remember tasting a more-flavorful soup dumpling in Manhattan since the early days of Joe’s Shanghai. For sensations like this, people have stood in line, and stood and stood, since the restaurant opened last August. RedFarm belongs to that post-Momofuku generation of restaurants made possible by the discovery that people will wait in line, open their wallets and put up with a reasonable amount of discomfort if the cooking consistently vaults above usual levels of intensity. No reservations are taken, except for large parties. The décor, to stretch a definition, is provided mostly by potted plants and by Mr. Schoenfeld’s owlish eyeglasses, color-coordinated with his sweaters. Cartons of beer and liquor are stowed above the tables on raw-lumber platforms. (What design budget there was seems to have gone into buying one of those highly accomplished Japanese toilets.) In exchange, all the flavors have been turned up as high as they can go. The dishes can be salty, or sweet, or rich. Often they are all three at once. At RedFarm, the food goes to 11. It’s hard to fault that approach when you’re crunching on one piece of crispy beef after another, lured in by the black vinegar and Grand Marnier glazing a deep-fried exterior. Or dipping a pastrami egg roll into mustard, and ingesting an entire century of sodium-drenched Lower East Side culinary history. But I wouldn’t advise eating both in the same meal, or even the same week. RedFarm’s waiters, though very good, tend to steer you toward the more-is-more end of the menu. I was in better hands with the woman seated next to me one night who said: “You should get the smoked cucumbers. You’ll need them.” I saw what she meant. Though not exactly sodium-free, the cucumbers are cooling and refreshing, gently pickled and pulsing with pink peppercorns. To her suggestions, I’d add three of my own: a plate of snow-pea leaves; the dessert of carved fruit in light ginger syrup; as many glasses of water as you can manage. Whether the unbalanced menu is heartfelt (Mr. Schoenfeld and Mr. Ng like this kind of cooking), cynical (they believe their target market likes it) or both, is hard to tell. The two hope to plant takeout-friendly RedFarms around the city, so clearly their eyes are on the mainstream. Meanwhile, Mr. Ng seems to have glanced away from Chinatown Brasserie, which on a recent night sent out food that was a second-generation copy of what it used to be. At the moment, though, there is just one RedFarm, and Mr. Ng and Mr. Schoenfeld are focusing all their energy on it. For New Yorkers who know a great dumpling when they see one, that’s more than good enough.","RedFarm, in the West Village, Turns Up the Flavors","['moment', 'try', 'forget', 'dumpling', 'staring',

260,Jungsik,★★,2012-02-28,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/29/dining/reviews/jungsik-intribeca-reinterprets-korean-cuisine.html,TriBeCa,"FOR many adults, a lobe of sea urchin has the same power to magically improve almost any plate that a squirt of ketchup has for children. The effect is far more luxurious, though. So I was not exactly stunned to find myself dipping my spoon over and over, slowly but determinedly, into a bowl of sea urchin over rice at Jungsik. And telling a friend, “Wow, you’ve got to try this.” And never quite getting around to sliding it over to his side of the table. The other tastes in that bowl did surprise me, though, and made it one I’ll remember happily for some time. Seaweed and sesame oil scented the rice. Above it were sticks of Napa cabbage kimchi and a handful of quinoa, fried until it lost its usual mustiness. I stirred all this together, like bibimbap, and began to travel. The seaweed and the briny urchin tugged me toward the beach. The kimchi and sesame oil dropped me on the corner of 32nd and Sixth. As for the quinoa, as it crunched between my teeth I was back at in my parents’ house, eating a breakfast bowl of Grape-Nuts. It sounds like a cab ride to crazy town, but it was great. A lot of what we call creativity in cooking is simply rearranging old patterns by swapping one ingredient for another, less-expected one. A talent for forming entirely new patterns is more rare. It is that much more exciting when you encounter it, as you do in some of Jung Sik Yim’s menu at the refined and expensive restaurant he opened in TriBeCa at the end of last summer. New Yorkers who crave Korean cuisine for its militant strafings of chile paste and raw garlic may find that Jungsik takes some getting used to. Its goal is refinement, for better and, at times, for worse. Rather than steaming to the table in rustic bubbling pots, Mr. Yim’s food is plated, and plated with a vengeance, with bits of this and that marching in neat, colorful chorus lines across expansive white plates. Inside a vibrant green circle of cilantro and jalapeño sauce is a red snapper fillet that literally sparkles; the scales are left on the skin, and exposure to blistering oil makes them puff and stand up in translucent points of amber. It’s an achievement, this crust made of fish-scale sequins, and it’s wonderful to eat. In the shadows of refinement, though, lurk dullness and pretension, and Jungsik sometimes slips into one or the other. Some dishes come and go without leaving much impression. Early on, the service was fluttery and nervous-making; now it tends toward a mannered formality that is almost a parody of fancy-restaurant etiquette. And the price, while lower than it was at first, is still what real estate brokers would call “aggressive.” (A five-course dinner is $115, and a three-course menu, the only other option, costs $80.) This may explain why Jungsik was half empty on a recent night. I wish more New Yorkers would give the place a chance. I also wish the place would give more New Yorkers a chance. Friendlier prices and a more comfortable tone would be a start if the restaurant, an import from Seoul, wants to adapt to its new environment. Mr. Yim was born in South Korea, learned to cook in the army and went on to work in kitchens around Seoul, including a bakery and a rice-cake shop. At 25, he came to the United States for culinary school, and after graduation he worked briefly at Bouley and elsewhere. As the tastes Mr. Yim grew up on collided with the techniques of the modern American restaurant kitchen, all sorts of ideas shook loose. What do you get when you inject a suave sabayon with the unruly heat and sourness of kimchi? A sauce for Arctic char that’s lush and focused. What if you stir barley into simmering anchovy broth? Two familiar Korean flavors generate a third, a little uncanny and very good. The chef planted his flag first in his home country, opening Jung Sik Dang in Seoul in 2009 with friends from culinary school. Their ambition was huge. Jung Sik Dang adapted Western fine dining for a culture where most restaurants prize tradition over innovation. Instead of panchan, small dishes of fermented vegetables and other things, meals began with a salvo of amuses bouches and a choice of breads served from a tray. All of this put the food of Korea on an equal footing with that of Europe and the United States, a forceful statement of national pride. Exported to Manhattan, though, Jungsik is just another restaurant, and its prices invite comparison with some of the city’s best. In that company, even a few off notes can hurt. In a flurry of five little pre-appetizers, a froth of red grapes over puffed rice was so dull that a baby might have wanted to add hot sauce, and a bulgogi slider wasn’t much more invigorating. Only Korean fried chicken on the end of a toothpick suggested that the meal to come would be worth sticking around for. The interior of the restaurant, with two long walls of creamy banquettes and white table linens, has a kind of rectilinear, modern elegance, but it might have been so much more striking if the grandly windowed space, once occupied by Chanterelle, had not been carved into boxes. With its distinctive view of Hudson and Harrison Streets now given away to a private dining room, the remainder looks like one of those cool-but-not-really hotel restaurants with names like CobaltBlue and 3sixty5. Jungsik has struggled to find the right tone in its service, too. Although highly attentive, the staff can affect an elaborate, almost Edwardian courtesy that does not seem to come naturally. Perhaps the actors on “Downton Abbey” can sound believable saying things like “As a final element to your meal here, we provide you with an angelica root pot de crème,” but it’s a bit much for the young servers at Jungsik. This reaching for elegance, clearly, is meant to convey something beyond the strict meaning of the words. It is trying to stake a claim for the global standing of Korean food. But Jungsik doesn’t need that. Mr. Yim is staking that claim on nearly every plate he cooks, and doing it convincingly. Now the restaurant he has built needs to stop worrying about the world, and start paying more attention to its new home.","Jungsik, inTriBeCa, Reinterprets Korean Cuisine","['many', 'adult', 'lobe',

261,Shake Shack,★,2012-02-21,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/22/dining/reviews/shake-shack-struggles-with-inconsistency.html,Downtown Brooklyn,"AFTER tossing out one of those limp politician’s jokes about how its arrival in Brooklyn meant that Shake Shack had finally “hit the big time,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg snipped through a green ribbon Dec. 20 to formally open the chain’s location on Fulton Mall. It is not every day that the mayor serves as midwife at the birth of a hamburger stand, but it is not every hamburger stand that achieves the prominent spot in the city’s consciousness held by Shake Shack. There are 14 of them now, uptown, downtown and out of town (Miami, Washington, Kuwait City). One respectable writer has spoken of the burger as life-changing. From its origins as a hot-dog cart that the restaurateur Danny Meyer set up as a kind of art project in 2001, Shake Shack has become one of the most influential restaurants of the last decade, studied and copied around the country. Its legacy can be seen not just in the stampede of good, cheap burgers, but in the growing recognition that certain fine-dining values, like caring service and premium ingredients, can be profitably applied outside fine dining all the way down the scale to the most debased restaurant genre of all, the fast-food outlet. To answer two obvious questions right away: Yes, I would give stars to a hamburger stand. No, probably not four stars. While the mayor was talking, a line had formed. Lines are so central to the Shake Shack experience that they have symbolic overtones. The line is democratic: everybody waits, including Mr. Meyer’s children. It is a signal of freshness: everybody waits, because the food is cooked to order. It is the people’s endorsement: everybody waits, so it must be worth it. I ate at the Shake Shack in Brooklyn and others around the city more than a dozen times recently. After about a third of those trips, I walked away thinking, “Wow, that was an awesome burger.” The other times, the food generally wasn’t worth the wait. Finally I understood that the people in line were looking for something that doesn’t come in a wax-paper wrapper. Shake Shack’s pitch is that, yes, even in New York, we can all return to a simpler, cleaner, friendlier place and time. It delivers on that pitch most reliably in its shakes and custards. The shakes are smooth, not crunchy with ice crystals, and drinkable, not so stiff that they fight the straw. And the flavors are true. A live current of caffeine pulses through the Fair Shake, made from vanilla ice cream swirled with coffee extract. (For those who like a different kind of buzz, Shake Shack has pints of Brooklyn Brewery’s easygoing Shackmeister ale. It also pours wine into stemless tulip-shaped glasses. You don’t realize they’re plastic until you touch them.) I was never let down by the hot dogs, bought from Chicago’s irreplaceable Vienna Beef, which were split down the middle, griddled and laid in a toasted potato bun with or without the classic Chicago garnishes. Better yet is the Bird Dog, a smoked chicken and apple bratwurst from Usinger’s of Milwaukee. How the burger could change lives I never divined, but on occasion it was magnificent, as beefy and flavorful as the outer quarter-inch of a Peter Luger porterhouse. More often, though, the meat was cooked to the color of wet newsprint, inside and out, and salted so meekly that eating it was as satisfying as hearing a friend talk about a burger his cousin ate. Even when the burgers were great, they could be great in one of two distinct ways. In the classic Shake Shack patty, a tower of ground beef is flattened against a searing griddle with a metal press and made to stay there, spitting and hissing, until one surface turns all brown and crunchy. A patty handled this way takes command of a Shackburger, standing up to its tangy sauce, its crisp lettuce, its wheels of plum tomato. Sometimes, though, the grill cook hadn’t had the energy needed for smashing and searing. Instead the patty was tall, soft and melting, so pink inside that its juices began to soak the bun at the first bite. Good as this version was, it was anomalous. Shake Shack wasn’t even consistently inconsistent. Once when I ordered a double burger, one patty was browned all the way through while the other was the color of a ripe watermelon inside. When Shake Shack’s slant-roofed kiosk first landed in Madison Square in 2004, it handily outclassed its nearest rivals, places like McDonald’s and Burger King. But success has bred better competitors. Today, for less than $10, you can get a burger at least as flavorful at Schnipper’s Quality Kitchen, FoodParc, Bill’s Bar & Burger and Steak ’n Shake Signature. In the early days, Shake Shack’s commitment to better ingredients, like antibiotic- and hormone-free “100 percent all-natural” Angus beef, might have seemed progressive. Now, you can get inexpensive burgers with a stronger promise of sustainability, made from beef that is local, organic or grass-fed, at Steak ’n Shake, Bark Hot Dogs, Bareburger, Whitmans and others. And you can get better fries just about anywhere. Considered as décor, the crinkle-cut fries are exactly right, calling up images of the milkshake-with-two-straws past that is at the core of Shake Shack’s appeal. Considered as food, though, they are pretty awful. Freezing turns them mealy, and no amount of oil or salt can make them taste like the fresh-cut potatoes that are standard issue at some burger joints now. Mr. Meyer runs one of the world’s great restaurant companies. Can’t one of his chefs show him how to make a decent French fry? Or help to upgrade the Shroom Burger? This item, a deep-fried portobello mushroom, erupts in a gushing flow of bland molten cheese that can scorch your hand when it’s hot and that grows even less appetizing as it cools. Though it has its fans, to me it is a bitter, slippery, 570-calorie throwback to the dark ages of meatless cooking, a don’t-care package for vegetarians. A restaurant with a menu as limited as Shake Shack’s should not have this many weak spots. Yet as with many of Mr. Meyer’s restaurants, the food is not the only attraction. It may not even be the primary one. Before Shack Shack, buying cheap burgers was rarely uplifting. Recently at a McDonald’s in Brooklyn, I waited to order as the people on the registers traded loud profanities with customers who were, I guess, their friends. A few months later, I went to the Shake Shack in Brooklyn with a friend’s 7-year-old daughter, who truly does seem to live on bread alone. Burgers and hot dogs were not doing it for her. “I want a grilled cheese,” she said firmly, and before I could tell her that it wasn’t on the menu, an order-taker leaned across the counter. “I can make you a grilled cheese,” he told her. They both smiled. One little piece of stagecraft at Shake Shack sums up the Meyer approach. It is handled so smoothly that I noticed it only after my 10th or 11th meal. When I reached the front of the line and made my request, I was, as always, handed a buzzer that vibrates when the food is ready. Then I was asked my name. As I made up an alias, it occurred to me for the first time that if you summon customers with a buzzer, you don’t need names. Except at Shake Shack. When I went up to get my takeout bag, the woman at the counter looked me in the eye and said, “Have a great night, Tony.” It was almost enough to make me stand in line again right then and there, and my name isn’t even Tony.      ",Shake Shack Struggles With Inconsistency,"['tossing', 'limp', 'politician’s', 'joke', 'arrival', 'brooklyn', 'meant', 'shake', 'shack', 'finally', '“hit', 'big',

262,Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria,★★★,2012-02-14,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/15/dining/reviews/il-buco-alimentari-e-vineria-nyc-restaurant-review.html,NoHo,"IS it crazy to fall for a restaurant because of a handful of chickpeas? Tumbling around with pickled currants under crunchy stalks of grilled octopus leg, these chickpeas were smaller and sweeter than usual, less starchy and grainy. Tasting one was like encountering a goldfinch if the only birds you’d ever seen were pigeons. Still, they were just chickpeas. Is it more logical to fall for a restaurant because of sliced bread in a basket? It was remarkable stuff, with the gradually unfolding nuances of taste that are achieved only through a slow and patient fermentation of dough with wild yeast. But other restaurants serve great bread. So let’s blame it on the salumi board, with satiny pink and white folds of lonza and capocollo and lardo that melt on the tongue into a lasting impression of salt, pig fat and time. The meats, cured and aged in the basement of Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria, are among the finest salumi in the country. In truth, there were a dozen little tastes that made me fall for this restaurant, which opened on Great Jones Street four months ago and has become New York’s most complete realization so far of a powerful myth: the simple and convivial spot that tastes just like Italy. That myth is an old one. You go to a small town in Umbria and find your way to some modest trattoria, or maybe a market with a few tables. Then lunch arrives, and the top of your head comes off. Meanwhile everybody around you has their elbows on the table and is acting like food this good is no big thing. And you say, why not? Why couldn’t we have a place just like this back home? The answer could fill a book, but the abridged version is that the modest trattoria can’t exist without the town. Fantastic elemental cooking requires fantastic elements, and those have to come from the baker, the grocer, the butcher and a dozen other local trades people and merchants. Still, the myth echoes in many places, from the pursed-lipped pieties of Alice Waters’s cathedral to the open-throated revels of Mario Batali’s pagan temple. Very few believers have tried to live out the myth by recreating the entire Italian village. But in a sense this is what Donna Lennard and her partners have done at Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria, and that is what makes it such an inviting place to have a pastry in the morning, a sandwich and a bowl of soup at noon, and a small feast at night. First, she built the grocery, the Alimentari part of the name, which carries those earthy chickpeas, along with salt crystals and olive oil with a pepper rasp that catches in the back of your throat. The shop seems at first to be the whole show. Keep walking. Down a few steps and past a colossal sculptural chandelier that would not look lost hanging in the Guggenheim rotunda is a bright, busy room where people are tearing at pieces of bread, eating off one another’s plates and talking with their elbows on the tables. Every cliché of the rustic Italian restaurant is on display here: the terra-cotta floor tiles, the handblown wine bottles, the rickety chairs, the overworked servers who are always rushing to somebody else’s table. Get their attention, though, and they will reliably guide you toward the good stuff on the menu and on the wine list. With six to eight selections from a number of producers, the wine list lets you drink your way through some bottles you might overlook on a more comprehensive list, like the spry Tyrolean whites of Garlider, or the spicy Calabrian reds of Odoardi. The sooner you order, the faster you’ll get a basket of Kamel Saci’s breads. He makes a dozen kinds, letting the dough gain flavor and structure during a rise that lasts at least 18 hours, sometimes twice that. His bread is not something you munch absent-mindedly while waiting for the first course. It is the first course. The Alimentari, with its $9 chocolate bars, might be too precious for everyday cooks. But it lets Justin Smillie, the chef of the space in the back (the Vineria), do amazing things with dishes that on paper sound commonplace. A few drops of specially imported Sicilian anchovy sauce, called colatura di alici, propel a roasted short rib for two to a height of deliciousness that short ribs rarely scale. With a forceful crust of peppercorns and coriander seeds, and crunchy bits of meat that are this restaurant’s answer to Kansas City’s burnt ends, this may be one of the best new dishes in town. Actually, since the same meat reappears as a sandwich filling at lunch, it may be two of the best new dishes. Bucatini alla gricia is a classic bare-bones production of pecorino, pepper and cured jowl. It is what Romans put together when there is nothing else in the house. When it’s cooked fearlessly, like it is here, you don’t need anything else in the house. Anyone still under the impression that dried pasta is inherently inferior to fresh will be quickly and permanently set straight. And if that doesn’t work, they should proceed to the spaghetti with bottarga to study the way the mullet roe sauce wraps itself around every strand, sheathing it in creamy maritime intensity. On the night I tried it, I only wished that the spaghetti had had a little more snap; sometimes the pasta station here seems to lose track of time, and a bowl of noodles that should be tensely coiled is allowed to unwind just a bit. Not that Mr. Smillie spends his days opening packages of spaghetti. He is, after all, the chef who was fired from a doomed East Village gastropub for spending too much at the Greenmarket. (More compatibly, he also cooked under Jonathan Waxman and Dan Silverman.) Somehow in February he hunted down the ripest persimmon I’ve tasted in a year, sending out wedges of it with a grilled quail that had not a hint of the liver overtones quail sometimes gets. And he found tiny beets to plant like tulip bulbs in a snowy drift of ricotta curds, with shiny tongues of white grapefruit on the side. Still, what makes Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria stand out are the products made in this village-inside-a-restaurant, and above all the cured meats. When Americans first conceived the myth of the great, simple Italian restaurant back home, the one thing that was most out of reach would have been salumi of this quality. Ms. Lennard first entered the cured-meats business about a decade ago at her first restaurant, Il Buco, a block away on Bond Street. At the time, only a few people in the United States were trying to replicate Italian-style salumi. As they set out to study a very intricate craft, they discovered that even fewer Americans were raising the old breeds of hogs whose thick sheath of sweet, creamy fat is essential to great salumi. If you somehow assembled the right skills and the right pork, you could still be stopped by the law. Ask Ms. Lennard about that. In 2006, the city’s health department told her that the temperatures in Il Buco’s basement curing facility were all wrong. “They made my guys chop all this gorgeous prosciutto, some of it two years old, into little pieces, and pour bleach over it, and put it into plastic bags, and poor Bernardo in the morning had to throw them into the garbage truck,” she said by phone. Bernardo Flores, the butcher in Ms. Lennard’s village, now has high-tech curing equipment in the basement of the new restaurant, imported from Italy at some expense. To devise a safety plan that keeps the inspectors at bay, she hired Christopher Lee, a longtime salumi maker at Chez Panisse. The work they are doing now, with pork from some of the best pig farmers on the East Coast, is the kind of exceptional reward Manhattan bestows on people who are stubborn, tireless and have the right timing. And on the rest of us, too, if we are lucky.",Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria - NYC - Restaurant Review,"['crazy', 'fall', 'handful', 'chickpea', 'tumbling', 'around', 'pickled', 'currant', 'crunchy',

263,Kutsher's Tribeca,★,2012-02-07,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/08/dining/reviews/kutshers-tribeca-nyc-restaurant-review.html,TriBeCa,"IF Kutsher’s Tribeca were a musical, it would be “Springtime for Hitler.” This is, after all, a restaurant whose business model rests on the idea that what New York has been missing is somewhere to go for upscale gefilte fish. It was opened in November by Zach Kutsher, whose family owns a faded Borscht Belt resort famous for stand-up shtick in the ballroom and eat-til-you-plotz meals in the dining room. When Mr. Kutsher told an interviewer that he hoped to continue the Catskills tradition “in a really modern, fun, hip, downtown kind of way,” it sounded so unlikely, that only one explanation made any sense. The place must have been designed to fail. But in TriBeCa, as in Max Bialystock’s theater, the surefire flop is a hit. On many nights, all 130 seats are taken with diners exploring a menu that updates the cuisine of Eastern European Jews. Strangest of all, everybody seems to be having a good time. Well, maybe not the ones who order the gefilte fish. But when the kitchen isn’t trying too hard, Kutsher’s turns all the jokes about Jewish cooking upside down. Which is to say: The food here’s not bad. And such big portions! Kutsher’s has other attractions, too. For one, it must be the least pretentious “nice” restaurant to open in Manhattan in years. A meal there does not begin with the ominous question, “Have you dined with us before?” But it may start with a server saying, “I’ll tell you what I tell everybody: you have to speak up because it gets loud in here, and I’m deaf in one ear.” There is no chef’s tasting menu, but there is a children’s menu. (Some care goes into it. If children are going to eat chicken fingers, they ought to be as crunchy and as juicy as the panko-crusted ones at Kutsher’s.) The dining room, designed by Rafael de Cárdenas with zigzags of blond wood and banquettes of charcoal leather, has a skinny-tie, Sinatra-at-the-Sands verve. But it is also spacious and open enough to appeal to the three-generational families that trooped in during Hanukkah. Zach Kutsher likes to circulate, working the tables as his grandfather and father must have done in their day. Gifted restaurateur-hosts can give you a sense that a Champagne cork is about to pop somewhere, maybe at your table. Mr. Kutsher’s homey brand of hospitality is a bit more like a can of Dr. Brown’s Cel-Ray soda. (Kutsher’s makes its own version of this, dry and refreshing.) But the presence of the man whose name is on the sign is welcome these days, when so many restaurants are run by interchangeable managers hired by chefs we’ve stopped hoping to see. Mark Spangenthal, the chef at Kutsher’s, won a reputation at the Screening Room and other restaurants for doing a lot with food that didn’t sound like much. Take, for instance, his matzo ball soup at Kutsher’s. Matzo ball preferences are deeply personal and beyond argument. Mr. Spangenthal aims for midrange fluffiness, so people who like a tightly compressed matzo ball that lands in the gut like a sock filled with pennies may not be satisfied. But they will certainly notice how flavorful these matzo balls are, and appreciate the rich broth, with its robust flavor and lip-smacking stickiness. The kitchen has been hard at work on that soup, but it has covered its tracks. The cooks labor over the charcuterie, too. The pink, soft, delicately hot-smoked veal tongue; the peppery, cold-smoked pastrami of duck breast; and the chopped chicken and duck liver, blended with head-spinning doses of chicken and duck schmaltz, all repay the effort. Not smoked on site, but still worth ordering, are the fat slices of pastrami salmon and nova lox. Sweet, meaty pickled herring is given two treatments, one of which reaches far beyond Eastern Europe and comes up with yuzu and wasabi. That dish, though, is the exception to the rule at Kutsher’s, where in general the more a plate looks like restaurant cooking, the less entertaining it is. The gefilte fish — made from halibut, padded out with bread, beaten to a fine paste, molded into tidy pucks and scrubbed of any perceptible seafood flavor, let alone a shiny gelatinous glaze — is the most striking example of overcompensation I’ve ever tasted, and the blandest. It is useful only as a sponge for the seasoned horseradish and the chrain, or beet relish, each energetically bright and pungent, and each deserving a better foil. Quinoa varnishkes forfeit what makes kasha varnishkes worth eating — toasty, earthy buckwheat — in favor of damp and listless quinoa. It clings to the floppy noodles like laundry lint. The most satisfying main course by far is the roast chicken with pletzel stuffing and mushrooms for two. Only the drumstick planted upright in the center of the platter, and the flavor that comes from brining the bird overnight, gives away the chef’s hand. In other main dishes, the effort increases and the returns diminish. A welter of mushrooms and caramelized onions and a knish that stands up on the plate like Devils Tower are distractions from a very tasty prime skirt steak. Salmon is hidden under a falafel crumble that lacks confidence, as if it knows it doesn’t belong. Reinventing flanken is a noble idea, but turning it into red-wine-braised short ribs with mashed potatoes, a dish served at a hundred other restaurants, may not be the ideal way to go about it. The cuisine of Ashkenazi Jews deserves a future beyond, as a friend put it, “self-referential jokes that fewer and fewer living people get.” Around town, a number of chefs are working on it. At JoeDoe and JoeDough in the East Village, Joe Dobias brings a non-Jewish perspective (and non-Jewish ingredients, like bacon) to dishes like chopped liver and tongue. He always seems to be asking, How much more flavor can this food handle? Noah Bernamoff and Aaron Israel, in their remarkable dinner menus at Mile End in Brooklyn, follow a more artisanal path, looking for handmade beauty in what was once rustic peasant food. At Kutsher’s, this cuisine is not so much rethought as retouched. You might wish that Mr. Spangenthal had a bit more faith in its grandmotherly charms, or that he had a vision of how to bring those charms into the modern world. But did you expect vision from a place with Milton Berle’s picture hanging by the door?",Kutsher’s Tribeca - NYC - Restaurant Review,"['kutsher’s', 'tribeca', 'musical', '“springtime', 'hitler”',

264,Parm,★★,2012-01-24,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/25/dining/reviews/parm-restaurant-review-nyc.html,Nolita,"IF the meatball parmigiana hero were a Southern dish, scholars from Chapel Hill, N.C., to Tallahassee, Fla., would hold academic conferences every six months just to talk about it. If it were a Florentine dish, the Four Seasons would have it on the menu for $95, or $55 without white truffles. But it is an Italian-American dish. It is at home on Wooster Street in New Haven, Atwells Avenue in Providence and Salem Street in Boston. It cannot be ordered at any restaurant that uses a truffle shaver. The closest thing to an academic symposium in its honor would be the lectures on the Food Network given by Prof. Giada De Laurentiis. Italian-American cuisine is not beloved by the arbiters of good taste, who celebrate risotto alla Milanese but ignore baked ziti, garlic bread, spaghetti and meatballs and lobster fra diavolo. “We’ve certainly moved, as a nation, beyond those dishes,” the food columnist Josh Ozersky declared on Time.com last year. In that case, I would like somebody to explain why my mind keeps drifting back to the meatball parmigiana hero at Parm. Like most things at Parm, which opened on Mulberry Street in November, it is prepared by cooks wearing white paper hats and is set before you in a red plastic basket. And, like most things at Parm, it is completely faithful to your memories while being much, much better than you remembered. At first, the sandwich exhibits nothing out of the ordinary. The tomato sauce, simple and summery, just seems to have been made by a good cook. The mozzarella and torn leaves of basil are fresh, which isn’t unheard of. The seeded roll is completely normal. The meatballs are not normal. For starters, they are not balls, they are patties. Anyone who has ever taken a bite of a meatball hero and watched one of the meatballs launch into orbit will recognize at once the significance of this deviation. Patties stay put. Most sub-shop meatballs are as hard as a 15-minute egg. The patties at Parm are not. Your teeth fall right through them. And when they do, you find something else that isn’t normal: the meat is juicy and rosy pink on the inside, the color of a perfectly cooked pork chop. The meatballs, made from veal, beef and sweet Italian sausage, are pink because they were braised at 180 degrees in a CVap low-temperature cooker for 40 minutes. They were braised at 180 degrees because Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone, the chefs behind Parm, studied fancy-restaurant techniques under chefs like Andrew Carmellini, Mario Batali and Wylie Dufresne. But the meatballs are sitting on a hero roll because Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Carbone are Italian-Americans who, once they had a restaurant of their own, decided to cook what is a kind of soul food for them and for millions of other Americans, even those with no Italian ancestors. This hybrid cuisine was created by immigrants who were, overwhelmingly, born in Southern Italy, at a time when the region was rural, overpopulated and desperately poor. More recently, when chefs and food writers studied authentic Italian food, they tended to travel to the wealthier north. Italian-American cooking, a bastardized cuisine with roots in an out-of-fashion region, was doubly uncool. Mr. Carbone, in a phone interview, said that when he was working at Babbo, “The sense I got was that the food of Italy was legitimate food, and the food Rich and I grew up eating was this weird thing we shouldn’t talk about.” Parm is essentially an expanded rendition of the lunch operation that the two chefs used to run at their first restaurant, Torrisi Italian Specialties, next door. (That restaurant now focuses all its energy on its prix fixe tasting menus.) Parm makes former Torrisi lunch standards like heroes and a marvelous array of vegetable side dishes. But the menu has grown to include, for instance, baked clams. Briny and just-cooked beneath crumbs of sesame breadsticks, they are like the meatballs in that all their divergences from the original are improvements. That’s the case with the fried calamari, too. Very small, very sweet and absolutely tender, they share their basket with two kinds of fried hot peppers that keep the squid from overstaying its welcome, as it sometimes can. With other recipes, Mr. Torrisi and Mr. Carbone do not tweak the original. They throw it under the bus. You may know pizza knots as the cold, lumpish chew toys that let pizzerias unload their stale dough. The warm pizza knots at Parm levitate, held down in their basket, it seems, only by a veil of grated cheese. The turkey sandwich at the old Torrisi persuaded many people, for the first time in their lives, to eat turkey more than once a year. It reappears at Parm (there would have been a riot had it not) served, as before, on a round semolina roll or on a hero. For the first time, it’s also on the menu as a platter, with a choice of baked ziti or salad on the side. The platters help Parm make its bid as a spot for dinner as well as for lunch. On that score, there is also a series of nightly specials, like a chopped steak on Tuesday to rival the one at Peter Luger and a zuppa di pesce on Friday. But even a clever cocktail list doesn’t quite succeed in making Parm as enticing by night as it is by day. At all hours, tables are set with paper place mat menus dominated by sandwiches. The whole mood of the place, in fact, isn’t especially attuned to the sense of theater New Yorkers like their restaurants to provide after dark. The old Torrisi managed to have it both ways. The shelves stocked with bags of pistachios and boxes of pasta looked utilitarian in the daylight and romantic when the votive candles were lighted. Parm has cartoony kitchen wallpaper and haphazard lighting that throws parts of the dining room into pools of shadow, and not the sexy kind. Would a few candles stuck into straw-covered Chianti flasks be pushing the joke too far? Maybe, but Mr. Carbone and Mr. Torrisi aren’t afraid to embrace a good cliché. Recall those chefs and food writers telling us that pasta is its own course, not a side dish, when you’re enjoying a springy cube of baked ziti with your chicken francese at Parm. Who cares what they do in Bologna?

265,Señor Frog’s,0 star,2015-12-29,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/30/dining/senor-frogs-review.html,Times Square Theatre District,"I was having my second Frogasm of the night when dinner got weird. Not that this or any other night at Señor Frog’s in Times Square was ever fully conventional. In point of fact, I had already danced in a conga line wearing a three-foot-high crown of yellow and orange balloons that made me look like Simba in a production of “The Lion King” staged by balloon animals. In further point of fact, I had also eaten a foot-long chili dog presented on a skateboard. Consider, too, that outside Señor Frog’s I had passed a sign promising that “Drinks go in, fun comes out!” (If nothing else, I was looking forward to seeing the restrooms.) The drink that was going in, a deviant margarita, came in a plastic cup that had a long, thrusting, curved, ridged shaft, ostensibly modeled on the trunk of a palm tree but impossible to grasp without thinking: “ribbed for her pleasure.” Still, total weirdness didn’t kick in until the ice cream truck parade. It began with an air-raid siren followed by a loudspeaker announcement: “All Señor Frog’s staff report to the kitchen!” We had said we were celebrating a birthday. (A lie.) Employees began marching across the stage, blowing whistles and waving glowsticks. Others were bearing aloft two ice cream trucks, each the size of a picnic cooler. Then a server in a light-up Santa cap stood on our table and sang, along with his colleagues, “Froggy, froggy birthday. Na-na-na-na-na. This is how we do it. Na-na-na-na-na.” (Another verse is sometimes added when it’s time to eat the cake: “Put it in your mouth, put it in your mouth.”) What happened next was captured in a fast-moving video that, like the Zapruder film, I have watched dozens of times. There is a piece of paper on a stick planted in a birthday cake. Then it is on fire. The birthday boy tries to blow it out. He fails. A powerful wind comes out of nowhere. It raises sparks from the fire. The birthday boy’s balloon hat starts to tremble, then shoots straight up in the air like an Apollo rocket. It hits the ceiling. Chaos reigns. Many thoughts went through my head at that moment. I wondered, briefly, why anyone trusted me with an expense account. But the dominant idea was: Señor Frog’s, where have you been all my life? I came to Señor Frog’s later than most of its customers. Founded in Mexico in 1969, the chain thrives in Caribbean beach towns and caters to college students on spring break who will fake orgasms on stage to win a margarita. I wasn’t one of them. My most memorable spring break was whiled away in my room reading “The Sorrows of Young Werther” in German. This did not get me invited to many orgasm contests, but I was inclined to think the time with Goethe had been well spent until Señor Frog’s opened on 42nd Street last summer. For the first time, I wished I had some memories of the chain. So when I ate there, I brought people who had gone to Señor Frog’s in their wilder years. Unfortunately, none of them recalled anything about it, either. One volunteered that he had climbed onto a giant speaker at the Cancún branch and danced furiously, a fact he knows only because witnesses later told him about it. “I think I went on a water slide,” said a woman who had also unwound in Cancún. “But I can’t remember where it ended.” “In jail,” her husband said. There is no water slide at the Times Square location, which offers a more sober and family-friendly version of the Frog experience. (“Do not show underwear,” the dress code posted at the door warns.) In early evening the place is filled with children, like the two who got up to sing “Let It Go” and gamely karaoked away when a blizzard of confetti snow erupted from the foot of the stage. Later the crowd got older, with more New Yorkers and fewer tourists than I had expected. Cocktails in embarrassing palm-tree vessels abounded, but I never saw anybody get really tanked, myself included, even after multiple Frogasms. All the mixed drinks seemed tame, and the shot that a server squirted into my open mouth when I hopped by in the conga line tasted like orange Gatorade. Señor Frog’s is not a good restaurant by most conventional measures, including the fairly basic one of serving food. One night I got just two of the half-dozen appetizers I had asked for. Another time, the starters showed up on schedule, but after nearly two hours the main courses still had not appeared. “What happened to our food?” we finally asked. “That’s what I’m wondering!” our server said brightly. “Like, where is it?” Getting just half of what you order at Señor Frog’s can be a blessing if it’s the right half. The chili, rich and chocolate-brown, does just what you want it to do for the thick, juicy hot dog or the nachos, whose chips were flaccid one night but crunchy another. Honey-sriracha wings, which ping-pong between sweet and spicy, are preferable to the Buffalo wings, which taste like a mild case of acid reflux. The ribs meet chain-restaurant standards, and so does the pulled pork sandwich once you scrape off the questionable coleslaw. You can get far worse guacamole at far more serious restaurants. (All other restaurants are more serious than Señor Frog’s.) The Reuben is good, for some reason. Most other things I tried may as well have stayed in the kitchen, except the chicken enchiladas, which should have been sent back to Cancún. I thought they tasted like tuna, but a more acute observer said the flavor was like pork sprinkled with fish food. But … here, hold my Frogasm, I need to stand on the speakers and dance. Because I had more fun at Señor Frog’s than at almost any other restaurant that has opened in the last few years. True, it’s a particular kind of fun: compulsory hilarity, scheduled spontaneity, a scripted theater of the inane with random outbreaks of mediocre Tex-Mex. Señor Frog’s brand of fun is so mindless that it’s embarrassing to give in to at first, but eventually everybody I brought there did give in, maybe because we’re all so desperate to let go a little bit. In the 1980s and ’90s it was a cliché to say restaurants had become theater. Hardly anyone says that now, because it’s not true anymore. A few chefs and restaurateurs still understand that people go out to have a good time; Daniel Humm would serve a chili dog on a skateboard if he had thought of it first. But too many restaurants have become church without the singing and costumes. The next time you’re in one of those places, try starting a conga line. If you’re asked to leave, there’s a place in Times Square that’s ready to welcome you as long as you keep your underwear out of sight.","At Señor Frog’s in Times Square, It’s Spring Break

266,Le Turtle,★,2016-04-05,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/dining/le-turtle-restaurant-review.html,Lower East Side,"The premodern look in restaurants and bars that has prevailed for the last decade or so is marked by salvaged wood; fireplaces that may or may not function; bare electric bulbs dimmed to mimic gaslight; warrens of small rooms hung with framed lithographs and, sometimes, taxidermy; servers in humorless aprons or lumberjack shirts or both; wine drunk from pickle jars; and short, historically minded cocktails stirred by men who trim their facial hair into antiquated contours. The style is distinct from the current Scandinavian aesthetic of twigs and fronds and rocks, but overlaps with it. Both lift the handmade and natural and imperfect above the machine-made and synthetic and shiny-new. They try to fill a void in our digitized lives, offering ancient virtues like community and integrity amid the pixels. But styles age. The premodern look increasingly appears to be a studiously crafted illusion — all the harder to swallow because it asks us to see it not as mere set dressing but as the outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual purity. Sooner or later, a trend-conscious restaurateur had to realize that the 19th century had overstayed its welcome. It happens to have been Taavo Somer, whose first restaurant, Freemans, was the most complete and successful statement of the antler aesthetic. Together with Carlos Quirarte, owner of the artfully rustic cafe the Smile, he opened what they call a “French new wave” restaurant on the corner of Chrystie and Rivington Streets in December. It goes by the gloriously fake-Gallic name Le Turtle. Replacing the artificially genuine with genuine artifice, Le Turtle’s dining room mixes building materials that have nothing in common but their shiny new surfaces. Glossy, unchipped marble sits next to raw concrete. Metallic vertical blinds of a kind last seen in “Miami Vice” hang in the front window. Mylar that looks as if it had been taped up five minutes before the doors were unlocked covers one wall. Another is sheeted with unfinished plywood with circles cut out by a jigsaw. A third wall is a two-way mirror. Stand behind it, near the restrooms, and you can spy invisibly on the dining room like a security guard at Studio 54. It’s like a private joke that’s funny even though I suspected I didn’t quite entirely get it. I felt the same way about the small table set in a half-hidden nook a few steps above the bar; I couldn’t imagine eating dinner with another adult up there in Rapunzel’s tower. I have no idea why the servers wear gray jumpsuits that make them look as if they could change your oil after they refill your water glass. At least I knew that no matter how fashionable the other diners looked, I would never be the worst-dressed person at Le Turtle. “Who designed your jumpsuit?” a woman at my table asked our server. “I don’t know,” he said. He didn’t sound happy. “They’re very hot now that it’s spring. I hope they give us something else to wear in the summer.” “Like rompers?” I asked. He seemed to flinch. Sit inside Le Turtle, and you can almost hear a new page in Manhattan dining turning over. “Almost” because you can’t hear much of anything above the Eurodisco and the Francophone covers of Nancy Sinatra and the Beach Boys. The chef, Greg Proechel, who comes to Le Turtle from Blanca and Mr. Nilsson, a short-lived tasting-menu experiment in Long Island City, Queens, seems to have no idea how to translate the French new wave into edible form. Intelligently, he stays away from Godard references; there is no À Bout de Soufflé au Chocolat. But he also stays away from anything you could really call French cooking. He does have an excellent contender in the city’s roast-chicken sweepstakes, a bird that once pecked and strutted in Pennsylvania. To show off its barnyard bona fides, it is initially presented in its entirety, head tucked in and feet stretched out on top of a smoldering nest of hay. The first time one of these platters went by, one of my guests looked up and said, “Do you smell pot?” I didn’t taste any smoke in the meat, though I did taste some sugar from the brine. Other than that, Le Turtle’s chicken is great. The skin has the lacquered crackle of Peking duck, and once the bird has been carved, it comes back with all the parts, so you can gnaw on the feet if you wish, though there’s more satisfaction to be had in burrowing into the fatty heart-shaped nugget where the tail feathers were once plugged in. Servers will tell you that quantities of this chicken are limited when they recommend it, which they invariably do. This is one restaurant where the dishes suggested by the house tend to be the best things on the menu. The poached lobster, for instance, is juicy and well flavored. It was slightly chewy when I had it, but I still liked experimentally pairing it with the mix-and-match accompaniments on the plate, the crunchy tarragon dust, cubes of Asian pear and spicy strips of pickled ají amarillo. The impressively smooth chicken liver mousse is as good as the servers promise it will be. So is the kohlrabi soup, unlikely as that sounds, served with wonderful cubes of browned lamb bacon. They’re also right about the assortment of mushrooms on a spookily good sauce of brie and oysters; the mushrooms are splattered with black truffle shavings that taste wonderful, even if they do make the dish look like a bowl of potting soil. Stray too far from the recommended dishes, though, and you could end up with the peculiarly unappealing seared foie gras with a fluffy, cloying lemon sauce and something that looks and tastes like cornflake crumbs. Leathery rectangles of squid had very little to say to oroblanco, a cousin of grapefruit. And while Mr. Proechel gets some deep flavors out of his braised oxtail, he’s had the meat trimmed into long sections that are interwoven with equally long sections of connective tissue; after awhile, it starts to feel more like dissection than eating. The best of the abbreviated dessert menu is the hazelnut financier, busted up into chunks and surrounded with spicy pear purée and yogurt sorbet, among other treats. You can drink wine from Burgundy and Bordeaux or from more obscure regions like Côtes Catalanes on the handy, affordable, single-sheet list. You can’t get a cocktail right now. This will change later this week when the hard-liquor license comes through. At the moment, though, the absence of bitters and the men who obsess over them is another way in which Le Turtle can give you a one-night vacation from all the aspects of New York dining you’re just starting to realize are getting old.","At Le Turtle, a French New Wave You Can Eat","['premodern', 'look', 'bar', 'prevailed', 'last', 'decade', 'marked', 'salvaged', 'wood', 'fireplace', 'function',

267,Back Forty,0 star,2012-05-29,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/30/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-back-forty-and-back-forty-west.html,East Village,"AS SoHo began to feel less like a New York neighborhood and more like a suburban shopping mall with two lanes of taxis running down the middle, there was Savoy, a sane oasis on the quiet corner of Prince and Crosby Streets. Even when years passed between visits, I felt better knowing Savoy was there. Then one day last June, it wasn’t there anymore after 21 years, and the city felt a little smaller. Some of the sting was taken out when Peter Hoffman, the chef and owner, promised to reincarnate the place in a new form along the lines of his other restaurant, Back Forty. Opened on Avenue B in 2007, Back Forty has become an East Village go-to place for grass-fed burgers, sustainably raised pork shanks and vegetables straight off the back of a farm truck. Back Forty West isn’t a total clone. It’s more like a fraternal twin, sharing the logo and the look of the first place, along with a few menu items and an overall philosophy. Mr. Hoffman’s move toward a casual format that can be easily replicated is, of course, one that makes sense to more and more restaurateurs. But this time around, the familiar story has a strange ending. Over the last month or so, I’ve had a string of extremely pleasant meals at second-generation Back Forty West, and a succession of sloppy, careless ones at the place it was modeled after. It’s as if Back Forty has gone into a long, jealous sulk, like a family cat that responds to the arrival of a new baby by hiding under the couch and scratching at anybody who gets too close. Unlike the original, Back Forty West is open all day, an agreeable corner cafe that pours coffee by 8 a.m. and fries chicken to serve over waffles at lunch. The neighborhood has embraced it, giving the place a confidence and sparkle that take it well beyond the routine farm-to-table tropes. A filling bowl of Brazilian fisherman’s stew loaded with squid and shellfish was bright green with cilantro and bracingly spicy. (Eat locally, cook globally.) Squid played to even better effect in another dish, this one inspired by Spain. Seared on a plancha until it was just done and not a moment longer, exactly the way squid has to be cooked, it was served with smashed fingerlings and with butter dyed rusty orange by pimentón. Butter, pepper, squid, potatoes: elemental and hard to argue with. Mr. Hoffman has installed a smoker on the second floor of Back Forty West, near where the small bar used to be, and the restaurant makes excellent, judicious use of it. A smoked chicken leg was so pink and juicy that a friend called it chicken ham; pork ribs in a Carolina-style vinegar sauce might have been a little more tender, but the low-key interplay of smoke and pig fat was just right. More than any one dish he created, an early and steadfast loyalty to Greenmarket produce defined Mr. Hoffman as a chef. So it’s the nicest kind of nonsurprise to find that Back Forty West handles vegetables with care and imagination. Dressing asparagus spears with rhubarb vinaigrette struck me at first as seasonal overkill, but it was in fact a lovely pairing. I also got a kick out of the restaurant’s tribute to the Caesar salad, with leaves of grilled kale, white anchovies and, in the role often played by stale croutons, some irresistible fried chickpeas. The menu at Back Forty West is organized in a way I’ve never seen before and hope not to see again: by eating utensil. If you have ever walked into a restaurant thinking, “Boy, I don’t know if I should be trusted with a knife tonight,” this is the place for you. Simply skip over the “Fork & Knife” section in favor of plain old “Fork,” or “Spoon & Ladle” or “Hands.” Unmasking the main courses in this jumble takes bit of sleuthing, but it’s obvious that the “Spoon” category is for desserts. A chocolate cake with hazelnuts was more gummy than chocolaty, but I’d order the cookie plate again (and then make sure I kept all the bacon-fat snickerdoodles for myself). And everyone seems to like the caramel pudding under an inch or two of marshmallow, too. The same dessert is served at Back Forty, yet it isn’t the same at all. In SoHo, the marshmallow is caramelized on top, giving it a tinge of bitterness that helps offset the sweetness, and the pudding is very slightly salty. In the East Village, nothing stands in the way of the sugar rush. One spoonful is more than enough. Direct comparisons between the two restaurants were nearly always punishing to the older sibling. The grass-fed burger at Back Forty West, on a soft potato roll, had plenty of character. The one at Back Forty, served on a crumbly sesame-seed bun, had almost none. Back Forty West had the bright idea to grill pea pods with olive oil and smoked sea salt and serve them whole; you pop the peas into your mouth like edamame. Back Forty had the less bright idea to grill whole fava pods; you pop out the beans, then have to separate them from their gray skins. Stranger still, the fava pods were plopped on top of some (quite good) hummus. It’s hard to imagine this ungainly dish on the menu at Back Forty West, and not just because you need your hands and a fork to eat it. This kind of inattention to detail was evident in every meal I had at Back Forty. Grilled whole onions and chard leaves with their stems intact were so undercooked, they were difficult to cut with a knife. Half the food, from French fries to a yogurt-dill sauce, seemed to have been tossed into an open barrel of salt before serving, and food that ought to have looked beautiful, like a beet salad, had been slammed carelessly down on the plate, as if to punish it. Some diners look at the vanishing numbers of places like Savoy and mourn the passing of the style of dining they represent. It’s no contradiction to share that sadness while celebrating the rise of places like Back Forty West, which make fine local products into everyday food. And Back Forty? At the moment, it is the cautionary tale, proving that simplicity isn’t so simple, and that everyday food needs to be handled with care, every day.",Back Forty and Back Forty West,"['soho', 'began',

268,Empellón Cocina,★★,2012-04-24,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/25/dining/reviews/empellon-cocina-in-the-east-village.html,East Village,"THE danger in writing about the smart and often inspired cooking at Empellón Cocina, Alex Stupak’s free-associating mash note to the food of Mexico, is that other chefs might get the idea that anybody can do what he has done. Mr. Stupak first took up Mexican food last year, in a Greenwich Village restaurant he called Empellón. He added Taqueria to that first restaurant’s name when he opened Empellón Cocina in the East Village in February. In both cases, Empellón means a push or a shove, as in the push you’d give a child who isn’t sure he is ready to swim. Mr. Stupak is on both ends of that push. A 32-year-old former pastry chef, he has read the classic cookbooks and spent some time in Oaxaca and the Yucatán, but he hasn’t studied this intricate and endlessly complex cuisine with an anthropologist’s intensity, as Rick Bayless and Diana Kennedy have. If everybody with a similarly brief education opened a Mexican restaurant, the world would be full of foolish empanadas, pretentious moles and goofy adobos. But some beginning students of a language can wake up to discover they’ve been dreaming in it at night. At its best, Mr. Stupak’s cooking at Empellón Cocina resembles the food of Mexico the way a dream resembles life. Everything looks familiar, except that the light seems to be coming from a different direction, and did that river always run right through the bedroom? When you slice into a gordita, does it always gush with warm egg yolk? The one here does, the deep-fried flying saucer of masa giving way to the yellow yolk that curls around smoked plantains and a crumble of chorizo. Is the beef tendon in a bowl of menudo, the tripe stew, always as puffy and crisp as a snack chip? Here it is; you crunch it between mouthfuls of manila clams dunked in the spicy organ-rich menudo. Mr. Stupak achieves surprisingly few of his surreal effects through the tools he helped pioneer as a pastry chef at WD-50 and Alinea, where he laughed at the laws of physics. His wizard’s cap was packed with envelopes of agar-agar, carrageenan and other chemicals for building the suspensions known as hydrocolloids. Now he’s devoting himself, almost exclusively, to just one hydrocolloid, and it’s been around for ages: masa. In this kitchen, the ground corn is coaxed into marvelous shapes and textures. Just after you sit down in the fairly plain and unbuttoned dining room, somebody will ask if you want guacamole. The correct answer is yes, please, and not just because this rough mash of ripe avocados studded with pistachios is a fantastic riff on the theme, even a fairly faithful one. Say yes because with that guacamole comes a small box of hearty masa crisps, flat crackers that have a baked texture but a fried flavor. How the kitchen does it is not obvious. I know that straining is the secret of making the masa in a Yucatecan tamal colado so creamy and fluffy it is like a species of spongecake. But questions of technique weren’t on my mind very often, and neither were questions of authenticity. Very little on the menu pretends to be traditional. When I ate at Empellón Cocina, I concentrated on the flavors. I couldn’t quite believe how much a spackle of bittersweet mole poblano paste had to offer roasted carrots, or what a lovely job yogurt did of bringing them together. I admired the tense balance of chile heat in a tartare of Wagyu skirt steak that I spooned into a warm flour tortilla for a do-it-yourself taco. And I was thrilled to follow the smoky, throaty call of mezcal as it wove its way through cured ocean trout and through any number of cocktails, like one called the Darkest Corner of Oaxaca. (It’s not as menacing as all that, but it is worth keeping an eye on.) Watching Mr. Stupak try to pull all this off gives you the giddy feeling you get watching great actors improvise. The adrenaline charge of seeing pure inspiration powers you past the stammers and the stops. And there are a few stammers. After the sharp clarity of the guacamole, a salad of avocados buried under toasted grains feels unfocused and unrewarding. On the night I had it, a kind of queso fundido made with lobster and tetilla cheese was buttery and rich, but also so watery that eating it became a three-napkin job. In fact, the simple act of eating the food was often a source of frustration at Empellón Cocina. Mr. Stupak describes what he is up to here as “Mexican tapas,” and servers encourage you to share everything on what are essentially bread plates. With just one other person, this works out reasonably well. At a table for four, things can break down. An elegant and sinuous sea urchin mousse between two wavy walls of masa looked as if a grenade had landed on it once it had been carved into four portions. And I suspect that I missed the full impact of that menudo, or of the marine broth that came with poached oysters, when I was lapping them off elfin plates that held the remains of at least one previous course. Mr. Stupak is not the only chef who serves fastidiously prepared food and then encourages you to treat it as if it were a bowl of popcorn. It’s hard to believe these chefs ever sit down and eat the way they want us to do. If they did, they’d notice the way temperatures drop, flavors muddy, contrasts drift away. Sharing didn’t harm the desserts, the department of Lauren Resler, Mr. Stupak’s wife and his partner in the restaurant. In particular, the vanilla marquesote, a crunchy cake served with dehydrated oranges and café con leche ice cream, is the kind of sweet you need to keep close at hand if you are with fast eaters. But my misgivings about the so-called tapas format don’t change my feeling that Empellón Cocina is an exciting restaurant where even the dishes that don’t quite add up can be fun. Taste, admire, share if you must, argue if you like (one Mexican-food fan wishes Mr. Stupak would stop putting sugar in salsa), but please: Don’t try this at home.",Empellón Cocina in the East

269,Fung Tu,★★,2015-05-12,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/13/dining/restaurant-review-fung-tu-on-the-lower-east-side.html,Lower East Side,"It can’t have been much fun for Jonathan Wu, the chef and an owner of Fung Tu, when Mission Chinese Food set up shop virtually around the corner in December. For his first year in business down in the headwaters of Orchard Street, just off East Broadway’s warren of Fujianese places, Mr. Wu was the only Asian-American chef plundering Chinese traditions to weave a modern cuisine of his own imagining. Then Danny Bowien showed up a couple of blocks away with his kung pao pastrami and his Mylar rainbow wall and his “Twin Peaks” hallway, and fanboys and fangirls turned cartwheels on the sidewalks. Sure, in theory, the more the merrier, a rising tide lifts all boats, and so on, but Fung Tu was now in the shadow of the only hipster-Chinese restaurant that anybody wanted to talk about. As a friend who likes both places put it, there must be moments when Mr. Wu feels like Donovan in “Don’t Look Back.”  Fung Tu didn’t help its own cause by getting off to a tentative start in 2013. A dinner about a month in held as many timid nonstarters (sunchokes and mushrooms uneventfully inhabiting a steamed bun) as eye-opening treats (the egg roll of pork belly and juicy olives stuffed into a delicately fried garlic-chive crepe). Some early reviews fell between nonplused and underwhelmed. Ligaya Mishan, in a Hungry City column, was more taken with the food than other critics were, but she thought some flavors never quite showed up. The sound of heads being scratched must have carried to the kitchen, because Mr. Wu has adjusted. Over three meals since the late winter, I rarely had any doubt what he was getting at. Mr. Wu is a two-year veteran of Per Se, and his cooking has always relied on nuance. It still does, but now the accents have been filled in. When something is supposed to be salty or spicy, it is. When salt and spice aren’t on the dance card, farmers’ market vegetables and other main ingredients step up. Dishes that were great from the start, like the duck-stuffed Medjool dates that drink up smoke until they taste like date bacon, are at least as good now. Some may be better. And many of the new dishes are a reason for anybody who wrote off Fung Tu after the early days to put a return visit at the top of the calendar. See, for instance, the China-quiles, which was devised for brunch but stays in its pajamas until dinner. The template is ma po tofu, but the bean curd has been replaced by a smoky egg custard so smooth and silky it almost parts itself when your spoon gets close. Over that goes a Sichuan pork sauce that makes your mouth hum and burn, studded with transparently thin yucca chips for crunch. On the opening menu, a similar but more fainthearted pork sauce was ladled over a white pile of doughy, bland dumpling knots. The sauce on the China-quiles is so much more delicious that you couldn’t call it an evolution; it’s more like an intervention. The Sichuan two-step occurs again in a vinaigrette that dresses cured Spanish mackerel, carved into elegant slices that almost look like small anchovies. With tart little buttons of pickled hon shimeji mushrooms, Mr. Wu shows that he can pluck the hot, sour and salty notes as cleanly and precisely as Jean-Georges Vongerichten. He can also bend classic European spring flavors in his direction, tossing asparagus, morels and peas with ricotta gnocchi that receive a whiff of Gorgonzola from doufu ru, fermented tofu.  Fried soft-shell clams appeared on the menu when spring got into gear. Their breading was a shade too thick, but Mr. Wu surrounded them with flavors that could make a clam rake taste good. First, he dusted them with dehydrated tomatoes, dried ginger and ground chiles, a blend that is a staple of Indian curries but becomes newly exciting in powdered form. Fermented black beans echoed the blend’s sour-salty theme. Fried clams want tartar sauce; Fung Tu’s is seasoned with star anise, charred ginger and other aromatics from a bowl of pho. The snack menu at Fung Tu does more than pad the check; it lets Mr. Wu come out and play. There are chips and dip, in the form of shrimp chips, shiny with hot oil, and a soft, rich, angry-red ’nduja. A sweet throat-burning mustard sauce was a little too intense for simple chicken wings, but the pairing of gently briny smoked mussels with scallion oil was so fresh and lively that I would like to take back what I said about smoked mussels at my parents’ cocktail parties. That doesn’t mean you’re in the clear yet, smoked oysters. Many wines would butt heads with such delicate, oblique cooking. Sommeliers overprescribe Gewürtztraminer for Chinese food, while laypeople tend to self-medicate with Tsingtao. Jason Wagner, Fung Tu’s drinks overlord and general manager, has better ideas. His very affordable list is packed with cryptic names like mondeuse and macabeu, which he will gladly decode. An enthusiastic partisan of sherry, he is worth listening to when he suggests a Gran Barquero amontillado that tastes like toasted hazelnuts dipped in caramel for the thin-cut fried pork chops with fermented mustard greens, a Chinatown classic here given a tangy, syrupy sherry-maple soy glaze.  The service in the beginning was a little tightly wound for a restaurant that sat between Success Hosiery and Yat Sing Trading Inc. Now the staff has relaxed into the setting, where handsome wood booths and straight-backed banquettes are illuminated by bare chrome-dipped bulbs caged in polyhedral glass webs made by Mr. Wu’s wife, the jewelry designer Jane D’Arensbourg. The bar up front provides an unhectic cove where you can decompress with cocktails that locate the middle ground between tradition and invention. Not usually the grandest of finales in Chinese restaurants, desserts, under Mr. Wu and his chef de cuisine, John Matthew Wells, are given a little more thought at Fung Tu, though they still seem like stepchildren to the rest of the menu. There are fried buns with fruit; a white chocolate mousse, not too sweet, with smooth, firm rhubarb slices; and peanut butter-chocolate truffles rolled in sesame seeds. When I first tasted one of those truffles, in 2013, it was chalk-dry and bitter, and went back to its plate after one small nibble. Like many things about Fung Tu, it turned out to be worth a second look.",Fung Tu on the Lower East Side,"['can’t', 'much', 'fun', 'jonathan', 'wu', 'owner', 'fung', 'tu', 'mission', 'chinese', 'set',

270,Meat Hook Sandwich,★,2015-04-14,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/15/dining/restaurant-review-meat-hook-sandwich-in-williamsburg-brooklyn.html,Williamsburg,"A normal sandwich was what I had in mind one day in January. Normal is not what Meat Hook Sandwich does, though, so I ended up eating something that I would call the greatest cheeseburger I’ve ever tasted if not for the inconvenient fact that it wasn’t a cheeseburger. What I ate was a chopped cheese sandwich, also known — in the very small patch of the United States where it is known at all — as chop cheese. This sandwich rarely strays from its natural habitat, the bodegas of Harlem and the Bronx. Filled with griddled ground beef in a cloak of melted American cheese, it is a distant relative of the Philadelphia cheesesteak and of the tavern sandwich, an Iowa standby that also goes by the irresistible name “loose meat.” In Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Meat Hook Sandwich stirs in some pickle relish and piles the meat-cheese-relish amalgam onto a sesame-seed semolina roll. The relish makes every bite spicy and sweet, while the cheese makes the meat, already potent and rich, extra hot and slick. The architecture of the chopped cheese avoids a common if generally overlooked flaw of many cheeseburgers: the tendency of the cheese to drift upward from the patty and incorporate itself into the upper bun.  Discovering this rearranged cheeseburger at the sandwich shop should not have been a shock. The place opened last year as a satellite of the Meat Hook, a butcher store a few blocks away whose bacon-cheeseburger sausage has made numerous and rewarding (for me) trips from the display case to my grill. Behind the counter, brawny women and men are always breaking down entire hogs and sides of beef from livestock raised on virtuous nearby farms. The economics of whole-animal butchery demand ingenuity in selling off the less-popular cuts and scraps. House-made cold cuts were an obvious sideline. As mortadella, ham and pâté amassed, the omens began to gesture toward sandwiches.  The Meat Hook’s restaurant, on Lorimer Street, does not look expensively decorated; the neon sign spelling “sandwich” in big white block capitals was a hand-me-down from another sandwich business. This hangs on one of two brick walls painted white. Fourteen backless metal stools surround exactly three tables. Sandwiches are ordered at a counter and delivered to the table in red plastic baskets. This is the extent of what you would call “service,” except on Wednesday nights, when $25 buys a Meat Hook steak, an accompaniment (sometimes a salad) and as many bottles of cheap beer as you can drink without calling attention to yourself. The beers, Miller High Life or Pacifico, are carried to the dining room by a butcher moonlighting as a cook doubling as a waiter. The sandwich concern was founded by three pillars of the butcher shop: Brent Young, a Pittsburgh native with a lifelong hoagie fixation; Ben Turley, a rehabilitated restaurant cook; and Tom Mylan, who recently wriggled off the Meat Hook. They put a veteran Brooklyn chef named Gil Calderon in charge of the kitchen. Try to picture the lunch a hungry young butcher would dream about after spending the morning hunched over a large animal with a hacksaw, and you have a good idea what you are in for. There are no elegant tricorner panini, and nothing you can eat with one hand while holding a pinot grigio in the other. The cooks listen to their lizard brains. Simultaneously, a higher sandwich intelligence is at work, one that understands the crucial role of contrast and the life-giving spark of condiments. Or, as Mr. Turley and Mr. Calderon recently put it, “Don’t think of your sandwich as a Beyoncé, think of it as a Destiny’s Child.” The kitchen knows that even great roast beef, which the Meat Hook’s is, needs backup. It needs a tangy, salty slice of Cheddar and horseradish sauce. Shredded lettuce for its juicy crispness and then, for a savory crackle, papery wheels of fried red onions. Finally, the bootylicious ingredient: a scattering of potato that seems to have been scraped off the bottom of a pan of hash browns.  One sandwich is based on a hunch that roasted pork would benefit greatly from a creamy tuna sauce, vitello tonnato-style. (It does, and if the sauce is applied too lightly, the sandwich can be a little dry.)  Another is a fairly straight-up Italian hero that, for once, starts with first-rate cold cuts (mortadella, pepperoni, soppressata, all from the Meat Hook), then hits them with caponata, raw onions, some unusually good pickled peppers and lardo whipped with roasted garlic. Would the flavors of the meats come through more clearly if they were folded and tucked to give them room to breathe, rather than being stacked up like plywood? Or is that a question that only a nonbutcher would ask? The Vegetarian Option is essentially a semolina roll heaped with all the garnishes from the other sandwiches. No meat intrudes on the fun, although the kitchen bends the rules slightly and slides in a purpose-made beet-parsnip-carrot hummus, without which the sandwich would probably taste like a heap of garnishes. In an expert piece of expectations-setting, Meat Hook Sandwich advertises that the Vegetarian Option is “better than you’d expect.” This was absolutely correct; the sandwich is impressively complex and still satisfying. If I have to choose between that and the hot chicken sandwich, though, vegetarianism is going to get a quick shove into moving traffic. An ode to the Nashville specialty known for producing copious tears of pain and ecstatic, speechless reveries, the hot chicken at Meat Hook Sandwich is made from hot-sauce-brined thigh meat with the deep flavor of a barnyard bird. Fried chicken sandwiches are usually made with pallid cutlets, so the intensity is startling. On top of that, there is sweet pickled celery and dried-chile schmaltz. This is chicken that can bring your whole day to a dead stop for a few minutes.  Next to the order counter is a small blackboard that is always worth scanning. This is where specials like the chopped cheese appear. Around St. Patrick’s Day, there was tender corned beef on seeded pumpernickel with a devastatingly rich coating of Welsh rarebit sauce. Recently, I’ve found a fine chipotle-fueled sloppy Joe.  I wish I could tell you more about the steak and beer special, but when I tried to get it on the first day of this month, I was met instead by another rearranged cheeseburger. “April Fools,” Mr. Young said. Two all-beef patties had been nacho-fied with Tex-Mex-style queso sauce, pickled jalapeños and crushed tortilla chips. If this is what butchers daydream about, I need a cleaver.","Meat Hook Sandwich in Williamsburg, Brooklyn","['normal', 'sandwich', 'mind', 'january', 'normal', 'meat', 'hook', 'sandwich', 'though',

271,Kao Soy,★,2015-02-10,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/11/dining/restaurant-review-kao-soy-in-red-hook-brooklyn.html,Red Hook,"Only half of the tables inside Kao Soy were taken, but the delivery guys were coming and going through the door on Van Brunt Street every few minutes. The December wind off the harbor that was shaking the little brick buildings in Red Hook, Brooklyn, was keeping everybody at home, ordering pad see ew and massaman curry from the new neighborhood Thai place. This turned out to be lucky for me. Five minutes later, I was facing down a platter of shrimp with skinny dried chiles over torn lobes of sweet pomelo that had a flaky coating of toasted coconut and crushed peanuts. Soon after that came a big bowl of rice noodles, shrimp and round Asian eggplants in a mild green curry that seemed to get more and more appealing. This arrived with a separate plate of dried anchovies, boiled eggs with almost-solid yolks and a fresh red chile sauce that had definite intent to harm. Then the kao soy turned up, the dish I’d come to try. This is a pale-yellow coconut milk curry from Chiang Mai with submerged noodles and a chicken leg, and, above the surface, fried egg noodles going off in all directions with strands of green-papaya fritters. There was another condiment plate for the kao soy, of course. I was eating all of this as fast as I could, and as the overall deliciousness began to sink in I started eating even faster. It wasn’t fast enough, though, and soon the plates covered every inch of available surface area and I needed to slide an empty table next to mine. In fact, I ran out of space every time I went to Kao Soy. Some blame must be given to the plates, which are vast white things with rims almost as wide as the sidewalks on Park Avenue. Some goes to Thailand, where a meal may start with half a dozen salads and sticky rice, and where even the condiments seem to have condiments. Some goes to the tables, which are not built for this kind of thing. Most, though, goes to Kao Soy’s menu for inducing me to order too much (except that it was never too much) by offering Thai dishes I rarely see around town, including a few from northern Thailand. Those of us who prowl restaurants whose owners come from countries known for delicious food harbor an irrational belief that one day, if we play it right, we may get the Other Menu. This is the one the owners save for their family and friends. It’s the one that lists all the foods they loved back home. It’s filled with the dishes everybody says Americans won’t like. Nobody I know has ever seen one of these documents. That hasn’t stopped me from raising my eyebrows and dropping key foreign phrases in the hopes that a server will say: “Oh, you want the Other Menu? Just a moment, sir.” At Kao Soy, the Other Menu is printed on the same green page that lists the dishes you know from your local Thai spot: the fried rice, the pad thai, the curry with choice of chicken, beef, pork or shrimp. Those items fill the shopping bags that go out the door every few minutes. They help keep the business floating. But the mission of Kao Soy is to sell New Yorkers on what Sirichai Sreparplarn, one of the restaurant’s two chefs, calls “the real food from the north.” Several New York neighborhoods have been wrapped in the fiery clutch of Thailand’s northeastern region, Isan. Dishes from the north, though, have been found almost exclusively in one place, Pok Pok Ny, just outside Red Hook. This puts two northern Thai kitchens less than a mile apart in a borough that is home to only about 12 percent of the city’s Thai population and virtually no other Thai restaurants worth knowing about. Kao Soy was opened last summer by Kanlaya Supachana, who has worked in several Thai restaurants around Brooklyn, answering phones and such. She and her co-chef, Mr. Sreparplarn, close friends for many years, had what he calls “the same passion for serving real flavor to New Yorkers,” but they failed to persuade any existing Thai restaurants to share their vision. Finally a local contractor, Carlos Padillo, agreed to sign on as Ms. Supachana’s business partner, and they took over a tiny space, filled it with a few tables, a tiny bar and an electric fireplace. The northern Thai dishes are scattered around the menu. Most obvious is the excellent kao soy, made in the style of Ms. Supachana’s father back in Chiang Mai. Beneath the heading Snack & Salad is a dish called nam prik ong. This is a platter of steamed cauliflower, long beans, strips of fried pork rinds curled like Fritos and long surfboards of romaine lettuce, all meant as garnishes for a dip that’s something like a spicy, slightly sweet pork ragù that went for a swim in the ocean. Or maybe the dip is the garnish; it was gone before I’d decided. A related dish, sai oua, is filed under Various. The dip here has been pounded from garlic, onions and fresh green chiles, hot ones. For dipping, you get steamed young mustard greens, cucumbers, freshly fried pork (not rinds but meat this time, and marinated in soy), along with a house-made pork sausage, the sai oua itself. Deeply perfumed with makrut lime leaves, coriander roots and lemongrass stalks, this sausage makes a more complete single-bite introduction to Thai flavors than any plate of pad thai. For the time being, we reach the end of the northern Thai menu with the banana blossom fritter and the kang hung le, a warmly spiced peanut curry cooked with pork belly and beef. A fried drumstick comes on the side, and you are meant to pull off some dark meat, pinch it with sticky rice and then scoop up some of the curry. I didn’t understand it, but I loved it anyway. But we have not reached the end of the Other Menu, because there are other less-familiar dishes under the Snack & Salad or Various headings. Few are dull, and some are very good, like the shredded mango salad with cashews and two kinds of dried fish, no longer than a toothpick. Kao Soy isn’t quite finished yet, Ms. Supachana will say. (When it is, I hope she gets her hands on more of the fresh herbs that add minty, bitter and even fishy notes to many of the salads at Pok Pok Ny; without them, some of Kao Soy’s cold dishes seem to stop short.) There are big plans for the little bar, including a full stash of liquor. Two weeks ago, the liquor license arrived, and already Kao Soy has some interesting ideas about what to drink with Thai food, like Farnum Hill cider from New Hampshire, a Belgian-style saison ale from Allagash in Maine, or a red grenache from Donkey & Goat in California. They’re going to need bigger tables.","Kao Soy in Red Hook, Brooklyn","['half', 'table', 'inside', 'kao', 'soy', 'taken', 'delivery', 'guy', 'coming', 'going', 'door', 'van', 'brunt', 'every',

272,Semilla,★★,2015-02-24,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/dining/restaurant-review-semilla-in-williamsburg-brooklyn.html,Williamsburg,"I came up with my nature-preserve theory of tasting menus while eating a cabbage sandwich at Semilla, a new restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, across the street from Jack’s Cancellation Shoes and Rachel’s Corset Discount Center (“specializing in hard to fit sizes”). Semilla had taken two cabbage leaves, then flattened and dried them until they were as crisp as a cracker. This was the bread. In between were a bundle of unusually delicious coleslaw and some grains of buckwheat groats. It wasn’t the most securely buckled-down sandwich I’ve ever eaten; some of the buckwheat fell out on the horseshoe-shaped counter around which Semilla’s 18 seats are arranged. But I liked the way the buckwheat that stayed in the sandwich cracked between my teeth like Grape-Nuts. The flavors woke up old memories of the Polish and Ukrainian restaurants that are mostly gone from the East Village. And it was undeniably cool to have cabbage-leaf “bread” arrive at my place without warning. Diners at Semilla don’t see a list of the 10 or so courses for which they are being charged $75 until the next day, when an email arrives from the restaurant. The sandwich struck me as a dish that might not last long on an à la carte menu. How many New Yorkers would choose to spend their dinner money on pressed cabbage when they could have broiled oysters or beef ribs or kale salad? By cordoning it off within a meal that has to be taken as a package deal, Semilla had sheltered the cabbage sandwich from the roughshod forces of the marketplace, the way the government might protect nests built by the gentle piping plover by banning four-wheel drive vehicles from the beach. The market’s relentless pressures to turn tables, to goose the check and so on are clear to anyone who goes out to eat in New York. It’s less obvious how those pressures may influence menus until we stop to ask why so many are virtually identical, with the same salads and the same cuts of the same animals. If not for minor variations in sauces and side dishes, we’d all fall asleep after our first cocktail. Semilla’s chef, José Ramírez-Ruiz, and its pastry chef, Pamela Yung, are using the nature-preserve possibilities of the tasting menu so their customers can taste dishes that weren’t concocted to please the marketplace. This is a familiar concept in music, film and art. It has come to New York dining only recently as multicourse, limited-choice menus have spread from the empyrean realms of Per Se and Atera to more affordable, less formal precincts like Contra and Semilla. Understand, as you enter this nature preserve, that you will be browsing extensively upon stems, tubers, rhizomes, seeds and other plant parts. Semilla tends to save fish and meat for moments when extra depth or intensity are needed. For instance, a paste of salt cod that covered the bottom of a plate in a thin layer, like gesso on raw canvas, acted like a dip for charred cups of cipollini onion and circles of rutabaga. It’s a dish that draws you in, as much for the rutabaga, which showed off its little-known talent for tasting like three or four vegetables at once, as for the salt cod, distilled to a potent cream so good I ran my fork around the plate twice to make sure I hadn’t left any. At Semilla (Spanish for seed), the term for this style of cooking is “vegetable forward.” This both warns vegetarians and vegans that they will need to ask in advance for substitutions, and reassures those for whom the term vegetarian cooking still evokes tie-dyed flashbacks of carrot-lentil loaf. Mr. Ramírez-Ruiz, the chief vegetable manipulator, owes almost nothing to that branch of the vegetarian family tree. It’s easier to see the imprint of Per Se, the Chef’s Table at Brooklyn Fare and Isa, all former employers, in the way he elegantly props one flavor against the next. He makes a frothy soup of beer and grilled celery root, then pours it over “noodles” shaved from a celery root; whipped Cheddar adds tang as it melts into the soup, and puffed quinoa gives it a breakfast-cereal snap, crackle and pop. Ms. Yung, another Isa veteran, who has been teaching sugar and flour new tricks since her days behind the counter at Room 4 Dessert, contributes two sweet courses at the meal’s end. (An inspired one brought black-truffle ice cream together with an electrifyingly tart Seville orange sauce.) She is also responsible for the hot sourdough bread that shows up at about halftime and often incorporates whole grains, such as farro and einkorn, that she grinds in a countertop mill stored on a shelf above the kitchen pass. (Most of the kitchen is visible from the seats and the rest can be seen through one-way glass slots in the restroom wall. At least, I think it’s one-way glass.) One night she had filled out the dough with cooked oatmeal, and the bread was pleasantly sticky under its thick crust. On all nights the bread arrives with a swirl of creamy butter and a trickle of buttermilk. There are aspects of Semilla over which reasonable people can disagree, but Ms. Yung’s bread isn’t one of them. I could argue, though, that the $75 price will keep out some of the young, creative-underclass types who may appreciate what the chefs are up to. I’d also say that Semilla’s servers should stop assuming that everybody has been initiated into the cult of natural wines; a guest of mine found the two samples she was poured too eccentric, and decided to drink nothing — a lost opportunity on each side of the bar. Inevitably, I wished a few dishes at Semilla had been swatted to the floor by the market’s invisible hand. One was a plate that I’ve come to call “too much cabbage with too many soybeans.” Another was an ice cream Ms. Yung made out of colza oil. Colza oil is a close cousin of canola oil; frozen, it tastes like cold lubricant. There is risk in this kind of cooking. There is reward, too, and the chance to find out how good a rutabaga spring roll can be when you dip it in bittersweet orange juice reduction. Whenever I glanced at the other people huddled around the ash countertop, I saw far more appreciative nods than puzzled grimaces. The crowd reminded me of the audiences, small but intense, who showed up to hear underground bands in the ’80s and ’90s, when that was one of the few ways to hear music that didn’t get played on the radio.","Semilla in Williamsburg, Brooklyn","['naturepreserve', 'theory', 'tasting', 'menu', 'eating', 'cabbage', 'sandwich', 'semilla', 'williamsburg', 'brooklyn', 'across', 'jack’s', 'cancellation',

273,Crown,★,2012-01-31,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/01/dining/crown-nyc-restaurant-review.html,Upper East Side,"IT looked as if fireflies had been released into the dining room. Pale yellow flames swayed from squat white candles on white linen. Taller tabletop oil lamps flickered behind black shades, and more black shades hid the low bulbs of wall sconces. Other candles, as fat as oak branches, guttered from the carved limestone fireplace. All around, displayed like portraits against the wood paneling, were the residents of the East 80s, confident that for as long as their dinner at Crown lasted, the tiny flames and gentle wattage and dark lampshades would conspire to cast them and their jewelry in the kindest possible light. Then a firefly would flash in a corner of the room and the portraits would be thrown into relief: a row of identical teeth, hair with an amethyst tint, an unyielding tightness in the flesh around the eyes. A pity, that light, but to order one must at least glance at the menu, and at Crown the caviar and oysters and foie gras and dry-aged sirloin are all written in a spindly font that is not easy to make out, particularly by people whose 40th birthday was celebrated in a previous century. And so, whenever a table contemplated dinner, phones would come out, their flashlight apps trained on the italic type. Happily, these bouts of illumination rarely lasted more than a minute or two. The menu, while generous, did not demand prolonged study. One did not need to get bogged down in the fine print and wonder what Calabrian chile, acetorium Barolo vinegar or horseradish lardo might be. One could simply select a protein, and trust the restaurant not to pull any tricky stuff. This was a safe strategy, because the kitchen, in the steady hands of John DeLucie, Jason Hall and Ted Rozzi, has no intention of frightening anyone. Mr. DeLucie, the chef and proprietor, has cheerfully called his cooking here “comfort food for millionaires.” (And for their pets; the kitchen once prepared a côte de boeuf for a regular’s dog.) For that job, few are more qualified than Mr. DeLucie, whose contributions to gastronomy include a $55 truffled macaroni and cheese he made when he was the chef at the Waverly Inn. Before it was reduced to handing out reservations on OpenTable, that restaurant operated as something close to a private club. Crown is more like a public dining room for locals who’ve given the cook the night off. Before 8 p.m., families eat wordlessly, girls ballerina-straight, boys slumped in their blazers, parents plodding their way through a cozy Burgundy. Crown opened just after Labor Day, and already everyone looks as if they have been coming here forever. Whether you should join them is a question of what you expect when dinner for two runs about $200 before the first drop of wine is poured. You will not get your first taste of sea buckthorn airlifted from Denmark, nor a plate of prosciutto from a boar the chef tracked and killed with a homemade crossbow. Like the work of the best Upper East Side caterers, most of the cooking at Crown is agreeably dull, with occasional pockets of excellence amid some patches of unalloyed boredom. The menu can deflect attention at times, particularly in the appetizer department, where in January every offering except a squash soup was meant to be served cold. Would you like to begin with a wild mushroom salad, a shellfish salad or a regular green salad? In the end, there are really only two kinds of things to eat at Crown, concessions for dieters and rewards for carnivores. In fact the menu could have been printed in two shades of ink: Valentino red for the tuna niçoise and organic chicken; Brooks Brothers blue for the rack of lamb and dry-aged Delmonico sirloin. The carnivores walk away happier, naturally. They may have begun with a disk of chopped raw dry-aged beef, wonderful to chew on as it offers up its secrets: now a crackle of sea salt, now a rustle of black truffle. Or better yet, a plate of hand-cut pasta squares in a suave white Bolognese perked up by dried chile and crunchy toasted hazelnuts. In another neighborhood, these would be known as pasta handkerchiefs. But here, a block east of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, they are silk handkerchiefs. Beef tortellini, though, were virtually uncooked one night. From here the carnivore could proceed to a highly satisfying rack of lamb, with two massive ribs over braised shoulder of lamb, or to a reasonably good, if expensive, steak. For those who do not want to wield a steak knife, there are sheep-milk ricotta gnudi as weightless as if the dough had been whipped with helium. An eye-catching tartare of pink Tasmanian trout is seasoned so well it could stand up to that beef crudo. But life on the lighter side does not always end so well. Roast chicken with bacon and warm cabbage seems to be intended not for people who like the flavor of chicken but for those who aren’t aware it is supposed to have any flavor at all. The salad of ruby-red shrimp, razor clams, baby octopus and scallops is expertly cooked but gets little support from its lemony dressing and none at all from that Calabrian chili, which might as well have stayed in Calabria. Even carnivores can come in for trouble with, say, the tough, stringy roast duck, which feeds two grumbling people for $97. If details like that keep you away from Crown, though, there is much you would miss. You wouldn’t get to ask Jordan Salcito, the sommelier, what to drink, and watch her decide if you are looking for a genteel tour of the Côte de Beaune or an off-road adventure in Corsica or Lombardy. You’d never taste Heather Bertinetti’s desserts, especially her milk chocolate soufflé, and that would be a shame. You’d miss out, too, on a dirty Gibson shaken, not stirred, by a bartender more interested in remembering customers’ faces than in finding the latest root-vegetable bitters. You wouldn’t get to see a server in black evanesce at your side, Jeeves-like, leaning forward from the waist to hear your order, asking “May I clear that, miss?” and not, “Still working on that?” Most of all, you’d be missing a chance to listen to that quiet purr that you hear only when a restaurant and its audience understand each other perfectly.",Crown — Restaurant Review,"['looked', 'firefly',

274,Lowlife,★,2016-03-22,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/23/dining/lowlife-restaurant-review.html,Lower East Side,"What a gnarled knot of warring impulses I feel about Lowlife. One minute, I want to stand on Stanton Street holding the door open while I give tips to diners on their way in: order the guinea-hen sausage, don’t miss the lamb tartare, above all eat the yakitori chicken. The next, I want to form a one-man human chain across the entrance and warn hungry people to go somewhere else. When I think about the best parts of this restaurant opened in November by Alex Leonard, the very talented chef, and Hugh Crickmore, the owner, I want to shake their hands. When I remember how much money I’ve spent there and how bizarrely pretentious the service can be, not just for the Lower East Side but for any neighborhood, I want to shake them by the shoulders until they come to their senses. Like many relationships that end in conflict, mine with Lowlife started in a happy rush of discovery. There was the smell of raw pine walls as soon as I walked in: invigorating. The wood gives the dining room the look of a sauna where people don’t sweat and keep their clothes on. I loved the sense of open space, too. Mr. Crickmore fought the urge to cover every inch of floor with seats. I could have stretched out my arms as I walked past a table of big men in black cowboy hats (how did they get here?) and along a long brown row of soft leather banquettes, beyond a bar and a framed cluster of birch trunks, to my seat at a kitchen counter. Just beyond was another cluster of tables, also spacious, also flanked by leather benches. The design is semi-Scandinavian, in the way of so many New York dining rooms lately, but it is not all frigid slanting-winter-light pallor. There’s some warmth. Then I sat facing the grill, and the scent of beef fat falling with a hiss on hardwood coals made some buried animal nerve in my skull hum to life. Mr. Leonard used to be the chef de cuisine at Blanca, the high-end tasting counter in Brooklyn where dry-aged meat is also cooked over white-oak charcoal from Japan. His menu bears other minimalist Blanca imprints. There are few empty gestures in his cooking; almost everything on the plate is there for a reason. First, I tried salty hackleback caviar and raw ribbons of fluke, flavored by the day or so it had cured between sheets of kelp; sitting in a coriander-seasoned broth, they made a delicious pair. I ate slowly, to stretch the time. I had ordered guinea hen, too, and was surprised to get a smooth, pale sausage wrapped in the hen’s browned skin to make a kind of weisswurst. Next to it were two sauces, one tan and yeasty, made with sourdough; the other dark and smoky, made from eggplant. This was some wonderful, subtle cooking. A rib-eye cap, fresh from the charcoal and running with juices, had so much flavor it didn’t really need the anchovy-and-garlic emulsion or the nettle sauce served alongside it. As I chewed, I watched a succession of even bigger hunks of rib-eye, bone and all, leave the grill for the front of the restaurant. Finally it dawned on me: The men in black hats must have heard that Lowlife serves excellent steak. What it does best of all is yakitori chicken. Cut up and blackened over charcoal, the bird has deep natural flavor and is brushed with a citrus-tinged glaze that is, by several miles, the best teriyaki sauce I have ever tasted. The squirt of green scallion sauce on the plate has nothing to do there and seems to know it. The crisp and smoky leaves of lightly charred cabbage are vital, though. As I said, it all started well. But on return visits, I noticed a leaden self-importance that began to feel stifling. I have never seen a restaurant clear dirty dishes the way Lowlife does. Two servers would flank the table. Each would reach in and remove a single knife at the same moment. Then one spoon each, again in synchrony. Then two forks would rise and disappear. Finally, two plates, now free of silverware, would be taken away, solemnly and ceremoniously, as if they had died fighting for their country. A bugler should have stood by, softly playing taps. Servers often talked with an affected tone that undermined the friendliness their smiles projected. One spoke about the coming meal as “the experience.” Dishes were “introduced,” as in, “Now I’d like to introduce you to your third course of the evening, our chicken.” Pleased to meet you, chicken. What do you say we make a run for the door? Fussiness this extreme would be out of place at Le Bernardin. At a Lower East Side restaurant where you listen to Kendrick Lamar, Stereolab and Ryan Adams while eating teriyaki chicken, it’s lunacy. The cost of a meal, while not quite insane, does suggest that Lowlife’s personality is not fully integrated. Servers will suggest three courses “if you are dinner-hungry,” as one put it. If I had ordered poached lobster and guinea-hen sausage, the two most expensive appetizers, and followed them with the rib-eye cap, I would have spent $94 before tax, tip and drinks. This doesn’t include dessert, either, although if I had attempted dessert after that meal, they would still be peeling my exploded carcass from the pine walls. Not that you would recognize the appetizers from looking at the menu, an uncategorized list. Servers have to explain that it is in ascending order of size. The smallest appetizer, a very good assemblage of trout roe, thick clotted cream and puréed beets, isn’t filling at all; the largest, the guinea hen, could make a light main course. Individually, the prices aren’t out of line compared with, say, Le Turtle, a nearby restaurant whose chef also cooked at Blanca. But add them up and they can cause squirming, especially on a night when the $120 bone-in rib-eye is lukewarm, or when the lag between courses is so long you could have eaten a whole meal somewhere down the street. If I did duck out, I would still try to make it back in time to finish with the almost-classical French apple tart painted with orange marmalade, or the unusual and appealing eucalyptus panna cotta, whipped into a froth. Warring impulses again, but then Lowlife suffers from them, too. The place wants to be cool; you can tell from the walls of one bathroom, where Allen Ginsberg’s inscribed photograph of Neal Cassady and Timothy Leary hangs across from a signed Joseph Beuys poster. But it’s hard to be cool when you’re trying to act important.",Lowlife Plays It Cool on the Lower East Side,"['gnarled', 'knot', 'warring', 'impulse', 'feel', 'lowlife', 'minute', 'stand', 'stanton',

275,Casa Enrique,★★,2019-01-29,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/dining/casa-enrique-review.html,Long Island City,"New York used to be a one-mole town, and that was mole poblano. A chocolate-colored, bittersweet agglomeration of two dozen or so ingredients, it comes, like most of the city’s Mexican immigrants, from the state of Puebla. Typically simmered with chicken, mole poblano was a staple of takeout joints and lunch counters and restaurants before anyone took Mexican food in New York seriously. All the other moles — Oaxaca’s mole verde, say, which gets its green color from pumpkin seeds, tomatillos and fresh herbs — were about as rare as a mandarin duck in Central Park. In recent years, as these once-exotic species have become regular features of the menus at Cosme, Empellón, Claro and other restaurants, mole poblano has become something like the pigeon of Mexican sauces, too common and familiar to be worth noticing. If you share this low view of mole poblano, you owe it to yourself to have the one at Casa Enrique. The chef, Cosme Aguilar, calls it mole de Piaxtla, after the Pueblan town where his father grew up, and as a reminder that there is not just one mole poblano but many. Some have apple in addition to raisins. Some are thickened with animal crackers. Mr. Aguilar remembers that in his childhood home, plantains were allowed to hang until they were black before they could be pounded into mole. Maybe this explains the particular sweetness of Casa Enrique’s version, which is not the candy-bar sweetness of some. It’s deep and complicated. The character of this mole de Piaxtla unfurls as you eat, whether the sauce has been soaked into enchiladas filled with chicken or simply pooled on a plate over and under a quartered chicken and yellow rice cooked with peas. Mr. Aguilar has been frying, blending and stirring mole de Piaxtla since Casa Enrique opened in 2012, just off Vernon Boulevard, in Long Island City, Queens. In fact, he has barely changed his menu since our Hungry City critic, Ligaya Mishan, reviewed it the next year. Mr. Aguilar says he is emulating the restaurants he likes best in Mexico, ones whose kitchens make the same dishes year in and year out. Whether despite this or because of it, the restaurant seems to have improved in subtle ways. Acoustic panels tacked to the ceiling make conversation easier. Servers, always welcoming, have become experts at anticipating the meal’s ebb and flow. They’ll step in just when you’re ready for a fresh drink, maybe a margarita with some tamarind this time to offset the raw-sugar syrup. They’ll gauge the precise moment when you’re ready to have dinner plates cleared to make room for dessert. Or they’ll break away from your table just long enough to join in a full-throated singing of “Happy Birthday” around a slice of tres leches cake with a candle stuck in it on the other side of the room. This may happen three or four times a night, probably not because Casa Enrique looks particularly festive — from floor to ceiling, it’s done almost entirely in white — but, I’d guess, because regulars know it regularly outperforms any number of other restaurants that might seem to be more special on the surface but aren’t, really. Also, the tres leches cake, if not as soggy with condensed milk as it could be, is still pretty good, though I think the flan is almost mandatory, and it, too, is a perfectly credible birthday-candle holder. Although the guacamole is freshly mashed and pleasingly minimalist, I tend to skip it as long as the people I’m with don’t mind. Instead I’ll head straight for the two-bite sopecitos topped with refried beans and loose chorizo, or the albondigas in cumin-laced chipotle sauce, each of the three meatballs stuffed with hard-cooked eggs. The best Mexican seafood dishes often come from restaurants that specialize in them. Mr. Aguilar, though, seems equally at home with fish and meat. The market fish offered as a main course — lately a black sea bass — has always been seared to a crisp on the skin side. Still, in all these years I’ve never been convinced that the corn under it compares to the best street-corner esquites, or that it and the fish really add up to a whole dish. The seafood appetizers, on the other hand, are some of my favorite things at Casa Enrique: the delicately fried oysters sitting in a mayonnaise that gets its tangerine color from ground chiles; the ceviche, freshly tossed with lime and herbs; the crab tostadas, loaded with a thin slice or two of Serrano chile, chopped tomato, leaves of cilantro, smooth avocado salsa and a spoonful of crab meat, pure and clean; and the shrimp cocktail, which gets its roundness and slight richness, I think, from orange soda, just the way you’d hope. Mr. Aguilar is not one of those chefs who set up masa factories in their basements. Casa Enrique’s corn tortillas do not have the pretty floral aromas of Cosme’s, or the sweet, focused corn flavor you taste in Claro’s. But they are better than you’d find almost anywhere else in New York. They give a boost to the tacos, made with braised tongue or brisket; crumbled chorizo; or fried, battered fish, and they are especially delicious soaked in salsa verde and wrapped around roasted poblanos in cream to make enchiladas Doña Blanca. And while Cosme’s more modern approach has soaked up more media attention, I’ve encountered more bloops and wobbles eating there than I have exploring the far more traditional menu at Casa Enrique. It isn’t necessarily the more interesting restaurant, but it’s the one where I’m more confident that if I went there tonight, everything would taste exactly the way it was supposed to. The pozole will be dark and intense, though not especially spicy, with tender strands of pork in the broth and all the usual mix-ins waiting on the side. The pork ribs will be slowly braised, in the style of Chiapas, in a thick cooked salsa built on a foundation of guajillo chiles. These ribs are not to be confused with the baby back ribs, cooked in an even thicker, creamier pipian rojo, that sometimes turn up as a daily special. Best of all, perhaps, will be the chamorro de borrego, or lamb shank stewed with chickpeas; it will be very tender and very flavorful in its rough sauce of pulla chiles with crushed guaje seeds. The name of that sauce is huaxmole, or sometimes guaxmole, or even mole de guaje. Yes, it’s a mole, and one that rarely flies as far north as New York City. At Casa Enrique, it has found a permanent perch.

276,Bouley,★★★,2016-03-01,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/02/dining/bouley-restaurant-review.html,TriBeCa,"Yes, the apples are still there. Hundreds of them, lining shelf after shelf in Bouley’s first room, the small one with the coat closet. Going soft under the skin, ripening, giving up the yeasty cider-mash smell you meet in orchard barns. As far back as 1987, when he opened the original Bouley on the other side of Hudson Street in TriBeCa, David Bouley has wanted that scent inside your head the minute you walked in. Yes, the trick works. Before your mind has time to doubt, your senses are leading you. Yes, the restaurant is trying to seduce you. There’s no other explanation for the gold leaf on the groin-vaulted ceiling or the crushed velour just about everywhere — on the curtains, the banquettes, the frame around a softly radiant field of lavender in an enormous painting. There’s even a velour armchair next to a toilet in the men’s room downstairs. It must be there in case you have brought along an especially devoted valet. Yes, it’s faintly silly. But there’s also visual joy in the baronial curves of the limestone fireplace and the patterns woven into the antique rug. This is a restaurant for romantics and sensualists, just the place to take my friend who collects Victorian jewelry and mounted butterflies, the one who will smile when she sees the Chartreuse prominently shelved with the other after-dinner drinks. No, Bouley is not trendy. Mr. Bouley doesn’t even seem aware that trends exist apart from those shooting through his own mind, of which there are more than anyone can count. Occasionally, these overlap with trends in the world outside. This is the case with his interest in gluten-free bread, as evidenced by two dense loaves that ride around on a wooden chariot with at least a dozen other proprietary breads. Typically, gluten-free bread in restaurants is, like margarine, a barely credible substitute. These two bricks at Bouley, on the other hand, reflect creativity, experimentation, maybe a shade of obsession. Yes, they’re delicious. The black one is a little salty, earthy from buckwheat, crackling with walnuts, reminiscent of the seeded health breads of northern Europe, and wonderful as toast. The white one is a little sweet and speckled green with pistachios, slightly tropical-tasting from the coconut fiber that helps hold it together. Yes, you can eat bread with wheat flour instead: get a slice of the dried cherry or the saffron-walnut loaves, press some cultured Norman butter across it. That would be delicious, too. But these two bricks, their mere existence and their distinctiveness, tell you a lot about what makes Bouley compelling. Mr. Bouley takes paths nobody else is on, and walks farther along them than anybody else would. No, I’m not opposed to refined sugar and heavy cream the way he is. When servers murmur that the desserts use only coconut-palm sugar for its “low glycemic index,” it doesn’t particularly turn me on. I don’t really care that the slouching white slab of powdered snow that appears before dessert won’t give me diabetes, although customers who already have diabetes are no doubt appreciative. No, what I care about is the way it melts on my tongue: so fast the cold barely registers before there’s nothing but a cool trace of skim milk sweetened with white chocolate. It’s an impression, no more than that, like sticking out your tongue in a snowstorm and catching a few flakes. No, neither the bread nor the milk fluff is on the menu. They simply appear, along with other surprises that make the cost of a three-course menu, $125, seem eminently fair. But they illustrate a key facet of Mr. Bouley’s cooking: By ruling out some ingredients for reasons of health or digestion, he forces himself to find new ways to whip up delight and a sense of luxury. True, it’s not all dreamy. Buffalo fillet was served with a nondescript sauce and bland, lumpy gluten-free gnocchi. The “chocolate frivolous” dessert, a mainstay for many years, seemed worn out one night, the warm chocolate cake in the middle of the plate filled with a strangely bitter and oily ooze. A tart of apples and black olives was more provocative than delicious. O.K., meals can last longer than they need to. Servers can forget who ordered what, or present a wine bottle to the wrong person. And I wish more women worked in Bouley’s dining room; the gender imbalance there is old-fashioned in the wrong way. Yes, but it gets much, much better. For sure, the most dramatic dish in New York is the Malibu sea urchin in its spiky shell that looks like a medieval torture device. Inside is a layered composition of almond and soy milk; tofu; soy and vinegar; yuzu jelly and bursting orbs of salmon trout roe; creamy tongues of sea urchin under yuzu sorbet; and an olive-green spoonful of golden osetra caviar. Swooshed around it all is a puckering froth of green apple juice. Each bite is exciting in a different way. Yes, the wild mushrooms in the “forager’s treasure” were so richly flavored they fooled me into thinking they were cooked in butter. With melting lobes of grilled tuna belly, a truffle sauce and a light coconut garlic broth, the dish sent me to some other world in a whoosh. All right, I should have learned, but I was tricked again by the lushness of the “ocean herbal broth” pooled around gorgeously fresh shrimp, scallops, a belon oyster and a bundle of sea cucumber cut into ribbons. No butter in this dish either, just puréed garlic and other aromatics with tomato water and the sweet brine that drips from shucked clams. No, the rabbit salad — juicy loin wrapped in crisped belly with inky poached prunes and foie gras — is nothing like a salad. It is a warm appetizer that would be one of the star main courses in another restaurant. Yes, chicken baked in a sealed pot over hay and alfalfa sounds like punishment. It is not. As fowl cookery goes, it is something close to perfection. Yes, perfection. Bouley can skim within sight of it on the right night with the right people. At other times, it’s clear that the restaurant can’t maintain a single-minded focus on doing absolutely everything right. Eccentricity and consistency don’t always get along, and Bouley is a slightly eccentric restaurant, as Frank Bruni noted the last time it was reviewed in The New York Times, in 2009. He thought it was a three-star restaurant.

277,Hotel Griffou,★,2009-09-22,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/23/dining/reviews/23rest.html,Greenwich Village,"WHEN the operators of restaurants known as celebrity hangouts are asked how an ordinary civilian can get V.I.P. treatment, they invariably give the same answer: Make yourself a regular. I used to believe them before Hotel Griffou, a new restaurant on West Ninth Street, came along. Its owners — among them veterans of the Waverly Inn, Freemans and La Esquina — have the frequent pleasure of reading gossip items about the meals enjoyed there by Kanye West, Jennifer Lopez, Sean Penn and the like, but Hotel Griffou seemed to follow the principle in reverse. I was treated worse each time I showed up. After my first dinner, I sat by the bar to wait for my friends to catch up. An employee rushed over and asked, in a voice that floated like a paper airplane, “Can I buy you a drink while you’re waiting for your table?” I wish she had been around for my final  meal there, when I checked in on time for an 8 p.m. reservation. “Three people?” asked the man at the desk. No, four, I said. He replied, with evident sorrow, that he had me down for three. “I called a couple of hours ago to change it to four,” I said. “Our reservations line closes at 5,” he said, as if he’d caught me. Why did it matter? At every restaurant I’ve seen, a three top is a four top missing a chair. Not at Hotel Griffou, where we were sent to the bar while someone hunted down our table. The restaurant has four dining rooms, and we had an excellent view of one, a bright space with long beer-hall tables that sat empty. We imagined that they were being held for a group. Naturally,  this is where we were seated, 50 minutes after we had arrived. I was afraid that if I returned they would hit the one-hour mark and lead me to a produce crate by the dishwasher. So I stayed away. That’s too bad in some regards, because Hotel Griffou does have its allures. Each dining room has a different motif, as if the restaurant were trying to ignite a collect-them-all frenzy. A friend described the Library as “very man-cavey,” outfitted with wooden ducks, a manual typewriter, a fiddle, a saddle, shelves filled with law books, a football that looks as if it was in play when F. Scott Fitzgerald was at Princeton, and four fox pelts. The Salon, dominated by a large photograph of an old woman shooting flames from her wrists, looks like the drawing room of an English aristocrat with a weakness for odd contemporary art. The most sedate chamber is coyly known as the Palm Terrace. It  sports a potted palm along with ivory leather banquettes and wallpaper celebrating the glory days of the Raj. A Little Red Riding Hood installation distinguished the last room I ate in, but I was too addled to give it a full exegesis. Apart from the modern art, the overall aesthetic drinks deep of the current nostalgia for country houses and hunting lodges in the sunset years of the British empire, mixed in with the renaissance of the types of handmade cocktails that faded during Prohibition. There’s a letter-perfect mint julep and a navy grog with pineapple juice and rum that almost makes you want to  join a ship. Of everything Hotel Griffou offers, the drinks are the easiest  things to swallow. They helped buff the rough edges of the food that followed. The cooking is hard to classify, partly because the menu is divided into “Seasonal” and “The Classics.” In the first category are garden-variety takes on Mediterranean-derived dishes. Grilled trout with tomatoes and braised fennel was typical, and successful. Much stranger was a chicken breast “in pistou,” as the menu claimed. In actuality, the delicate basil sauce coated a handful of crisp vegetables rather than the powdery, overcooked chicken, which could have used it. Tender fettuccine appears with a rotating cast of seasonal vegetables. One night it was a very enjoyable pairing of kale and cranberry beans, on another, fresh chickpeas with eggplant, so  underdone it squeaked. As modern as these dishes were, their presentations were often scattershot, as if the food had been lobbed in the general direction of plates as they sailed toward the kitchen door. The classics were more solid. On this side of the menu you’ll find a dish not served anywhere else in the city, a plate of pounded and fried pork cutlets under a dark mushroom sauce with peas. It is an appealingly unreconstructed throwback, dating to 1892 and attributed to Marie Griffou, who once ran a boardinghouse at this address. The tender and rich burger was a solid success, and the secret seemed to be the way the kitchen let  a mildly tart and spicy ketchup soak into the top bun. It shouldn’t have made a difference, but it did. A strip sirloin steak was cooked just as we had asked, and hit the right beefy notes, though the sauce au poivre seemed to be geared  to diners who don’t like black pepper. But you’d think that our waiter might have delivered a $37 steak, or for that matter a $17 burger, without having to be reminded who got what. Service at Hotel Griffou can be wildly inconsistent. In the Library, we were under the ministrations of a flotilla of servers. (Given the country-estate mood, and how briskly and unobtrusively they patrolled the room, I am tempted to call them servants.) On another night, we got the kind of gruff attention you expect at a steakhouse. After that last meal, having abandoned the gooey desserts that had the excessive sweetness that is the hallmark of school bake sales, we saw a vehicle parked at  the curb, a Mercedes Sprinter cargo van  that had been expensively retrofitted for passengers. A driver had ferried somebody from out of town for dinner at Hotel Griffou. With luck, that somebody did not have to wait for a table. I’d hate to think of the driver’s overtime. Hotel Griffou SATISFACTORY 21 West Ninth Street, (212) 358-0228. ATMOSPHERE Four intimate dining rooms have contrasting decorating schemes but share an  aesthetic that is prewar and vaguely Anglophilic. SOUND LEVEL Ranges from civilized (in the room called the Palm Terrace) to raucous. RECOMMENDED DISHES Deviled crab croquettes, spinach salad, grilled Tasmanian sea trout, fettuccine, burger, strip sirloin frites, plat au boeuf. WINE LIST French-leaning, with just enough choices under $50. An ideal night here would begin with a cocktail, and could stop right there. PRICE RANGE Appetizers, $8 to $16; main courses, $19 to $38. HOURS Monday to Saturday, 6 to 11:45 p.m.; Sunday, 6 to 11 p.m. RESERVATIONS Recommended several days to a week ahead. CREDIT CARDS All major cards. WHEELCHAIR ACCESS Not accessible.

278,Grünauer Bistro,★,2016-06-21,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/22/dining/grunauer-bistro-review.html,Upper East Side,"Our server at Grünauer Bistro called the men at our table Sir. When one of the women asked for a glass of water, he replied, with deep seriousness and an Austrian accent, “Madame, consider it done.” He set off deliberately, his chest billowing before him and his feet moving with slow, battle-weary pride. A few minutes later, he returned. “There you are, Madame,” he said. “As fast as I could.” Once he had hauled away the dessert dishes — by that time, we had reduced the Sacher torte to a rubble of dark crumbs and the palatschinken folded over chestnut mousse to a few stray smudges of chocolate sauce — he came back with a bottle and four glasses. The clear spirit he poured was a pear-apple brandy from Austria. After a sip, one of the women said it reminded her of grappa. He lifted his chin and gave an indulgent chuckle. In that laugh was compressed the entire history of Austria’s contributions to European culture. “Yes, Madame,” he said. “But … more refined.” He was so perfect for Grünauer Bistro, and Grünauer Bistro was so perfect for him, that it’s impossible to imagine a time when they hadn’t been together. The whole restaurant is like that. Although it opened in early March, it might have been frying Wiener schnitzel and simmering tafelspitz on the corner of First Avenue and 82nd Street for decades. More than I would have thought possible, Grünauer Bistro seems to be a holdout from Yorkville’s past, when businesses fed the Czech, Slovak, Hungarian, Austrian and German immigrants who lived side by side in microneighborhoods that replicated the arrangement of Mitteleuropa. I could believe that Grünauer Bistro was founded the same year as Elk Candy, a German confectioner who formed tiny carrots, pigs and strawberries out of marzipan. That it had outlived Mrs. Herbst’s, baker of a Hungarian cabbage strudel that Nora Ephron once called “almost the only thing I remember about my first marriage.” That it once competed for expatriates with the Viennese Lantern, where diners were serenaded by a strolling fiddler, a strolling accordionist and a lyric soprano or two, firmly planted. Grünauer Bistro is a quieter spot. Late on Thursday nights, a pianist works the baby grand by the bar. On other nights, customers have to make do with a poster-size photograph of a fiddler hanging on the wall, the gilded statue of Johann Strauss II in Vienna. The picture helps brighten the spirit of a dining room that tends toward contemplative twilight. A sunset glow emanates from the coffered ceiling panels. Wood needs time to look this warm, and I wasn’t surprised to hear that the ceiling was inherited from Primavera, the Italian restaurant that sat on this corner for 32 years. When he took over the address, Peter Grünauer must have realized that any restaurant built under that ceiling would appear long established. He is long established himself, having made his name in Manhattan in the late 1970s and ’80s as the owner of Vienna 79. That restaurant made Austrian cooking waltz to the tune of nouvelle cuisine. What this meant was “lightening up on fats and flour” and “garnishing dishes with an unusual rainbow of bright steamed and sautéed vegetables,” Mimi Sheraton wrote in her four-star review in 1981. Not much about the traditional cooking under Thomas Slivovsky, Grünauer Bistro’s chef, could be called nouvelle, but ghosts of Vienna 79 whisper in the kitchen. Dill-strewn bands of house-cured gravlax with whole-grain mustard sauce reappear, and are worth getting. Applesauce cut with horseradish still makes an interesting complement to the tafelspitz, beef braised to tenderness with root vegetables in a light broth. Beef consommé with the sharp nip of black pepper is filled out by browned ribbons of crepes rather than the liver dumplings of old. Goulash here is made with beef, not veal, but it still comes with buttered spaetzle that squiggle their way into the meaty, paprika-choked sauce. Oddly, the spaetzle tossed with herbs, vegetables and a squirt of lemon as a vegetarian main course were less tender and appealing the night I tried them. There is Wiener schnitzel, of course. There has to be Wiener schnitzel, and it has to come with lingonberries (intact and not too sweet), potato salad (on the mild, creamy side) and marinated cucumber slices (classic). And if on some nights the rippled crust over the tender veal cutlet doesn’t crunch quite as emphatically as you want it to, it may be that the kitchen is simply trying to play along with the illusion that everybody at Grünauer Bistro has been doing this for so long that imperfections are to be expected once in a while. You could draw the same conclusion about the somewhat dry chunks of white meat in chicken paprikash. As for unusual rainbows of vegetables, the closest the menu comes is the vinegared beets in several colors, with big white puffs of whipped goat cheese. But it’s a very nice salad. At an Austrian restaurant, the desserts had better be good. For the most part, they are. The shell of pastry wrapped around apple strudel was damp one night, but flaky and crisp on another. More notable — ridiculously good, actually — was the kaiserschmarrn, a dense, eggy pancake broken into pieces that were white with powdered sugar and stained dark by fruit compote. A server always asked whether we wanted coffee, from the Viennese roaster Julius Meinl, during dessert or after. It’s a small detail that helps set the Old World tone. “Austrian vineyards offer lean pickings for wine lovers,” Ms. Sheraton wrote in 1981. In this case, the outlook has improved. The list is full of reds and whites from notable producers including Prager, Nikolaihof and F. X. Pichler. Most of the bottles are under $70. There are also some Austrian wines that Mr. Grünauer, who runs another Grünauer Bistro in Kansas City, Mo., has commissioned under his own label. Each of my meals ended with the same ritual, a bottle of pear-apple brandy poured out for everybody at the table. I don’t believe the restaurant had spotted the critic; the gift simply seemed to be an acknowledgment that we had shown heroic appetites. Once, we supplemented the brandy with a single $25 glass of Hans Reisetbauer’s astonishing carrot eau de vie. It tasted like carrots, but more refined.",Grünauer Bistro Waltzes to a Time-Honored Tune,"['grünauer', 'bistro', 'called', 'men', 'sir', 'woman', 'asked', 'glass', 'replied', 'deep', 'seriousness',

279,Standard Grill,★★,2009-09-29,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/30/dining/reviews/30rest.html,West Village,"DOESN’T your heart sink a little when you hear the words “Here’s a little something from the chef”? I know I’m ungrateful, but when I find myself spooning sunchoke froth from a demitasse I wonder why the chef couldn’t send out a little something I actually want, like six cold oysters or a nice sausage. Dan Silverman, the chef at the Standard Grill in the meatpacking district, does not make that mistake. At dinner, as the main courses are being set down, he sends out a cast-iron platter of fried potatoes dressed with pimentón mayonnaise, his spin on patatas bravas, the tapas bar classic. Crisp, smoky, spicy and very hard to resist, this little something rounds out the meal rather than slowing it down. Small grace notes like this have helped the Standard Grill play to robust crowds since it opened three months ago. It is not the place I would send friends who want to study the latest contortions of the yoga masters of haute cuisine. But it is exactly where I would direct anybody who needs to recharge by plugging straight into the abundant, renewable energy source that is downtown Manhattan. This was not a foregone conclusion when Mr. Silverman teamed up with the Standard Grill’s owner, André Balazs. Mr. Balazs operates remorselessly stylish hotels in California, New York and Florida, and with them, a number of restaurants. Yet none of them really established Mr. Balazs as a restaurateur. The Standard Grill, adjoining his Standard Hotel, does. The rambling menu doesn’t always cohere, and the waiters can be unequal to their jobs, but somehow none of that matters much. The pair had the great luck to open their restaurant just under the High Line and the good sense to know what to do there. A location beneath a disused railroad trestle is not an automatic ticket to success. But this trestle has been transformed into a pedestrian park that is one of the most exciting promenades in the city, and the design of the Standard Grill taps this excitement. Windows in the dining room look north and south, taking in the steel underbelly of the High Line and the endless human circus of the walkers drawn to it. Few of them will end their stroll with a meal at the Standard Grill, unless they booked well ahead. Those who did, and who survive the line at the host’s pulpit to be granted entrance to the inner dining room, find themselves in a handsome, big-city space that invokes either the Grand Central Oyster Bar or, less romantically, a subway platform at rush hour. The tiled, barrel-vaulted ceiling makes for treacherous acoustics. At times conversations across the room are beamed directly to your table. Sitting by the open kitchen one night, we heard an expediter shouting out orders as if he were communicating with cooks in Jersey City. With 100 seats in this room, another 100 in an even noisier antechamber, and 85 more on the sidewalk, it is a marvel that the kitchen reliably bangs out solid, flavorful food. Mr. Silverman, a veteran of Lever House, Alison on Dominick Street and Union Square Cafe, may be overqualified for cooking at a mess hall. But, as in archery, high-volume restaurants must aim above the bull’s-eye to allow for the effect of gravity. Like the potatoes, some of the best dishes show the chef’s fluency with ingredients from Spain. Their casual integration alongside French and Italian ideas on the menu is vivid testimony that Spanish cuisine has entered New York’s vernacular. Wax beans often leave me wanting something more, and Mr. Silverman provides it, tossing them with miniature coins of chorizo. I sank my spoon with pleasure into a velvety white gazpacho, although I wished it hadn’t been garnished so freely with onions, grapes, cherry tomatoes, cucumbers and almonds that it threatened to become more salad than soup. It was not the only item that seemed to suffer some kind of identity disorder. A vegetable plate with wild mushrooms, corn and airy herb dumplings came with plenty of broth, but not the soup spoon it needed. And, like the sweet, tender ravioli of peas served with pistachios and mint, it was sold as an entree, but ate more like an appetizer, in portions that were put to shame beside a generous plank of grilled trout or a fillet of swordfish grilled, like tuna, to a flattering medium rare. We did ask for a spoon, and our server responded with a quick and chipper, “Absolutely!” Her smile went a long way, as did the good cheer of most of the staff, in making up for frequent wobbles. An iceberg wedge was ordered as a side dish but showed up just before desserts. Espresso arrived without sugar, and empty cocktail glasses hung around on the table until the check was paid. What is billed as “million dollar” roasted chicken for two cost $32 and occasioned a service failure you wouldn’t expect if you were paying 99 cents. The chicken was set down before me in a cast-iron skillet. I did not get a plate, nor did the friend who was sharing it with me until he spoke up, and then he was given one scaled for an appetizer. We didn’t blame the overwhelmed waiter, but we did want to wrap him in a warm blanket and pack him into a cab with the names of a few restaurants that give the staff more than 30 seconds of training before sending them into battle. The place is full of small oddities: the restrooms that look unisex, but aren’t; the disc jockey in a glass booth whose tunes don’t play in the dining room; the very good chocolate mousse that you are meant to eat with a big rubber spatula. Does any of this make sense? No. Does it, against the odds, add up to a worthwhile restaurant? Absolutely. The Standard Grill ★ 848 Washington Street (West 13th Street), (212) 645-4100. ATMOSPHERE A modern Manhattan take on a brasserie, with tiled ceilings, pennies set into the floor, and sidewalk tables. SOUND LEVEL Approaching pandemonium, especially near the bar.

280,Mission Chinese Food,★★,2012-07-24,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/dining/reviews/mission-chinese-food-nyc-restaurant-review.html,Lower East Side,"LED ZEPPELIN was thumping and moaning at stadium volumes inside Mission Chinese Food. Everybody knew what Robert Plant was thinking: I am a traveler of both time and space To be where I have been. As for our little group, it wasn’t as clear. We were sitting below the wooden chairs and the Chinese dragon that hang from the ceiling, shouting into one another’s faces, gesturing like mimes and attempting to put an order together. They talk of days for which they sit and wait All will be revealed. Outside on Orchard Street, they were waiting, all right, with plenty of time to peer in at the backlighted takeout-style pictures of kung pao pastrami and ma po tofu. Beneath the photos was a keg, and free beer in plastic cups for anybody who could fit inside the door. Unseen others were sitting in bars nearby, wondering whether they would order a third round before the phone rang. When the call came at last, they would return to Mission Chinese Food, go down a few steps, pass behind a curtain and enter a narrow corridor separated from the kitchen by one long window. It must have been hot as a forest fire in the kitchen, because the burners were raging and Danny Bowien, the chef, was in swim trunks. All I see turns to brown As the sun burns the ground. Hot woks run fast. Minutes after we’d ordered, our table was covered with plates. The ma po tofu that had looked impressive on the menu board was staggering in real life. Ivory cubes of bean curd were sunk deep inside quantities of simmered pork and fermented fava paste under a shimmering lake of chile oil. It burned and buzzed in the pulsating manner of Sichuan, but in China the meat would be a mere seasoning. Mr. Bowien’s version emphasized and amplified the pork to the point where it knocked you down and left you happily breathless. We cooled down for a minute with smashed cucumbers that had the old-fashioned tang of barrel-fermented Lower East Side half-sours. Then came the cumin lamb, and conversation (never exactly free-flowing) ceased completely. Hissing on a hot iron platter were pickled long beans, powerfully fragrant fresh bay leaves, sticky dates that we chewed as if they were taffy, and slabs of lamb breast, thick cut around a bone that jutted out like a stick from a Popsicle. Robert Plant was keening now. He wanted to take me there, baby baby. But I was there already, a lamb rib in one hand. Mr. Bowien does to Chinese food what Led Zeppelin did to the blues. His cooking both pays respectful homage to its inspiration and takes wild, flagrant liberties with it. He grabs hold of tradition and runs at it with abandon, hitting the accents hard, going heavy on the funk and causing all kinds of delicious havoc. The story of how Mr. Bowien — the Korean-born, Oklahoma City-raised, retired indie band frontman; dark-horse world champion of pesto; Food Network reject, and serial workaholic — ended up pillaging and celebrating Chinese cuisine does not follow a straight line. In brief, he and a collaborator, Anthony Myint, were reverse engineering the cuisine of celebrated restaurants from around the world. They did this two nights a week in a not particularly celebrated Chinese restaurant in the Mission District of San Francisco. Somehow this led to their deciding to invent what Mr. Bowien came to call “Americanized Oriental food” with the blessing of the restaurant’s owners, who dished out chow mein in the same dining room. The rest can be told in a montage: Long lines. Newspaper and magazine clippings. The Manhattan skyline. Because he more or less makes stuff up, Mr. Bowien is free to hallucinate dishes like kung pao pastrami, with a riotously smoky housemade pastrami. It’s laughably inauthentic, but the only reason you laugh while eating is because you can’t believe how well it plays out. He is also free to make his own mistakes. A recent take on mouthwatering chicken, a Sichuan classic, substituted a chicken roulade stuffed with pickled ramps for the traditional plain boiled chicken. But the roulade was so thickly sliced and tightly wrapped that there was almost nothing for the hot-and-numbing dressing to cling to. (Mr. Bowien apparently thought so, too, and now he uses poached chicken thigh.) And a delicate monkfish liver sashimi was trampled underfoot by an intense soy dipping sauce. Such stumbles are rare. More common is the random sequencing of the meal. Apart from the night our rice (steamed with nutty grains of barley) showed up just before the check, this was only a minor problem, but it did tend to pit subtle dishes against more fiery ones. You can guess which team lost. A version of chawanmushi, an egg custard topped with raw scallop, a little confetti of green apple and comma-sized basil seeds, was so quiet and defenseless I wanted to take it into another room and bolt the door. This is one downside of tearing an old cuisine away from a culture that has been working out ways to extract the most pleasure from a meal for centuries. But you can write off that loss when the upside brings dishes like the amazing salt-cod fried rice, rich with the oils of slowly poached mackerel that slick each grain of rice. Or the take on Sichuan fish and pickled vegetable stew. Mr. Bowien spikes the stew with peanuts boiled in Old Bay seasoning, which is both certifiably crazy and certifiably delicious. A bit like the rock stars who neglected to pay royalties to blues masters like Willie Dixon and Howlin’ Wolf, many American chefs have freely appropriated the cuisines of other cultures, repackaging them and selling them at a premium. They might do well to study the example of Mission Chinese Food, which gives 75 cents to a food bank for each entree sold. The restaurant could almost certainly charge twice as much as it does on Orchard Street, where currently the most expensive dish is $15 and where four people can eat like pashas for less than $100. The prices (like those at Pok Pok Ny, in Brooklyn, opened by another out-of-towner) should give some proprietors of other loud, cramped, chaotic local restaurants a shiver of guilt, and cause them to glance nervously over their shoulders. Charging fine-dining prices in a dive may bring you gold, but it won’t buy you a stairway to heaven.",Mission Chinese Food,"['led', 'zeppelin', 'thumping', 'moaning', 'stadium', 'volume', 'inside',

281,Kawi,★★,2019-05-28,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/dining/kawi-restaurant-review.html,Hudson Yards,"You will find Kawi, the latest Momofuku restaurant, on the fifth floor of 20 Hudson Yards, assuming you stay determined and swallow back the urge to run for the exits that may grip you as you negotiate escalators that don’t connect to one another, elevators that are hidden out of sight like somebody’s crazy grandfather and shiny retail windows that seem to be trying to provoke a class war. By the time people reach Kawi they tend to look rattled; New Yorkers who will easily weave their way around broken sidewalks, potholes, garbage piles and al fresco rat conventions come undone when faced with the interior of a shopping mall. Kawi, now two months old, can be disorienting in its own way, but at least you can have a seat and a drink while you get your bearings. Space there is used, or not used, the way it is in Las Vegas. There’s a very long bar behind a line of black, geometric bar stools receding toward the vanishing point; low lounge tables; taller, square wood tables; round wood tables; black-leather booths; red-leather booths; red-leather banquettes; and a row of chairs facing a kitchen counter. Between all this furniture are aisles wide enough for a Zamboni. All those seats have backs, too. Kawi is loaded with the comforts and accommodations that critics, including me, were begging Mr. Chang to pay more attention to as recently as the opening of Nishi three years ago. Has anybody complained before that a David Chang restaurant was too quiet? They’re saying it about Kawi. If there is anybody left who still thinks of Mr. Chang as a downtown punk, Kawi will clear up that misconception. The early Momofuku restaurants were skateboards; Kawi is a minivan with sliding doors, armrests, cupholders and Don Henley on the stereo. The ride may not be as fast, but it’s a lot smoother. Kawi is also the first Momofuku restaurant in New York to address Korean cuisine head on and at length. Majordomo, which opened in Los Angeles last year, is at least half Korean, but the menu is loaded up with other stuff, a lot of which is big and showy and seemingly designed to dazzle the high rollers. It can be hard to remember you’re eating galbi-jjim after a server buries it beneath a tableside avalanche of shaved raclette. Eunjo Park, Kawi’s executive chef, avoids this type of distraction. This is lucky, because she makes food that you want to concentrate on. Before joining the Momofuku stable, she worked in the formal and highly fastidious kitchens of Daniel, Le Bec-Fin and Per Se. She later returned to South Korea, where she had lived until she was 12, for advanced studies at the Seoul restaurant Gaon and at the kitchen of the Chunjinam hermitage, presided over by Jeong Kwan, certainly the most celebrated cooking Zen nun in her country. A strong interest in tradition marks Ms. Park’s food at Kawi. Her dishes are set apart from versions you may have had before by the exactitude of the technique and the quality of the ingredients. One section of her menu is turned over to kimbap, those wide, nori-wrapped sushi rolls often spotted at salad bars, languishing under plastic wrap. Most kimbap is designed to be portable, filling and inexpensive. Ms. Park’s kimbap, on the other hand, is built for pleasure. She has a pickled vegetable kimbap on the lunch menu that is truly exciting; you are meant to dip it in a dark liquid that tastes a bit like soy sauce but is made with beets. The dinner menu brings kimbap filled with chives, pickled daikon, citrus jelly and a buttery pink vein of foie gras terrine. Has this really never been done before, you wonder as you eat it, and if not, why not? Among the other gussied-up raw fish that you expect in Momofukuland, like a refreshing if somewhat staid madai tartare, are some dime-size clams in chile sauce and an elegant, inspired interpretation of gejang. Blue crab legs and claw are cracked and given a three-day soak in soy sauce, among other things, which gives them an impressive amount of flavor. Then, in case you haven’t noticed that you’re dealing with a real chef, Ms. Park stirs the crab’s roe with creamy rice and spoons this Korean risotto into the open belly of the shell. At moments like this, or in the hwedupbap filled with raw fish as strikingly good as any you’ll find in a $200 omakase, or in the doenjang jjigae, a potful of braised fermented bean paste with pork belly that appears on the menu as “yesterday’s stinky soybean stew” and manages to be homespun and polished at the same time, it’s possible to see Kawi as Ms. Park’s response to Atomix. It’s as if she had looked at Junghyun Park’s dazzlingly complex compositions at his year-old modern Korean restaurant and decided that she could cook in a style that was every bit as modern and painstaking, but that instead of turning traditional dishes into tasting-menu food she would keep the old forms and innovate inside them. With her tidy, refined, French-influenced neo-traditionalism, Ms. Park could become something like the Alain Ducasse of Korean cooking. It’s not obvious, though, that Kawi needs an Alain Ducasse. Certain appetizers seem to belong on another planet, more beautiful and gentle than ours, such as the soft tofu with soy syrup that, sitting under a shattering thin crust of caramelized sugar, is like a savory crème brûlée by way of Seoul. And there are others, such as the sticks of fried cod that a server pointlessly snips in half with scissors and then spritzes with atomized yuzu juice, that are right at home at Hudson Yards. The presentation seemed forced. That could also describe the boiled chicken dish, one of the menu’s showiest items and, at $64, one of its most expensive. The whole bird is steamed, then the breast is sliced and served plain while the dark meat is fried and coated with spices. Neither is spectacular on its own, and the combination is bizarre. More successful versions of elaborate, oversize, multicomponent dishes are proven moneymakers elsewhere in the Momofuku republic. But arm-waving platters like that seem out of place at Kawi, which is the least Momofukian of the Momofukus. The most uncharacteristic thing of all is that the dining room has never been operating at anything close to capacity, at least when I’ve been there. Maybe tables are being kept off the reservation books to give the cooks time to learn where the spice cabinet is. Or maybe the fans who are so devoted to Mr. Chang’s downtown spots are still trying to figure out the escalators.","Kawi, From Momofuku, Takes Korean Food Head On","['find', 'kawi', 'latest',

282,North End Grill,★★,2012-03-20,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/21/dining/reviews/north-end-grill-in-battery-park-city.html,Battery Park City,"AT times I wondered if North End Grill was trying to look dull on purpose. Its name may mark the first time a restaurant has tried to lure New Yorkers by pretending to be in Boston. It’s not, of course. It’s in Battery Park City, where they don’t literally roll up the sidewalks at 10 p.m., but where almost nobody would notice if they did. Danny Meyer, whose Union Square Hospitality Group opened North End Grill in January, has called it an update of the American bar and grill. Expecting a trudging parade of steaks, chops and other battle-hardened veterans, I studied the menu. Pumpkin soup with crab ... halibut with clams ... scallops with cauliflower ... brussels sprouts on the side. It all sounded pleasant, but not the kind of thing you’d readily cross the howling six-lane purgatory of West Street for. And then I started to eat. That pumpkin soup had a deep, pasilla-chile warmth that made the fat lumps of peekytoe crab taste all the more sweet. The cauliflower with those scallops had a low rumble of cumin. Shaved brussels sprouts were crisp, not gummy, and hummed with mustard seeds and curry leaves. The halibut came at me from all directions. Fried shallots and ginger with roasted pine nuts brought a toasty crunch. Around the fish was a clam broth with the smoke of chipotles, the licorice tease of anise, the perfume of coriander seeds. It is high on the list of the least boring halibut dishes I’ve ever tasted. Dull? I should have known better. The kitchen is in the hands of Floyd Cardoz, who deploys spices with as much sophistication and authority as anyone in town. Mr. Cardoz was born in Mumbai, trained in Europe and made his name in New York. When he ran Tabla, coaxing Indian flavors into contemporary American presentations, his watermelon curry served as the sauce for the single least boring halibut dish I’ve ever tasted. After 12 years, Tabla closed in 2010, taking the watermelon curry and a host of other inventions down with it. One of them stages a welcome comeback at North End Grill, the Kachumber Cooler, a gin cocktail built on an herbaceous base of muddled cucumber, coriander leaves and green chiles. It sounds like a drink for August, but feels just right in your hand in March, too. In search of a concept for North End Grill, Mr. Cardoz and Mr. Meyer looked west to the Hudson River, a stripe of which you can see from the dining room. This made them think of a fish restaurant. They did some reconnaissance in Spain, where they watched the way seafood is grilled over wood. They started free associating. Mr. Cardoz enjoys single malts; could they be incorporated somehow? He also likes to cook eggs; why not devote a section of the menu to them? You enter through the bar, which in the early evening might mean slaloming around traders from Goldman Sachs’s mother ship around the corner. A wall of Scotch bottles is on your left. Straight ahead is a long counter facing the open kitchen where Mr. Cardoz is on duty, watching over a state-of-the-art open grill. It now holds a whole turbot, to be shared by two people who will marvel over its meaty flesh and chew appreciatively on the smoky, gently crisped skin. Turn a corner and you pass piles of oysters. To your right is Alexandra Ray’s pastry station, where somebody is cutting a sky-high wedge of tart lemon meringue pie. (Remind yourself to order it later, along with the butterscotch pot de crème. Ms. Ray, who transferred from Gramercy Tavern, has a gift for the kinds of business-casual makeovers of classic American desserts that have been a strong suit of that restaurant’s since Claudia Fleming’s days.) After this cinematic entrance, settling into the dining room can be a bit of an anticlimax. There’s little intimacy or drama in this empty square, although the sunlight off the river in the afternoon makes it a very cheerful place to enjoy the amazingly good “burger” of chopped rock shrimp and bacon, or the smooth, mustard-scented grilled seafood sausage. Speaking of cheer: Smiles, everyone, smiles! This is a Danny Meyer restaurant, and goodwill is doled out by the armload. One night a server might act out the menu in a jolly interpretive dance; another day a guest might be complimented on his socks. The service is not always highly polished. (Did somebody just describe the Eccles cake as “an English pastry made by peasants?”) But faulting such details would be like blaming a puppy for licking your hand. What you might fault at North End Grill is a slight hollowness at its core. This may be the first major Danny Meyer restaurant that feels as if it grew not from an organic sympathy for its neighborhood but from a reading of the real estate market. The space was part of a deal that also gave Mr. Meyer’s company three ground-floor venues in the Conrad New York hotel. (The other two became a Shake Shack and a Blue Smoke.) That much may have been simple, but giving North End Grill a firm personality was not. Mr. Meyer and Mr. Cardoz decided to try to have it all: the fish and the Scotch, the grill and the eggs, the spice-route seasonings and the brown butter cheesecake, the lunch-hour finance crowd and the dinner-rush condo owners. North End Grill may be trying to be too many things to too many people for it to work its way into the city’s heart the way Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern have. Buried here and there on the menu are items that don’t feel very convincing. Lamb with chickpeas tastes like a last-minute concession to people who don’t eat fish. A salad of shaved turnips and fennel doesn’t go anywhere, and one billed as “spicy greens” is only a little better than mesclun from a bag (though this may improve after Mr. Cardoz plants his 1,000-square-foot roof garden). And there is an odd dish of cod throats, handsomely pan-fried, but done in by a veal reduction that blots out any hint of the sea. Navigate around these, though, and there is so much left to revel in: a clam pizza that might surpass the one at Franny’s; a massive appetizer of white bones filled with buttery marrow topped with pink trout roe; every one of the egg dishes. Set loose from the constraints of an Indian-inspired kitchen, Mr. Cardoz can simply cook, showing off his deep understanding of flavor without worrying about anyone’s preconceptions of how those flavors are supposed to be used. In the restaurant’s big-tent approach, Mr. Cardoz has found something better than a concept: freedom.",North End Grill in Battery Park City,"['time', 'wondered', 'north', 'end', 'grill', 'trying',

283,Perla,★★,2012-05-15,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/16/dining/reviews/michael-toscano-provides-a-thrill-at-perla.html,West Village,"UNTIL I ate the vitello tonnato at Perla, I’d never thought of it as a dish to get a carnivore’s pulse racing. The veal is often too thin, too gray, too much a blank canvas for the mayonnaise and tuna. Then one night the version at Perla showed up, and I heard part of my brain, the part that we share with wolves and lions, calling out an urgent message: There’s meat at the table. This veal was pink all over, thrillingly pink. It was cut into juicy slabs almost a quarter-inch thick, not shaved into onionskin layers. And it was fantastic, with that quiet but very real flavor of true veal that America has all but forgotten. The meat was the point of the dish, and a demonstration of what Perla and its chef, Michael Toscano, do best. The restaurant, which opened on Minetta Lane this year, serves a swaggering red-blooded version of Italian food. One dish that sums up the philosophy is duck ragù on handmade cavatelli. Dark and glossy with duck fat, sweet from slow braising, the ragù can stop conversation all by itself. But in Mr. Toscano’s world, that’s not enough. A server holds a grater in one hand and a frozen cylinder of foie gras terrine in the other, and begins to rub them together above the pasta. You might ask whether this benediction of foie gras dust, which disappears into the sauce and leaves behind only a wink of privilege, is necessary. I would reply: What kind of silly question is that? You might as well wonder whether Mr. Toscano’s sensational roast guinea hen really needs its foie gras sauce. Or ask whether the rib-eye for two, blasted in the wood-burning oven to give it a serious Fourth of July backyard char, would work without a few spoonfuls of syrupy balsamic vinegar aged so long it’s almost as complex as Madeira. While you’re at it, why don’t you go ahead and order a bourbon cocktail called Tombstone Sunday Nights, and tell the bartender to leave out the pepperoni bitters. If these are the kinds of things you worry about, this is not the restaurant for you. Enjoying Mr. Toscano’s cooking requires a willingness — even an eagerness — to go a little too far, and then tell yourself that too far is exactly where you wanted to be. This willingness is the price of admission at many of Mario Batali’s restaurants, too. Not coincidentally, Mr. Toscano spent years in the Batali circus, first as a sous-chef at Babbo, then as the chef at Manzo, inside Eataly. The cooking at Manzo, at least under Mr. Toscano, was exceptional, but you ate it in a dining room that sits inside a pumped-up grocery store, without benefit of doors or walls. To get to the restrooms, you go to Eataly’s beer department and turn right. Perla is in most respects a more welcoming environment. Like Minetta Tavern across the street, it deploys red banquettes and mirrors and lighting the color of aged Parmigiano-Reggiano in a way that suggests it has been around for decades. Unlike Minetta, Perla isn’t a period piece, not with its framed photo of Mos Def, the unsettling portrait on the cover of his record “The New Danger.” Perla’s proprietor, Gabriel Stulman, also operates Jeffrey’s Grocery, Joseph Leonard and Fedora, all of them small, all of them somewhere on the spectrum between ambitious bars and actual restaurants. He staffs his places largely with Midwesterners, who have become the smiling storm troopers for his brand of hospitality: earnest, familiar, very downtown yet entirely nonthreatening. One night, a female server at Perla bounded over to a table of youthful big spenders in cotton shirts and silk neckties given a 5-o’clock tug, and greeted them with a flirty “Hi, boys!” In this comfortable setting, I’m happy to report, a great deal of the Manzo menu has been transplanted with very slight amendments. The beef that was a specialty of Manzo reappears, to glorious effect. Here is the suave tartare of beef from the Razza breed of Piedmontese cattle; here is the squared-off braised and grilled tongue, soft as ice cream at the beach (though it called out for a more forceful sauce). And here are some ideal gnocchi, in a dead-simple tomato sauce with a stealthy chile warmth. There is no foie gras or marrow in this dish, or in the delicate tortelli with ricotta salata and miniature coins of sliced asparagus, or in the orecchiette with sweet sausage and ramp pesto that had an untamed, garlicky edge. Mr. Toscano can step lightly at times, but not always. The fig vinaigrette on a salad of field greens was pointlessly sweet, and skate with black truffle vinaigrette was oily, flat-footed. He is in charge of pastries, too, and this may be too much to ask, because some sloppiness creeps in at the end of the meal. Rustic desserts like chocolate crostata or date cheesecake looked as if they had been dropped on the floor, and fennel cookies showed up one night so underdone that they might have been made in an Easy-Bake oven. Dessert in a glass might be advisable, because Perla has a fascinating selection of after-dinner drinks, including otherworldly Austrian eaux-de-vie from Hans Reisetbauer. The wine list is a charming read, too, until you check out the prices. There are too few choices below $50, and many of the bottles have been marked up at about three times retail, rather than the standard two times. Better values would be welcome and so would reservations. Currently only six tables can be reserved; the rest are first come first served, a policy that is easier to take at an ambitious bar than at a restaurant where you are encouraged to order antipasti, primi and secondi, and where a roast chicken for two costs $65. Dining at Perla takes a significant commitment of time and money. The restaurant should make a reciprocal commitment, rather than force customers to stand around near the bar — not at the bar (stools are reserved for dining at peak hours), but near the bar. By 8 p.m. the mob gets thick and the wait can be two hours. One night, somebody sent a 2002 Dom Pérignon to the table next to mine. The bottle cost $400. With a few customers like that, Perla could subsidize quite a few less expensive choices for everybody else. Hospitality means more than a friendly smile.",Perla in Greenwich Village,"['vitello', 'tonnato', 'perla', 'i’d', 'never', 'thought', 'carnivore’s', 'pulse', 'racing', 'veal', 'often', 'thin', 'gray',

284,La Mar Cebicheria Peruana,0 star,2012-03-27,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/28/dining/reviews/a-review-of-la-mar-cebicheria-peruana-in-manhattan.html,Midtown South,"ON one of the few nights this winter when the temperature sagged below freezing, the host at La Mar Cebicheria Peruana led my party to an upstairs table without offering to take our coats. This was a surprise, because the coat check had been in full swing on a warmer night weeks earlier. In September, Gastón Acurio, the prodigious restaurateur and chef from Peru, opened this eighth branch of his expanding ceviche chain on Madison Square Park where Tabla once held court. The designer Stephanie Goto, hired to redo the two-story space, cast off its warm subcontinental palette in favor of a shimmery, tropical cool. When we reached the top of the stairs, images of the tropics came to a thudding halt. Nearly every chair had a winter coat draped over it, giving the room all the elegance of a church-basement bingo game. The coat-check clerk must have gone south for the night, taking along the employee in charge of cleaning up. At the beginning of that meal, the men’s room wastebasket overflowed with paper towels. An hour later, the room was still a mess. Like those paper towels, the oversights piled up. Pisco punch came in a goblet as sticky as a jelly jar. Explanations of menu terms like lúcuma and chicha morada were rushed and mumbled. Plates sat around so long before being cleared that they looked like archaeological sites. But what happened to a dish called Salmon Macho was no mere oversight. You could tell from the scorched surface of the fish that it had been cooked miles beyond the medium rare that the chef allegedly preferred. The flesh was parched, the yellow-pepper sauce was browned like crème brûlée and some clams that came with it were heat-blasted into nothingness. Any restaurant can get the hiccups. This one was having a full-blown seizure. I had other, better, far less disheveled meals at La Mar. And whenever I was spooning up a ceviche —bathed in a marinade that delivered chile heat and citrus acidity in precisely calibrated doses — I knew why Mr. Acurio is a rock star in Lima, and how he has managed to build a 31-restaurant empire in 12 countries. Still, once I got beyond ceviches, tiraditos (another raw-fish specialty) and a few other successes, too many dishes were either carelessly prepared or not very much fun to begin with. La Mar is a sometimes exciting, often disappointing demonstration of the ways in which a global restaurant chain opening an outpost in New York faces more complex challenges than a retailer planting a new Abercrombie & Fitch in SoHo. When you reproduce a menu from afar without testing it on the locals, or bet on a style of cuisine without scoping the competition, or hire servers who aren’t versed in the care and feeding of the natives, the city’s response can be cold and lingering, or brutal and swift. Some of this is local chauvinism. But the restaurateurs share the blame. Before presenting a choice of luxury fountain pens that turned the signing of the check at Alain Ducasse New York into a money-burning display that could well have embarrassed a Kardashian, Mr. Ducasse might have reflected that much of New York’s wealth is discreetly hidden away on the upper floors of skyscrapers. Before importing the menu for Le Caprice, Richard Caring might have asked whether the loyalists at his London original are loyal despite, rather than because of, the dressed-up and overpriced club food. As for Mr. Acurio, he had reason to be confident riding into Manhattan. Bogotá, Mexico City and São Paulo had taken to his ceviche-centric chain. Before a San Francisco location opened, he was asked how he intended to sell Americans on his country’s cuisine. Simple, he replied: “With a pisco sour in one hand and ceviche in the other, I think I can convince everybody.” La Mar’s ceviche is indeed compelling. Gleaming tiles of fish bask in liquids so vivid and potent that the Peruvian name, tiger’s milk, makes a kind of sense, almost. The one called Elegance, with Rhode Island fluke in an invigorating lime broth, is less marinated fish than raw seafood soup. I was persuaded, too, by a tiradito called Nikei, with sliced yellowfin tuna belly in a small lake of soy and sesame oil sauce; it starts out Japanese before a sour nudge of tamarind takes it in an unexpected, delicious direction. With all this fine raw seafood, I was surprised to find that my favorite appetizer of all was the tender, emphatic skewers of beef heart cooked on a grill. You eat it and feel strong. And if you are going to dip into the deep end of the menu, strength will help.Causas were busy assemblages of ingredients on bland cups of whipped potato; I could never figure out what was supposed to be good about them. Arroz con pato, a main course, featured washed-out duck on a mash of gluey green rice. Another rice dish, though, arroz negro, had the deep flavor and character of squid ink, and I appreciated the quality beef in lomo saltado, a stir-fry reflecting Peru’s Asian population. Both grouper and salmon belly main courses were overcooked, though they couldn’t compete with the Salmon Macho meltdown. The best part of a $42 lobster in hot ceviche was the dish of tiny potatoes that came alongside — a recipe from the family of Victoriano López, the executive chef. What about the Peruvian classic in Mr. Acurio’s other hand, his second weapon in the campaign for the American palate? The bartenders at La Mar can in fact shake up a reasonably good pisco sour. The trouble is that they generally do so only when a customer wants a more expensive brand of pisco. Everybody else gets a cocktail mixed ahead of time and finished in the blender. Meanwhile, serious cocktail haunts all over the city routinely shake every pisco sour to order as a matter of pride. A high-end restaurant in the heart of Manhattan that showed off Peruvian cuisine in all its vast, hybrid glory would have been a real event. If you sit at the bar of La Mar, order up a grilled heart and some raw fish, and get a drink made by hand, you can catch some bright glints of what that might have tasted like. And have a good little meal, too.",A Review of La Mar Cebicheria Peruana in Manhattan,"['night', 'winter', 'temperature', 'sagged', 'freezing', 'host', 'la', 'mar', 'cebicheria', 'peruana', 'led',

285,Chevalier,★★,2015-08-11,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/12/dining/restaurant-review-chevalier-in-midtown.html,Midtown,"“What’s the matter?” my dinner companion asked one night at Chevalier, the luxurious new French restaurant in Midtown at the base of the Baccarat Hotel & Residences New York. “You look like you just saw a ghost.” Maybe I had. A man wearing an elegantly knotted silk tie had just materialized at our side and wished us “bon appétit” with the ease of a native speaker. He was Charles Masson, who for years steered the stately old ship of La Grenouille until a family struggle sent him out on the streets. He landed at Chevalier as the “director.” In the pre-opening press, Mr. Masson drew as much attention as the chef, Shea Gallante, formerly of Ciano and Cru. But just a month after the opening in early April, he announced that he was leaving. Now, four weeks after that, I was startled to see him in the flesh, still haunting the dining room, wishing us a healthy appetite as we faced our scallops and cavatelli. Today Mr. Masson is officially gone, but Chevalier is still searching for a guiding spirit. This place is confused about its identity. The designer Stephen Sills gave the dining room the soft glimmer of an abalone shell; it’s pretty, but it also looks like a movie director’s idea of a restaurant for rich people. Some of the customers get into the spirit: On two separate nights, somebody walked in with the help of a sterling silver-handled cane. As one of my guests said, it’s a place where Bruce Wayne would have dinner. According to the website, though, Chevalier is a “brasserie de luxe.” The first person who can successfully explain what it has in common with a brasserie wins a choucroute garnie for 12 at my house. Finding the right tone for a new restaurant is fiendishly complicated. As expense and ambitions increase, so do the complications, and Chevalier is both expensive and ambitious. Already, even as it tries to figure itself out, there is a lot to enjoy. Mr. Gallante’s cooking is a little hard to pin down, but every meal reminded me just how compelling Ciano and Cru had been when he was in charge. Anybody whose taste buds are in working order could work up a good appetite for those cavatelli — chewy but tender, yolk-enriched, and shiny in a sharp, springlike ramp pesto with smoked pecorino. The next course brought what has to be the greatest piece of roasted veal loin I’ve ever met, supremely flavorful and juicy. The long slabs of dry-aged duck breast I ate another night had all the intensity, the blood-rich tang and the richness that I’m starting to give up on getting from steak. Thick slices of pork loin ringed with a narrow band of well-rendered fat were a model of subtle, sensitive roasting; most chefs can’t come up with pork this juicy without brining it until it’s as salty as ham. Mr. Gallante is smart enough to leave these strong flavors alone, with just minor help from the rest of the plate. With the duck came a dab of Medjool date-red wine sauce, not too sweet, and the pork got by with just a breezy, summery helping of beans and garlic scapes. With seafood, the sauces do more of the work. A buttery emulsion with a trace of lemon verbena was neatly calibrated for black sea bass; cucumber chopped to a pulp and yuzu juice had a powerful and wonderful effect on raw Japanese yellowtail. The charcuterie plate is a marvel of offal craftsmanship: duck rillettes with a bullet of foie gras shot right through the center; rough-hewed and pistachio-flecked liverwurst; calf’s tongue and chicken liver mousse layered in a terrine with a bronze jiggle of Madeira jelly on top; saucisson sec with a clear, bracing fermented sourness. Wow. But the same restaurant that achieved this near miracle also served foie gras mousse as cold and hard as butter right out of the refrigerator. I couldn’t spread it; worse, I couldn’t taste it. The veal that had been so transporting was, the next time I tried it, cooked to the unappetizing pinkish-gray color of canned tuna. Both nights, it came with a stodgy nub of sweetbread, reminiscent of pressed tofu. Fried soft-shell crab with burrata sounded weird on the menu and was weirder on the plate. It was like watching a bad date. I kept waiting for one of the ingredients to get an urgent text from a roommate who’s locked out of the apartment. Although Chevalier often seems to be in out-of-town-tryout mode, it charges Broadway prices. This may get ironed out in September, when the menu will go à la carte. Right now, a three-course prix fixe dinner is $96; two courses are $74, which means you could save $22 by skipping David Carmichael’s accomplished French desserts. The prix isn’t entirely fixe, though. The dense chocolate soufflé, which to be fair is enough for two and is delivered with a dark-chocolate, crème-anglaise-filled egg that servers carefully crack and place on the soufflé, is $8.50 extra. Side dishes, like excellent gratin dauphinois, are $12 extra; the charcuterie plate is $26 extra. Mr. Gallante also promised lower, more consistent prices for the bar, where the situation now borders on the irrational. A manhattan was $18, but a gin and tonic was $20. One night, my companion pointed to my $22 Moscow Mule and asked the bartender for something “just like his, but different.” One difference was its price, $24. Tweaks are planned for uniforms, décor and “service sensibility,” which the publicist said “will definitely be lightened.” I have no complaints about the service itself; the dining room staff came out of the gate with the fluid, watchful poise of people who have been in place for years. But its Old World tone would make more sense if the restaurant itself had a clearer point of view. Chevalier and its hotel were built by a real estate conglomerate, which sold them but still manages both through a subsidiary company. The conglomerate also owns the Baccarat crystal firm, and sprinkled its sparkly glass all over the building. At Chevalier, named after a Baccarat designer, the product placement is subtle but ever-present. There are charms in drinking water from heavy crystal tumblers, not least of all the workout you give your biceps, but it’s hard to escape the feeling that customer pleasure is secondary to corporate interests. Chevalier seems to have been conceived as a French luxury restaurant, in other words, simply because Baccarat is a French luxury company. French luxury restaurants can be wonderful, but they have to be played with conviction. Mr. Masson could have supplied that, but now it will have to come from somewhere else. Of course, there is one luxury that would overcome all arguments. Food as consistently good as the charcuterie plate and that first veal loin would make Chevalier a destination. It just wouldn’t be a brasserie.",Chevalier in Midtown,"['“what’s', 'matter”', 'companion', 'asked', 'chevalier', 'luxurious', 'french', 'midtown', 'base', 'baccarat', 'hotel', '', 'residence',

286,Gus & Gabriel Gastropub,0 star,2009-09-15,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/16/dining/reviews/16rest.html,Upper West Side,"WHEN three children under age 10 leave their milkshakes almost untouched, you know there’s trouble. They weren’t tempted by anything else on the table, either: barbecued pork, mashed potatoes and other dishes that would be gone in five minutes in any other restaurant. Gus & Gabriel Gastropub isn’t any other restaurant. It is the latest project from Michael Psilakis, a prodigiously gifted and largely self-taught chef who seemed to materialize out of nowhere five years ago and since then has gone from success to success. His Italian cooking at Dona, and then at its more relaxed successor, Mia Dona, was  distinctive and crowd pleasing. He plumbed the earthier pleasures of Greek food at Kefi; by keeping the flavors direct and the prices within reach, he filled the seats of its original space, and then a much larger one. Best of all is Anthos, his more rarefied take on Greek cuisine, where he refined a highly personal and original vision that proved he is a chef who can both dream and deliver. His fast and glorious run earned Mr. Psilakis, 41, national acclaim. It brought Gus & Gabriel a high level of attention upon its arrival early this summer. And it makes that restaurant’s colossal misfires almost impossible to believe and harder still to explain. The anglicized Gastropub of the name is a red herring. Gus & Gabriel’s menu reads like the one at countless casual American pubs, with a few nods to T. G. I. Friday’s and all the strip-mall P. T. Pennyfathers it spawned. Mr. Psilakis intended to improve mainstream food — fried mozzarella, spaghetti and meatballs, barbecued riblets — by making it all from scratch. The tortilla chips in nachos are fried  in house;  the ice creams in the shakes and floats are made at Anthos. This may strike some people as pandering. But the problem with Gus & Gabriel is not that it aims low. The problem is that it fails to achieve even its low aims. After all, almost every chef in town is experimenting with techniques for building a better burger. Mr. Psilakis may be the only one to have perfected a new technology that magically strips out all the taste. I never thought I would want to add salt to a burger topped with bacon, Gruyère, onion rings and a fried egg. Greasy and indistinct, it disproved the adage that fat is flavor. He uses the same device on pork butt and pork ribs. Is he sending all the flavor to his other restaurants? Exploring the first section of the menu, called Bar Snacks, you get a glimpse of what Gus & Gabriel could have been. Mr. Psilakis really has improved on Friday’s loaded potato skins, if the ones being served at an outlet of the chain near Penn Station last week were representative. Those were sodden, sad sinkholes with a potato-like appearance. The Gus & Gabriel version was made with identifiable potatoes, good bacon and chili with a hint of sweetness and cinnamon, Cincinnati-style, and they are terrific. So are the thick potato chips fresh out of the hot oil, the golden mozzarella balls and the enormous platter of nachos. This section of the menu made me long for a barstool and a ballgame. But I was in the wrong place: there are no televisions and room for just four customers at the stools stuffed into an awkward space near the front door. Everybody else walks down a passageway to an oddly stiff dining room in the back. Here we face the central mystery of Gus & Gabriel: if Mr. Psilakis wanted to serve bar food, why didn’t he just open a bar? Given the speed with which he moved, welcoming the first customers  about five months after announcing the plans, it’s impossible not to suspect that he was in too much of a hurry. He had an idea and, once he relocated Kefi, he had an empty restaurant. But he seems not to have paused to ask if they were right for each other. With a little more time (and extra money and headaches), he might have reconfigured the layout to make space for a bar along one wall. The room would have been livelier, noisier, more hectic. Gus & Gabriel may be the only restaurant in history that would be improved by adding a popcorn machine to the dining room. Initially, Mr. Psilakis was going to open Gus & Gabriel with Donatella Arpaia, his business partner in Kefi, Anthos and, until he left it this week, Mia Dona. She dropped out. Had she stayed, she might have pointed out that a suit of armor and a few Tiffany-style  lamps do not add up to interior design. She might have suggested that a place serving macaroni and cheese and milkshakes on the Upper West Side might want to have a highchair. The food would have benefited from a more deliberate rollout, too. The skin on what is advertised as “crispy chicken” was as crisp as a balloon, and the biscuits on the plate were wet and doughy, as if the cook had decided halfway through that he would rather make dumplings. A kind of gazpacho made with tomatillos was sharp, salty and weird. The broth with a French dip had the acrid taste of onions left to burn on the stove. Pork ribs sat on a smear of what looked and tasted like undercooked roux. But extra time didn’t save a section of the menu called Other Stuff, which appeared a few weeks after the restaurant opened. A selection of offal and other oddities, it raises hopes that those dishes are exempt from the pub theme because they’re so delicious. Those hopes wither at the first bite of a sour chicken-liver mousse paired with a mushy terrine, and they die with a taste of tongue that seems to have passed through the flavor subtractor. (The tongue came with a dish of what the waiter said was the poaching liquid. It didn’t taste like anything, either. The only thing on that plate that did was the bread.) The “other stuff” was particularly dispiriting because it brought to mind a lunch in this same room about five years ago, when it was called Onera and the chef was a newcomer named Michael Psilakis. He prepared a tasting menu of kidneys, brains and other butcher’s remnants. The flavor juxtapositions were so right they were almost spooky. I hoped that the chef would be cooking at this level for a long time to come. I still do. Gus & Gabriel Gastropub FAIR 222 West 79th Street, (212) 362-7470.

287,Saul,★★,2009-10-06,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/07/dining/reviews/07rest.html,Prospect Heights,"TEN years is a respectable run for a New York restaurant. Most don’t make it that long, and many of those that do are slowly taking on water. A few may change course by bringing a new chef on board or, more and more frequently these days, trimming their sails and tacking toward cheaper, more casual shores. Saul is a heartening exception. One of the first restaurants to bring a contemporary sensibility to Brooklyn when it appeared on Smith Street in 1999, it has neither faded, nor stood still, nor sought a personality transplant. Instead Saul Bolton, the chef and the owner with his wife, Lisa, has upgraded just about everything in their modest storefront. Saul is the same restaurant, but better. Mr. Bolton stood out in his adopted borough during the Clinton administration for his premium ingredients and the skill with which he prepared them, rather than for any pirouettes of imagination. In a $25 and Under column the year Saul opened, when it was last reviewed in The New York Times, Eric Asimov praised the “strong, clear flavors, bolstered by background harmonies that augment without overshadowing.” Even with foie gras on the menu (for the time-capsule price of $11), the cooking then was relatively unadorned. The dish I remember best from that era was roasted chicken, cooked all the way through but not a moment longer, and given a refined bistro treatment with a concentrated roasted garlic sauce. Good as it was, it did not carve out new territories of flavor the way the best dishes now do. I don’t remember anything on the original menu as eye-opening as the crisp pork terrine, a small grenade of deep-fried deliciousness. The kitchen simmers the head of a pig until it falls apart in shreds, then molds the meat to form the fatty core inside a crunchy panko shell. At this point, cornichons and grainy mustard would seem inevitable. Mr. Bolton has other ideas, namely  a creamy scoop of guacamole, a tart tomatillo and cilantro salsa, and cubes of pickled red pepper. The only thing that surprised me more than this Franco-Mexican liaison was how quickly I was ready for another helping. Squid ink tagliatelle was a more conventional appetizer, but was gone just as quickly. Black handmade noodles supported tender bits of squid and soaked up their wonderful broth (and, no doubt, a good deal of butter) but still held their firm-tender snap. Golden chips of garlic, a poached egg and slivers of unusually sweet and meaty dried tomatoes were on hand for all the extra emphasis the dish needed. With the exception of a striped bass fillet so aggressively seared that the  skin was more carbonized than caramelized, most of what I ate showed the same unwavering handle on technique that set Saul apart from the beginning. A main course of skate wing was sautéed to a beautiful golden finish, and left on the bone (or more precisely, the cartilage), giving it a fuller, more luxurious taste than most restaurants manage. Many calves would die in vain before I learned to pan-roast veal sweetbreads as precisely as Saul did. Even then, I doubt I would dream up the pillowy purée of chickpeas that doubled as a side dish for the sweetbreads and their sauce. The Boltons chose Smith Street in 1999 because they sensed that their neighbors wanted Manhattan-style meals without crossing a bridge. Also, the rents were low. Their dining room made the best of a tight budget: thick plates from Fishs Eddy, sturdy wineglasses, exposed brick. Like couples in a starter apartment, they dressed the place up as the money came in. The food is now served on white Bernardaud china and the wine is poured into Ravenscroft glasses. Such refinements gave Saul the feel of a destination. The first New York Michelin guide ratified this view when it gave Saul a star, a rating that was reaffirmed with the publication of the 2010 edition this week. Mr. Bolton said in a telephone interview that the Michelin star lured visitors from around the country and beyond. But Saul is probably best understood as a neighborhood restaurant, although a very nice one. The Boltons buy their wineglasses from the owner of the company, who happens to be a regular. With another customer, they bartered meals in exchange for the luminous Venetian plaster, which he applied to walls that once held a regular coat of paint and then buffed with beeswax. Classifying Saul as a neighborhood restaurant also keeps expectations in line. A cod main course one night was on the dry side, which might have been all right if it had tasted fresher. A mackerel appetizer with caponata, candied lemon and parsley sounded like September on the Mediterranean, but was as dull as New York in November. One garnish too many gave some preparations a disorderly aspect. The menu has grown bigger and more expensive (even the cheapest main course is more than $25), and it might be better if it were pared back to the inarguable winners, like the knockout roasted breast and confit leg of squab, with cracked green wheat that tasted fresh and earthy at once. Styles change, and Saul now lives among newer Brooklyn restaurants that don’t pretend they’re in Manhattan. Their homespun aesthetic can make the borough feel like  Berkeley East. Their crowd skews young. (The Boltons themselves are about to open a second, more casual place, in Prospect Heights.) At Saul, I saw young women carrying date-night purses sitting beside couples a generation or two older. The restaurant, its music never too loud or too boring and its waiters neither too aloof nor too familiar, seemed to suit them all. For all its changes, it has always been a good neighbor, even if its neighborhood now stretches beyond Brooklyn. Saul ★★ 140 Smith Street (Bergen Street), Boerum Hill, Brooklyn; (718) 935-9844.

288,Cherche Midi,★★,2014-09-30,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/01/dining/restaurant-review-keith-mcnallys-cherche-midi.html,Nolita,"We were halfway through appetizers at Cherche Midi, passing the steak tartare and spreading anchovy toasts with softly jiggly Parmesan custard, when one of my guests suddenly tilted his head and listened. He looked like the boy in a tornado movie who notices that the birds have stopped singing. “There’s no music,” he said. “They have speakers all over the dining room, but they’re not using them.” The restaurateur Keith McNally opened Cherche Midi in June on the corner of Houston Street and the Bowery, in a neighborhood where you don’t go out to dinner unless you are prepared to shout over some Pavement song the chef loved in college. But we were talking, with no recorded soundtrack, as if we were in some Continental restaurant off Sutton Place in 1964 eating veal Orloff by candlelight. This is the paradox of Mr. McNally. Food writers who were still eating applesauce through a straw when he opened his first restaurant (the Odeon, 1980) write about him with the same reverence that music writers have for Leonard Cohen. He’s “the king of cool,” the restaurateur who “owns NYC.” Yet when it comes to current dining trends, particularly those in favor downtown, Mr. McNally shows a healthy disregard, verging at times on hostility. Of the six restaurants he operates between 14th Street and Canal Street, Cherche Midi may be his most thorough repudiation of the downtown scene. It isn’t just music that’s missing. There’s almost no view of the street. Tapas, shared plates, tasting menus, wine pairings, “Chef recommends,” two-hour waits for a table the size of a chessboard — no, none of that. Nor did Cherche Midi’s servers try to tell me “how the menu works,” as if it were some complicated and expensive piece of machinery that I was likely to break. In Mr. McNally’s restaurants, chefs are rarely treated like stars. At Cherche Midi, two men, Shane McBride and Daniel Parilla, share the work and the credit. As a result, perhaps, their cooking is almost egoless; it’s not about what they want. It’s about what you want, especially if that happens to be red meat and French wine. The prime rib may be the only dish at Cherche Midi that could be accused of trying to make an impression. The dark, roasted edges had the irresistible intensity of the bark on great barbecued brisket, even on the night they were aggressively salted. Lending this slab of dry-aged beef a bit of finesse is the side dish of pommes soufflées, like inflatable potato chips or, as one guest said, “gluten-free beignets.” The menu gives three more main-course slots to beef. Steak frites does a fine impersonation of a Parisian bistro steak, the kind you don’t mind chewing and chewing between glasses of the house Beaujolais Villages, served at Cherche Midi in an $18 carafe. Filet mignon au poivre is far more tender, of course, with less sacrifice in flavor than usual. The tall, compact, rather lean, drip-free and wholly excellent burger is made from dry-aged prime rib; if you put your nose close enough, you can smell the meat locker right through the aroma of onion-bacon jam. All three dishes come with dark, skinny fries. Cherche Midi is so good with beef that even the best of the other main courses may register as a half step down: a pot of fat, clean mussels with bits of preserved lemon clinging to them; a roast chicken done right; a salade niçoise that pays attention to the last detail, including, in a wonderful departure from tradition, the pile of smashed potato salad at the bottom of the bowl. Here and there, the kitchen tends to overembellish. The decent roasted salmon comes with a lentil salad that tries to do too many things at once, and limp white stewed onions and fennel did not give skate Grenobloise (billed as meunière) anything that it really needed. It would be nice, too, to taste the meat under the aggressive seasoning in the steak tartare appetizer, given the chefs are clearly buying good beef. At least it made a strong impression, which is more than I can say for the $18 heirloom tomato salad. Heirlooms from where, exactly? Food Emporium? Still, unless you are coming to Cherche Midi to commune with the essence of summer, it is a good enough salad. The desserts are much better than that. The floating islands, the mocha pot de crème, the small pink raspberry soufflé hovering above a bed of warm berries — the lineup is one argument after another for bringing back old-fashioned pleasures. After a recent tour of all his restaurants, I think Mr. McNally’s great talent may be knowing which things are worth worrying about and which can get by with being just good enough. At Morandi, the main courses were almost impressive in their mediocrity, but the pasta was just swell, which may be all the place needs to keep its chairs full. The short-rib patty melt was the only good dish on a table full of disappointments at Schiller’s Liquor Bar, but I enjoyed myself more than I have at far better restaurants. There is a limit, though, and Balthazar is approaching it. The cooking, under Mr. McBride, has become utterly mundane, a pretty but flavorless imitation of French food of the kind found at any generic fake bistro. Cherche Midi’s salade niçoise is delicious from start to finish; Balthazar’s is a bowl of ingredients that can’t remember what they’re supposed to taste like. How can the same chef and the same restaurateur be responsible for both? Mr. McNally does worry about service, which at Cherche Midi manages to be everywhere without crossing the line to helicopter waitering. And, of course, he worries about the interiors. Cherche Midi’s is lovely. Outside is a dystopian intersection. You’d never know it in the dining room, which feels intimate, almost private, although of course every face is on display, bathed in light the color of apricot jam. For three decades, Mr. McNally has been rooting around in the same Lego kit: distressed mirrors, chipped subway tiles, bottles backlighted to look like stained glass. In his hands, these well-worn tricks give restaurants the battered nobility of a vintage Saab. When anyone else tries, they end up with a 1986 Ford Escort. Sets and lighting will never be the whole show.",Keith McNally’s Cherche Midi,"['halfway', 'appetizer', 'cherche', 'midi', 'passing', 'steak', 'tartare', 'spreading', 'anchovy', 'toast', 'softly',

289,Calliope,★,2012-10-02,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/03/dining/reviews/restaurant-review-calliope-in-the-east-village.html,East Village,"THE first time I tasted Ginevra Iverson’s cooking, I was sure she was French. At the time, she was running the kitchen at Thirstbaràvin, an overachieving wine bar in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and nothing about her menu felt American. Not its concise take-it-or-leave-it length, nor its obvious faith in the power of sorrel and leeks and butter, nor its sensitive takes on the kinds of classics that are scratched in chalk above a zinc bar. Only someone born in France, I thought, could serve a plate of lamb leg with baked tomatoes that tasted so simple and honest, with no effort to crank the flavors up to American levels. When the wine bar’s owners set me straight (Ms. Iverson is Californian), I learned two lessons. First, that it’s foolish to think that only someone born into a culture can understand its cuisine. Second, and of more immediate interest, that Ms. Iverson was a chef I’d happily follow, wherever she comes from and wherever she goes. In the spring she turned up in the East Village, where she and her husband, Eric Korsh, a chef who was last seen at the Waverly Inn, have taken over a turnkey restaurant formerly called Belcourt. They largely left intact the brasserie bones that New Yorkers living in the Age of McNally call bistro décor: tiles, tin ceilings, scarred mirrors and glass doors. Whether the room is true to the bistro ethos doesn’t matter. The menu is, in a way that the city doesn’t see often enough. You’d have to spend a week in Paris to taste rabbit cooked in as many ways as it is served at Calliope. Rabbit kidneys on toast, a special one night, was so traditional it was almost shocking, in the most pleasant way. They were sautéed to the rare side of medium-rare, the uncouth edge of their bitterness softened by a Cognac-and-chicken-stock sauce with a touch of cream and butter. A wrapping of bacon gave rabbit saddle stuffed with tender leek greens and carrots an American note of smoke, but the heart of the dish, another special, was located across the Atlantic. The star of the cotton-tailed roster, a regular on the menu — and a dish that makes Calliope worth a visit all by itself — is tender braised rabbit legs tossed with pappardelle. All around the city you can find Italian spins on this idea, the sauce a ragù pink with tomatoes and aromatic with rosemary. Calliope’s rabbit is unmistakably Gallic. The sauce is built on white wine and shallots; the herbs are the trusty French quartet of chives, chervil, tarragon and parsley, and there’s not a tomato in sight. That dish and others at Calliope made me wonder why bistro cuisine in New York seems to have largely stopped evolving. For decades after World War II, French cuisine flowered here, from formal dining rooms to neighborhood dives. But somehow, as American tastes began to change, Italian restaurants stole the scene, drawing ideas from lesser-known corners of Italy, from the farmers’ markets and from ever-better imported ingredients. Meanwhile, bistro cuisine has fossilized, as chefs thumb through the same dog-eared recipe cards again and again. Steak frites, poulet rôti, moules marinière, pâté de campagne, crème brûlée: the menus might as well be printed on a mimeograph. Some New Yorkers might believe that these by-the-numbers bistros offer a cheap ticket to the Left Bank, but those who have been to Paris recently know that the bistro tradition, never dormant, has been thoroughly rejuvenated by young chefs. Mr. Korsh and Ms. Iverson don’t go nearly as far as, say, Inaki Aizpitarte at his modern bistro Le Chateaubriand. But those who hunger for the soul of bistro cuisine and not just its greatest hits will want to order a plate of Calliope’s boiled eggs with mayonnaise all the same. The eggs are just barely set in the center, and the mayonnaise is a sunny, yolk-rich yellow, seasoned boldly with vinegar, lemon juice and mustard. Sprinkled around the plate is a tart house-made celery salt of dried celeriac that I’d like to put on every egg salad I eat from this point on. This is how to keep a classic alive. The couple, who met while working at Picholine, share kitchen duties. She is responsible for the excellent beef tongue, shaving it into thin leaves that are folded over sweet white onions and an old-school sauce gribiche that’s even tangier than that mayonnaise. Mr. Korsh knows his way around a pig’s head, and his tête de porc has deep flavor with a textbook funkiness, though I wished it was sliced more thickly to play up the contrast between firm boiled meat and other, more gelatinous stuff. Those weren’t my only misgivings. The room looks pretty, but all those hard surfaces can make conversation an ordeal. The leeks that surrounded poached lobster in a gorgeous slab of a terrine could have been more flavorful, or maybe the dish was served just a few degrees too cold. And while I have no quarrel with the decision to serve ricotta-chard dumplings in browned butter, such nods to Italy having become almost routine in Paris bistros, Calliope’s are dense and flat-footed. In matzo-ball vernacular, these dumplings are sinkers. And the cake that our server one night billed as something like angel food was nearly as earthbound as an emu. I spooned up the apricot-pit ice cream served with the cake, though, as I did almost all the other desserts, now under the care of the talented pastry chef Shuna Lydon. She makes a stunningly simple bowl of vanilla custard under a chilled layer of red plum purée that I’m going to think about all fall and into the winter. And while it can’t be called her invention, the baba au rhum almost made me misty with gratitude each time a server cut the still-hot and yeasty cake neatly in half and doused it with booze from a little pitcher, as the steam lifted the vanilla scent of aged rum into the air. Very few Manhattan restaurants not owned by Alain Ducasse get baba au rhum so right. And Calliope gets many things right, even its two note-perfect chard gratins and a New York strip steak that might sound run of the mill yet is anything but, thanks to an aggressive searing and a small lake of butter and beef fat. The beef isn’t French, but the spirit is, and with bistro cuisine the spirit is what matters.",Calliope in the East Village,"['tasted', 'ginevra', 'iverson’s', 'sure', 'french', 'running', 'kitchen',

290,Romera New York,★,2012-01-17,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/18/dining/reviews/romera-new-york-nyc-review.html,Chelsea,"THE first thing I ate at Romera New York was a jam of black olives and tomatoes. Sticky, sweet and salty, it made a fine spread for the warm roll that came with it, and it was just as appealing eaten with a spoon. At the rim of the plate were three stripes of green, gold and red, each smaller than a grain of rice and arranged like the flag of Bolivia. I eventually decided the flag had to be a garnish and ate it. Raw bell peppers. Their grassy flavor clashed with the jam. When the next plate arrived, again bearing three filaments of raw pepper, I asked a server about it. “That’s the chef’s little signature,” she said. “Like an artist would sign his paintings.” By the end of my meal, the flag that was both a garnish and a little signature also became an emblem, one that stood for the larger problem posed by Romera New York. A restaurant willing to send out a garnish meant to be interpreted rather than eaten is a restaurant that wants to be admired, not enjoyed. Without question there is much to admire about Dr. Miguel Sánchez Romera, the chef who signed that plate and founded this restaurant. Dr. Romera is a neurologist who took up cooking as a hobby. It grew into a passion so powerful that, without ever having studied in a culinary school or a professional kitchen, he opened a restaurant in Barcelona, L’Esguard. While the rising tide of Spanish gastronomy no doubt lifted Dr. Romera’s boat, he set himself apart. He opposed some of the chemicals being explored in places such as El Bulli, saying that for a doctor to use such synthetic ingredients would be a violation of the Hippocratic oath. Instead, he championed a cassava-based stabilizer that he called Micri. He studied the brain’s interaction with the stomach, which led to another innovation, gastronomic waters, a kind of broth that he claims produces a feeling of fullness to prevent overindulgence during his long multicourse tasting menus. There’s a lot to admire, too, about Romera New York, the restaurant he founded this fall in the Dream Downtown hotel on West 16th Street. Designed by the architect Glen Coben, it is a fluid composition of glass, steel and wood, with living plants, pools of smooth black stones and serpentine curtains of rippling white fabric. It has to be the brightest and airiest restaurant anyone has ever built in a basement. In the kitchen, there is a devotion to doing things the hard way that can make the D.I.Y. fetishists of Williamsburg, Brooklyn, look like Sandra Lee. Coffee beans are roasted in house, and so, even more remarkably, are the cacao beans that Dr. Romera buys from Chiapas, Mexico, and then painstakingly turns into glossy, satiny tablets of dark chocolate that come with the petits fours. And there are the dishes that precede the chocolate, 11 in all if you choose the full $245 tasting menu. Dr. Romera’s plates have a visual style all their own, painterly and handmade. Subtle compositions like a glistening scallop in a shallow pool of unsweetened white chocolate sauce invite quiet contemplation. In a city where not just the restaurants but the cooking are often clamorous, this is food that whispers. Can you tell which marinated salmon egg tastes like soy and which like beets? Is there really cinnamon in the caviar dish? If you give yourself over to the experience, a meal at Romera can refresh your perspective on what’s in front of you, one of the gifts of art. Yet as much as you might admire Dr. Romera, you can’t help feeling that you will never be able to admire him quite as much as you’re supposed to. Upon arrival, you are shown to a waiting room and invited to peruse Dr. Romera’s collection of books about cooking, art and neuroscience. Shipped from Spain, the library may be the first one where “Fat Detection: Taste, Texture and Post Ingestive Effects” is shelved right between Bocuse and Escoffier. Reading matter is provided in the restrooms and on the front staircase, too, which are inscribed with quotations from Dr. Romera like “I am a doctor who cooks, not a cook who doctors food.” The menu also makes references to the doctor’s ideas. Two dishes come on plates in which powdered spices or vegetables have been applied in a tight geometric grid; these are called Romerian mosaics. This wouldn’t be any more becoming if the chef in question were a globally recognized master, but you might grit your teeth and indulge it as one of the prices you pay for magnificent cooking. But to eat at Romera New York is to be told repeatedly that you are in the presence of greatness, while the evidence of your senses tells you that you are in the presence of, at best, okayness. If all went well and the plates hadn’t cooled too much on their short trip from the kitchen, a recurring problem, the food at Romera could be rather pleasant. But it was not pleasurable, in the deep and memorable way that makes you want to book your next reservation and tell your friends. I could never convince myself that the white chocolate brought anything more to the scallop than a sticky blandness. Tiny swirls of vegetable purées in that sauce contributed more color than flavor. Beet juice lent salmon the deep crimson of Chinese lacquer; orange peel and bay leaves infused its marinade. But none of the seasonings could make this fish taste like wild salmon; it never lost the listless texture and flavor of fish raised on a farm. As a place charging this kind of money must, apparently, Romera New York arms its tasting menu with caviar, foie gras and truffles. I’d gladly have traded all of them for carrots and beets that tasted like carrots and beets, instead of the washed-out facsimiles that appeared with one of the Romerian mosaics. The same dish featured raw spinach coated in a yellowish goop of cassava and a slowly creeping sludge of lukewarm vegetable broth. I never finished that dish, not once in three attempts. There was one night when nearly everything was tepid and much of it went back to the kitchen only half eaten. Nobody seemed to care or even notice. The show was in progress, and it wasn’t going to be stopped by the reactions of mere customers.",Romera New York,"['thing', 'romera', 'jam', 'black', 'olive', 'tomato', 'sticky', 'sweet', 'salty',

291,Botequim,★★,2014-12-23,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/24/dining/restaurant-review-botequim-in-the-east-village.html,Greenwich Village,"Restaurants hide in all kinds of ways. There is the coy, unmarked-door hiding of the neo-speakeasy. There is the romantic hiding of restaurants whose positioning at, say, the end of an alley allows men to seem clever and their dates to seem impressed. There is the snooty hiding of exclusive restaurants that behave like private clubs, an affectation that is going out of style and won’t be missed. Then there is Botequim, a fine new Brazilian restaurant that seems to have been hidden away against its will in the basement of a hotel on Fourth Avenue.  You descend to Botequim in one of two ways. The first is weird. You walk into the Fourth, the street-level all-day restaurant of the Hyatt Union Square New York, past disoriented travelers at the bar, and take the stairs that unwind beneath a dangling helix of children’s beds suspended from the ceiling. The second is weirder. You open a glass door on Fourth Avenue that says Botequim — so far, so good — and descend a staircase that deposits you in a backstage area between the kitchen and the dining room. Taking this route one night, I landed in the middle of a hushed, tense conference between two employees, who fell silent when they saw me. I felt like Lord Grantham stumbling upon a downstairs bitchfest. The hotel’s efforts to keep Botequim out of sight since its September opening may account for the half-full dining room. Once you make it inside, though, things quickly start to look up. Graffiti-style murals zigzag across the walls, samba rhythms ripple all night long, and a glass of cachaça is never more than a few minutes away; the bartenders upstairs will shake it with muddled lime hulls for a classic caipirinha or stir it with a cube of frozen coconut water, a stupefyingly simple drink that I will be copying at home next summer. Most of all, Botequim has Brazilian food, under the direction of the chef Marco Moreira, that is too good to be trapped in a basement.  To start, have a few globes of pão de queijo, Brazilian cheese puffs that are something like gougères crossed with mochi. Springy and lightly chewy from tapioca flour, they are delicious eaten in alternating bites with toothpick-speared lengths of grilled calabresa sausage, spicy and tinged with garlic. Or with a plate of pastelzinhos, wonderfully crisp turnovers whose thin pastry shells are not even a little bit doughy. Some are filled with cubes of unmelted cheese from the state of Minas Gerais, and you may need to come from there yourself to appreciate its squeaky blandness. But the pastelzinhos holding ground beef with tomatoes and olives are instantly lovable. So are the rough and flaky fried croquettes of salt cod, light but not insubstantial. They come with a lemon emulsion, which is to be ignored in favor of a few potent drops of the bright-red hot sauce made on site. It’s terrific stuff. The main courses make it obvious, if it wasn’t already, that Botequim’s kitchen cooks with far more finesse than the remaining restaurants of Manhattan’s Little Brazil or the outposts of those all-the-grilled-meat-you-can-eat chains that turn up every few years and are never as much fun as they sound. Mr. Moreira, who with his wife and business partner, Jo-Ann Makovitzky, owns Botequim along with Tocqueville and 15 East, was raised in São Paulo. The kitchen is in the hands of Jason Hall, his chef de cuisine, but you can tell that Mr. Moreira put considerable care into the recipes. He may have lightened some of Brazil’s more bruisingly rich dishes, but he kept the flavors true. Botequim’s cube of suckling pig plays a recurring role in one of my hungry daydreams, in which I break the thin roof of crackling skin into chips to scoop up swirls of lime-brightened pork, soft enough to serve as a dip. In other idle moments between meals, I flash back to the short rib, roasted in extremely slow motion until a dark and satisfying crust wraps around woozily tender meat. It’s like smokeless barbecue, and once I had tried it, I stopped flashing back to Botequim’s roasted top sirloin, called the Brazilian, a fine steak but ultimately just a steak. My private visions of moqueca may feature a more varied mix of seafood than black sea bass and a single prawn. But the coconut-tomato broth in this Bahian stew would taste a lot like Botequim’s, with every mouthful slicked by a palpable slug of red dendê oil. And when I imagine feijoada, it looks the way it did my first night at Botequim, when it was loaded with smoked pork and sausages and the black beans tasted as if they, too, were on the verge of turning into meat. On a second try, it was more soup than stew, and the beans tasted like beans. Maybe it was just the luck of the ladle. The high point of dessert was always a tres leches-style coconut cake grandly slouching under the weight of all the milk and cream it had soaked up. When I tried anything else, the meal never ended as well. Sonhos, the doughnut holes whose name means “dreams” in Portuguese, had an undreamlike heaviness, though a quick dunk in guava sauce helped. For reasons I can’t imagine, the rice pudding, which was allegedly made with bananas and passion fruit, tasted like stewed onions. And my coffee, which seemed like a sure thing in a Brazilian restaurant, was awful, a thin and watery broth. If you want a drink with dessert, try some sherry from Roger Dagorn’s list, which is strong in all departments, down to the rarely seen Brazilian beers. But weak coffee and iffy desserts can be fixed; they’re no reason to hide Botequim away from people looking for dinner along Fourth Avenue. Mr. Moreira and Ms. Makovitzky also operate the Fourth and a whiskey and wine bar called Singl, both on the street level. I don’t know anything about the hotel business; if I did, maybe I’d understand why hotels have such strange ideas about spelling. But a bar seems like a natural inhabitant for a snug room in the basement. My message to Mr. Moreira: Set the moqueca free! Let the cod fritters come upstairs!",Botequim in the East Village,"['hide', 'kind', 'way', 'coy', 'unmarkeddoor', 'hiding', 'neospeakeasy', 'romantic', 'hiding', 'whose', 'positioning', 'end',

292,El Rey Coffee Bar & Luncheonette,★,2015-07-28,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/29/dining/restaurant-review-el-rey-coffee-bar-luncheonette-on-the-lower-east-side.html,Lower East Side,"Just after I accepted the fact that I was in love with a dish called vegan chicharrones locos, a phrase from Freud ran through my head. The phrase was “the return of the repressed,” and it seemed relevant, somehow, to these fried squares of puffed wheat at El Rey Coffee Bar & Luncheonette on the Lower East Side. Porkless chicharrones would have struck me as sacrilegious a few years ago. At the time, I was busily cheering on the new cult of animal-flesh worship that was burying the joyless orthodoxy of the low-fat diet beneath slabs of pork belly. White meat, steamed vegetables and olive oil were elbowed aside to make room for chicken liver toasts, marrow bones and whipped lard. Chefs and avid eaters scorned anything that might qualify as health food, which by the standards of the time included any vegetable cooked without bacon. But as Freud knew, repressed urges find ways of bobbing to the surface again. Last decade, the return of the repressed looked like an entire pork shoulder torn apart by people who would leave the table with the glazed look of an anaconda that happened across a slow-moving deer. In this decade, it looks like puffed brown rice with raw cauliflower pebbles and kale at Sqirl in Los Angeles. It looks like an Allen Street marquee of Times Square dimensions screaming DIRT CANDY above Amanda Cohen’s vegetable circus-slash-restaurant. It looks like chia pudding with hemp at Dimes on Canal Street, where they put wheat grass in their margaritas. And it looks like vegan chicharrones locos at El Rey. The dish turns a Mexican street snack, chicharrones de harina, into a salad, and turns salad into an event. These mock pork skins are tossed with mint and sticks of raw jicama in a bowl, the vessel of choice for return-of-the-repressed dishes across the country. They are dusted with smoldering Aleppo pepper and lemony ground sumac, strafed by a terrific hot sauce of chiles and pickled pineapple and mellowed with a nondairy cashew cream. Nicholas Morgenstern, the proprietor of GG’s and Morgenstern’s Finest Ice Cream, opened El Rey in 2013 with little more than an espresso machine and some shelves of pastries baked by Gerardo Gonzalez. Luncheonette was appended to the name when Mr. Gonzalez was promoted to chef a few months later. When El Rey was reviewed by Ligaya Mishan in a Hungry City column the following year, it served breakfast and lunch. Friends I trusted kept telling me that I needed to check it out. They said things like “the food is exactly what I feel like eating.” They renewed their calls after February, when the dinner menu sprouted up. All these friends were women, and when I finally took their advice, I noticed that in the dining room, men were always outnumbered by women (they had yoga stomachs, quick eyes and nails as colorful and glossy as a Mini Cooper on the dealer’s lot). I wouldn’t read too much into this observation, but it seems worth mentioning because the voices that brayed most loudly about the virtues of animal fat tended to be male. The pieces of this tiny restaurant fit together like an empty wallet and a new $20 bill. Two high tables are each surrounded by four metal stools. A few more seats crouch beneath a counter that looks onto Stanton Street, and three more face an area the size of a bathtub with a single induction burner. This passes for the kitchen. Neon script on the back wall spells the restaurant’s name in swimming-pool blue. The service is California chill. Ordering is uncomplicated. El Rey has few of the comforts of a larger, more elaborate restaurant, but none of the discomforts, either. Mr. Gonzalez is a native of San Diego. In his short time at El Rey, he has worked out a point of view in the kitchen that is distinctly his own, a blend of California-Mexican cuisine with some of the less punitive flavors from the health-food and vegan disciplines. In these tight quarters, his menu necessarily favors assemblage over cooking, by which I mean dinner will probably feature at least one salad. There is chopped kale that tastes brighter and more refreshing than the routine version. The shaved cauliflower number sprinkled with toasted sesame seeds has more surprises; it softens and picks up flavor as it soaks up the chickpea-tahini vinaigrette and the yolk of a poached egg. Other dishes have more ballast, but nothing will make you feel like an anaconda. Warm, marinated chorizo is essentially a tapas portion with something extra: chopped hazelnuts and threads of orange zest. Octopus, sliced dime-thin and marinated, Cuban style, is mixed with chopped hominy and tomatillo; it sits on white beans that have been puréed with squid ink, garlic oil and black garlic. I was still wondering if I’d ever tasted white beans put to such interesting use as I scraped the last smudges from the plate. Mr. Gonzalez has devised a winning, original tostada: shaved carrots and smoked sardines on a crackerlike corn tortilla on which whipped butter and thick yogurt are spread. Butter and sardines are longtime dance partners, but what sends them trotting off in new directions is the salsa verde of carrot greens. The kitchen has limitations, and not all of them can be blamed on lack of space. The brief menu reaches for the crunch factor of nuts a little too often. Should you eat the papas bravas the same night as the chicharrones locos, you may wish they did not both depend on the pineapple hot sauce and the cashew cream. But if you have them on their own, the crisp skins of little blue potatoes knocking up against pickled chunks of pineapple, you’ll simply wish you had more. To drink, you may have a good oddball wine, or a twist on the michelada rimmed with Aleppo pepper, or white sangria turned green by shiso and cucumber, which gives you the pleasant illusion that you are fortifying your body with nutritious juices and not just knocking back one glass of wine after another. At the end of dinner, there is usually a single dessert in addition to whatever pastries the daytime crowd didn’t make off with. One sultry May night, Mr. Gonzalez had carved up buttery lobes of Champagne mango, spooned mango pickle sauce on top and scooped some mango-passion fruit sorbet on the side. It was exactly what I felt like eating.",El Rey Coffee Bar & Luncheonette on the Lower East Side,"['accepted', 'fact', 'love', 'called', 'vegan', 'chicharrones', 'locos', 'phrase', 'freud', 'ran',

293,Gwynnett St.,★★,2012-04-03,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/04/dining/reviews/gwynnett-st-in-williamsburg-brooklyn.html,Williamsburg,"THE one-story exterior facing Graham Avenue, in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn, was totally unornamented except for a cryptic pair of stone lions up on the cornice. The dining room was plain, too, harking back to the days when nothing said hip, contemporary and urban better than exposed brick. At the end of the bar was what looked like, and under the previous ownership was, a pizza oven. Now it was baking miniature loaves of whiskey bread. They cost $5, tasted sweet and old-fashioned, and brought me back to those sprawling family restaurants that serve turkey with hot gravy on Sunday afternoons. Until the first course, in fact, nothing about Gwynnett St. hinted at what the kitchen had in store for me. But now servers had silently flanked the table. The one on my left decanted creamy salsify soup into a bowl dotted with crunchy bits of sweet-and-sour water chestnuts and a dab of shiso oil and fresh shiso leaves. I’d never imagined that the minty, lemony herb would have so much to say to the rich, oystery flavor of salsify. Or that a soup that brought them together could be so seductive. To my right, somebody had just been given a mound of roasted maitakes draped in a glistening sheet of lardo. It looked like a pine cone after an ice storm. Poked, the mushroom fell apart into mouth-size bites ready to be swabbed in a gentle cream of onions and rosemary. Across the table, two planks of brown-butter-roasted carrot lay alongside two strips of slow-cooked lamb breast, crisp and richly melting.  The sauce was thick, saffron-colored yogurt that tasted of carrots.  Crumbled rye toast with caraway and brown butter lent an Eastern European flavor. And what was that grassy herb? A sprig of carrot tops? Like almost everything at Gwynnett St., that lamb breast is not as simple as it looks, but its complications work together to build a marvelous sense of harmony. The restaurant opened in November with Justin Hilbert in charge of the kitchen. Mr. Hilbert worked at Wylie Dufresne’s idea factory, WD-50, after going abroad for a while to peer into the abyss at Mugaritz, the Basque restaurant where diners are routinely antagonized with potatoes inside baked clay, and the like. Back in New York, Mr. Hilbert isn’t antagonizing anybody. He follows Mr. Dufresne’s decentralized approach to cuisine — using modern craftsmanship to build a dish out of separate components that are crunchy, chewy, smooth and so forth — but without Mr. Dufresne’s fondness for tough-love flavors like black licorice and chicory. Mr. Hilbert is after quieter effects, teasing multiple forms and textures out of a few compatible flavors. His smart-wallflower style is best displayed in the Amish chicken with potatoes, beets, rutabagas and hay ash. What the what? All the cool kids are cooking with ashes these days. You didn’t know that? This chicken is soaked in a brine made with ash, then cooked with more ash rubbed into its flesh. The surprise is that it does not taste anything like a chimney. In fact, the chicken has a sweet and salty flavor, like a mild ham, with a dusting of something that tastes a bit like smoked mushrooms. Our table ordered it in a gambling spirit. It turned out to be the dish we all fought over, even more than we did over the long strips of duck breast that looked like flank steak and tasted incredible. Mr. Hilbert’s style of cuisine is not yet common in this pocket of Williamsburg. In fact, cooking this sophisticated would be a find anywhere in New York. And while it is a restaurant in Brooklyn, Gwynnett St. is not really a Brooklyn restaurant. There are no butchers’ tools hanging from reclaimed barn doors. Under the eye of Carl McCoy, the proprietor, the dining room staff is calmly professional, utterly free of pretense and attitude. Nobody is the least bit likely to pull up a chair and offer to show you pictures of the sauerkraut the chef is currently fermenting inside a pair of Red Wing boots. Looking around the attractive but plain-spoken dining room, you get the sense that the pizza oven was left in place largely because tearing it out would have cost too much. The budget seems to have driven many of the other design decisions, down to the single restroom decorated with vintage car-repair manuals and an 1869 map of the neighborhood. (It shows a thoroughfare called Gwinnett Street, later renamed Lorimer Street.) More attention to lighting in the dining room would flatter both the food and the faces, but for the most part Gwynnett St. does quite well by pouring most of its resources into the kitchen. The excellence is on the plate. I can’t think of a similar restaurant, for instance, with a tofu main course that is as thoughtfully and stylishly put together as anything else on the menu. Made from almonds, it has the luxurious texture of a custard rather than the rubbery bounce of bean-curd tofu. Toasted sliced almonds on top let your teeth get in the game, while a green swoosh of puréed lettuce and herbs gives your eyes something to look at. A carnivorous friend thinks this dish wasn’t filling enough to make a main course, but I suspect anybody who embraces tofu won’t have that complaint. In fact, it won’t surprise me if vegans begin marching into restaurants holding up pictures of this tofu and saying, “More like this, please.” When you learn that there is no pastry chef at Gwynnett St., you might start to expect tiramisù and other make-ahead sweets that are to understaffed restaurants what a pint of sorbet is to a last-minute dinner party. You would be so very wrong. Mr. Hilbert’s job at WD-50 was in the pastry kitchen, then under Alex Stupak, and at all times no place for slackers. If anything, the desserts at Gwynnett St. are put together more elaborately than the rest of the meal. Ingredients change shapes. Milk chocolate ganache is made to bend and curl; coconut becomes snow. Even a recent cheese course was a chance for the kitchen to play: a raw sheep’s-milk cheese was sent out with shards of almond and flaxseed brittle and coins of ripe persimmon. None of which is brandished on the menu, of course. Every plate is more complex and more studiously designed than you would ever guess. But Mr. Hilbert’s cooking doesn’t jump up and down in its seat in the front row waving its hand wildly. It sits, patiently, until you notice that it knows all the answers.","Gwynnett St. in Williamsburg, Brooklyn","['onestory', 'exterior', 'facing', 'graham', 'avenue', 'east', 'williamsburg',

294,Pasta Flyer,★,2018-01-23,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/23/dining/pasta-flyer-martina-review.html,Greenwich Village,"Successful fast food restaurants have to be clean, efficient and consistent. As far as I can tell, though, it’s never been necessary for the people who run them to care about food. How would you even tell? It would be like watching a porn film to assess the work of the dialect coach. Mark Ladner was the chef at Del Posto for a decade, steering it to a four-star review from The New York Times in 2010, and at Lupa for five years before that. Leaving all that behind, in October he opened Pasta Flyer, a restaurant in Greenwich Village where pasta in a compostable sugar-cane-fiber bowl costs between $7 and $8.75 and is cooked in less than a minute while you watch. If you tasted the fusilli with pesto, say, or the fettuccine Alfredo, and didn’t know Mr. Ladner’s history, you probably wouldn’t guess that it had been made by one of the city’s greatest pasta cooks. But you’d be able to tell in a second that it was made by somebody who cared about food. The texture is the first thing most cheap pasta places screw up. Pasta Flyer doesn’t screw it up. The noodles are firm and chewy, with a happy little bounce. Partly this is because they’re not overcooked, but Mr. Ladner is also buying excellent dry pasta from Italy. It’s similar to the imported stuff I like to buy when I cook at home, which costs almost as much by the pound as a bowl does at Pasta Flyer. The rigatoni is made with whole grain and the penne is gluten free; they’re both as supple and smooth as the three shapes made from semolina. The sauces — which can be matched with any pasta — are pesto, beef ragù, Alfredo and marinara, with or without meatballs. You might see that and say, “Ah, classics.” Or you might say, “sounds kind of basic?”, with a rising inflection signifying that “basic” is not a compliment. Your response will mirror your attitude toward Pasta Flyer as a whole. I’m in the classic group. The basil pesto looks a little too glossy, more purée than paste, but it has the advantage of insinuating itself all over the pasta (fusilli is the default shape) and it still tastes like aged cheese and toasted pine nuts. The marinara is lively on its own and an agreeable partner for the meatballs, which are of the fine-ground, spicy, sausagelike school. The ragù is lovely, if a little pale and lean. The Alfredo sauce, sweetly dripping from the fettuccine like rain from a leaf, hit me like a prescription opiate that had been specifically engineered for my opiate receptors. It’s been a long time since I’d had fettuccine Alfredo. Those who expect ingenuity from Mr. Ladner should be happy with the garlic dots. Everybody should be happy with the garlic dots, little fried puffs of choux pastry brushed with garlic butter. Like the browned slices of lasagna that you can eat with your fingers, they’re street-fair food from a more advanced civilization. A few small vegetable sides, like a sweet-and-sour fried cauliflower with golden raisins, can be had, along with crisp little chopped salads. That’s about it. Dessert, in the form of tiramisù cannoli, will shuffle onstage later this week. Once your pasta is sauced and you’ve helped yourself to a fork, a napkin and a tray, you settle the tab — paying is the slowest part of the whole procedure — and look for a table. These were plentiful on my three visits, particularly at night. I learned to avoid the seats directly under the satellite dish that hangs from the ceiling and echoes conversations held under it, disconcertingly. It’s an artifact of Mr. Ladner’s fixation on flying saucers, also seen in the door-handle design and in the doctoring of a blown-up photograph of the Roman Forum that covers one wall. In other words, Pasta Flyer is not where you take somebody you need to impress. For some reason, this is how our culture defines success for chefs: by how well their food performs the task of being impressive to a date, an employer or a fan of restaurant dining. Mr. Ladner, though, is using his skill, knowledge and connections not to make special-occasion fireworks but to make ordinary food that many people can afford. Pasta Flyer isn’t spectacular, but it’s still a major achievement. I’ve eaten a lot of supposedly cheap pasta, and it’s never as good as what Mr. Ladner is serving. There’s precedent for devoting specialized attention to the problems of everyday living among architects and industrial designers, who may toggle between showpiece commissions and small, affordable houses. Lately the idea has begun to occur to chefs, including Daniel Patterson and Roy Choi in California, and Mr. Ladner’s old pastry chef, Brooks Headley. Do enough people in Greenwich Village want $8 rigatoni to make Pasta Flyer a success? In a way, the location would work better if it didn’t have to bear the weight of being the only one in town. As a solitary prototype, the restaurant has an odd, expectant air, as if it’s ready for a crowd that hasn’t shown up.  Nick Anderer and Danny Meyer have been pursuing similar goals in the pizza universe. Martina, which opened in the East Village in the fall, is the less expensive younger sibling to Marta, their Roman pizzeria in NoMad. The prices run from $7.50 to $11.50 for a pizza that will serve one not-too-hungry person. Martina is supposed to be fast, too, although that hasn’t always been my experience. One night my pizza arrived 19 minutes after I’d ordered it — hardly a land-speed record. You do save some time ordering and paying at Martina’s counter, but speed isn’t the real selling point. Martina’s charm is that it is a neighborhood place where nothing is a big deal, but where attention has been paid to all the little deals. If the idea of fagioli al fiasco with pizza appeals to you, the ones at Martina are excellent, as are the arancini, cylindrical fritters of creamy rice cooked with tomatoes. The wine list is a thumbnail version of Marta’s, but the few wines are good ones; as at Marta, you’re encouraged to drink sparkling wine in full or half bottles, kept here in an open refrigerator case facing the dining room. The pizza is in the style of Roman neighborhood joints. The crusts are flat, extremely thin, pale and crisp, but not crunchy. They’re softer than the ones at Marta, which snap like crackers. The crust is merely a vehicle; what interest these pies hold is entirely in their toppings. Covered with mushrooms, say, or pork sausage with broccoli rabe, or grated cheese and shaved brussels sprouts, they can be very good. But the simple margherita is a bore. For dessert, there’s vanilla soft-serve, either over espresso or under simple toppings like olive oil, sea salt, candied hazelnuts or chocolate sauce. Simple as it is, it helps make Martina into a restaurant instead of a pit stop. (Mr. Ladner might take notes here.) Neither Martina nor Pasta Flyer is trying to be a thrill ride. But finding a quick, cheap meal that betrays signs of actual care can be a thrill of its own.

295,Carla Hall’s Southern Kitchen,★,2016-10-04,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/05/dining/carla-hall-southern-kitchen-review.html,Columbia Street Waterfront District,"For a long time, very few people thought there was money to be made selling hot chicken. This is almost certainly because for a long time, very few people outside certain neighborhoods in Nashville knew what hot chicken was. The ones who did know usually lived somewhere near Prince’s Hot Chicken Shack, which was known as Prince’s BBQ Chicken Shack until it was taken over by a member of the family who thought it was time to acknowledge that what the Princes did to chicken had nothing to do with barbecue. Prince’s is and always was a fried-chicken restaurant. The chicken was never cooked in advance. It spattered away in a skillet while the customer who had ordered it waited, and waited. But the thing that made Prince’s famous, to the extent that it was famous, was what happened to the chicken after it came out of the skillet. Still dripping with oil, the legs, thighs and breasts were given a glossy finish with spicy oil. Prince’s kitchen is a restricted area. The family guards the recipe for that oil fiercely. But the seasonings are said to include brown sugar, dried garlic, paprika and, crucially, cayenne. Depending on how much oil is applied, the cayenne can make a hot-chicken eater cry. When Anthony Bourdain was asked about the scariest situations he’d been in while filming his television shows, he named Congo, Libya and Beirut, followed by hot chicken in Nashville. Pain was the point all along. According to the family legend, which fortunately for everybody took shape long before fact-checking became a household phrase in America, Thornton Prince’s girlfriend cooked the first hot chicken for breakfast one morning during the Depression to get back at him for his nocturnal wanderings. Forgetting that revenge is best served cold, she loaded the chicken with spice, only to find that her unfaithful man loved hot chicken, shared hot chicken with his friends and made hot chicken into a business that has lasted more than 70 years. Although Prince’s had local competition from a hot chicken place started by a former cook, it was only in this decade that entrepreneurs began to think that cooking chicken that makes customers cry might be a good way to earn money. In the Nashville area there is Slow Burn, Pepperfire and Hattie B’s, among others. KFC began selling its version of Nashville hot chicken throughout the United States in January. Independent operators have set up across the country from Los Angeles to Cambridge, Mass., to Brooklyn, where Carla Hall opened a tiny Nashville chicken spot in June. Carla Hall’s Southern Kitchen doesn’t lack for branding. Slogans and catchphrases are written all over the menu and the walls, inside and outside on the corner of Kane and Columbia Streets. The place is so clearly positioned to spawn multiple locations that it almost seems pregnant. When you have decided whether you want thighs, drumsticks, breasts, tenders or some combination of these, one of the smiling people working at the counter will ask: “Do you want Southern, Hoot & Honey, Hoot, Hootie Hoot, Hoot-N-Nannie, or Boomshakalaka?” It’s like having a conversation with an owl. Even when you know that Ms. Hall, a host on “The Chew,” has been identified with the phrase “hootie hoo” since her days as a “Top Chef” contestant, this is not an easy question to answer the first time you hear it, or the second or third time, either. Most customers fall back on a number system, one to six. Level one, Southern, gets no hot oil and is easy enough to eat. Like all the chicken, it sits on white bread and has pickle slices pinned on it with toothpicks. Level two is slicked all over with just enough oil to give it a rounder flavor that is sweet, savory and spicy but not cruel. Heat tolerance is of course a personal thing, but at level three I became slightly more aware of my skin; at level four, I became conscious of the passing of time; at level five, I began tearing off chunks of white bread and stuffing them into my mouth. Level six gave me second thoughts, but not serious pain. (If you want to go to the dark side, the chicken for you is the extra hot at Peaches HotHouse in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, although the chile payload is delivered by a spice powder sprinkled over the top; parts of the crust that aren’t powdered just taste like regular fried chicken.) The meat at Carla Hall’s Southern Kitchen tastes natural, which is to say it hasn’t been twisted beyond recognition by aggressive brining of the kind practiced at Root & Bone and other places around town. Ms. Hall seems to have focused her efforts on the crust, and it is excellent, a darkish shell both formidably crunchy and a little chewy. Spice or no spice, this is not a style of fried chicken you often find in New York. The hottest and crunchiest chicken I ate was the one I waited longest for. The least exciting, though it was still well worth eating, was a piece of white meat that came out before I’d moved from a counter to one of the few chairs. This is a small restaurant, not built for lounging, and Ms. Hall may not want hungry crowds hanging out while the chicken sizzles away. But her recipe is good enough to make you wish every piece were cooked to order. The sides and desserts will not draw anybody to Columbia Street, but a few of them are very good. I tend to sigh when I hear that collards were cooked without meat, but Ms. Hall’s are lively and tangy; better, actually, than many pots of collards around town. No reforms have been inflicted on the candied yams, and that is good news. The pimento cheese, punched up with flecks of hot green pepper and served with a waxed-paper bag of Ritz crackers, was exactly what I hoped it would be. I felt the same way about the biscuits, which had a tenderness that tends to elude Northern cooks. The potato salad, on the other hand, needed perking up, and the macaroni and cheese was the opposite of creamy, a hard, bland lattice of noodles. The bread pudding was dried out, too, and something seemed to have gone wrong with the whoopie pies. They were dense and lumpy, as if a distracted baker had left out an ingredient. I can’t imagine why Ms. Hall is bothering with whoopie pies when her banana pudding is (a) charming, with caramelized bananas and a swirl of what looks like whipped cream but turns out to be a version of Marshmallow Fluff; and (b) the only dessert anybody needs after pimento cheese and fried chicken.","Carla Hall’s Southern Kitchen Likes It Hot, but Not Hellish","['long', 'people', 'thought',

296,Lupulo,★★,2015-07-21,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/22/dining/restaurant-review-lupulo-in-chelsea.html,Chelsea,"If George Mendes did not have such a strong grip on the flavors and aromas of Portugal, Lupulo might have slipped away from him. It can be a confusing restaurant at first, its messages mixed, its fairly simple concept fuzzed over with complications. But give the place a chance, and you can find clarity in the smells of garlic and wood smoke that fill the dining room; in the way sweet paprika and cilantro sidle up to each other in olive oil; and in the fresh, firm seafood, the grilled sardines and carabineros, red as a lobster, their heads dripping with juices that are as rich and intense as any sauce. The restaurant may be unfocused, but the cooking isn’t. Mr. Mendes’s basic idea for Lupulo, which opened a few blocks south of Herald Square in April, was straightforward enough. The name means “hops,” and the place is his take on the beer-centered Portuguese taverns called cervejarias. The nearest American equivalent is probably a brewpub, which Lupulo resembles with its hard, low wooden chairs, its high ceilings and its U-shaped dining bar stretching off into the distance. The menu gets right into the beery spirit with food that’s left a little rough around the edges. The skin on chicken piri piri is black from the grill, but the meat is juicy right down to the bone. It shows up at the table with skinny French fries and a squeeze bottle of piri piri, the hot sauce that suggests Portuguese people have an advanced understanding of pain’s pleasures. Manila clams steamed open in vinho verde with cilantro and chopped spring garlic are simple and wonderful, especially when you soak some grilled bread in the pan sauce. Purists may be let down to find that Lupulo’s caracois are meaty Burgundian snails lying naked on a plate, not the smaller variety that people suck from their shells one by one on any summer afternoon in Lisbon. But wait until the purists get a taste of the rustic olive oil sauce, spiced with smoked paprika and chopped garlic that is warmed but not tamed. The Portuguese are masters of what Italians call cucina povera, the discipline of squeezing enjoyment out of inexpensive ingredients. Maybe you have wondered why anyone would choose to eat bread porridge? Try Lupulo’s version of açorda — mushy and crunchy at the same time, topped with a few carabineros and saturated with a shrimp-head stock that makes the room reel — and wonder no more. Mr. Mendes works the same humble sorcery on sweet spring peas cooked with choriço. The liquid yolk of a sunny-side-up egg waits to be poked and swirled around until it joins up with the fresh herbs laced into the peas. It has a close cousin, just as satisfying, in the bowl of bright-green favas with crunchy knobs of blood sausage and morels. At other times, the kitchen veers off message, with artsy swooshes and swirls that seem as if they’d be more at home serenely perched on the tablecloths at Mr. Mendes’s other, more formal restaurant, Aldea. You can spot these exiles from Chefville on the menu at a glance: the raw sockeye and darkly glittering caviar in buttermilk froth under radish wheels sliced thin enough to blow away, the grilled asparagus with dried and fresh sea urchin. From a branding standpoint, Mr. Mendes should probably ship these dishes off to Aldea. But I hope he doesn’t, because his forays into fussiness are at least as flavorful as the more broad-shouldered plates. And some, like the raw snapper with the stormy heat of fermented serrano peppers calmed by waves of coconut broth scented with makrut lime, are at least arguably Portuguese in a post-colonial sense, if you care to play those games in the face of inarguable deliciousness. Of course there is Portuguese wine, a short and solid list, but there is more energy and excitement in the beer menu. This document can be disorienting, though, at least on a first visit. Why open a cervejaria and turn over all the taps but two (recently there was one for a Spanish cider, another for the dry, likable Sagres lager from Portugal) to American craft breweries? Mr. Mendes has said in interviews that he features the United States simply because it makes more of the carefully, intelligently made beers he enjoys than Portugal, where small-scale brewing is a newer phenomenon. He gave Ryan Mauban, most recently seen fussing over the bottles and kegs at Torst in Brooklyn, the job of tracking down innovative brews from around the country. His list is short but packs in a lot of stylistic diversity: goses (see Eric Asimov’s Pour column this week) more tart than lemonade, Belgian-style ales with a barely-there hint of Thai basil. With dessert, Mr. Mauban may suggest a South Carolina stout brewed with cocoa, cinnamon and a flicker of habanero. It tastes like chocolate soda that grew up into an alluring stranger with a dark secret. In fact, it had more going for it than some of Alexander Zecena’s sweets, like the sleepy vanilla rice pudding, now off the menu, and the pasteis de nata, bite-size tarts of egg custard that were somehow both floury and not quite firm. But there is no point trying to resist the pudim Molotov, like the child of a flan and a marshmallow, or the eggy sponge cake next to a slice of soft, mildly sour sheep’s milk cheese. The menu, to give this dead horse one last whack, is kind of confusing. It is divided into Small Plates, Fish, Meat and Garden. Simple enough, until you’re told that all but the last four Fish entries are also small plates. That quirk is easier to get used to than the roar of Lupulo’s dining room at full tilt. The wall of traditional blue-and-white Portuguese ceramic tiles is pretty, but combined with the two walls of soaring window panels and all the bare wood, it guarantees that by 8 p.m. everybody will end up talking about how hard it is to talk. Full-tilt dining rooms may not be a problem for long if Lupulo doesn’t get an acoustic adjustment soon. It would be a shame if noise drove the crowds away, because Lupulo gets almost everything else right. On that point, there shouldn’t be any confusion.",Lupulo in Chelsea,"['george', 'mendes', 'strong', 'grip', 'flavor', 'aroma', 'portugal', 'lupulo', 'slipped', 'away', 'confusing', 'message', 'mixed',

297,Pok Pok Ny,★★,2012-06-26,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/27/dining/reviews/pok-pok-ny-brooklyn-restaurant-review.html,Columbia Street Waterfront District,"AT first I didn’t notice the green chile paste at the center of the plate. I was in the backyard of a new Thai restaurant in Brooklyn called Pok Pok Ny (rhymes with “rock rock fly”), enjoying a deep communion with a grilled sausage that seemed to be everything anyone could want on a summer night. The sausage was rough-hewed and reddish, with little studs of melting pork fat and traces of galangal and white pepper that were flowery and spicy at the same time. Though this sausage, a favorite in the Thai city of Chiang Mai, needed nothing more than a cold beer, I began dunking it into that chile paste. And then I’d dunk the Frito-size curls of fried pork rinds, and wedges of steamed kabocha squash, and long beans tied into knots. The paste, called naam phrik nuum, was hot but not chokingly so, and had some of the grassy sweetness of a grilled green bell pepper, and one quality that green bell peppers don’t have: I couldn’t get enough of it. As I kept dunking, my perspective underwent a Copernican shift. The sausage had seemed to be the center of the universe, but it turned out that it, and everything else on the plate, revolved around that mesmerizing naam phrik nuum. Altered perceptions come free with the price of dinner at Pok Pok Ny, which was opened by the chef Andy Ricker. Mr. Ricker owns an acclaimed cluster of casual Thai eating and drinking places in Portland, Ore., and a takeout joint for papaya salad and Vietnamese chicken wings on the Lower East Side, Pok Pok Wing. Now he has set up his first sit-down restaurant in the city. New York is already lucky to have Ayada in Elmhurst, Queens, where the chef Duangjai Thammasat brings delicacy and beauty to fiery dishes, and Sripraphai in Woodside, Queens, which Sripraphai Tipmanee, the owner, has made into a beacon for Thais and non-Thais alike. Ms. Thammasat is from Thailand’s central heartland; Ms. Tipmanee is from the south. Zabb Elee, in Jackson Heights, Queens, and in the East Village, offers the electrifying flavors of Isan, the country’s northeast. I’ve heard some New Yorkers insist that they will stick to these established restaurants. If convenience is their priority, they have a point. Sripraphai is about 15 minutes from Pennsylvania Station, and Ayada is about 25; Pok Pok Ny is a 40-minute journey, including a hike from the subway to a stretch of Brooklyn waterfront amputated from Cobble Hill by the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway. You’ll need to factor in more time if you fail to arrive shortly after Pok Pok Ny opens at 5:30 p.m. The restaurant doesn’t take reservations. Later arrivals are exiled to a bench or wooden chair beneath swirling ceiling fans in a backyard tent. There they sit until a table is free in the tent, in an open-air patio or indoors. This cheerfully ramshackle village seems to have been banged together overnight by somebody who didn’t expect to be there six months from now (and who never ran the numbers on having three dining areas served by a coffin-size bathroom). So yes, by all means go to Ayada and Sripraphai. Everybody should. But don’t tell yourself that you’ll be getting the same stuff, because it isn’t true. The first way Pok Pok Ny shifts your perspective is by offering the food of northern Thailand, which has been largely missing from New York. With a wealth of ingredients and an abundance of pork and firewood, the region developed a cuisine that is less incendiary than other Thai cooking, contains almost no coconut milk and makes great use of the grill. To that end, behind the backyard tent is a remarkable outdoor kitchen with a black-barrel smoker, a vertical charcoal rotisserie, a clay-lined pot and a standard grill or two. That kitchen brings the warm breath of charcoal smoke to the kai yaang, grilled hens that can start the meal with a burst of lemon grass; to little half-moons of soy-glazed pork neck that come with ice-cold raw mustard greens, for crunching between bites of pork; and to long eggplants roasted until they are as soft as pudding and nearly as sweet. You even taste it in a salad of grilled and minced catfish dressed with mint leaves, dried chiles and lime juice. The salad, called laap, comes with stalks of herbs grown in Florida from imported seeds. There are the glossy and sour blades of bai makhok, the Thai olive; spade-shaped leaves of khao tong, with a flavor that earns it the English name fishwort; and deceptively pretty spears of bai sadao. Eaten on its own, sadao is so ferociously bitter that you think about calling a lawyer. Folded into a spoonful of laap, it is no more threatening than basil. Here comes another shift: you could prowl the city for years without finding some of the ingredients in Mr. Ricker’s kitchen. I’d read about black crabs, pests that can fell a rice paddy unless they are scooped up and preserved in salt, but had never encountered one in a green papaya salad before Pok Pok Ny. Pitched into the salad, shells and all, the tiny crabs are hard enough to crack molars, but they are part of Mr. Ricker’s mission of reproducing northern Thai cooking in Oregon or Brooklyn with as much fidelity as he can muster. He is nothing if not obsessed, liable to begin sentences with, “It’s a long story.” If his enthusiasm is contagious, though, not everyone on his Brooklyn staff has caught it. One night we asked our server whether the powerfully refreshing sweet-sour sodas called drinking vinegars were popular in Thailand. “I’m not really sure,” was the answer, and that was that. There are other ways in which Pok Pok Ny hasn’t synchronized its watches yet. An order went missing for ages, then showed up in duplicate. And one night I ran into two or three dishes whose flavors seemed to be napping, including a fried egg salad and even a papaya salad. I left downcast, humming Peggy Lee: Is that all there is? No, it’s not. In my next visits I was thrilled to taste more remarkable dishes than the table could hold: prawns in smoky noodles simmered with soy and ginger in a clay pot; an eggy pancake of juicy, sweet mussels with garlic chives; a stunningly complex pork laap. Compared with other pork laaps I’ve had, this one seemed to have eight or nine extra dimensions. The memory of it will be enough to keep me docile next time I wait for a table.",Pok Pok Ny in Brooklyn,"['didn’t', 'notice', 'green', 'chile', 'paste', 'center', 'plate', 'backyard', 'thai',

298,Wassail,★,2015-12-22,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/dining/wassail-review.html,Lower East Side,"You can tell when restaurateurs’ choices are based on cold market calculus and when they’re driven by passion. If the passions are good ones, they can become contagious. Wassail is a Lower East Side restaurant that is deeply devoted to hard cider. After circling back again and again since it opened early this spring, I’ve fallen under cider’s spell, and Wassail’s, too. Sometimes I take over a table in the tavernlike back rooms to spend a couple of hours with food in which vegetables get to show off, and there’s always more going on than meets the eye. Sometimes I drop anchor at the long, busy bar and eat fried jalapeño-Gouda balls as if they were popcorn. Always, I drink cider. Hanging out at Wassail is like going to a planet populated by nitrogen-based life-forms; everything is at once recognizable and thoroughly different. The staff plays up the recognizable aspects. Conversations about cider at Wassail often begin with “What kinds of wines do you like?” then a suggestion for a cider with the clean rasp of a sauvignon blanc or the cow-patty funk of rustic natural wines. I could taste a different cider at Wassail every night starting now and not repeat myself until the end of March. This sounds like a wise use of the next three months when I think of how many discoveries I’ve already made: Among many others, I’ve had Hudson Valley ciders that were as round and fleshy as a Degas bather; Spanish ciders as taut and linear as a Giacometti; a spooky, briny cider introduced to seaweed; and a smoky, brooding cider aged in charred whiskey barrels. The roots of Wassail’s idiosyncratic obsessions go back to when one of the owners, Ben Sandler, went on a class trip to a zoo at age 14. He was on acid at the time, which did not prove to be a sound decision. When his mind stopped rippling, he swore off meat and illegal drugs for good. This helps explain why the menu at Wassail, which he opened early this spring with his wife, Jennifer Lim, is fully devoted to vegetables. (Ms. Lim converted after marriage and is now fully devoted to vegetables herself.) How they settled on fermented apple juice as the house intoxicant is a story that starts at the Queens Kickshaw, the couple’s first restaurant. Their original idea, back in 2011, was to sell excellent coffee and grilled cheese sandwiches to their neighbors in Astoria. Cider wasn’t even a gleam in their eyes. Apart from sugary, mass-produced stuff, neither had ever tried it. That year, though, they went to a tasting of French and American ciders. They had the kind of reaction that Mr. Sandler was probably hoping to get from LSD. “It was eye-opening, it was mind-blowing,” Ms. Lim said. “We were clued into something that was incredible and underrated and new and old at the same time.” Cider began to take over the Queens Kickshaw, but things really got going when the couple found a space for Wassail on Orchard Street. (It must have seemed like a sign that the street is named after the fruit-tree grove of an early New York family, the De Lanceys.) Wassail has a dozen ciders on tap and about 100 more in bottles. A number of those bottles are poured by the glass, thanks to trial-and-error adjustments to a carbon dioxide pump designed to keep the fizz inside uncorked Champagne. Apples, pressed and turned into brandy, pommeau and of course cider, are the foundation of most of the cocktails, including a potent and energizing wassail punch of mixed spirits and beet juice. Apples roll through Joseph Buenconsejo’s savory courses and Rebecca Eichenbaum’s desserts as well. Luckily, this is not always obvious. Little about their cooking is. What I noticed about a parsnip-apple soup wasn’t the thematic tie-in but the way caramelized onions and pecans broadened the sweet, creamy flavor of the soup. Grilled butternut squash was buried under smithereens of nuts and seeds, a kind of exploded granola that added a wonderfully sweet and crunchy dimension to the soft squash. I almost always order creamy little potatoes, their red and white skins blistered and blackened over charcoal. Mr. Buenconsejo sends them off in an Eastern European direction with a dill sauce and a lather of tangy goat butter, a treatment that’s both delicate and direct. To a salad of cucumber spears and pearls of dripping-ripe melon, Mr. Buenconsejo adds so many elements — macadamia milk, chopped macadamias, sorrel leaves, borage oil — that it almost spins out of control, but it doesn’t. One dish that got away from him paired hakurei turnips with wild rice in a dashi that was off-puttingly fishy, despite containing no actual fish. He and Ms. Eichenbaum think and cook alike; her desserts flow seamlessly out of his savory courses. She makes a pool of chocolate, softly melting like a candy bar you kept in your pocket, but then reminds you that this is a vegetable restaurant with screaming-pink buttons of beet-buttermilk sherbet and a spill of toasted amaranth grains that pop between your teeth. She can even find the sweetness in celery, churning it into a delicate granita that she scatters around a parsley-root mousse. With all due respect for her interest in the produce bin, though, my favorite Eichenbaum creation was a floral, romantic, early summer assemblage of strawberries, strawberry ice cream and a deeply enchanting rose-petal cream. The menu is supposed to progress from small plates to larger ones, but in practice there isn’t much difference. Mr. Buenconsejo’s compositions tend to stimulate your palate more than they satisfy your appetite. Hunks of lobster mushrooms given a luxurious bath in butter were served over a cauliflower-mushroom purée and a twirl of gingered noodles with a side of foamy curry sauce; I immediately wanted more. This is both a compliment and a minor complaint. The dish is listed as “ginger pasta,” but it isn’t filling the way you expect pasta to be. It’s even harder to feel as if you’ve had a whole meal on nights when the kitchen has trouble getting the food to the tables. One time the wait between courses grew so long that my companions and I were on the verge of playing a game of charades to pass the time. On other nights, service at the tables could be glancing and distracted. I tended to be happiest when I treated Wassail as a bar where the food is surprisingly interesting but cider, doing things I never expected it to do, carries the night. As a destination for exploring the nuances of the apple, Wassail is so exceptional that I don’t mind working around its occasional shortcomings as a restaurant.","At Wassail on the Lower East Side, in

299,Wong,★★,2012-01-03,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/04/dining/wong-greenwich-village-restaurants.html,West Village,"IF you want to have some fun, bring friends to Simpson Wong’s new restaurant on Cornelia Street and watch them taste the duck-fat ice cream in a dessert called duck a la plum. First they stop talking. Then they stop moving. Their eyes shut, and just when you’re wondering how long this will last, they pop open again, bright with the pleasure of discovery. It’s been a long time since Asian fusion cooking has promised thrills of this sort. When it makes eyes roll these days, nobody smiles. Witness the lengths that some Manhattan restaurants operating in the Asian fusion or pan-Asian idiom go to avoid those terms. RedFarm has “Chinese cuisine with Greenmarket sensibility,” says the Web site. Kin Shop’s menu is “modern Thai,” and Rouge et Blanc’s is “French-Vietnamese.” At Wong, meanwhile, the euphemism of choice is “Asian locavore.” Maybe the owners of these places should meet to agree on a name that doesn’t evoke 900-seat nightclubs with giant Buddhas, because taken together with the shock troops at Momofuku and a few other places, they offer hope for New Yorkers who hunger for adventure, for something new. Duck tongues, anyone? Say yes, please, because I think you’ll like the way Mr. Wong prepares them, braising them to tenderness, then rolling them into small meatballs with a crunchy fried crust. If Mr. Wong sold them to go, I’d buy them by the bag and eat them like popcorn. The menu bills these tongue meatballs as the supporting players to seared scallops, but really, the two are equal partners on a surf and turf platter that’s as wonderful as it is uncommon. You are a fan of sea cucumbers, too, I hope? You’ll find slippery, crunchy bits of them in Wong’s slightly demented Bolognese. Made with pork and shiitakes, too, and served with fat springy rice noodles, it’s the kind of dish that tastes simply odd at first, but keeps luring you back for another bite. The flavors build as you eat until there’s nothing left. Like the scallops, the rice noodles appear on the menu beside the restaurant’s logo, a sign that it’s a specialty of the house. In general, dishes bearing that mark are roughly twice as delicious as the others, most of which aren’t half bad to begin with. You will eat well enough if you order the wreckfish or the pork plate, but your enjoyment of your dinner may be undone by your envy of everybody else’s. (Though I’d steer well clear of the mystifying crab pizza and the duck meatball, neither of which improves on the Italian original.) Let’s hope that Mr. Wong intends to put his logo next to the entire menu some day. Imagine what this restaurant could be if everything were as compelling as the lobster egg foo young. In any kitchen not owned by Mr. Wong, that dish is a Chinese omelet, usually in brown gravy. Some people like it. Here it’s half a lobster tail and a claw, poached to an angry red and cradled in a cast-iron skillet with a tomato-chili sauce, a dusting of dried shrimp, two fried chicken eggs with liquid yolks and shaved hard yolks from salt-cured duck eggs. The dish comes with a slice of toast. I used it to clean my skillet. The best dishes at Wong have a where-did-that-come-from quality. For some New Yorkers, so will the restaurant. Simpson Wong, the chef and proprietor, has kept a low profile of late, although a previous restaurant of his, Jefferson, was once an address known by car service drivers and executive assistants, especially around 2004, when its sleek minimalist dining room popped up on “Sex and the City.” The next year, Mr. Wong had a heart attack and closed the restaurant. He tried to restart it as Jefferson Grill, with smaller plates and a lower cholesterol count, but its best days were in the past. It was shut in 2006. Mr. Wong retrenched to his first restaurant, Cafe Asean (after 15 years, it is still on West 10th Street, still cheap, still pan-Asian and still over-performing). And he traveled. He flew home to Malaysia, where he was born, and rounded up his mother (who is nearly 80 and gets around in a wheelchair). Together, they went on a series of eating tours across Asia. In Hong Kong, they ate spicy crabs that became a model for the typhoon lobster at Wong. They bought shrimp fritters on the street in Ho Chi Minh City; in Hanoi, they went to Cha Ca La Vong to taste the house specialty, turmeric-scented fish fried with dill stalks, tossed over rice vermicelli and doused with nuoc cham. On Cornelia Street, the dish is renamed cha ca la Wong. The cooking at Jefferson, which was awarded two stars by William Grimes in 2003, often began with Western ideas to which Asian ingredients were introduced. At Wong, he has kept his freewheeling palate and his nuanced instincts for building contrasts, but the starting point tends to be Asia, which means that his cooking at Wong, at its strongest, resembles nothing else in town. That is the reason to go to Wong. The dining room is half Williamsburg, half Salvation Army, with wood salvaged from demolition sites and molded-plywood schoolhouse chairs, the kind with a wire basket under the seat for geometry textbooks. The interior probably won’t be seen in the pages of Architectural Record, as Jefferson’s was. But then Jefferson cost three to four times as much, Mr. Wong said in a telephone interview. These are more sober times, and among chefs more high-minded times as well. Mr. Wong is earnest about his locavore convictions, to the point that he won’t sell bottled water. Those beliefs also helped inspire an all-American and largely sustainable wine list that, unfortunately, simply can’t keep up with the kitchen. Without compromising his principles, Mr. Wong should be able to do better than the dozen lackluster choices. The list doesn’t have to be longer, just stronger. For proof, see the dessert menu put together by Wong’s pastry chef, Judy Chen. There are three choices. Two are first-rate and the third has that ice cream that makes time stop. At 48, Mr. Wong has closed a popular and acclaimed restaurant. He knows what a heart attack feels like. For future reference, if those things happen to you, there are worse ways to react than to invent duck tongue meatballs. Wong ★★ 7 Cornelia Street (West Fourth Street); (212) 989-3399; wongnewyork.com. ATMOSPHERE The dining room, with 32 chairs and 16 stools, could be the subject of a magazine spread about dealing with a small space on a tight budget: long mirrors, big windows, salvaged furniture, a well-organized open kitchen. SERVICE The staff is ready to explain curry leaves or any other unfamiliar ingredients. SOUND LEVEL Under control. RECOMMENDED DISHES All vegetable side dishes; shrimp fritters; lobster egg foo young; grilled chicken; rice noodles with Bolognese; cha ca la Wong; duck a la plum. PRICE RANGE Appetizers, $9 to $15; larger plates, $17 to $26; desserts, $8 to $10. HOURS Monday to Thursday, 5:30 to 11 p.m.; Friday and Saturday, 5:30 to 11:30 p.m. Closed Sunday. WINE AND DRINKS The wine list is small, all-American, largely sustainable, inexpensive and uninspiring. Better choices are found among the beers. RESERVATIONS Accepted. WHAT THE STARS MEAN Ratings range from zero to four stars and reflect the reviewer’s reaction primarily to food, with ambience, service and price taken into consideration.  ","Wong, Greenwich Village

300,White Gold Butchers,★★,2017-02-07,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/07/dining/white-gold-butchers-review-april-bloomfield-restaurant.html,Upper West Side,"I’ve finally found a new restaurant on the Upper West Side that I want to recommend to people who don’t live there. It has only taken me five years. In my time as critic, I’ve searched the streets between Lincoln Center and Columbia University for good places to eat. I’ve come across some, but I could never convince myself that any of them were worth a special trip. That finally changed after October, when Ken Friedman and April Bloomfield opened White Gold Butchers, a restaurant inside a butcher shop on Amsterdam Avenue. Here’s something strange: In all this time, I’ve never heard from Upper West Side readers either attacking me for ignoring their neighborhood or tipping me off to a gem I’d overlooked. Have they just given up hope after watching the local restaurants they could honestly tell friends were worth traveling for — Picholine, Telepan, Ouest — close one by one? Another odd thing: White Gold is the first Bloomfield-Friedman restaurant where I have never had to wait to be seated. True, one night I showed up ridiculously early, and by the time I left, a small crowd by the door was eyeing my table. But people in the neighborhood tell me it is possible more often than not to walk right in and sit down. This is not typically the case at the Spotted Pig, the Breslin Bar & Dining Room, Salvation Burger or other restaurants run by Ms. Bloomfield and Mr. Friedman. Where is everybody? People, April Bloomfield is cooking meat, one of the things she does best. Two young butchers, Jocelyn Guest and Erika Nakamura, are partners in the restaurant; in their blue aprons and white shirts, they oversee the carving and trimming and sawing and chopping. Looking at the colors in the glass butcher’s case, the plum purple of the raw pork and the marigold yellow of the chicken skin, you know that this meat will cook up so nicely that it can be eaten and enjoyed all by itself. White Gold doesn’t go quite that far, but it comes close. The menu gets right to the point, no small talk: The main courses fall under the heading Plates. There are usually four of them, cooked very simply. A gorgeously juicy and pink length of grilled pork, for example, was flecked with sage salt, and its only garnish was a spoonful of sauce made from apples — not applesauce but a saltier and more complex reduction. Beef heart was served like steak, sliced into small, tender, nearly rare slabs. The spice-and-nut blend dukkah was the seasoning. Probably meant more for the roasted carrots on the same plate, the dukkah was also at home with the heart. A special one night was a portion of pork shoulder cooked in milk at a quiet murmur until the meat had relaxed and the liquid had boiled away and the fat had pulled together in sweet curds the color of peanut butter. It sounds and looks creepy, but it’s wonderful. As good as it felt to lose myself in tender pork and caramelized milk, the high point of that dinner was beef carpaccio. White Gold now makes my favorite version of this classic Italian dish in New York. The toppings are sliced white mushrooms, parsley leaves and pickled broccoli stems. I’d never given much thought to pickled broccoli stems before, but now I think their highest use is with darkly lush sheets of raw beef furred over with fine white horseradish gratings. The raviolo in brodo is Italian, too, up to a point. The broth is beef, deeply brown and sticky on the lips. For the single raviolo, two circles of barely cooked kabocha squash do the work normally done by pasta, sandwiching a creamy core of taleggio that will end up running out and slipping into the broth, no matter how careful you are, flavoring the soup along with red drops of pumpkinseed oil. If none of this has persuaded you to take a train or crosstown bus to the Upper West Side, then it’s time to let the “crispy layered potato” out of its cage. These are little golden boxes made of thin rectangles of potato stacked like Post-it notes, then fried in beef fat. I’m not sure how they stay together. They are crunchy and delicate and impossible to stop eating. White Gold has found a way to multiply the surface area of a fairly small piece of potato so that more potato comes into contact with hot oil. This is a significant advance in the field of applied potato physics. Like Fleishers Craft Butchery, Dickson’s Farmstand Meats and a few other butcher shops, White Gold buys whole animals. In theory, the cooks should be able to get creative with the odds and ends, yet offal isn’t a major feature of the menu. I have to admit that the White Gold of my dreams would serve not just chicken liver mousse but gizzard confit; not just grilled lamb leg but sautéed kidneys; not just pork shoulder but stuffed trotters. In the morning, White Gold is devoted to egg sandwiches. At lunch, you can order a version of the chopped cheese, a late-night specialty of bodegas in Harlem and the Bronx. As the sandwich has started showing up in other neighborhoods, at higher prices, it has become a symbol of cultural appropriation and gentrification. White Gold sells it for $11, roughly twice what it would cost on its home turf. It is also a somewhat odd interpretation, not so much the classic cheese-slicked heap of ground beef as a cheeseburger hacked into chunks. Britain does better than the Bronx on White Gold’s lunch menu. Head straight to the savory-pastry case and get a sausage roll, a stub of golden crust wrapped around pink, coarse breakfast sausages, or a pasty, a hand pie that can be held by its rolled seam, which looks like a fat lip. One pasty is filled with potatoes and fontina; another with beef stew. Both are so good I’d recommend buying an extra to tote around in an empty pocket. One reason White Gold isn’t mobbed at night may be that, for the first time, Mr. Friedman and Ms. Bloomfield have built a restaurant without a bar. Wine and beer are available, from Narragansett in a can to (when I was there) a six-year-old bottle of petit verdot from Clendenen Family Vineyards, but there’s nowhere to drink them unless you’re eating. The space doesn’t encourage hanging out with a glass. This may have to do with the bright lighting — butchers need to be able to see to do their work — or the relative starkness of the atmosphere. The wallpaper in the restroom has more energy than the rest of the interior design put together. White Gold reminds me of small, obscure, excellent restaurants I’ve tripped into during vacations, the tapas bar or the trattoria that happened to be close to where I was staying and that I remember better than the places other people had recommended before I left home. White Gold may never be a destination, but in its modest and simple way, it’s memorable.",White Gold Butchers Slices to the Point: Meats Cooked Simply,"['i’ve', 'finally', 'found', 'upper', 'west',

301,La Promenade Des Anglais,★★,2012-01-10,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/11/dining/reviews/la-promenade-des-anglais-nyc-restaurant-review.html,Chelsea,"WHEN the money that had kept New York aloft went away a few years back, some chefs switched into damage control immediately. They clipped prices. They made their menus and dining rooms more easygoing. They put future projects on hold. Alain Allegretti was not among them. Well into the first year of the recession, he marched forward as planned with a fairly expensive and rather formal restaurant in Chelsea. Allegretti, he called it. There were starchy expanses of white fabric on the tables and service that was somewhat starchy as well. Main courses began around $30 and sailed on from there. This was in the summer of 2008. The end of that story was as predictable as it was unfortunate, because Mr. Allegretti is one of the city’s most adept practitioners of modern French cuisine. But like many people who were knocked back a step or two by the less frenetic economy, Mr. Allegretti studied the city’s new mood, and studied it well. La Promenade des Anglais, a flashy bistro by way of Nice that he opened in Chelsea in September, is almost a point-by-point rebuttal of Allegretti. The tabletops are glossy black, set with dark place mats. The prices top out at $30. The staff is all smiles. And so was I, the minute I ate a small prosciutto and clam croquette. It looked demure enough, primly nestled in a folded linen napkin like a Parker House roll. It was anything but demure. At the first bite, the golden shell gave way to a riotously creamy, molten core that was something like a clam brandade. Sit at the bar with an order of these and a $10 glass of Gerard Bertrand’s Languedoc rosé, and you’re on your way to a grand night. But Mr. Allegretti didn’t labor in Alain Ducasse’s kitchens for four years just to make clam fritters. Even in these times, he can construct harmonious and sophisticated plates on which each ingredient has been treated in a way calculated to coax forth the most flavor. For a convincing demonstration of the power of this approach, consider a main course of striped bass. A gentle green broth of leeks is edged toward luxuriousness with nibs of black truffle, while a bed of braised leeks and a tangle of fried leeks allow other sides of that vegetable to shine. Fingerling potatoes look ordinary enough, but one bite tells you there’s something more going on, something that is explained by a slow braise in chicken stock. And the bass itself falls into radiant white slabs at the merest approach of a fork. In a shrimp tartare appetizer, Mr. Allegretti amplifies the natural sweetness of raw red shrimp with a lightly perfumed swirl of lemon-grass oil and a judiciously dressed celery-root rémoulade. (The tartare is served on freshly fried sliced potatoes, too elegant to be called chips.) He sets tender strips of canned Sicilian tuna belly on handmade quills of trofie pasta in a sweet tomato sauce that brought back the hot sunshine of late summer. Sometimes Mr. Allegretti’s cooking tilts toward the south of France and Liguria, as with those delicious caper- and olive-accented trofie, and sometimes it doesn’t. In either case it is so alluring that I began to think of La Promenade des Anglais as a charming and undiscovered seaside resort that I’d stumbled across. That it sits on the ground floor of the London Terrace apartments did little to splash cold water on this fantasy. At first I was dazzled by everything, from the long white awning that starts right at the curb to the stylized beach umbrellas and palm trees in black and white on the ceiling to the huge brass floor lamps and even the paint on the walls — Côte d’Azur blue. My companions and I were delighted with simple dishes like whipped ricotta with a stack of toast that tasted as if it had been grilled on the beach. We were just as happy with the lamb osso buco, with a marrow spoon jutting out from inside a length of shank bone. As you do when you’re falling for someplace new, I couldn’t wait to return. With a closer look came the inevitable realization that what I had discovered on West 23rd Street fell a little short of paradise. The octopus à la plancha was tender enough, but needed more of a boost in flavor than it got from chorizo and chickpeas. And while I loved the juicy hunk of swordfish, nothing else on the plate did. The quiet taste of the fish had to keep fighting off incursions from pungent eggplant caviar, fat and briny olives and spicy harissa. Travel long enough and sooner or later you turn the wrong corner, trust the wrong stranger. One night it happened to me at La Promenade. The veal medallions, which on an earlier trip had made a strong case for bringing this meat back into fashion, were now lukewarm and floppy. The shaved brussels sprouts and cauliflower purée on the same plate, formerly a hearty and filling mash, were wet and gloppy, like a slaw that sits too long before a picnic. Salt brought an unwelcome sharpness to several plates, including a risotto cake with the scallops; tiny, flower-shaped ratatouille ravioli; and Provençale fish soup, which our server had excitedly billed as one of the chef’s signature dishes. Even the chrome and the Deco curves looked less like a stylish terrace overlooking the beachside avenue in Nice that gave its name to this restaurant, and more like a disco that hasn’t been updated since Bianca Jagger’s last turn on the dance floor. By this point I wondered whether I’d been in the grip of the same kind of hypnosis familiar to vacationers who’ve discovered that a piece of folk art that seems like a masterpiece in the flea market by the port is not quite as masterly on the wall of a Manhattan apartment. A final meal proved that the charms of La Promenade des Anglais are real and abiding. Yes, there are dull spots on the menu. (None are duller than the panisse, sticks of chickpea flour that are as tasty as a mouthful of cotton gauze.) And some dishes that can sparkle don’t always. Then I think back to how adroitly Mr. Allegretti corrected course between his last restaurant and this one. He wasn’t particularly quick to react, but he made up for it in thoroughness. I’ll bet he’ll take the same approach with the handful of things that are awry at La Promenade.",La Promenade des Anglais in Chelsea - Review,"['money', 'kept', 'aloft', 'went', 'away', 'year',

302,La Silhouette,★,2012-05-08,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/dining/reviews/a-review-of-la-silhouette-in-hells-kitchen.html,Clinton,"IF you want to start a fight on the subway, one proven technique is to smile at somebody and say, “Excuse me.” Asking the gentlemen in front of you at the stadium to kindly stay in their seats so you can see the next pitch does not always lead to bonding over what a swell season the Yankees are having. Politeness, in other words, is not always rewarded in New York. This may be one reason La Silhouette, which opened a little more than a year ago in Hell’s Kitchen, is still relatively unknown outside its neighborhood. Almost none of the people I took to La Silhouette had heard of it. By the end of the meal we would all be asking ourselves how a restaurant that works this hard at pleasing customers can be lost in the shuffle while the city showers attention on less comfortable places that are more skilled at boasting and preening. That La Silhouette is on the extremely short list of good French restaurants in walking distance of the Broadway theaters makes its low profile that much more unfortunate. Anybody on their way to watch “Death of a Salesman” at the Ethel Barrymore, for instance, certainly deserves a taste of La Silhouette’s foie gras à la Botero beforehand. The fattened liver, scored and well seared outside but meltingly pink within, is served with ripe plantains and roasted pineapple, the tropical sweetness of the fruit brought back into line by a bracing dab of coffee gel. It is close to an obligatory first course, although it has strong competition from another foie gras dish. This time the liver is the silky filling inside a rustic pâté of duck, pork and pistachios. It is a succinct reminder of why French charcuterie will be around long after we’ve all forgotten the name of Carla Bruni’s husband. La Silhouette’s chef, Matthew Tropeano, ought to know his way around a lobe of foie gras. He spent eight years in the kitchen at La Grenouille, mastering old-guard French dishes that fewer and fewer chefs in New York know how to pronounce. He was the chef there when Sam Sifton awarded the restaurant three stars in a review in The New York Times in 2009. Mr. Tropeano, who turns 33 on Sunday, is too young, however, to spend the rest of his life tending the eternal flame of the pike quenelle. Last year, he was lured to La Silhouette, where he must have more freedom to roam and to keep his menu in tune with the seasons. His technique and orientation are still recognizably French. He does well by the old school, like the coral-colored and lobster-rich sauce Americaine that comes with butter-poached bass and lobster. For admirers of the saucier’s art, tasting it is like hearing a forgotten favorite record on the radio. Every bit as classic, just as nicely handled, is ballotine stuffed with truffled forcemeat, the highlight of the roast chicken that La Silhouette has been serving lately. Yes, the skin on the breast could have been browned more thoroughly, but there’s no need to eat chicken skin when the plate also offers a foie gras sauce that is preposterously, appealingly rich. The chicken skin was symptomatic of a small but pervasive issue: even on very good dishes there was almost always one element that couldn’t keep pace or didn’t belong there in the first place. A generous serving of sweetbreads with a sauce of morels and pine nuts would have been complete on its own. Instead, a single raviolo stuffed with ricotta and nettles had been slipped under the sauce, which did no favors to the sweetbreads or to the raviolo. Next to a suave partnership of lamb chop and shredded braised shank, garlicky stems of broccoli rabe cooked al dente seemed intended for another dish, or perhaps another restaurant. And there was the duck sauce. Yes, it was a sauce that came with duck breast, but it was also reminiscent of the Chinese-takeout condiment. It wasn’t nearly as sweet, being made from rhubarb, but it was just as shiny and as insistently orange. The dish was saved by short, crisp lengths of rhubarb under bits of preserved ginger, a cheerful wink at spring, and by the duck itself. Here and elsewhere, the kitchen’s command of protein cookery tended to overcome any fumbles in the garnishes. And if for some reason that doesn’t do the trick, there is dessert. Jeffrey Sytsma, the pastry chef, seems to have a deep affection for all-American sweets, and he shows it by transforming them into smart, well-built desserts. For his popcorn crème brûlée, Mr. Sytsma strolls along the carnival arcade, making a popcorn-infused custard and serving it with caramel popcorn and slices of candied apple. What he bills as a dark chocolate pot de crème is really that campfire standby, s’mores, dressed up in evening wear: graham-cracker ice cream and a block of hazelnut marshmallow sit beside a chocolate pudding that is encased in a white chocolate shell, making it look a little bit like a marshmallow itself. One of the wonders of La Silhouette is that it manages all of this in a long, low, dark space that is about as inviting a spot for a restaurant as the Holland Tunnel. Handed this Rubik’s cube, the architect Richard Bloch attempted to inject some drama by creating a progression of small interiors. You check in beside the boxy little bar, pass through a small dining room, a slightly larger one, and a landing. Then you descend a few steps, and the restaurant suddenly opens up into a bright main dining room with bold red stripes on one wall and, at last, some windows. If this is your destination, you feel a genuine sense of arrival. Seated in one of the antechambers, you may feel like a traveler whose train has stalled somewhere on the outskirts of town. But outskirts don’t always stay outskirts forever. Not long ago, this stretch of Hell’s Kitchen was nobody’s idea of a dining mecca. Now lights pour from the glass faces of restaurants up and down Ninth Avenue. A block away from La Silhouette, Danji has built a citywide following for its bulgogi sliders. Foie gras and premillennial service are a less fashionable proposition, of course, but La Silhouette is trying very hard to beat the odds. New Yorkers may not always react well to good manners, but they do respond to ambition.",A Review of La Silhouette in Hell’s Kitchen,"['start', 'fight', 'subway', 'proven', 'technique', 'smile',

303,La Chine,★★,2016-01-19,Pete Wells,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/dining/la-chine-review.html,Midtown East,"In a nest of dried grass and feathery moss sat an eggshell, its top neatly lopped off. Caviar and a crinkle of gold leaf shone just inside the rim. Underneath were layers of custard and hairy crab, a seasonal freshwater treat from China whose taste is a lot more seductive than its name. The rich, smooth pleasure in each spoonful almost made my head pop. The egg was one of the first things I ate at La Chine, which opened in November inside the Waldorf Astoria, specializing in Chinese food made with finesse and an eye for beauty. This could get interesting, I thought. In fact, the rest of the meal and the two that followed did get interesting, in ways that those of us who love the cuisines of China wish would happen more often in New York. Downtown Manhattan, Flushing in Queens and Sunset Park in Brooklyn are rich in Chinese restaurants. Their cooking can range from filling to thrilling, but it rarely aspires to climb the slopes of creativity. Ingredients are generally good but not stellar, limited as they are by the prices these restaurants can charge. Unlike many cities in Asia, New York has not historically had a broad base of people willing to spend a lot on Chinese food. La Chine costs much more than most of them; lamb loin stir-fried with cumin is $38, about twice as much as the fervently admired Muslim lamb chop at Fu Run in Flushing. If you allow the man they call the “sake ninja” to talk you into a bottle, you could easily drop $100 or more. (This ninja wears a jacket and tie; he must be working undercover.) But at the risk of undermining my populist credentials, I’d suggest New York could use more Chinese restaurants that are as expensive as our most ambitious French and Italian places. Those restaurants could use more ingredients worth splurging on, and restaurateurs determined to lure talented chefs from China. We have Hakkasan, of course, part of a global chain whose crackerjack cooks excel at dim sum but tend to play it safe with other courses. At the two RedFarms, Joe Ng cooks with originality and verve, but the recurring sweetness in the dishes betrays a tailoring of his ideas for perceived American tastes. The cooking at La Chine is something different. The menu was devised by the executive chef, Kong Khai Meng. A native of Singapore, he became a protégé of the acclaimed chef Jereme Leung before setting up restaurants in hotels around Asia. With Mr. Leung, he worked out his ideas for La Chine, which he executes in the kitchen with David Garcelon, the hotel’s culinary director. The restaurant replaces Oscar’s American Brasserie, a glorified coffee shop whose loss did not leave a deep wound in the city’s psyche. The bones of the space have been exposed, the massive pillars and ceiling coffers showing off the hotel’s Art Deco monumentality, though not its Art Deco flourishes. Some tables are set in secluded alcoves at the east end, framed by spidery latticework that evokes carved Chinese screens. A central chandelier, like a huge upside-down wedding cake, shines on vases of orchids whose pinks howl in this room of muted creams and golds. The effect would be more stunning if the lighting weren’t so murky; it hovers in the eternal twilight of surgery recovery rooms where patients slip in and out of consciousness. Each time I was about to go under, though, something from the kitchen would bring me back. Raw seafood always did it. Sliced yellowtail was fanned out in a pinwheel over Sichuan chile oil. Translucent bands of fluke were darkened by black rice vinegar, China’s answer to balsamic, then touched with hot peony oil, which sizzled and whitened the lean fish as it landed. A long rectangle of bigeye tuna tartare seasoned with soy vinegar was strewn with flowers, herbs, pickled shallots and a stripe of caviar. All three dishes took a modern, Japanese approach to Chinese flavors. All three were very good. So was the stack of lightly battered Spanish mackerel delivered under a smoke-filled cloche, like the sturgeon at Eleven Madison Park; the smokiness of the fish was underscored by a smoked soy sauce, appealingly sweet and sticky. Broad-bean-fried prawns were juicy and tender-firm inside a crisp, golden coating that flaked into spicy crumbs I couldn’t help eating off the plate. Cauliflower was stir-fried with thick bacon slices in a very hot wok that caramelized the bumpy surface to a delicious mottled brown. The snow pea shoots with garlic were as simple, classic and good as any I’ve tasted. Everything is served family style except the soups, which ought to be. In individual bowls, they are hard to work into a shared meal, and people may be tempted to skip them. This would be a loss, because they are beautifully made; there’s a clarity to the chicken cloud consommé, vividly seasoned with ginger, and a shellfish-drenched power to the “eight hour golden broth,” thick with lobster, crab and scallops. Before opening, restaurants now routinely put out photographs of one striking dish, like a band releasing a single to build excitement for an album. For La Chine, this was the barbecued duck. And it is an exciting bird, suffused with five-spice powder and ready to be tucked into griddle-blackened crepes with skinny sticks of cucumber, leek and, surprise, cantaloupe. But if anybody had asked, I would have suggested leading with the black-iron tabletop grill that holds a wonderful barbecued collar of Berkshire pork, the meat’s pink edges crackling with a candied honey glaze. (The menu reveals that the honey was secreted by bees who live on the roof, if that appeals to you.) Chicken with cashews may not make a great advertisement for a high-end restaurant, but it’s a great dish, in a kung-pao-style sauce that is keenly balanced between sweet and sour. In fact, most of the main courses show off La Chine’s sophistication apart from some subdued seafood dishes. Sous-vide cod with black bean sauce was flabby and, like the scallops in a long canoe-shaped dish with peppers and onions, not a showpiece of sparkling freshness. The restaurant’s French name is puzzling until the desserts show up; they are very much in a Western mode. The warm chocolate cake, with sesame ganache melting away inside, has a seductive undertow of spice. The most elaborate and prettiest is the vacherin of passion-fruit cream sandwiched by white spirals of meringue; there’s a white chocolate sphere painted with a metallic swirl like a pink pearl, and a marvelous scoop of sorbet made with fresh lychees. La Chine is far from the realm of fortune cookies, and better off for it.",Imagination Worth the Added Price at Midtown’s La Chine,"['nest', 'dried', 'grass', 'feathery', 'moss', 'sat', 'eggshell',
